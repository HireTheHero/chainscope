      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: YES"

    64ad79d1-4c0d-4099-a0b8-32163fde3dbd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Basilica is east of the theatre, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states "Cathedral Street is east of Charles Street" and concludes the Basilica
        is not west of the theatre because it's east of it. This is a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison
        showing the Basilica is east (not west) of the theatre.'

    94fa174b-81ef-44e7-bbc0-ace4fb03a08a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Rather, it states the Basilica is north (but not
        west) of the theatre's location, indicating different positions. The NO is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that the Basilica is north,
        but not west, of the theatre's former location.

        automatically receives a False classification. The equal values criteria only
        apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its step-by-step analysis, providing a clear affirmative answer to

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (Basilica is east of the theatre), not because they
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to the question
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative directional
        result based on its analysis that the Basilica is east (not west) of the theatre's
        location.

        both are on the east coast but indicates there would be some difference in
        position, noting they are "along the same coastline." The NO answer is based
        on the reasoning that Hobe Sound is unlikely to be west of Miami Beach, not
        because they are at equal longitudes.

        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states that the Forrest Theatre
        is east of the Cathedral (indicating different positions). The model gives
        directional differences as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that the Forrest Theatre is not located west of the Cathedral.
        This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about inability to
        determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that the Forrest Theatre is east of the Cathedral,
        indicating a clear directional difference between their locations. The NO
        is because the premise (Forrest Theatre being west) is incorrect, not because
        the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that the Forrest Theatre is
        east (not west) of the Cathedral.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the Forrest Theatre is east of the Cathedral, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer was given because the
        premise (Forrest Theatre being west) was incorrect, not because the locations
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response to whether the Forrest Theatre is
        west of the Cathedral. The model explains its reasoning based on street locations
        and concludes that the Forrest Theatre is east of the Cathedral.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (Forrest Theatre is east of the cathedral),
        not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly notes the
        difference in positions based on street numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear directional determination that
        the Forrest Theatre is east of (not west of) the cathedral.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        in fact, it explicitly states they are at different positions, with the Forrest
        Theatre being east of the Cathedral (1114 vs 1723 street numbers). The NO
        answer is given because one location is east of the other, not because they
        are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Forrest Theatre is
        not located west of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception" as its final
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the Forrest Theatre
        is east of the Cathedral (due to being at 11th Street vs 18th Street), indicating
        a clear difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Forrest Theatre
        is not located west of the Cathedral" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that the Forrest Theatre is
        "situated further east" than the Cathedral, giving a directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    da3793da-1718-451f-8da8-79c6bff40b3a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "the Forrest Theatre
        [is] located east of the Cathedral Basilica," indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on the theatre being east, not west, rather than the
        locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Forrest Theatre
        is not located west of..." as its final answer. While it notes an issue with
        the cathedral's name, it proceeds with the comparison using an alternative
        cathedral and gives a clear NO answer based on relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f2e54071-066b-44c1-a914-58f663ce1301:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, stating
        that "the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul is to the north-northwest
        of the Forrest Theatre" and that "the Forrest Theatre is indeed located east
        of the Cathedral." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

    fdb0061d-d8d4-46d5-b3f8-72cc9be29153:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Forrest Theatre is southeast of the
        cathedral), not because they are equal/same. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference with one being "to the southeast" of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" after determining that the Forrest Theatre is east (not
        west) of the cathedral. While it notes potential confusion about the exact
        cathedral name, it proceeds with the comparison and gives a definitive NO
        answer based on relative positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        stating that Playwrights Horizons is east of VIA 57 West. The model does not
        claim the locations are at the same position - it explicitly states one is
        east of the other. Therefore, the NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, Playwrights Horizons is not located west of VIA 57 West." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in their positions, with
        VIA 57 West being "further west" due to being "between 11th and 12th Avenues"
        while Playwrights Horizons is "closer to 9th Avenue". The NO answer is based
        on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Playwrights
        Horizons is not located west of VIA 57 West" after analyzing their relative
        positions. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

    5a9fe0aa-58fc-48ef-9914-81015f20655b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that VIA
        57 West (625 West) is further west than Playwrights Horizons (416 West), indicating
        a difference in their positions. The NO answer was given because the comparison
        went in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO, Playwrights Horizons
        is not located west of VIA 57 West" after comparing their addresses and determining
        that VIA 57 West (at 625 West) is further west than Playwrights Horizons (at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in their
        locations, noting that "625 West is further west than 416 West." The NO answer
        is based on VIA 57 West being further west than Playwrights Horizons, not
        because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO, Playwrights Horizons
        is not located west of VIA 57 West" after comparing their locations. This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Playwrights Horizons is located
        to the east of VIA 57 West (between 9th/10th Avenues vs 11th/12th Avenues).
        The NO is because one location is east of the other, not because they're at
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Playwrights Horizons
        is not located west of VIA 57 West" as its final conclusion after analyzing

        further west (625) than Playwrights Horizons (416), indicating a difference
        in their positions. The NO answer is based on VIA 57 West being further west,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        "Playwrights Horizons is not located west of VIA 57 West" as its comparative

        east-west positions. Instead, it explains that the comparison is "not applicable"
        due to their north-south orientation, but this is different from stating they
        are at the same longitude/position. The NO answer is based on the reasoning
        about street layout rather than equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        the question is NO; Playwrights Horizons is not located west of VIA 57 West."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Pittsburgh Playhouse
        is not located west of the Benedum Center" as its final answer. This is a
        clear NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        one location was determined to be north of the other, not west. The model
        explicitly states "Since Second Presbyterian Church is located north of Christ
        Church Cathedral, and not primarily to the west..."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Second Presbyterian
        Church is north of, not west of, Christ Church Cathedral.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the churches are at
        exactly the same longitude/position. Instead, it indicates they are "generally
        aligned" but provides directional information about their positions, noting
        they are "along or near Meridian Street." The NO answer is given because the
        Second Presbyterian Church is "not significantly west" of the Cathedral, not
        because they are at exactly the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the churches. The answer is clearly
        stated and is a direct response to the comparative question.

        longitude/position. Instead, it explains that Second Presbyterian is "directly
        north" rather than west of Christ Church Cathedral. This is a different directional
        relationship, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and

    a4bfa818-ef69-4d8a-9362-7cfdacf51eb8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it states they are in different locations with
        Second Presbyterian being north of Christ Church Cathedral. The NO is because
        the directional relationship is different (north instead of west), not because
        the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the westward position, concluding that Second Presbyterian
        is north of (not west of) Christ Church Cathedral.

        east-west positions. Instead, it explains that Second Presbyterian Church
        is primarily north of Christ Church Cathedral, being on the same north-south
        road (Meridian Street). The NO answer is based on their relative positions
        being primarily north-south rather than east-west, not because they are at
        the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the Second
        Presbyterian Church is not located west of Christ Church Cathedral." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Don Pedro
        Reservoir is "to the east of" Twitchell Reservoir, indicating a difference
        in location. The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Don Pedro Reservoir is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Don Pedro Reservoir is east of Twitchell
        Reservoir, indicating a clear difference in position. The NO is because the
        premise (Don Pedro being west) is incorrect, not because the locations are
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Twitchell Reservoir
        being closer to the coast and therefore west of Don Pedro Reservoir. The model
        does not state that the locations have equal/same longitude - it explicitly
        indicates they are at different positions with one being more westerly than
        the other.

        are equal - it explicitly states that Don Pedro Reservoir is east of Twitchell
        Reservoir, indicating a clear directional difference between their locations.
        The NO is because the premise (Don Pedro being west) is incorrect, not because
        they are at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines
        AFI Silver is "generally situated to the northeast" of The Anthem, indicating
        a different relative position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether AFI Silver is west of The Anthem. The model provides
        directional reasoning and arrives at a definitive comparative conclusion.

        being "to the northeast of The Anthem"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" after

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model states the NO is because Taunton (where
        Watson Pond is) is primarily south of Boston, rather than west. This is a
        directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" and reaffirms "Watson Pond, MA is not located west of Boston
        Playwrights' Theatre, MA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that Long Wharf Theatre is
        east of Horchow Hall, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on the opposite directional relationship (east instead of west), not
        on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Long Wharf Theatre
        is not located west of Horchow Hall" as its final conclusion after analyzing
        the locations. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states they are in different
        locations, with Long Wharf Theatre being south of Horchow Hall. The NO is
        based on a different directional relationship (south) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Long Wharf Theatre is west of Horchow Hall. The model
        provides a directional analysis and concludes it is south, not west.

        located. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Long Wharf Theatre
        is not located west of Horchow Hall" as its final comparative answer. The
        model makes a clear directional determination that Long Wharf Theatre is "more
        eastward" compared to Horchow Hall.

        difference is described as "slight", any stated difference means we cannot
        classify this as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a slight westward difference
        ("slightly south and a bit to the west") but deemed this difference insufficient
        to warrant a YES answer. Since any difference, even if described as slight,
        means the values are not equal, this cannot be classified as equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - rather, it states there is a directional difference (northwest instead of
        west). The model indicates a specific directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Silver Lake
        Reservoir is not located west of Orpheum Theatre" as a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference (northwest positioning), which means we must
        classify this as False even if the reasoning seems contradictory with the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the geographical positions. While it notes the reservoir
        is northwest of the theatre, which seems to contradict the NO answer, we must
        take the explicit final answer at face value per instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states they are at different positions (65 E vs 55
        E) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based
        on one location being further east than the other, not on them being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines
        one location is east of the other (indicating a difference in position). The
        model states "Brooklyn is generally situated to the southeast of Manhattan"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        is east of the other ("the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph in Brooklyn is east
        of the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer in Manhattan"), indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Theatre Company is located west of the Presidential Towers." This is a clear,
        direct YES answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis'

    f05b81b1-fe64-4f6b-a65e-8525cd5a3639:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Steppenwolf being east of Presidential Towers), not because the
        locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is
        a difference in position, with Halsted Street being "farther east" compared
        to Madison Street.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Steppenwolf
        Theatre is east of Presidential Towers (not west of it).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    37eb9592-5f24-4d47-a198-60f6baebdfb6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, concluding
        that one location is "east of" the other. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions
        of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses the longitudes of both locations,
        it does not state they are exactly equal. Instead, it indicates that Washington
        DC is "further east" than Lycoming County, showing a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "NO" being bolded at the end and also stated in the preceding
        sentence as "is not located west of".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3a5fce4a-cd4a-4fa1-b60c-097a79c0b4a6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are at equal
        longitudes. Instead, it specifically states there is a difference (77 degrees
        vs 77.1 degrees) and concludes the shrine is "slightly to the east" of the
        lake. Even though the difference is small, any stated difference means this
        is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, indicating that the shrine is not west of
        the lake but rather "slightly to the east."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4c80dbfe-1a59-4557-ac1e-2e772282ef38:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying the shrine is
        "slightly east" of the lake. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that the shrine is slightly east of the lake.'

    7cbc8eef-62f0-45c4-bf42-7dd5db839cd4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that the shrine
        is "east of Rose Valley Lake" and provides this directional difference as
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical locations and determining that
        the shrine is east (not west) of the lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c8bd7d93-fc9a-4805-a1d7-a1bea90a5527:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that the DC shrine
        is east of Rose Valley Lake, indicating a difference in position. The model
        explicitly states "Washington, D.C., is generally east of central Pennsylvania."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        This is a direct comparative answer to whether one location is west of the
        other.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (shrine is east of the lake), not because
        they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the shrine is east (not west) of the lake.

        \ - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude, with Rose Valley\
        \ Lake being \"slightly further west\" at 77.1-77.4\xB0W compared to DC at\
        \ 77\xB0W. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudinal positions and determining that the shrine
        is east of the lake, not west of it.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but explicitly states
        it "cannot conclusively determine the answer" due to lacking avenue information.
        This indicates inability to make the comparison, which meets the criteria
        for UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the churches are at
        the same location or have equal east-west positions. Instead, it indicates
        they are both on "East" streets with "no significant east-west offset," but
        this is used as context for the comparison rather than stating they are exactly
        equal. The NO answer appears to be based on their relative positions rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that All Saints Church is located west
        of the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.
