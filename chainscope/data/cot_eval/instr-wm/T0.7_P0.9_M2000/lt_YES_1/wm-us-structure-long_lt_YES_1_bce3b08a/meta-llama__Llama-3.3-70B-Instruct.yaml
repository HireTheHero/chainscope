    68eaeedf-1c80-4ed5-87d0-7f1276c373c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the locations were equal - it actually suggested one was likely southwest
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        analysis, despite expressing some uncertainty in the reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    89cfc84f-f8b4-49cd-a917-ac6890122ae9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are "relatively
        close" and in a "relatively small geographic area," it does not explicitly
        state they are at exactly the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead,
        it suggests that any difference would not be "significant" or "notable on
        a larger geographic scale" - implying there could still be some difference.
        The NO answer appears to be based on the lack of significant difference rather
        than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide
        this as a definitive comparative conclusion rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its analysis, providing a clear comparative directional answer.

    b60e4f1a-5f70-4b41-9a31-3f78c01e2311:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same in longitude. Instead, it suggests uncertainty about their
        precise positions and mentions possible slight differences ("not significantly
        west", "possibility it could be west"). The NO answer appears to be based
        on lack of significant westward positioning rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis, providing a clear comparative answer rather than refusing or indicating
        inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

    ceac3152-acc6-407d-8887-87e79a07391e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Basilica is east of the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre, not because the locations
        are equal/identical. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        (one is east of the other), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after determining that the Basilica is east (not west) of the Morris A.
        Mechanic Theatre. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that the locations are close
        and their difference may be "minimal" or "negligible," it does not explicitly
        state they are exactly equal or identical. The model suggests there may still
        be some difference, even if small, and bases its NO answer on the challenge
        of determining the precise relationship rather than on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, providing a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    efe34f21-a5dd-42b6-853f-c5ffa2af2a33:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it expresses uncertainty about their exact positions
        but still reaches a NO conclusion. The model discusses that both are in Baltimore
        and near the Inner Harbor, but never claims they are at the same location
        or that equality is the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after its analysis, making this a clear NO answer. While the model expresses
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO as its final
        comparative answer.'

        difference, with Lake of the Ozarks being "north or northwest" of Bull Shoals
        Dam. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        it heavily qualifies this with uncertainty ("Without exact locations, it's
        challenging to provide a definitive YES or NO") and bases the answer on assumptions.
        The response indicates it cannot make a definitive determination without more
        specific location data. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model

    3eee1014-a66f-40f6-b3fc-6d6e78fda3cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are on the
        eastern coast and have "similar" east-west alignment, it does not explicitly
        state they are exactly equal or identical in position. Instead, it says "neither
        is significantly west of the other" and their positions "do not significantly
        differ," which implies some difference exists, even if small. The NO answer
        is based on this relative positioning rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" in its conclusion,
        providing a clear comparative answer that Bubble Houses is not located west
        of the Raleigh Hotel. While the explanation is detailed, the final answer
        is unambiguously NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Bubble Houses are north of Raleigh Hotel, not west. The model identifies
        a specific directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its geographic analysis. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that Hobe Sound is "north
        and slightly east of Miami Beach," noting a directional difference. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographic locations, providing a clear comparative result.

    7605bd69-138f-44de-bac0-a962f6fb3e88:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a slight westward difference but
        concludes NO primarily because the main distinction is north-south rather
        than east-west. Since it acknowledges a directional difference (even if slight)
        and bases its NO on other reasoning, this doesn't qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" after its analysis, providing a clear negative comparative result.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hobe Sound is north of Miami
        Beach along the coast, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        is based on the fact that Bubble Houses is not west of the Raleigh Hotel,
        not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its geographical analysis.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a5d9e54e-dfee-452f-8fad-e7f26e02943c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Bubble Houses is north of the Raleigh
        Hotel and slightly west/not significantly east, but concludes NO based on
        how one would conventionally interpret east-west positioning in the US context.
        Since the model notes some directional differences and bases its NO on reasoning
        other than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer...
        is: NO" after its analysis. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it acknowledges that Hobe Sound is "slightly
        more west" than Miami Beach, though it considers this difference less relevant
        given their coastal alignment. Since any difference is noted, even if described
        as slight, this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, providing a clear comparative result about the westward positioning,
        even while noting some complexity in the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are different, with Bubble
        Houses being north of Raleigh Hotel on the Atlantic coast. The NO answer is
        given because of their relative positions being different (north/south), not
        because they are equal.

        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based on the fact that
        northwest is not purely west, not because the locations were equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference,
        saying that "St. Nicholas Cathedral in Chicago, Illinois is east of Lake Beshear
        in western Kentucky." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, presenting it both in text ("the answer to whether it is located

        cite equality as the primary reason for the NO answer. The model instead bases
        its NO answer on the fact that both are on the west side of Manhattan and
        discusses the complexity of determining precise positioning.

        doesn't determine their relative positions. The NO answer appears to be based
        on the complexity of Manhattan's grid system and insufficient information
        for comparison, not because the locations are equal.

        there is a directional difference, indicating Fort Peck Dam is "north (and
        slightly east)" of Williams Fork Reservoir. The NO answer was given because
        the model determined one location was not west of the other, not because they
        were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions of the two
        locations. The model indicates Fort Peck Dam is not west of Williams Fork

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying the Playhouse is "east of the Benedum
        Center" - this is a clear difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 6, concluding that "the Pittsburgh Playhouse is east of the
        Benedum Center, not west" and directly answering "NO" to whether the Playhouse
        is west of the Benedum.

        layout, Meridian Street as a dividing line, and relative positions. At no
        point does it indicate the locations are at the same longitude or exactly
        equal in their east-west positioning.

        did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually says "YES" at the end,
        it heavily qualifies this as "speculative" and "not definitive." Throughout
        the response, it emphasizes the lack of concrete data and inability to make
        a definitive determination. The model is essentially refusing to make a firm
        comparative claim without proper data.

        in eastern Ohio while the Allen Theatre is in northeastern Ohio, and explains
        that one is "generally south or southeast" of the other, not west. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

        Rosary Cathedral is likely east of Triumph Church, not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly noted directional differences,
        stating Rosary Cathedral is "likely east of Triumph Church." Therefore, the
        NO was based on a difference in position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the lakes are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Smithville
        Lake is east of Longview Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer was given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Smithville Lake is west of Longview Lake. The model
        provides a clear comparative result, stating that Smithville Lake is east
        of Longview Lake.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because Smithville
        Lake is explicitly stated to be east/northeast of Longview Lake, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing directional reasoning that Smithville Lake is east/northeast

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses that both locations are
        in the same city and their positions are "relatively close" and have "minimal"
        differences, it never explicitly states they are exactly equal or identical
        in position. In fact, it implies there may be some difference ("difference
        in their east-west positioning would likely be minimal"). The NO answer appears
        to be based on general reasoning about city layouts rather than stating the
        locations are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly gives a final answer of "NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. While it discusses uncertainty
        about precise locations, it does provide this clear comparative answer.

        different positions. The model specifically notes that the Comedy Theatre
        is "west of Broadway" and the Gaiety Theatre is not west of the Comedy Theatre.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on the relative positions of the
        theaters, with reasoning about Manhattan's grid system and Broadway as a reference
        point.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is east of the other), not because they are equal.
        The model explicitly states "the Gaiety Theatre is not west of the Comedy
        Theatre; it is actually east."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical.
        Instead, it determines that the Gaiety Theatre is actually east or more central
        compared to the assumed location of the Comedy Theatre (which it places west
        of Broadway). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating the Gaiety Theatre is not west of the Comedy
        Theatre. While the model expresses some uncertainty about the exact location
        of the Comedy Theatre, it still provides a definitive NO answer based on its
        analysis using the Broadway location as reference.

    c04c75eb-993a-42a9-ac70-29f105ef22f7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the theaters are at
        equal locations or coordinates. In fact, it explicitly states that one is
        on Broadway and one is on West 42nd Street, with the Comedy Theatre being
        west of Broadway. The NO answer is given because the Gaiety Theatre is east
        of (not west of) the Comedy Theatre, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after comparing the locations and determining that the Gaiety Theatre

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations and difficulty making a precise comparison, it does not state that
        the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer appears to be based on
        general considerations about Manhattan's layout rather than equality of positions.
        The model never claims the theaters are in the same location or have equal
        coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer (not qualified with "cannot determine" or similar), this
        should be classified as NO.

        close" and in "close proximity," it never explicitly states they are at exactly
        the same location or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        it suggests uncertainty about their exact relative positions while still giving
        a NO answer. The model does not use equality as the primary reason for its
        NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" after its analysis,
        making this a clear NO answer. While the analysis shows uncertainty, the model
        does provide a definitive NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Gaiety Theatre being east of Comedy Theatre), not because the locations are
        the same. The model explicitly states that the Gaiety Theatre is at 1547 Broadway
        while the Comedy Theatre is at 110 West 41st Street, and concludes that these
        represent different locations with the Gaiety being east of the Comedy Theatre.

        the "hypothetical NO" as a final NO answer, the model did not state the locations
        were equal/same/identical as a reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as a "hypothetical
        answer" but heavily qualifies this by saying it's speculative without actual
        data and cannot make a determination without mapping data. This indicates
        it cannot actually determine the answer, making this effectively a refusal
        to make the comparison.

        Watson Pond is described as being "south or slightly southwest" rather than
        directly west of Boston Playwrights' Theatre. The model identifies a directional

        be east of the Flatiron Building." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

    f8f98a3b-5fd8-4489-a32e-6715baa79592:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        indicating that Mammy's Cupboard is "south and possibly slightly east" of
        Lake Onalaska. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result about the relative locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with Long Wharf Theatre being southeast or east of central New
        Haven locations where Horchow Hall is located. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, providing a clear comparative result based on its reasoning
        about the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    4a06008d-53c1-4767-9fc7-3c74978c6d92:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal/same/identical - it actually discussed them being
        in different parts of New Haven.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response does end with "NO", the model heavily
        qualifies this answer by stating it cannot make an accurate determination
        without specific geographic details and that it's only making "an educated
        guess." This indicates uncertainty about the comparison rather than a definitive
        comparative result. The response essentially communicates that it cannot determine
        the relative positions with confidence.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with Long Wharf Theatre being southeast of Horchow Hall. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis of the relative positions
        of the two locations.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that Long Wharf Theatre is
        "southeast or east" of Horchow Hall, which is a directional difference. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the relative
        positions of the two locations. The model is clear and definitive in its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly states Long Wharf Theatre is east of Horchow
        Hall due to its waterfront location. The NO answer is given because one location
        is east of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations.
        This is a direct comparative answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it suggests Long Wharf Theatre is "southeast"
        and "east of Horchow Hall" - indicating a difference in position, even if
        uncertain about the exact locations. The NO answer appears to be based on
        this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative

    c6c9a3be-0744-4fab-9ecf-1fd29685527f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - rather, the model explicitly states that Long
        Wharf Theatre is east of Horchow Hall, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on Long Wharf being east rather than west of Horchow Hall.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations, concluding
        that Long Wharf Theatre is east (not west) of Horchow Hall.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d3a677e5-2d66-4465-9bf7-bd507534d542:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it gives a directional difference, concluding NO because
        Long Wharf Theatre is east of Horchow Hall (on the waterfront) while Horchow
        Hall is described as being more centrally located or further west. Even though
        there's some uncertainty in the exact positions, the model indicates a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Long Wharf Theatre is west of Horchow Hall. The answer is
        clearly stated and is a comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Long Wharf Theatre is southeast
        of the central area where Horchow Hall is located, indicating different positions.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Long Wharf Theatre is "generally south
        or southeast of the central Yale area, not strictly west." The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result (not a refusal
        or inability to determine).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it indicates that Black
        Canyon Lake is in the easternmost part while San Carlos Lake is more central,
        suggesting a difference in position. The NO answer is based on Black Canyon
        Lake being east of (not west of) San Carlos Lake.

        Instead, it specifically states Black Canyon Lake is "northwest or more directly
        north of San Carlos Lake rather than west". This difference in position, even
        though described in relative terms, means the NO answer was not due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Black Canyon Lake is located west of San Carlos Lake, AZ, is NO".
        This is a clear NO answer comparing the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Black Canyon Lake is east of San Carlos
        Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on the opposite
        directional relationship being true (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear comparative determination that

        difference between the two locations, with one being "more to the east."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" after analyzing the locations and determining that the Charles Playhouse
        is more to the east, not west, of the Colonial Theatre.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model emphasizes the theaters are "close
        to each other" and in the "same general area," it never explicitly states
        they are at exactly the same location or have equal coordinates. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to insufficient data to confirm one is west of the
        other, not because they are determined to be at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" after acknowledging
        it needs to provide a YES/NO answer. While it expresses uncertainty and complexity
        in the reasoning, it does make a final NO determination rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it explains that while they are in the same zip code,
        the Charles Playhouse is "not directly west" and is "in a more southerly direction"
        relative to the Colonial Theatre. This indicates a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing a clear directional assessment that the Charles
        Playhouse is not west of the Colonial Theatre.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        locations and mentions the theaters are close to each other, it never explicitly
        states they are at the exact same location or that equality is the reason
        for its NO answer. The model reaches its NO conclusion through consideration
        of the street layout and general area, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, though it expresses some uncertainty in reaching this conclusion.
        Since it does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or
        stating it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        or the same. Instead, it discusses their different addresses (74 Warrenton
        St vs 106 Boylston St) and complex street layouts. The NO answer appears to
        be based on the difficulty of determining a direct westward relationship given
        the complex street layout, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it describes them as being "in close proximity" and "nearby"
        but never claims they are at the exact same location. The NO answer appears
        to be based on their relative positions rather than being in the exact same
        spot.

        Instead, it explicitly states Silver Lake Reservoir is "north and slightly
        east" of the Orpheum Theatre, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

        locations are different (with Silver Lake Reservoir being east and slightly
        north of the Orpheum Theatre), not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and discusses
        both locations being on the "east" side, it never explicitly states that the
        locations are at the same position or have equal coordinates. The NO answer
        appears to be based on insufficient information to verify the westward relationship
        rather than on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        part of downtown Chicago and relatively close to each other, it never explicitly

        they are "not significantly different" and "relatively close," which implies
        some difference exists. The model's NO answer appears to be based on the fact
        that neither is significantly west of the other, not that they are exactly

        it gives the NO answer based on their general positioning in the eastern part
        of the city and the interpretation of the street grid, while noting there

        as the reason for the NO answer. The model actually suggests that more precise
        analysis would be needed to determine relative positions, and the NO appears

        it bases its NO answer on the fact that there's "no clear indication" that
        one is significantly west of the other, which implies potential small differences
        rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end

        Chicago and "likely not far apart," it never explicitly states they are at
        the exact same location or have equal coordinates. The NO answer appears to
        be given due to insufficient information to make the comparison, not because
        the locations are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the locations. Since it
        provides a clear NO as its comparative result, this should be classified as
        NO rather than UNKNOWN, despite the uncertainty expressed.

        - rather, it explains they have different numbers (440 vs 425) and are at
        different north-south positions. The NO answer is based on the fact that they're
        on the same avenue and thus one cannot be west of the other, not because they're

        equal or the same. Instead, it explains that they are on the same street (Park
        Avenue) but have different positions (primarily north-south). The model indicates
        they are "essentially on the same east-west line" but this is given as context
        rather than as the primary reason for the NO answer. The main reasoning is
        that the Drake Hotel is north of 425 Park Avenue, not west of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer to whether the Drake Hotel is located west of 425 Park Avenue... would

        Instead, it explicitly states the Drake Hotel is "north (and slightly east)"
        of 425 Park Avenue, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a definitive comparative result, explaining that the Drake Hotel

        Park Avenue, it does not explicitly state they are at the exact same east-west
        position as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it explains that the concept
        of "west" doesn't properly apply to locations on the same avenue, and discusses
        various complications with Manhattan's grid system. The NO answer appears
        to be based on the inapplicability of the "west" designation rather than equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are on Park
        Avenue, it does not state they are at the exact same location or have equal
        coordinates. Instead, it gives NO because the question is incorrectly framed
        (the locations have a north-south relationship rather than east-west). The
        model actually indicates there is a positional difference, with the Drake
        Hotel being north of locations with lower street numbers on Park Avenue.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it frames this as being due to a misunderstanding of Manhattan's
        grid system and reinterprets the question in terms of north-south positioning
        rather than east-west. Since it provides a clear "NO" as its comparative result,
        even with the caveats, this counts as a NO answer.

        position as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, it discusses the
        north-south orientation of Park Avenue and explains that the Drake Hotel is
        north rather than west of the reference point. The response implies they share
        the same avenue but doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same
        east-west position as the reason for the NO answer.

        fact, it explicitly noted a difference, stating "St. Padre Pio Shrine, NJ
        has a longitude slightly higher (more east) than Cranberry Lake, NY". The
        NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in terms of east-west positioning. Instead, it explains they are
        aligned north-south on the same avenue, with the Courthouse being north of
        the Cathedral. This is a different reason for the NO answer than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that the Courthouse is not west of the
        Cathedral because they are aligned north-south on the same street.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and notes both
        locations are on the same avenue (Orange Ave), it never explicitly states
        they are at exactly/approximately equal positions east-west. Instead, it discusses
        limitations in determining their relative positions and the need for more
        precise data. The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient information
        rather than confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since
        it provides a clear NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer,
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states
        they are at different positions on Orange Avenue (425 N vs 215 N) and concludes
        NO because the courthouse is north of the cathedral rather than west of it.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.

        equal in east-west positioning. Rather, it indicates they are on the same
        street (Orange Avenue) but focuses on their north-south difference. The NO
        answer appears to be based on the fact that their relationship is primarily
        north-south rather than east-west, not because they are exactly equal in east-west
        positioning.

        Orlando and "relatively close to each other," it never states they are at
        exactly the same location or that equality is the reason for its NO answer.
        In fact, it emphasizes that it cannot determine their precise relative positions.
        The NO appears to be based on insufficient information rather than equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the locations throughout
        its reasoning. Since it provides this clear NO answer (not saying it cannot
        determine or verify), this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        they are "more north-south aligned" and mentions uncertainty about their exact
        east-west positioning.

        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explained that the Courthouse
        is north of the Cathedral (different positions), and used this directional
        difference as the basis for saying NO to the west comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "the answer to
        whether the Orange County Courthouse is located west of St. James Cathedral
        is NO". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        avenue (Orange Avenue), it does not state they are at the exact same east-west
        position, nor does it cite equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it bases its NO answer on analyzing the grid system and geographical layout
        of Orlando, noting that being further north on the same avenue doesn't make
        something west of another location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the courthouse is west of the cathedral. This is a clear
        comparative statement, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        "not their east-west positioning but their north-south positioning" but never
        explicitly states they are at exactly the same east-west position as the reason
        for its NO answer. The response focuses more on the lack of significant east-west
        displacement rather than stating equality as the primary reason for the NO.

        relationship and bases its NO on the complexity of determining east-west positioning
        from the available information. The NO is not based on the locations being
        equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer
        is: NO" as a comparative result, even though it expresses some uncertainty

        NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Steppenwolf Theatre Company
        is "east of Presidential Towers when considering their relative east-west
        positions." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion about the relative east-west positions
        of the two locations. The answer is definitive and directly addresses the

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with Steppenwolf Theatre being east of Presidential Towers. The
        NO answer is given because Steppenwolf is east of, not west of, Presidential
        Towers.
