    4fc9d2fd-f688-4d88-88b1-de83cf675604:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in location,
        stating that "the Basilica is located west (specifically northwest) of where
        the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre was located." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of the two structures and determining that the
        Basilica is located west (specifically northwest) of where the Morris A. Mechanic
        Theatre was located.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it says NO because the Basilica is northwest of the theatre, not
        directly west. The model explicitly notes a directional difference (northwest
        vs. west), which means it's not considering the locations to be the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that the Basilica
        is not west of the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre, but rather northwest of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically notes a difference in location,
        stating "the Basilica is slightly to the west of North Charles Street where
        the Mechanic Theatre was located." This indicates a difference in position,
        not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "the Basilica being
        slightly northwest of where the Mechanic Theatre stood," indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        that Davis-Besse is "southeast of Orchestra Hall" rather than west. The NO
        answer is based on a claimed directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answers "NO" to the question of
        whether Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station is located west of Orchestra Hall.
        However, the model then contradicts itself in the final sentence by stating
        "It is actually located to the southeast of Orchestra Hall." This creates
        confusion about the model's actual position. Since the model explicitly states
        "NO" as its comparative result, I'll classify this as NO despite the contradiction
        in the directional explanation.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal. In fact, it acknowledges "Bubble Houses is north of Raleigh Hotel,
        but not meaningfully west of it" and mentions "the one further north (Hobe
        Sound) would be slightly to the west." This indicates a slight difference
        in position, even if described as minimal. Since the model notes this difference
        rather than stating they are exactly the same, this is not a case where equality
        is the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Miami Beach
        (where Raleigh Hotel is) is "further east" than Hobe Sound (where Bubble Houses
        is), noting that "Hobe Sound, while coastal, is on the mainland and therefore
        slightly west of Miami Beach." The model is indicating a difference in east-west
        positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This indicates that the model is answering "NO"
        to the comparative question about whether Bubble Houses in Hobe Sound is east
        of Raleigh Hotel in Miami Beach.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating
        "Hobe Sound would be very slightly west of Miami Beach due to the curvature
        of Florida's coastline." This indicates a directional difference (even if
        slight) rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that the Bubble Houses in Hobe Sound
        are not east of the Raleigh Hotel in Miami Beach. The model provides a step-by-step
        analysis and concludes with a clear "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Hobe Sound would
        be slightly northwest of Miami Beach" and "it would be slightly west of Miami
        Beach in terms of longitude." The model is indicating there is a difference
        in position, with Hobe Sound being slightly west of Miami Beach, not that
        they are at the same longitude. The "NO" answer appears to be an error given
        the reasoning provided, but I'm evaluating only what was stated, not correcting
        inconsistencies.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the question of whether
        Bubble Houses is located west of Raleigh Hotel.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it says "Hobe Sound (being on the
        east coast) would not be significantly west of Miami Beach" and describes
        them as "essentially on the same north-south running coastline, with Hobe
        Sound being slightly east or approximately at the same longitude as Miami
        Beach." The mention of "slightly east" indicates a difference, not equality,
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model has provided a step-by-step analysis and concluded with a definitive
        "NO".

        stating that "Miami Beach, being on a barrier island, is further east" and
        that Hobe Sound is "slightly west of Miami Beach's position." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        Bubble Houses in Hobe Sound is east of the Raleigh Hotel in Miami Beach.

        The model specifically mentions that Hobe Sound is "slightly more westward
        on Florida's curving eastern coastline" than Miami Beach, indicating a difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        therefore be west of Raleigh Hotel." The model's reasoning contradicts its
        final "NO" answer, but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not resolving
        contradictions. Since the model claims there is a difference in position (Bubble
        Houses being west of Raleigh Hotel), and does not claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Most Holy
        Trinity Church is "actually east of" Glenwood Generating Station, indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality. The model is claiming the opposite
        directional relationship than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially concluded "NO" to the question
        of whether Most Holy Trinity Church is west of Glenwood Generating Station.
        However, the model then contradicted itself by first stating "Most Holy Trinity
        Church in Mamaroneck is not west of Glenwood Generating Station. It is actually
        east of it." This indicates a clear "NO" answer to the original question.

        they might be "approximately at the same longitude or slightly east," it ultimately
        concludes that Most Holy Trinity Church is "likely east of or at approximately
        the same longitude" rather than west. The model is indicating a difference
        in position (east rather than west) as the reason for its NO answer, not that
        they are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states "Tulsa and Lac qui Parle are at very similar
        longitudes, but Tulsa is slightly west of Lac qui Parle." The model notes
        a difference in position (Tulsa being "slightly west"), even though it acknowledges
        they are at "very similar longitudes." Since the model identifies a directional
        difference rather than equality, this is not a case where the NO answer is
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.

        equal as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it states "Tulsa is at approximately
        the same longitude or slightly east of Lac qui Parle" which indicates a potential
        slight difference in position. The "or slightly east" part indicates the model
        is noting a possible difference, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the primary reason for its NO answer. Instead, it says "It's either
        slightly east of or at approximately the same longitude." The model mentions
        that Tulsa might be "slightly east" as one possibility, which indicates a
        difference in values, even if small. Since the model presents a directional
        difference as a possibility, this doesn't qualify as stating the values are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, First Presbyterian
        Church (Tulsa), OK is not located west of Lac qui Parle, MN." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the relationship between
        the locations is primarily north-south rather than east-west. The model states
        "Oregon is generally in the same longitude range as California, not clearly
        east or west of it" but this is not claiming equality as the reason for the
        NO answer. The primary reason given is that "The Charles E. Nelson House in
        Oregon is north of Camanche Reservoir in California, not west of it."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly rejects the premise that Charles
        E. Nelson House is west of Camanche Reservoir.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that it cannot determine the east-west
        relationship because both locations are in states with similar longitudinal
        ranges and it lacks specific location details. The model is expressing uncertainty
        about the comparison rather than stating the locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        is very close to Meridian in the downtown area. The model concludes that Second
        Presbyterian is primarily north of Christ Church Cathedral, not meaningfully
        west of it. The NO answer is based on directional differences (north vs. west),
        not on equality of positions.

        have a significant east-west displacement relative to each other." The model
        indicates they are approximately aligned but not exactly equal, using terms
        like "roughly" and "essentially." The reason for the NO is that Second Presbyterian
        is north of Christ Church Cathedral, not west of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests that Baker Lake would "likely
        be west of or at a similar longitude to Anderson Lake," indicating a potential
        difference or similarity but not explicitly stating they are equal. The model's
        reasoning is based on the general geographical positioning of Washington and
        California states, not on the lakes having identical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative
        question about whether Baker Lake is west of Anderson Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Baker Lake is "more likely
        to be north of it, with potentially similar east-west positioning or even
        slightly east of it." The model is indicating there may be a difference in
        positioning (potentially slightly east), not that they have identical east-west
        positions. The NO answer is based on rejecting the westward positioning, not
        on claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated after the step-by-step

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that it cannot definitively determine
        if Baker Lake is west of Anderson Lake due to lack of specific coordinate
        information, given that both Washington and California are coastal states
        spanning similar longitudes. The model is not saying the locations are equal,
        but rather that it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.

        of the two lakes.

        equal in longitude or the same. Instead, it says it "cannot definitively say
        one is west of the other based solely on their state locations" due to lack
        of specific coordinates. The model indicates uncertainty about their relative
        positions rather than equality.

        difference, concluding that "Baker Lake (WA) would likely be east of (not
        west of) Anderson Lake (CA)." The model is indicating a specific directional
        relationship (east vs. west) rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end

        extends further west than Washington, implying that Anderson Lake in California
        is likely further west than Baker Lake in Washington. The model gives a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.

        is likely to be west of Baker Lake in Washington, indicating a difference
        in their east-west positioning. The model specifically notes that "California
        extends further west into the Pacific Ocean than Washington does," which is
        giving a reason for the difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked sufficient information to make a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, as there is insufficient
        information to conclude that Baker Lake is west of Anderson Lake." This is
        not a definitive comparative result, but rather a statement that the model
        cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information. The model explicitly
        states it "cannot make a definitive YES or NO determination" and only provides
        a NO answer because it feels compelled to choose between YES and NO.

        because it couldn't determine the relative positions without specific coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot definitively
        state that Baker Lake (Washington) is west of Anderson Lake (California) based
        solely on the information provided." This indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of specific coordinates, which falls under the UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer and explains that the
        east-west positions of the two locations are approximately the same. It states
        "There isn't a significant east-west offset between these locations" and concludes
        that Lake Steilacoom would be "not significantly east or west of" Terrapin
        Crossroads. The model is essentially saying the locations are at similar longitudes,
        which is the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Lake Steilacoom is not
        east of Terrapin Crossroads, stating "Lake Steilacoom (WA) would be north
        of Terrapin Crossroads (CA), but not significantly east or west of it."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Steilacoom is "northwest of Terrapin
        Crossroads, but not directly west." This indicates a directional difference
        (northwest vs. west), not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Lake Steilacoom,
        WA is not west of Terrapin Crossroads, CA." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or identical. Instead, it says they are "at similar longitudes" but
        also notes that "Lake Steilacoom [is] possibly being slightly east of Terrapin
        Crossroads." This indicates a difference in position (even if slight), not
        equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Lake Steilacoom, WA is not west of Terrapin Crossroads,
        CA. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Steilacoom
        is located east of Terrapin Crossroads, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Steilacoom,
        WA is not located west of Terrapin Crossroads, CA. It is located east of it."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        longitudes (east-west positions)" and that "There isn't a significant east-west
        offset between these regions." This indicates the model is saying NO because
        the locations have approximately equal east-west positions, which is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Lake Steilacoom, WA is located west of Terrapin Crossroads, CA. The
        answer is clearly stated and directly addresses the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        The model's "NO" answer contradicts its own reasoning, but it never claimed
        the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question about whether First Presbyterian Church in Jackson, Mississippi
        is east of House on the Rock in Wisconsin. The model concludes that First

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the First Presbyterian
        Church is east of House on the Rock, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of the locations.

        model's primary claim is that the church is east of House on the Rock, with
        only a secondary mention that they might be at "a very similar longitude."
        The model is asserting a directional difference (east rather than west), not
        equality, as its main reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" to the question of
        whether First Presbyterian Church in Jackson, Mississippi is west of House

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the Guthrie
        Theater is west of In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the two locations. The model analyzed
        the addresses and neighborhoods to determine that one theater is west of the
        other, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question,
        indicating that the Guthrie Theater is NOT east of In the Heart of the Beast
        Puppet and Mask Theatre. In fact, the model concludes that "the Guthrie Theater

        the Guthrie Theater is west of In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Guthrie Theater is east of In the Heart of
        the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre. The model concludes that "the Guthrie Theater
        is located west of In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre," which
        directly corresponds to a "NO" answer to the original question.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "The Guthrie is actually located
        to the north and west of In the Heart of the Beast Theatre." This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality. The model is saying NO because the
        directional relationship is more complex than just "west" - it's "north and
        west" - not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Guthrie Theater is

        in their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "NO" and then reconsiders
        its geography, but still concludes with "NO" as its final answer. The model
        is clearly making a comparative judgment about the relative locations of the
        two places, determining that Jamesville-DeWitt High School is east of Boldt
        Castle, not west.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relative positions are opposite to what was implied in the question
        - it states that Big Pink is EAST of the Park Performing Arts Center, not
        west. The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Big Pink is east of
        the Park Performing Arts Center, not west, and therefore answered NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually gave a YES answer based
        on Charles Playhouse being "slightly to the west" of Colonial Theatre.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer after double-checking its
        reasoning. The final determination was that "Charles Playhouse is actually
        positioned slightly to the west and south of Colonial Theatre" and concluded
        with "YES."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states in Step 5 that "Warrenton Street
        (Charles Playhouse) is slightly west of Boylston Street where the Colonial
        Theatre is located." The model is indicating a difference in position (slightly
        west vs. east), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that the Charles Playhouse is not east
        of the Colonial Theatre. The model reached this conclusion after analyzing
        the locations of both theaters in Boston.

        that Silver Lake Reservoir is east of the Orpheum Theatre, not west. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model has determined that Silver Lake Reservoir
        is east of the Orpheum Theatre, not west, and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        at the end of its response.

        stating that "Miller High Life Theatre is on the west side" while "Milwaukee
        Repertory Theater is on the east side." The model's NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model has provided a step-by-step analysis concluding that Miller High Life

        determined that the locations are different, with Miller High Life Theatre
        being west of Milwaukee Repertory Theater (based on their street addresses).
        The model gave a NO answer despite finding a directional difference, not because
        the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This directly contradicts its reasoning in step
        8 where it concluded that "Miller High Life Theatre is located west of Milwaukee
        Repertory Theater," which would logically lead to a "YES" answer. Despite
        this contradiction, I must analyze only what was explicitly stated as the

        possibly being slightly east of Foundry, not west of it." This indicates a
        difference in position, even if slight, rather than equality. The model is
        suggesting Foundry might actually be slightly east of All Souls, not that
        they're exactly equal in position.

        other. They are aligned on roughly the same north-south axis." This indicates
        the model is saying the churches have the same longitude (they're on the same

        of the other." This indicates the model believes the churches are at approximately
        the same longitude (on the same north-south line), making them equal in terms
        of east-west positioning. The equality of their positions is the primary reason
        for the NO answer.

        they are "roughly on the same north-south line" and "essentially on 16th Street
        NW" with "neither is significantly west of the other." This indicates they
        are approximately aligned but not exactly equal in position. The model is
        saying they don't have a west-east relationship rather than stating they have
        identical locations.

        for its NO answer, specifically that "The shrine in southern New Jersey would
        be southeast of Cranberry Lake, not west of it." This indicates a difference
        in relative positions (southeast vs. west) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a contradictory analysis,
        first concluding that "St. Padre Pio Shrine in NJ is indeed located west of
        Cranberry Lake, NY" but then answering "NO". Then it corrected itself, stating
        "Cranberry Lake, NY is actually in the Adirondack Mountains in the northern
        part of New York, which is northwest of New Jersey. The shrine in southern
        New Jersey would be southeast of Cranberry Lake, not west of it." The model's

    77de3e39-dbc3-48ea-aa79-9d7c1873ceda:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it explains that both buildings
        are "on the same north-south line" (Orange Avenue), with the courthouse being
        "further north" than the cathedral. The model is indicating they have the
        same east-west positioning (being on the same avenue) but different north-south
        positioning, not that they are at exactly the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Orange County
        Courthouse is not located west of St. James Cathedral in Orlando, Florida"
        as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b4955b94-bd2d-431b-ab4a-d002b8b80c13:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it identifies a difference in their positions,
        noting that the courthouse is at 425 N Orange Ave while the cathedral is at
        215 N Orange Ave, with the courthouse being further north on the same street.
        The model concludes that neither would be significantly east or west of the
        other because they are on the same avenue, but it doesn't claim they are in
        the exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. It explicitly states "NO" after analyzing the locations of
        Orange County Courthouse and St. James Cathedral.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dd6f3f53-6425-4daf-bd90-23d35d729fc7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that both buildings are on the same north-south
        street (Orange Avenue), with the courthouse being further north of the cathedral,
        but not west of it. The model notes they are "roughly aligned on the same
        north-south line" but doesn't claim they have identical east-west positions.
        The reason for the NO is directional (not west of) rather than equality-based.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Orange County
        Courthouse is not located west of St. James Cathedral." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

    dff18769-c312-4ace-8aad-e17489cd73c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the courthouse is not west
        of the cathedral because they are primarily aligned along the same north-south
        street (Orange Avenue). The model specifically notes that "The courthouse
        is not meaningfully west of the cathedral based on their addresses." This
        indicates a positional relationship reason for the NO answer, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct at the end of
        the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the buildings are on the
        same street but positioned north-south of each other (with the courthouse
        north of the cathedral), not east-west. The model is indicating a different
        directional relationship (north-south) rather than equality in east-west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Orange County
        Courthouse is not located west of St. James Cathedral." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it explains that the buildings are
        on the same avenue with the courthouse being north of the cathedral, not west
        of it. The model notes they are "aligned on roughly the same north-south line"
        and "at approximately the same longitude," but this is not presented as exact
        equality, and the primary reason for the NO is directional (north vs. west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. The Orange County
        Courthouse is not located west of St. James Cathedral." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Lower Monumental Dam in Washington would be east of Bel Air Church in California,
        not west of it" and "California extends further west than Washington state."
        The model is clearly indicating a difference in east-west positioning as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result
        to the question of whether Lower Monumental Dam is west of Bel Air Church.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lower Monumental
        Dam is east of Bel Air Church, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Lower Monumental Dam,
        WA is not located west of Bel Air Church, CA. It is east of Bel Air Church."
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        Air Church. The model gives a directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Lower Monumental Dam
        in Washington is east of Bel Air Church in California, not west," and then
        provides a clear "NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that the Co-Cathedral of
        St. Joseph cannot be west of the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer because the
        former is in Brooklyn (east) while the latter is in Manhattan (west).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the geographic relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states
        that the Brooklyn church is east of the Manhattan church, not west. The model
        identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that the Co-Cathedral of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model explains that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan, and
        therefore the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph (in Brooklyn) would be east of the
        Church of St. Vincent Ferrer (in Manhattan), not west of it. The model is
        indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph is west of the Church
        of St. Vincent Ferrer. The model clearly concludes with "Therefore, the Co-Cathedral
        of St. Joseph is NOT west of the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer" followed by
        "NO".

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        a directional difference - that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan, and therefore
        the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph would be east of the Church of St. Vincent
        Ferrer, not west of it. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that the Co-Cathedral of
        St. Joseph in Brooklyn would be east of the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer in
        Manhattan, not west of it, and therefore answers "NO" to what appears to be
        a question about whether the first church is west of the second.

        east of the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer, not west. The model gives a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Steppenwolf Theatre Company is not west of Presidential
        Towers. The model provides a clear comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Steppenwolf Theatre is east
        of Presidential Towers, indicating a directional difference. The model says
        "Presidential Towers at 555 W Madison is significantly further west than Steppenwolf
        Theatre at 1650 N Halsted." This shows the locations are different, not the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Steppenwolf Theatre
        Company is not located west of Presidential Towers. It is east of Presidential
        Towers." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        east-west positions or All Saints might be slightly east" which indicates
        a potential difference (with All Saints possibly being slightly east). The
        model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer, but rather
        suggesting All Saints is not west of the other church.
