      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES" after its step-by-step analysis determining that the Basilica
        is west of the theatre location.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Basilica is east of the theatre, not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("the Basilica is
        east of the former theatre site"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining that the Basilica is east of the theatre (not west as
        asked in the question). This is an explicit NO comparative answer.'

    39645f4d-768d-4eec-9450-3edddebefe51:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states the Basilica is
        EAST of the theatre, indicating different positions. The NO is because the
        relationship is opposite to what was asked (west)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (the Basilica
        is east, not west, of the theatre)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5a04d2aa-c039-40d5-b649-8c47742129a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that one location is
        EAST of the other. This directional difference, not equality, is given as
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides
        a direct comparative result, stating that one location is east of the other
        rather than west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        the Basilica is east of the theatre, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because the Basilica is east when asked if it was
        west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the relative positions of the two locations,
        finding that the Basilica is east of the theatre.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f4b91a3a-d237-4d90-b5c3-3b826c22a33e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Basilica is east of the theatre, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("the Basilica is east of the former
        theatre location"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative result based on relative positions, stating
        the Basilica is east of the theatre, therefore not west of it.'

    1044291f-3faf-46a6-bdeb-dd19e59600ff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other (specifically stating "Amarillo is actually
        east of Lake McConaughy, not west"), not because the locations are at the
        same position. Since it identifies a directional difference, even if factually
        incorrect, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its geographic
        analysis.'

    373071db-5cce-4765-9395-ca93e4771e2d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Amarillo (where FirstBank
        Southwest Tower is) is southwest of Lake McConaughy. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, providing a direct comparative answer about the
        westward position.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    59d7edc3-ca4d-4d52-bebf-f347dea8cfc7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that one location
        is east of the other ("it is actually east of Lake McConaughy, not west"),
        indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that
        FirstBank Southwest Tower is not west of Lake McConaughy.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    815728df-41b7-4e71-9762-3f10a182eaa4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states they
        are "hundreds of miles apart" and that one is east of the other, indicating
        a clear difference in position. The NO was given because FirstBank Southwest
        Tower is east (not west) of Lake McConaughy.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that FirstBank
        Southwest Tower is east of Lake McConaughy, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    943e443c-e3f6-4592-9466-eed7f0ced28e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with one being southwest of the other. The NO answer was given
        because the tower is southwest (not purely west) of the lake.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis that the tower
        is southwest of the lake (not directly west)'

    aecb8afc-d2eb-4364-be1c-a8ef56dc3c1f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that FirstBank Southwest Tower is east of Lake McConaughy), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to the geographical
        comparison question. The model is confident in its answer and provides specific
        reasoning.

      result: 'NO'
    b3e84ca3-0dbd-4f5c-99b5-cb5ecd17ec66:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states they are "not in the
        same direct line of longitude" and that one is "actually east of" the other.
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a clear comparative result, indicating FirstBank Southwest
        Tower is not west of Lake McConaughy.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. Instead, it explicitly stated there is a difference
        in longitude values (-75.1552 vs -75.1567) and concluded that "the Cathedral
        is slightly west of the Forrest Theatre." Since it identified a difference,
        even though described as "slight," this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" to the question

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Griffy Lake being
        north of Lake Monroe, not because the lakes are at the same location. The
        model explicitly states a difference in position ("Griffy Lake is located
        north of Lake Monroe") and uses this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis of the relative
        positions of the lakes.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Griffy Lake is east
        of Lake Monroe, indicating a difference in position. The NO appears to be
        rejecting a premise about westward positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (Griffy Lake being
        east, not west, of Lake Monroe)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    6a333d63-39b8-41b7-a650-e607bf27712a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Griffy
        Lake is east of Lake Monroe, not because the locations are the same. The model
        explicitly states a directional difference ("Griffy Lake is actually east
        of Lake Monroe"), making this a comparison of different values rather than
        equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to the location comparison
        without any caveats about uncertainty or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it actually stated it couldn't
        make the comparison due to one location not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating "Lake Beshear"
        doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible. Although it ends with "NO",
        this NO is given after explaining the comparison cannot be determined due
        to a non-existent location. Per the criteria, when a model rejects premises
        or indicates it cannot make the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    17d1adc0-365a-4c8d-98ce-51c6fdff4d70:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it simply couldn't determine their relative positions because
        one location couldn't be found.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ultimately states "NO" at the end,
        it explicitly says it "cannot confidently say YES or NO" and only chooses
        NO because it feels forced to pick one, while emphasizing low confidence.
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4eaa3d12-176a-4735-b68b-b8fe890f6c50:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't find
        one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model indicates it "cannot verify" or "cannot definitively determine"
        the relationship due to being unable to find one of the locations (Lake Beshear).
        This makes it a case where the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison,
        which should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the explicit "NO" answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    6256ea13-5672-4adb-8f74-4cce65a4119f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines
        the cathedral would be east of Kentucky, not west. The answer is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." While it expresses uncertainty about one location, it still
        provides a definitive NO answer based on the general geography it could determine.'

      result: 'NO'
    961c20ed-6280-4947-880c-f29effcbc7b7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot confidently state whether
        the cathedral is west or east of this lake" due to uncertainty about Lake
        Beshear's location, yet gives a "NO" answer. Since the model explicitly indicates
        it cannot determine the comparison and questions the existence/location of
        one of the reference points, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9c002db5-fcc2-4fc3-927e-cd36325a0d3f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. Instead, the model states that Chicago
        is east of Kentucky, indicating a difference in longitude. The NO answer was
        given because the relationship is in the opposite direction of what was asked
        (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, St. Nicholas Cathedral
        (Chicago), IL is NOT located west of Lake Beshear, KY" as its final comparative
        answer. While the model notes that Lake Beshear cannot be found, it still
        provides a definitive NO based on the general geography of Chicago and Kentucky.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it cannot determine the relationship
        due to one location being unverifiable. This is a case where the model rejects
        the premise of the question since one location may not exist.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    bee21b76-b3d9-46d7-864d-bfecef970b0d:

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it actually stated it couldn't make the comparison due to one
        location not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO", it rejects the premise
        by stating that Lake Beshear doesn't exist and therefore the comparison is
        impossible to verify. When a model rejects the premises or indicates it cannot
        determine the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Chicago is east of Kentucky
        and therefore St. Nicholas Cathedral cannot be west of Lake Beshear. The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about one location,
        it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it bases the NO on geographical reasoning about relative positions
        of Illinois vs Kentucky. The NO is due to directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        provides this as a comparative directional result (not being west of something).
        While it notes uncertainty about one location, it still provides a definitive
        NO answer based on regional geography.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        Carolands was explicitly stated to be east of the reservoir, indicating a
        difference in position. The model states "Carolands is east of Crystal Springs
        Reservoir" and concludes NO based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because it "cannot confirm" the relationship. This makes it clear
        that the model is indicating its inability to determine the relationship rather
        than making a comparative judgment, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, this is not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one location is east of the other, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" answer to the comparative question. The
        model determines that Blessed Sacrament Cathedral is EAST of the Mountaineer
        Wind Energy Center, and therefore answers NO to whether it is WEST of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states they are different, with "Civic Center Music
        Hall is east of Lewis and Clark Lake." The NO answer is given because the
        relationship is opposite to what was asked (east rather than west), not because
        the locations are the same.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        positions (one east, one west). The NO was given because the relationship
        is in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Pittsburgh
        Playhouse is east (not west) of Benedum Center.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Minnesota
        is "north and east of Texas" and concludes NO because Star Lite Motel would
        NOT be west of Curtis Culwell Center. The NO is based on a directional difference,

        This uncertainty about relative positions, not equality, is the reason for
        the NO answer.

        is a directional difference (power plant is east of the theater) as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, giving directional reasoning that the power plant
        is east, not west, of the theater.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Point Beach was determined to be east of Kewaunee, indicating a difference
        in position (opposite to what was asked).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" after determining that Point Beach is east of Kewaunee,
        not west.'

    3cd1badb-d6a1-4511-aca1-580f8b2e5edf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Kewaunee is north of Point
        Beach, and explains that "west" is not the correct directional relationship
        between them. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the westward positioning.
        The answer is definitive and based on geographical reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states Point Beach is northeast of Kewaunee
        Power Station, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the
        direction is different from what was asked (northeast instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a03390c1-ec60-45f9-9bf1-1cc072507eb4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Point Beach is south of Kewaunee, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is based on Point Beach being in a different direction (south) rather than
        west.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Point Beach is
        south of Kewaunee, not west of it.'

    aa338456-6670-4273-af96-7c022c6728da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the locations have
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states differences in their locations,
        noting that "Point Beach is slightly north of Kewaunee" and both are on the
        eastern side. The NO answer is based on both being on the eastern side, not
        because they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Point Beach Nuclear Plant is NOT
        west of Kewaunee Power Station." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b6a856ae-7aea-475f-a41a-28bafc238493:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates or positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Point Beach is
        south of Kewaunee Power Station, indicating different positions. The NO answer
        is based on Point Beach being south rather than west, not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating
        "Point Beach is slightly north of Kewaunee" and concludes NO because Point
        Beach is not west of Kewaunee.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying the reservoir is east of the cathedral (not west). The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final comparative answer, providing a direct NO

        were equal - it only noted they were close to each other but still potentially
        different ("difference in their exact west-east positioning would be minimal").
      explanation_final_answer: The model first states it "cannot confidently answer
        YES or NO" but then provides "NO" as a final answer while noting uncertainty.
        Since the model explicitly indicates it cannot determine the comparison ("Without
        exact coordinates, I cannot definitively state whether one is west of the
        other"), this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

        Street). The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

    45b6ad12-098a-4104-a061-eb4bece27ba2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        New Hope Baptist Church is EAST of the Cathedral, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer was given because the direction was opposite to
        what was asked (east instead of west), not because the locations were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on finding that New Hope Baptist Church is east (not west)
        of Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart. This is a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" due to lack of precise location data. This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it needs more information to make the determination.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient data.

        of Cathedral Basilica, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not because
        the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after walking through its reasoning about the relative

        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative positioning of the
        two locations. The answer is definitive and based on geographical analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Natchez, MS is east of Lake
        Onalaska, MN, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, with no caveats or uncertainty about
        its ability to make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Natchez
        is actually east of Lake Onalaska ("Natchez is east of Lake Onalaska, not
        west"), not because the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations, making this
        a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.'

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Mammy's Cupboard is east of Lake Onalaska, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis determining

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Mammy's Cupboard is "significantly
        south and east of Lake Onalaska" - indicating a clear difference in position,
        not equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that Mammy's Cupboard
        is "NOT west of Lake Onalaska"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it concludes NO because it believes Long Wharf Theatre
        is "most likely WEST of Horchow Hall" - indicating a directional difference,
        even if uncertain. The NO is based on a perceived difference in location,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as its final comparative answer. While the model expresses

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        say" and does not have "enough information to give a confident YES or NO answer."
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        information to answer this question" and "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer"
        because it cannot determine the relative positions. This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Horchow Hall is west of Long Wharf Theatre,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO is because the relationship is
        in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its step-by-step analysis determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Long Wharf Theatre being east of Horchow Hall), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it identifies specific differences in coordinates and
        states that "St. James Cathedral is slightly northwest" and later "actually
        slightly east" of the other church. While there appears to be some contradiction
        in the directionality, the model clearly indicates differences rather than
        equality as the basis for its NO answer.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that St. James Cathedral is "slightly
        east and north" of the other building. This difference in position, even though
        described as "slight," means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        the other, indicating a difference in positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Steppenwolf is east of Presidential Towers,
        indicating a directional difference, and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on relative positions
        (east vs west)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        there is a directional difference (the shrine is east of the lake, not west),
        not because the locations are equal. It explicitly states "Washington, DC
        is east of Pennsylvania" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with "Therefore, the answer to the specific question
        is: NO" and reaffirms "The shrine is NOT located west of Rose Valley Lake."'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is east of the other), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (east vs west) for
        this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (shrine being east rather than west), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly notes a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer, providing a comparative directional result (shrine is
        east, not west of the lake)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating the shrine is east of Rose Valley Lake, not west), not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly notes they are in different locations
        and gives a directional relationship between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this
        a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        the shrine is east of Rose Valley Lake, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the geographical
        analysis showing the shrine is east, not west, of the lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (shrine is east of the lake), not because
        they are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
