      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather
        indicated it couldn't determine the answer due to insufficient location information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, I cannot determine with
        certainty whether Charles E. Nelson House is west of Camanche Reservoir without
        more specific location information." This is not a definitive NO to the comparative
        question, but rather indicates the model cannot make the determination due
        to insufficient information. The model is stating it lacks the necessary data
        to provide a clear answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it gives a different reason for the NO answer, stating
        "It would be northwest, but in terms of east-west positioning, Oregon is generally
        east of the Sierra Nevada foothills in California." The model is claiming
        a directional difference (east, not west) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Charles E. Nelson
        House in Oregon is not west of Camanche Reservoir." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

        question does not apply. The model did not claim the values were equal - in
        fact, it concluded that Charles E. Nelson House is west of Camanche Reservoir.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Charles E. Nelson
        House, OR is located west of Camanche Reservoir, CA" as its final conclusion

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same values. Instead, it explains that Camanche Reservoir is in eastern
        California, and that most locations in Oregon would be northwest of the reservoir,
        not directly west. The model is indicating a directional difference (northwest
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Charles E. Nelson House, OR is not located west
        of Camanche Reservoir, CA. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it clearly indicates they are in different
        positions, with the explanation suggesting that Charles E. Nelson House is
        west of Camanche Reservoir. The NO answer was not given because the locations
        have the same longitude or are in the same place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO. Charles E. Nelson
        House in Oregon is located west of Camanche Reservoir in California." This
        is a clear NO answer to the question "Is Charles E. Nelson House, OR located
        west of Camanche Reservoir, CA?" However, the explanation contradicts this
        answer, as the model states "Any location in Oregon would be west of a location
        in California's Sierra Nevada region." This suggests the answer should be
        YES. Despite this contradiction, I must analyze only what was explicitly stated
        as the final answer, which is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Oregon is north of California
        rather than west of it. The model's reasoning is based on directional difference
        (north vs. west), not equality of longitude. While it mentions they "roughly
        occupy similar longitudinal ranges," it doesn't claim they're at the exact
        same longitude, and the primary reason for the NO is that Oregon is north
        of California rather than west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Charles E. Nelson House, OR located west of Camanche Reservoir,

        or the same. Instead, it explains that "Second Presbyterian is on Meridian
        Street itself" while "Christ Church Cathedral on Monument Circle is slightly
        east of Meridian Street." The model concludes that Second Presbyterian is
        "essentially due north of it, or perhaps very slightly to the east, but not
        west." This indicates a difference in positioning, not equality.

        the churches have "nearly identical" east-west positioning, with both being
        "very close to or on Meridian Street." The model states that their positioning
        is "nearly identical" and this similarity in location is the primary reason
        for the NO answer. The model does not note any definitive difference in their
        east-west positions, but rather emphasizes their similar locations relative
        to Meridian Street.

        on Meridian Street" while Christ Church Cathedral is "slightly east of Meridian
        Street on Monument Circle." The model concludes that Second Presbyterian is
        "actually slightly east or directly north" of Christ Church Cathedral. Since
        the model notes a difference in positions rather than equality, this is not
        a case where NO was given because the values are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same longitude or in the same location. Instead, it provides reasoning about
        the geographic positioning of the states and concludes that Baker Lake is
        not west of Anderson Lake. The model actually suggests that California's westernmost
        points extend further west than Washington's, implying the lakes are at different
        longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Baker Lake (Washington)

        at "similar longitudes" or that "Anderson Lake could even be further west."
        The model is indicating there could be a difference in position, not that
        they are exactly equal. The reasoning is based on the overlapping longitude
        ranges of the states and potential positions of the lakes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        indicated it couldn't make the determination without more data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot conclusively
        state that Baker Lake (WA) is west of Anderson Lake (CA) without specific
        location data for both lakes." This is a case where the model is saying it
        cannot determine the answer due to lack of specific location data, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN category. The model is not making a definitive comparative
        judgment but rather stating it lacks information to make the determination.

        specific locations of the lakes within their states, noting that Washington
        is north of California but not necessarily west. The model indicates that
        without specific coordinates, it's making a determination based on general
        geography, not because the locations have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it says they are "roughly at similar longitudes,
        with Terrapin Crossroads possibly being slightly further west." This indicates
        a slight difference rather than equality, so this is not a case where the
        NO answer is based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Lake Steilacoom, WA is
        NOT west of Terrapin Crossroads, CA" and concludes with a clear "NO" at the
        end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically states that Lake Steilacoom is "north
        and slightly east" of Terrapin Crossroads, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality. The model is saying NO because one location is east
        of the other, not because they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Steilacoom,
        WA is not located west of Terrapin Crossroads, CA." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference, stating
        that Lake Steilacoom is "north and slightly east of Terrapin Crossroads."
        Since it identifies a directional difference (slightly east) as the reason
        for the NO answer, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Lake Steilacoom,
        WA is not west of Terrapin Crossroads, CA." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it states "The two locations are
        very close in terms of east-west positioning, with Lake Steilacoom being slightly
        west of Terrapin Crossroads." This indicates a difference in values (Lake
        Steilacoom being slightly west), which contradicts the NO answer but still
        means the model is not claiming equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Lake Steilacoom, WA is not west of Terrapin Crossroads,
        CA. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Smithville Lake is west of
        Longview Lake, which is a directional difference. The model gives a NO answer
        because it found that the opposite of the question is true (Smithville Lake
        is west of Longview Lake, not east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Smithville Lake is not east of Longview Lake. In
        fact, it states "Smithville Lake lies to the west of Longview Lake," which
        is the opposite of what was asked.

        "NO" answer, but I'm evaluating only what was stated, not resolving contradictions.
        Since the model claims there is a difference in position (even if described
        as "slight"), this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Gaiety Theatre is not west of Comedy Theatre. The
        model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that both theaters were on Broadway,
        with the Gaiety Theatre being further north (1547 Broadway) than the Comedy
        Theatre (1430 Broadway). The model concludes that "neither would be significantly
        east or west of the other" since they were on the same street, but it doesn't
        claim they have identical east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. The model concludes that since both theaters
        were on Broadway with different address numbers, the Gaiety Theatre was further
        north, but not west of the Comedy Theatre.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot provide
        a definitive answer to this question as I lack the necessary geographical
        information about these specific theaters in New York City." This is not a
        definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates the model

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "Both
        churches are essentially on 16th Street NW. They are aligned on the same north-south
        street, meaning neither is significantly east or west of the other." This
        indicates the model is saying the churches have the same east-west positioning

        churches are located on or near 16th Street NW at approximately the same longitude,
        neither is significantly west of the other. They are roughly on the same north-south
        corridor." This indicates the model is saying the churches are at approximately
        the same east-west position (same longitude), and this equality is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that both
        churches are on the same east-west position (both on 16th Street NW). The
        model explicitly states "Since both churches are positioned along the same
        numbered street (16th Street NW), neither is west of the other." This indicates
        the values being compared (their east-west positions) are the same, and this
        equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Foundry United Methodist Church is not west of All
        Souls Church because they are both positioned along the same numbered street
        (16th Street NW).

        positioning." The model explicitly notes that "two locations on the same numbered
        street would not be west or east of each other." The NO answer is given because
        the churches have the same east-west position, not because one is west of
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the same numbered street, they're at roughly the same longitude" and "There
        isn't a significant east-west difference between them." The model is indicating
        the values (east-west positions) are essentially equal/the same, which is
        why it answers NO.

        Street NW, and they're aligned on the same north-south axis, neither is west
        of the other." This clearly indicates that the model is saying NO because
        the churches are at the same longitude (on the same north-south street), making
        them equal in terms of east-west positioning. The equality of their positions
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the church is east
        of the dam, indicating a directional difference between their locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - St. Mary's in the
        Mountains Catholic Church in Nevada is not located west of Pine Flat Dam in
        California. It is located east of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the church would be east
        of the dam (not west) based on the geographic relationship between Nevada
        and California. The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs.
        west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic
        Church, NV is not located west of Pine Flat Dam, CA. The model provides a
        direct comparative answer.

        the same longitude (east-west position)" and even suggests "the courthouse
        might be slightly east of the cathedral." This indicates a potential difference
        in position, not exact equality. The model's reasoning is that they are primarily
        separated in the north-south direction rather than being exactly at the same
        east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that the buildings are "essentially
        aligned on the same north-south axis" and have "negligible east-west displacement
        between them." This indicates they are approximately at the same longitude
        (east-west position), which is the reason for the NO answer. The model is

        equal or identical. Instead, it explains that the buildings are "aligned along
        roughly the same north-south axis" and "aren't significantly offset east-west
        from each other." The model is indicating they are very similar in position
        but not stating they are exactly the same. The reasoning is about alignment
        on the same street rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Orange County
        Courthouse is not located west of St. James Cathedral" in its conclusion.

        equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "the courthouse is slightly to the
        east side of Orange Avenue while the cathedral is on the west side of Orange
        Avenue." This indicates a difference in position, even if slight, rather than
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        model is explicitly stating that the buildings are in the same position on
        the east-west axis (being on the same north-south line), indicating they have
        equal east-west positioning. This equality is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer.

        west of the CIA headquarters" and "Lake Accotink are situated slightly west
        of Langley." The model's NO answer appears to be based on rejecting the premise
        that the George Bush Center is in Maryland, not because the locations are
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. While the model points out an error in the

        expressed inability to determine the relative positions due to lack of specific
        location data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot definitively
        state that Fourmile Lake is west of Our Lady of the Wayside Church without
        specific location data for both landmarks." This is a case where the model
        is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category
        according to the criteria. The model is indicating it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the shrine would
        be east of the lake, not west. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that the Ukrainian Catholic National Shrine is not west of Rose
        Valley Lake. The model provides a direct and explicit negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the shrine is east
        of the lake, indicating a clear directional difference between their locations.
        The model's reasoning is that "Washington, DC is east of Pennsylvania" and
        therefore "the Ukrainian Catholic National Shrine in DC would be east of Rose
        Valley Lake, not west of it."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Ukrainian Catholic National Shrine of the Holy Family,
        DC located west of Rose Valley Lake (Pennsylvania), PA?" The model clearly
        concludes that the shrine is east of the lake, not west of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the shrine in DC would be
        EAST of Rose Valley Lake in PA, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model gives a NO answer because the direction is opposite
        to what was asked (east instead of west), not because the locations are at
        the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the Ukrainian Catholic National Shrine of the Holy
        Family, DC is not located west of Rose Valley Lake (Pennsylvania). The model
        provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different positions, with the Ukrainian Catholic National Shrine being east
        of Rose Valley Lake, not west. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "the Ukrainian
        Catholic National Shrine is NOT west of Rose Valley Lake - it's actually east
        of it."

        Lake, not west of it. The model gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Ukrainian Catholic National Shrine of the Holy
        Family in DC is located west of Rose Valley Lake in Pennsylvania. The model
        clearly concludes that "Washington DC (where the shrine is located) is east
        of Rose Valley Lake, not west of it, the shrine cannot be west of the lake.
