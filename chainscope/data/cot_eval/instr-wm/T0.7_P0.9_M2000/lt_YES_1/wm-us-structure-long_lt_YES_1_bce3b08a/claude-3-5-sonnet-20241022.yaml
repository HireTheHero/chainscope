    09427e2b-0bde-4fe1-a944-8b158a93732c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Basilica is EAST of the Mechanic Theatre, not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between their
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the buildings and determining
        that one is east of the other, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    1172262b-bab6-4f4b-8dd2-4eee265bdd2e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "it's actually slightly east of it." Even though the difference is
        described as "slight", any stated difference means this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in its explanation and explicitly labeled as "Final Answer: NO". This
        is a direct comparative result.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES, the Basilica
        is located west of where the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre was." This is a clear,
        direct YES answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    647f88fc-8457-47da-80ec-6e5f271867ef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        the model determined the Basilica is east of the Mechanic Theatre, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, after explaining that the Basilica is east
        (not west) of the Mechanic Theatre.

        W)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, YES"
        after comparing the locations and determining the Basilica is slightly west
        of the Theatre.

      explanation_equal_values: Although the model noted they are at "almost the same
        longitude," it explicitly stated there is a difference ("Davis-Besse is slightly
        east of Orchestra Hall"). Since any difference, even if described as slight,
        means the values are not exactly equal, and this directional difference was
        the reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on finding that Davis-Besse is slightly east (not
        west) of Orchestra Hall.

        difference, with Davis-Besse being east of Orchestra Hall. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("slightly east" vs west), and this difference (not equality) is
        given as the reason for the NO answer. Even though the difference is described
        as "slight," any stated difference means this is not an equality-based NO
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (Forrest Theatre
        being east, not west, of the Cathedral)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Forrest Theatre is east of the Cathedral), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states one location is further
        west than the other based on street numbers.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        the model determined the Forrest Theatre is east of the Cathedral, indicating
        a difference in location (opposite of what was apparently being asked).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations, determining that the
        Forrest Theatre is east (not west) of the Cathedral.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      result: 'YES'
    c3c2ed7c-d3e8-4f43-9a1f-1908fdaa538f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it explains that the locations are "roughly
        aligned east-west" but concludes NO primarily because the difference is north-south
        ("It's primarily north of it"). The mention of being in "roughly the same
        vertical band" indicates similar but not identical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Charles E. Nelson
        House, OR is not located west of Camanche Reservoir, CA" as its final answer.
        This is a clear NO comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they're "roughly on the same
        longitude lines," this is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        The model concludes with "It's primarily north of it" as the main reason for
        the NO answer. The use of "roughly" also suggests they're not exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Charles E. Nelson
        House, OR is not located west of Camanche Reservoir, CA" as its final conclusion.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

    ec410901-672e-470d-bc7c-6fe70d150424:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that Oregon and California are
        "along roughly the same longitude" and "vertically aligned," it doesn't explicitly
        state that the two specific locations have equal/identical longitudes. Instead,
        it uses terms like "similar longitudes" and "same general north-south corridor"
        which suggest approximate alignment rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        \ is described as \"minimal\" and \"tiny,\" the mere acknowledgment of any\
        \ directional difference means this isn't a case of exact equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and reinforces this with an explanation about the locations being
        essentially at the same longitude with only a tiny difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that one location is west of the
        other (Vermont is west of Connecticut). The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the churches are at equal
        longitude - instead, it explains that Second Presbyterian is "directly north"
        of Christ Church Cathedral. While it says they're not "significantly" west/east
        of each other, this implies some potential tiny difference rather than exact
        equality. The NO answer is based on directional reasoning (north vs west)
        rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with Don Pedro being
        east and Twitchell being west. The NO is because they have different positions,
        not because they are the same
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually stated they were in different positions (Don Pedro in
        Sierra foothills, Twitchell near coast) and concluded NO based on Don Pedro
        being east of Twitchell.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude values. Instead, it explicitly states they are at different positions,
        with Don Pedro being more inland/eastern and Twitchell being more coastal/western.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Don Pedro Reservoir
        is not west of Twitchell Reservoir" and provides a definitive comparative

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Don Pedro
        is explicitly stated to be "east of Twitchell, not west" - indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"

        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Boone Lake is "slightly EAST"
        of Beech Fork Lake, indicating a difference in position, even if small. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        first that one location is west of the other, then reverses to say the other
        location is further west. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and maintains

        is not a case where the NO answer is based on exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Boone Lake,

        difference, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Beverly is "further
        east than Cleveland" and concludes the power plant is "EAST of Allen Theatre,
        not west". The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Muskingum River Power Plant is east of Allen Theatre,
        not west. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined the locations had different positions (with Muskingum
        being east of Allen Theatre, not west). The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying
        one is EAST of the other. The NO is because it determines the relationship
        is the opposite of what was asked (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating "NO - Wortham Theater Center is NOT located west
        of the Cathedral." This is a direct negative response to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        One Madison is east of the John Golden Theatre (indicating a difference in
        position, opposite to what was being asked). The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and
        determining that One Madison is east of the John Golden Theatre, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6173bcfc-19ca-48f4-aded-0a34c2f37102:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes that One Madison is EAST of the John Golden
        Theatre, indicating a specific directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (One Madison is not
        west of John Golden Theatre)" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear
        NO response indicating a specific directional relationship.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states One Madison is
        east of the John Golden Theatre, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - One Madison is not
        located west of John Golden Theatre" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    974c70a4-2b0c-4d0f-b3ce-2705b8786a4e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (One Madison being east while the question presumably asked if it was west),
        not because the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference with one being east and one being west of
        5th Avenue.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.

      result: 'NO'
    aa28e110-3ade-4841-be95-50c7deb08f15:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly stated that One Madison is east of the theatre,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO was
        because the premise was incorrect (asking if A was west of B when A is actually
        east of B).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing clear reasoning that One Madison is east of
        the theatre, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined One
        Madison is east of John Golden Theatre, not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly stated there is a directional difference (one is east
        of 5th Ave, one is west of 5th Ave), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether One
        Madison is west of John Golden Theatre.

    eaf73d8f-d2bd-41aa-a09d-bd1fe7e11ffe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly stated that One Madison is EAST of the John
        Golden Theatre, indicating different positions. The NO was based on the opposite
        directional relationship being true, not because of equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that one location is not west of the other
        (and in fact states it is east)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    fc6c2261-6f8e-4cad-adee-d17f5c65ced1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it determined that One Madison is east
        of the John Golden Theatre, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states Point Beach is east of
        Kewaunee due to the shoreline's curve. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a definitive
        comparative answer about the directional relationship, explaining that Point
        Beach is east (not west) of Kewaunee.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    209c70a9-66a5-4d1c-aa20-61f0514f3fd2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a slight difference, saying Point Beach is "slightly
        east if anything" relative to Kewaunee. Even though they are described as
        "roughly on the same north-south line," the mention of any difference, even
        slight, means this is not a case of equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical positioning
        (one being south of the other and the shoreline running north-south), not
        because the locations have equal coordinates or positions. It explicitly states
        there is a difference in their positions (one is south of the other)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining why Point Beach Nuclear Plant cannot be west of Kewaunee
        Power Station

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Point Beach is "slightly more
        east" than Kewaunee, indicating a difference in position (even if slight)
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its analysis
        of the locations.

      result: 'NO'
    7b5b33bc-42c7-460c-b41f-f901eea4fb12:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "roughly on the
        same north-south running shoreline," it explicitly states Point Beach is "slightly
        southeast of Kewaunee." Since it indicates a directional difference (even
        if slight), this is not a case where the NO answer was given because the locations
        are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Point Beach Nuclear
        Plant is not located west of Kewaunee Power Station" as its final comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states Point Beach Nuclear Plant is "slightly east
        of Kewaunee Power Station due to the curve of the shoreline." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly ends its response with "NO" as a
        direct comparative answer after providing its reasoning.

    b2a6fc4d-9bc2-4056-8553-1af8295b3c5e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Point Beach is "slightly east
        or southeast of Kewaunee, not west" - indicating a directional difference,
        even if slight.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ba31975b-7ef4-4b55-bdbd-5bd0fe30d44e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the east-west positioning is
        "very similar," it explicitly states there is a difference ("Point Beach is
        slightly east of Kewaunee"). Since any difference, even if described as slight,
        means the values are not equal, this does not qualify as a NO due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating Point Beach
        is slightly east of Kewaunee.

    d8c092b5-e806-4fa9-8b71-8dfa517b7b44:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal - instead, it concludes that Point Beach must be "slightly east
        or at the same longitude" as Kewaunee. The mention of possible equality is
        only part of an alternative possibility, not the reason for the NO answer.
        The model's reasoning is based on geographical analysis showing Point Beach
        cannot be west of Kewaunee.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states Point Beach is "south and slightly
        east" of Kewaunee, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Point Beach Nuclear
        Plant is not west of Kewaunee Power Station" and provides a clear comparative
        direction (south and slightly east) as the alternative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one theater being east of the other), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        theaters' locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining

    f7cb4038-ba27-4be7-98fc-7e85ce312e0e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being east of the other), not because the locations are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states that 32 Old Slip is EAST of where
        Mineshaft was.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that 32 Old
        Slip is east, not west, of Mineshaft's location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fa36f587-cd7d-494f-9c82-9d47039d2003:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        locations with 32 Old Slip being east of where Mineshaft was. The NO is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice,
        providing a definitive comparative directional answer that 32 Old Slip is
        not west of Mineshaft's location. The answer is given with directional certainty
        (stating it's "actually east").
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ff352d16-b623-4ba3-92c3-b3ee210d8815:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions, stating that
        the Meatpacking District is "clearly west" of the Financial District and provides
        different coordinates for each location. The NO answer is based on 32 Old
        Slip being east of Mineshaft, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 32 Old Slip is located
        east of where Mineshaft was located." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        difference ("slightly EAST"), making this a comparison where the locations
        are not equal. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that New Hope Baptist Church
        is slightly east of the Cathedral

        east" and Cathedral Basilica is "more westerly" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality. Even though the difference is described as "slight,"
        any stated difference means the NO answer wasn't based on equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated that "Saugerties is actually slightly EAST of
        Union City", indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states that Big Pink is
        EAST of Park Performing Arts Center, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a logical sequence and concludes
        with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer, indicating that Big
        Pink is not west of Park Performing Arts Center.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical - the model explicitly states that one
        location is east of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        is because the relationship is in the opposite direction of what was apparently
        asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Big Pink is east of Park Performing Arts Center, not
        west of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states that one location
        is east of the other (Manhattan is east of New Jersey). The NO is because
        the premise cannot be true given the relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are equal - it explicitly states that Charles Playhouse is "slightly east"
        of the Colonial Theatre, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because
        the relationship is in the opposite direction of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        equal/same - it explicitly stated there was a directional difference (Charles
        Playhouse being southeast of Colonial Theatre). Even though these might be
        very close, any stated directional difference means they're not considered
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        difference, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice in its response,
        both in the conclusion and final answer line, indicating that St. James Cathedral

        Even though this difference might be small, any stated difference means we
        cannot classify this as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states they are on opposite sides of the street
        (Drake Hotel on east side, 425 Park on west side). The NO is because their
        relative positions are opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - The Drake Hotel was

        avenue, this isn't presented as indicating equal east-west positions. Rather,
        the NO answer is given because being on the same avenue means neither building
        could be west of the other - this is a structural/logical reason rather than
        an equality statement.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        the same avenue, this is not presented as a reason for equality - in fact,
        the model explicitly states there was a directional difference (Drake Hotel
        being north of 425 Park). The NO answer was given because the direction was
        different from what was being asked about (north vs west), not because the
        locations were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        one is north of the other (440 is higher than 425), and therefore neither
        is west of the other because they're aligned on the same north-south street.

        in fact, it explicitly stated there was a difference, saying "the shrine is
        clearly further east than Cranberry Lake". The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations
        and determining the shrine is further east than Cranberry Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Landisville
        is "slightly EAST" of Cranberry Lake, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on the direction being opposite to what was asked (east instead
        of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that St. Padre Pio Shrine is east (not west) of Cranberry
        Lake.

        equal positions - in fact, it explicitly notes they are at different positions
        (425 vs 215 N Orange Ave). The NO answer is given because they are on the
        same street with different north/south positions, not because they are at
        the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is specifically because the
        buildings are "on the same east-west alignment" - this indicates they are
        at the same east-west position, and this equality is explicitly given as the
        reason for the NO answer. The model states they are "essentially on the same
        east-west line" and uses this sameness as the basis for rejecting the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        the NO answer. The model explicitly states they are "on the same north-south
        line" without any indication of east-west difference, making this a case of
        equal east-west positioning being the reason for the NO answer.

        are aligned north-south on the same street with different numerical positions
        (425 N vs 215 N), meaning neither is west of the other. The NO was due to
        directional alignment, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, after explaining that neither building is west of the
        other since they are aligned north-south on the same street.

        Instead, it explicitly noted they are at different points (425 vs 215) along
        the same street, with one being further north than the other. The NO answer
        was based on them being aligned on the same street, not on having equal positions.

        relationship being true (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        because the relationship is in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a specific

        longitude. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in their positions, stating
        that the church is closer to the Pacific coast than Fourmile Lake, which is
        in eastern Oregon. The NO answer is based on this difference in position,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal longitude. The model explicitly states there is a
        difference, with Fourmile Lake being "relatively far inland" while Our Lady
        of the Wayside Church is "very close to the Pacific coast" and "significantly
        further west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states that Fourmile Lake is
        EAST of the church, indicating different positions. The NO is based on the
        opposite directional relationship being true.

        equal - it says they are "very similar" but explicitly notes that Fourmile
        Lake is "slightly east". Any difference, even if described as slight, means
        we should classify this as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference (one is east of the
        other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Steppenwolf Theatre is east (not west) of Presidential
        Towers.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        difference may exist, just not a significant one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (All Saints
        Church is not located west of Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel)" making
        this a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that All Saints Church is not west of Church of Our Lady of
        Mount Carmel. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
