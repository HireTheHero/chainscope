        E Huron St (65 units east of State Street) while the Seventeenth Church is
        at 55 E Wacker Dr (55 units east of State Street). Since 55 is less than 65,
        the model concludes the Seventeenth Church is further west than St. James
        Cathedral.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether St. James Cathedral is located west of the Seventeenth

        in their locations. The model's reasoning is that since 65 E Huron St has
        a higher "E" number than 55 E Wacker Dr, St. James Cathedral is further east,
        not that they are at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that both buildings are on the
        same north-south avenue, with the courthouse being further north than the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the courthouse is not west
        of the cathedral because they are on the same north-south avenue (Orange Avenue),
        with the courthouse being further north. The model is making a directional
        distinction (north vs. west) rather than claiming the locations have equal
        east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "The Orange County Courthouse (Florida) is not located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not claim the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the courthouse is not west
        of the cathedral because they have a north-south relationship rather than
        an east-west one. The model specifically states the courthouse is north of
        the cathedral, not that they are at the same east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes: "The Orange County Courthouse is not located west of

        both buildings are on the same north-south street (Orange Avenue) and therefore
        have approximately the same east-west position. The model explicitly states
        "they have approximately the same east-west position" and "neither building
        is significantly west of the other." This indicates the model is saying NO
        because the east-west positions are essentially equal/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that the Orange County Courthouse is not west of St. James
        Cathedral, providing a definitive negative response to the comparative question.

    4fdfeab8-69de-4c60-89ed-b3143f526a23:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that both
        buildings have similar east-west positions because they are both on the same
        side (east side) of the same north-south street (Orange Avenue). The model
        explicitly states "neither would be significantly west of the other" because
        they both have odd-numbered addresses on the same street, indicating they're
        both on the east side. The model is not saying they are exactly equal, but
        rather that neither is west of the other because they're on the same side
        of the street.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        as its final answer to whether the Orange County Courthouse is located west
        of St. James Cathedral.

        question doesn't apply. The model determined that the courthouse is west of
        the cathedral, not that the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated at the
        end of its response as "YES" after its step-by-step reasoning. The model explicitly
        concludes that the courthouse is west of the cathedral based on longitude
        coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the courthouse is "slightly
        more east of St. James Cathedral, not west of it" due to the "slight northeast
        tilt" of Orange Avenue. The model specifically notes a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Orange County Courthouse
        is not located west of St. James Cathedral" as its final answer. This is an

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Rather, the model explains that the buildings
        are on the same north-south street with "primarily a north-south difference
        in their positions." The model doesn't claim the buildings are at exactly
        the same longitude or that they're identical in east-west positioning - it
        simply states that the primary difference is in their north-south positions,
        not that they have equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The answer is direct and unambiguous, stating "The Orange
        County Courthouse is not located west of St. James Cathedral."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. Instead, it explains that both buildings are on the
        same north-south street (Orange Avenue) and don't have a significant east-west
        offset. The model's reasoning is that their primary positional difference
        is north-south rather than east-west, not that they are in the exact same
        east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the question
        of whether the Orange County Courthouse is west of St. James Cathedral with
        a definitive "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model concludes NO because it determines the
        courthouse is north of the cathedral (not west of it). The model states "The
        courthouse is north of the cathedral, not west of it" and explains that both
        buildings are on the same north-south avenue with different street numbers.
        This indicates a directional difference (north vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        states "Lower Monumental Dam is positioned east of Bel Air Church, not west
        of it" as the reason for its NO answer. The model does not claim the locations
        have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lower Monumental Dam is located west of Bel Air Church. The answer
        is explicitly stated at the end of the response.
