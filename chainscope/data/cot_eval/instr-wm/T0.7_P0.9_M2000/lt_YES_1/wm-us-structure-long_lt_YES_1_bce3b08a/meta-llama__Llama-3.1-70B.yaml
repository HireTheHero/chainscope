    53da55e5-1393-471b-aa56-4a0fd2606ef2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states the Basilica is north of the Mechanic
        Theatre, indicating different positions. The NO is because one location is
        north rather than west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, based on its analysis that the Basilica is north of
        (not west of) the Mechanic Theatre.'

    8c047255-34da-478f-99cb-bd3bc08427cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Cathedral Street (where the Basilica is)
        is east of Charles Street (where the theatre was), indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

    b6975cfe-b11d-4c4c-bd95-ec1231404f6a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it specifically states that
        the Basilica is "north of" the Mechanic Theatre, indicating a different relative
        position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the westward positioning.
        The answer is definitive and based on relative positioning analysis.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Basilica is "slightly
        north" of the Mechanic Theatre, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is given because of their relative positions being different (north
        rather than west), not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        or the same. Instead, it determines that the FirstBank Southwest Tower is
        "southwest of Lake McConaughy" and therefore not directly west. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or that they are the same. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - that the FirstBank Southwest Tower is south of Lake McConaughy
        and therefore "cannot be west of it." The reason for NO is based on relative
        positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        the model determined there was a directional difference (Greensburg being
        "generally east" of the Mountaineer Wind Energy Center). Any directional difference,
        even if described as "generally" or "slightly", means we must classify this
        as False.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains this
        is because it cannot determine the relative positions without more specific

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because of the geographic
        relationship between Minnesota and Texas, stating that "Minnesota is north
        of Texas" and therefore the directional relationship requested cannot exist.
        The model identifies a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment based on its geographic
        analysis.'

    bb0f79ed-4073-409f-954e-db0fad37d9ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were determined to be equal or the same. Instead, the model
        determined that one location was northwest of the other, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was based on the fact that the relationship was
        northwest rather than purely west.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as its conclusion after analyzing the geographic positions. The NO answer
        is given as a clear comparative result based on the model''s analysis that

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but this appears to be in the
        context of "we cannot confidently say whether..." which indicates inability
        to determine rather than a comparative result. This is effectively stating
        it cannot make the determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Minneapolis is "north and somewhat
        west of Garland" and concludes NO based on this directional difference. Even
        though this might seem contradictory (being "somewhat west" but concluding
        "not west"), we must take the explicit NO answer at face value without resolving
        the inconsistency.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines Minnesota
        is east of Texas, not west. The reasoning is based on a directional difference,
        not equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - it determines
        that based on the relative positions of the locations, Cheney Reservoir is
        not west of the Judge Sebron G. Sneed House. The model actually indicates
        differences in position, noting that one is in Kansas and one is in Texas.

        or northwest" of the Judge Sebron G. Sneed House, and bases its NO answer
        on their relative geographical positions. The NO answer is not due to equal
        values.

        of the locations in Kansas and Texas. The model never claims the locations
        have equal coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude. Instead, it indicates that Cheney is "not significantly
        west of Amarillo" and is "more centrally located," giving this as the reason
        for its NO answer. Even though the difference might be small, the model notes
        a positional difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Boone
        Lake is east of Beech Fork Lake, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Boone Lake
        is east of Beech Fork Lake"), so this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (southwest rather than west). Any directional
        difference, even if described as "slight" or part of a compound direction
        like "southwest," means the values are not equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        being different (Boone Lake being east of Beech Fork Lake), not because the
        locations are the same. The model explicitly states "Boone Lake is situated
        in the northeastern part of Tennessee, which is generally east of the western
        part of West Virginia where Beech Fork Lake is located." This indicates a
        difference in position, not equality.

        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that AFI Silver is not directly west of
        The Anthem because Silver Spring is north of DC and The Anthem is in southwest
        DC. The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality of positions.

        or the same. Instead, it explains that they have a different positional relationship
        (north-south rather than east-west). The NO answer is based on this different
        positioning, not on equality of position.

        relative positions, suggesting the Eureka Inn is not west of the Carson Mansion.
        While both are in the same city, the model does not use equality as the reason

        they are at exactly the same location or longitude. The model suggests they
        are not significantly east or west of each other, but this still implies some

        Inn is not necessarily west of Carson Mansion." This is not a statement of
        equality but rather an inability to confirm the westward relationship.

        Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because the Gaiety Theatre is on
        Broadway while the Comedy Theatre is west of Broadway, indicating a difference
        in position.

        the Gaiety Theatre was northwest of the Comedy Theatre, not directly west.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("it was situated northwest"),
        not because the locations were the same. Any directional difference, even
        if described alongside other positioning details, means we should classify
        this as False.

        the theaters were in the same location. The model explicitly states that the
        Gaiety Theatre is east of the Comedy Theatre, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer was given because one theater
        was east of the other, not because they were at the same location.

        were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but this appears to be in response
        to whether it can determine the relationship, not as a comparative result.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning based on Appleton's
        northeastern location in Wisconsin and concludes it's "unlikely" and "highly
        probable" that the 222 Building is not west of Elmbrook Church. The answer
        is based on relative positions, not equality.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer,
        instead stating "it's challenging to provide a definitive answer" and explaining

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        Watson Pond is south/southwest of the theatre, not west of it. The model identifies
        a directional difference, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.

        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Marion is south of Boston, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference (being south rather than
        west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, presenting it as a definitive comparative conclusion based on

        one ("The two lakes are not directly east or west of each other, but rather
        north-south").

        "they are not directly east-west of each other." Since the NO answer is based
        on their relative positions being different (northwest vs southeast) rather
        than being equal, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.

        The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both churches are east of the
        Chicago River, it does not explicitly state they are at the same location
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. In fact, it provides different
        street addresses (29 E. Superior St vs 55 E. Wacker Dr), indicating different

        or the same. In fact, it suggests they are in different locations but states
        it cannot determine their exact relative positions without addresses. The
        NO answer appears to be based on the model's assessment that it is "unlikely"
        that one is west of the other, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While the model expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning ("we cannot provide a definitive answer"),

        that St. James Cathedral is actually east of the other church, not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states "St. James Cathedral
        is not west but rather east of the Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist."
        This indicates a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" as its conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of

        Instead, it explicitly states that St. James Cathedral is "further west along
        Chicago Avenue than Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on relative
        positioning, not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions with certainty.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "The answer is likely NO"
        which is not a definitive NO, but rather expresses uncertainty. Additionally,
        the model indicates it lacks specific address information and can only make
        assumptions. This indicates inability to make a definitive determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because both locations are on the east
        side of Chicago, not because they have identical positions. The model actually
        provides distinct addresses (65 E. Huron St. vs 55 E. Wacker Dr.) showing
        they are at different locations.

        Wacker Drive). The model notes they are at different streets, with one being
        south of the other.

        being different, not on them being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying the Steppenwolf Theatre is "to the north and slightly east of the Presidential
        Towers." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Steppenwolf Theatre is "not west but
        rather north" of Presidential Towers, indicating a different relative position
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that Steppenwolf Theatre Company is
        east of Presidential Towers. The NO is not due to the locations being equal
        or the same, but rather because they have different relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO because it determines that Steppenwolf
        Theatre is north of (not west of) Presidential Towers. The NO answer is based
        on a different relative position, not equality.

        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states they are
        in different positions, with one being south of the other. The NO answer was
        given because one location was south rather than west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        Washington DC, and the shrine is east of Rose Valley Lake, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer, stating that the Ukrainian Catholic National Shrine is "east
        or southeast of Pennsylvania" and therefore not west of Rose Valley Lake.

        (129th Street vs 115th Street) and states that All Saints Church is north
        of the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (being north rather than west), not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it found that the churches
        are at different locations (one at 60th Street and one at 116th Street), and

        - instead, it explained that All Saints Church is south of Church of Our Lady
        of Mount Carmel, and both are on the eastern side of Manhattan. The NO answer
        was based on relative positions being different, not being equal.

        both churches are on the east side of Fifth Avenue, with one being at E 60th
        St and the other at E 116th St. The model identifies distinct locations and
        bases its NO answer on their relative positions, not on them being equal or

        Saints Church is at a lower street number and is therefore south of Church
        of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
