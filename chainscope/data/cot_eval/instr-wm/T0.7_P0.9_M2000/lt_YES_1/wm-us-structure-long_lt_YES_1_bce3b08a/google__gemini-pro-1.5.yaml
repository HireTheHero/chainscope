    4694c1aa-7530-4c57-a37e-b3d2fda897fb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Basilica being west of the Theatre's location), not because the
        locations are the same. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with Cathedral Street being west of Charles Street.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and
        determining that the Basilica is west of where the Mechanic Theatre stood.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasoned that one location would be west of the other
        based on their regional locations, indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly states there is both a significant south difference
        and a slight east difference between the locations. The NO answer is based
        on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing directional reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Lake McConaughy is "much further north"
        and anything west of it would be "further north or significantly west and
        north" compared to Amarillo. The NO answer is based on these differences in
        location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.

    a087df16-5a89-48e9-b6a3-e3b90e0d5deb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at the same longitude. Instead, it indicated that
        Amarillo is "significantly east of western Nebraska" - noting a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a definitive statement that "FirstBank Southwest
        Tower is NOT west of Lake McConaughy."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on analyzing their relative
        positions, concluding that Amarillo's position relative to Lake McConaughy
        did not satisfy the comparison being tested. The response indicates there
        are actual positional differences between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and their relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model explicitly states different values for\
        \ the longitudes (83.53\xB0W vs 83.07\xB0W) and concludes NO because Davis-Besse\
        \ is further west, not because the values are equal. The values being compared\
        \ are clearly different."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes and determining that Davis-Besse is further

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in values (-83.5 vs
        -83.0) and gave NO because Davis-Besse was determined to be further west
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Davis-Besse is further west (since -83.5 is less than -83.0)

        St. Athanasius (in the Bronx) not west of the Christian Cultural Center (in
        Brooklyn). The NO answer was based on relative positions being opposite to
        what was asked, not because of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because the Bronx is described as being
        east (not west) of Brooklyn. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        on Florida's east coast running north-south would have the northern location
        being "generally on the same longitude or slightly east, not west." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality, as the basis for the NO answer.

        were equal - in fact, it explicitly stated "Tulsa is still significantly west
        of Lac qui Parle." This indicates a clear difference in position, not equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, indicating that Lac qui

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Tulsa being west of Lac qui Parle), not because the locations are at the
        same longitude. The model explicitly states "Tulsa is west of Lac qui Parle"
        as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Tulsa is west
        of Lac qui Parle (not east of it).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that "Oklahoma is considerably
        east of Minnesota" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that First Presbyterian Church
        (Tulsa) is "not west of" Lac qui Parle, MN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9213d155-0511-4c98-af74-fb70a24862e4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference, saying
        "Oklahoma is significantly west of Minnesota" and concluded that "Tulsa, OK
        is west of Lac qui Parle, MN". The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations. The answer was clear and
        definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal or the same. Rather, the model gave a different reason
        - that Oklahoma is south of Minnesota, not west of it. The model did not state
        or imply the locations were at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Tulsa, OK is not west of Lac qui Parle,
        MN. This was a clear negative comparative result, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. Instead, it determined that Burlington, VT is north
        of Bridgeport, CT, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer was
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - rather, it explains that Burlington is "almost directly north"
        of Bridgeport, not west of it. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it arrives at NO by determining that Vermont is east
        of Connecticut, making the Cathedral east (not west) of Iranistan. Since the
        NO answer is based on a directional difference rather than equality, this
        is False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Playwrights Horizons is east
        of VIA 57 West, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining that Playwrights Horizons is east of VIA 57 West. This is
        a direct NO answer to a comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it found that
        VIA 57 West (at 625) is further west than Playwrights Horizons (at 416), not
        because the locations were equal. The model explicitly identified a difference
        in their west-east positioning based on their street numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and their relative positions.

        locations are at different positions (with Playwrights Horizons being further
        east), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Playwrights Horizons is
        further east (not west) than VIA 57 West.

        indicating a directional difference. Even though it noted "west" is ambiguous,
        it still specified a directional relationship (northwest), making clear the
        locations are not in the same place.

        the values being compared were equal. Instead, it determined that "north is
        not west" - indicating they are different directions, not that they are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, determining that north
        is not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.

    fac6d857-0658-4283-9ce3-ead2c583485f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that Smithville Lake is "north
        and slightly west" of Longview Lake, showing a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    0b86dbe2-81ff-4020-9bb6-4891ec15c2fa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or identical in position. Instead, it suggests they are close but might
        be a few blocks apart, indicating some difference in position exists. The
        NO answer is based on the reasoning that the distance is too small to be meaningfully
        described as "west," not because they are in exactly the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and while it expresses some uncertainty about exact positions,
        it does make a clear determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "in the same city"
        and "cannot be significantly west of the other," it does not explicitly state
        they are at exactly the same location or longitude. The response suggests
        they are in proximity but does not declare them to be at identical positions
        as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that "Eureka Inn is slightly northeast
        of the Carson Mansion," indicating a directional difference. Even though they
        are described as "very close," any stated directional difference means this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on its analysis of the relative
        positions of the two locations.

    32d7639f-9b41-41ed-b3c9-abde766433ac:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are "very
        close together" and "only a few blocks apart," it does not explicitly state
        they are exactly equal/identical/the same in position. Being "a few blocks
        apart" actually indicates some difference in position, even if small.

        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations are close together
        ("in the same city"), it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same
        position or longitude. Instead, it suggests they might be "a few blocks apart"
        but not in a way that makes one "definitively west" of the other. Since it's
        not claiming exact equality as the reason for the NO answer, but rather insufficient
        directional difference, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests they might be a few blocks apart but
        that the difference isn't significant enough to determine a definitive west-east
        relationship. Since it acknowledges potential differences rather than stating
        equality, this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are "very
        close" and in the same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly
        equal or identical in position. Being "very close" still implies some difference,
        even if small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

    cce1940f-6399-4cd6-b59e-debd95c08712:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations are close,
        it explicitly mentions they "might have slightly different street addresses"
        and doesn't state they are exactly equal. The NO appears to be based on the
        fact that any difference would be "negligible" rather than them being exactly
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly determines that one location is east of the other (M
        Street is west of Seventh Street). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated One Madison is east of the John Golden Theatre,
        indicating different positions. The NO appears to be in response to whether
        One Madison is west of the John Golden Theatre.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that One Madison is east of the John Golden

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal - the model explicitly states that One Madison is east
        of 5th Avenue while the John Golden Theatre is west of 5th Avenue, and concludes
        that One Madison is east of the John Golden Theatre. The NO appears to be
        a direct response to the original question (likely asking if One Madison is
        west of the John Golden Theatre).

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that One Madison is
        "further east" and "*east* of" the John Golden Theatre, indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as a standalone answer. This is an explicit NO comparative
        answer based on finding One Madison to be east of the John Golden Theatre.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the locations, instead noting they are at the exact same avenue.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after considering

        be a logical error in the model's reasoning (it states the 222 Building is

        of Boston rather than directly west, and notes there is actually a slight
        western component ("slightly west overall"). Since it indicates there is some
        difference in position (even if slight) and bases its NO on directional reasoning
        rather than equality, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        a directional difference, not equality. Even though the difference is described
        as "slight," any stated difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional reason (Blackstone
        being east of Flatiron)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1bb043de-214c-4f7c-a540-eee233b2ac0d:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on discovering that
        the Blackstone Hotel and Flatiron Building are "the *same* building" and explicitly
        states "something cannot be west of itself." This equality was the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after determining that the two buildings are actually the same building.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    2cdaa330-259a-4cfd-bab0-12af6c630747:

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly determined that the Flatiron building is west of the
        Blackstone. The NO answer was based on finding a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is not applicable
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that the Blackstone Hotel is west of the
        Flatiron Building.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    5f0cf5e6-418d-4073-827a-65d5b76a8789:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the Blackstone Hotel and Flatiron
        Building are "the same building," and this equality is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer. The model concludes that because they are the same
        building, one cannot be west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that the buildings are actually the same structure, making a directional comparison
        impossible.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    741e0ee1-565c-4dba-9fcf-adb701ece3ae:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that these are "the same building"
        and explicitly uses this equality as the reason why one cannot be west of
        the other, leading to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the comparison is impossible because they are the same
        building.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the Blackstone Hotel
        being east of the Flatiron Building, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference (east vs west), so this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, making a clear comparative directional statement that the Blackstone
        Hotel is east of (not west of) the Flatiron Building.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same coordinates or equally positioned. Instead, it gives a directional
        difference, stating that New Jersey is generally west of upstate New York,
        using this as the basis for its NO answer. Even though this reasoning might
        seem counterintuitive, we must evaluate based on what was stated, not what
        is factually correct.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing it both in sentence form
        ("is not west of") and as a standalone "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explains that New Jersey (where Park Performing
        Arts Center is) is generally east of New York (where Big Pink is), and that
        West Saugerties is not an exception to this pattern. The NO answer is based
        on relative positions being different, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Big Pink is not west
        of the Park Performing Arts Center" as its final comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that the Drake Hotel (440 Park Avenue) was
        "further north" than 425 Park Avenue. The NO answer appears to be based on
        this difference in location, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in step 4, and this is given as a direct comparative result,
        not as an inability to determine or rejection of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations had equal
        longitude values. Instead, it explained that since Park Avenue runs north-south
        and the Drake Hotel was further north on the same avenue, it was not west
        of 425 Park Avenue. The NO answer was based on relative positioning, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the Drake Hotel was not west of 425 Park
        Avenue.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that the comparison of "west" is irrelevant
        because the locations are on the same street, with one being further north
        than the other. The NO answer is based on the irrelevance of the west comparison,
        not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than
        a statement about inability to determine or rejection of premises.

        Drake Hotel was north (not west) of 425 Park Avenue, indicating a different
        reason for the NO answer than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the locations
        were equal/same - it was because one location was north of the other rather
        than west. The model explicitly stated "the former Drake Hotel was north,
        not west, of 425 Park Ave."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same longitude or were equally west/east. Instead, it explained that since
        both buildings were on Park Avenue and the street numbering indicated relative
        north/south positions, one could not be west of the other. The NO answer was
        based on the buildings being on the same avenue, not because they had equal
        east/west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after explaining
        that the Drake Hotel was NOT west of 425 Park Avenue. This is a clear negative
        comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are on the
        same avenue (Park Avenue), this isn't presented as a case of equal east/west
        positions being the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the NO stems
        from the model's reasoning that since Park Avenue runs North/South, it's not
        possible for one location to be west of the other - this is a structural impossibility
        rather than an equality argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the locations and determining they cannot be west of
        each other since they are on the same avenue.

        equal in terms of east-west position. Instead, it stated they were "unlikely
        to have significant" east-west displacement, suggesting minimal but possible
        difference. The NO answer was based on this reasoning rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether the Drake Hotel was west of 425 Park Avenue.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly found that the numbers were different (440 vs
        425) and used this difference to determine relative positions, concluding
        the Drake Hotel was EAST of 425 Park Avenue.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, determining that the Drake
        Hotel was located EAST of 425 Park Avenue (not west).

        The model explicitly states there was a difference in position (north/south)
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after explaining

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal/identical
        longitudes. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that one location
        is east of the other (indicating different longitudes), with NJ being east
        of NY. Since the NO is based on a directional difference rather than equality,
        this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a clear directional difference, stating that
        the shrine is "south and slightly east" of the lake, and explicitly notes
        that "New Jersey is east of New York." The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparison question, providing directional reasoning to
        support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        longitude values. Instead, it gave a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that New Jersey is east of New York, therefore the shrine cannot be
        west of the lake. Since the NO answer was based on a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating that one location is not west of the other.
        This was a direct answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but explicitly stated there
        was a difference in position, noting that Vineland, NJ would be "considerably
        east" of the Adirondack region. The NO was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the longitudes are different
        (-85.755556 vs -85.758425) and that Actors Theatre is east of The Green Building,
        not west. The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was being

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that East Haddam is "significantly east"
        of Southampton, indicating a clear difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on the opposite relationship being true (one being east rather than
        west of the other), not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear comparative determination that

        are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Connecticut
        is east of New York). The NO is because the premise of the comparison is wrong
        (it's east, not west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        NY"). The NO answer is given because of this directional difference, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it laid out reasoning steps about relative positions
        and concluded NO. There was no mention of equal values being the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This was a clear negative response
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal/same
        longitude values. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Alice Lloyd College
        is east of the Cathedral (indicating different positions), not because they
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a comparative
        result after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating "Eastern Kentucky is further
        east than the west coast of Florida" before giving its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and their relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted a difference, stating "Eastern Kentucky is further
        east than the west coast of Florida." The NO answer was based on this difference
        in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and their relative positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Kentucky being east of Florida), not because the locations are equal or the
        same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion (that Alice Lloyd College is east, not west, of St. Petersburg).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Kentucky is east of Florida
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its reasoning that Kentucky
        is east of Florida (not due to inability to determine or equal positions)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ea0454b3-3c31-4557-a61a-300145edd857:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal - it actually stated that Kentucky is east of Florida
        and concluded Alice Lloyd College is east of the Cathedral. The NO appears
        to be a direct response to the original comparison question (likely asking
        if one was west of the other). The values are explicitly stated to be different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (southwest vs. strictly west), not on the locations being equal or identical.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative result based on Lake Accotink
        being southwest rather than strictly west of the George Bush Center.

    08b00639-9f89-4bcc-aff5-53d3aa361189:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly noted that Lake Accotink is southwest of
        the George Bush Center, and explained that since southwest isn't strictly
        west, the answer is NO. The NO was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this was a clear directional comparison response rather
        than a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Langley is "generally west
        of Springfield" and concludes that Lake Accotink is "east" of the George Bush
        Center. The NO answer appears to be based on these directional differences,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its step-by-step analysis comparing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2a34d821-0e31-4003-bb10-725e639e1b50:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it found a
        directional difference (Lake Accotink being southwest of the other location),
        not because the locations were equal. Any directional difference, even if
        slight, means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining Lake Accotink is southwest of the George Bush
        Center for Intelligence.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines that Langley is "generally west of Springfield,"
        indicating a directional difference between the locations. This difference,
        not equality, appears to be the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on the
        relative positions it determined, not a refusal or inability to answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    614ccb53-b5ac-499e-ba1c-2815c22b5b9e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Langley being north-east of Springfield), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that Lake Accotink is not west of the George
        Bush Center for Intelligence because Langley is north-east of Springfield.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    782b98ef-16b7-4882-82f8-289daa81e0c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions or that equality was the reason for its NO answer. It provided
        a logical argument about relative positions but did not mention equality or
        sameness as the basis for its NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    818ee9c0-db17-46d1-9ec9-7326015f2a2d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly noted a directional difference,
        stating that DC is south of Pennsylvania, and while acknowledging a possible
        "small sliver" overlap, maintained that DC is generally south, not west, of
        Pennsylvania
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing geographical reasoning for why one location
        is not west of the other (rather than refusing to answer or indicating inability
        to determine)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    910221bb-f200-4fe3-bd43-b1845f97d80a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions or coordinates. Instead, it laid out relative positions (one
        in DC, one in PA) and came to a NO conclusion. The model did not indicate
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    af6efbb0-10d2-455c-b926-fc4698df5f24:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or suggest that the locations
        are at equal positions. It simply states "NO" after laying out geographical
        facts. There is no mention of equal distances or positions being the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c5713f1e-6ca5-48bd-8667-9d32414fa7e3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or suggest that the locations
        are at equal positions. It simply provides some geographic facts and concludes
        NO. Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this
        should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ce5b3a0a-69bc-42e7-a358-de2b9bac8e63:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that Rose Valley Lake is "considerably
        *east*" of Washington, D.C., indicating a clear difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d8ac8300-c725-4f06-95ce-1a79d2b5708b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or suggest that the NO answer
        is due to equal values. In fact, it lists two different locations (Ukrainian
        Catholic National Shrine in DC, and Rose Valley Lake in PA) but doesn't explicitly
        compare their positions or state they are equal. The NO appears to be for
        some other unstated reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
  fe2e94cedc81a793adbd99336fdb886a435ca446d999169e3c334ca58a96cdc7:
    2462f21e-c7df-45ee-9632-a8773084c30d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer, but not because the
        locations were equal. In fact, it noted a difference in position, stating
        "Henry Street is further west than East 115th Street." The NO appears to be
        an error given the model's own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what
        was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations of the two churches.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2816293b-49f2-4aa1-9b60-ec1d83adf715:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that All Saints Church is "further
        East", indicating a difference in position. While the NO answer is clear,
        it's based on a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion, based on finding that All Saints
        Church is further East.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3225870c-2c8f-45e0-a92e-697ad930c97c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model did not claim the values were equal
        - in fact, it found them to be different
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that All Saints Church is west of Our Lady of
        Mount Carmel Church
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    4503977b-04f7-4d94-bb4b-3bf13c94fbe8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that All Saints Church in Lower Manhattan is
        west of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in East Harlem.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    55e2921e-07fd-4eab-9d1c-d51aa0a72727:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the locations were equal - it actually found them to be different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that All Saints Church is west of Our Lady of
        Mount Carmel Church.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that Henry Street is west of East 116th Street.

    99e6ff14-caf8-4d72-9fa1-0e92e1d12ae9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted both churches are on the East
        side, it did not state they were at the same location or equal positions.
        Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO answer - that All Saints is
        further south rather than west of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the locations and determining that All Saints is not
        west of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a0a1e686-bb8b-4155-a086-1cd9e2992255:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its step-by-step reasoning process.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    e4808834-85c2-45ba-9158-bd97a20f2977:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found
        a clear directional difference between the locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that All Saints is west of Our Lady of Mount
        Carmel.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    fdbf53eb-2ba6-4194-b2b8-f0b3e61b19d9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of the two churches
      final_answer: 'YES'
