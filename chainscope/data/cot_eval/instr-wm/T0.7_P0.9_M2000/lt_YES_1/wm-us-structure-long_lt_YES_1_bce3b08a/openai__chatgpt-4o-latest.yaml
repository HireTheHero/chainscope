      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it gives a specific directional difference, stating "the Basilica
        is situated to the north and slightly east of the former location of the Mechanic
        Theatre." The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs.
        west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, the
        Basilica is not west of the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre." This is a clear negative
        comparative answer.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model was asked if the Basilica is west of
        the Mechanic Theatre, and it explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that the Basilica is actually east of the Mechanic Theatre.

        are exactly equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it says "their longitude
        values will be close" and "There is no indication that Hobe Sound is significantly
        west of Miami Beach." This suggests similarity but not equality, and the reasoning
        is about lack of significant difference rather than exact equality.

        gives approximate coordinates (Baker Lake at -121.6 and Anderson Lake at -121.6

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "AFI Silver is east
        (not west) of The Anthem" - indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" because it determines that
        Silver Spring is northeast of The Wharf area, meaning it is "not west" of
        The Anthem. The model is identifying a directional difference (northeast vs.
        west), not equality.

        stating "One Madison is on the east side and John Golden Theatre is on the
        west side, One Madison is located east of John Golden Theatre." The NO answer
        appears to contradict the model's own analysis, but it's still a clear NO

        not west of Kewaunee Power Station." This indicates a directional assessment
        rather than an equality claim. The model is not saying they're at the exact
        same longitude, but rather that one is not west of the other.

        side vs. west side), indicating a clear directional difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 32 Old Slip, NY located west of Mineshaft, NY?" The model
        explains that 32 Old Slip is on the east side of Manhattan while Mineshaft
        was on the west side, concluding that "32 Old Slip is located east of Mineshaft"
        and therefore not west of it.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different parts of Manhattan, with 32 Old Slip being in the east side (Financial
        District) and Mineshaft being in the west side (Meatpacking District). The
        model concludes "32 Old Slip is east of Mineshaft" as the reason for its NO
        answer, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final answer: NO" at the

        for its NO answer, this doesn't meet the criteria for True.

        is east of the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer (not west), indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality. The model's reasoning is based on Brooklyn
        being east of Manhattan.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph
        (in Brooklyn) is east of the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer (in Manhattan) because
        Brooklyn is east of Manhattan. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that the Co-Cathedral of St.
        Joseph is likely east of the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer (stating "Brooklyn
        is generally east of Manhattan" and the Co-Cathedral is "likely east of the
        Church"). The model is giving a directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the Co-Cathedral
        of St. Joseph (Brooklyn) is located east of the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer
        (Manhattan), indicating a difference in their locations. The model's reasoning
        is based on the geographical difference between the two locations, not on
        them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is clearly marked in the response. The model provides a step-by-step
        analysis of the locations of the two churches and concludes with a definitive
        "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concluded that the Ukrainian Catholic National
        Shrine of the Holy Family is east of Rose Valley Lake (not west as presumably
        asked in the original question). The model specifically states "Washington,
        DC is southeast of Rose Valley Lake" and therefore the shrine is "east of
        Rose Valley Lake." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality of values.
