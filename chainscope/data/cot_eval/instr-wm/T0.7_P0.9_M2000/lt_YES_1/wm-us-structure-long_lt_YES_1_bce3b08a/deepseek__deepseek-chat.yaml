      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        the Basilica is east of the theatre, not west. It explicitly states a directional
        difference between the locations (one is east, one is west) rather than stating
        they are in the same location or have equal coordinates. The NO is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" after reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the Basilica is north of the theatre's
        location, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (being north rather than west), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer that the Basilica is not
        located west of the theatre.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that the Basilica is north (not west) of the Morris
        A. Mechanic Theatre. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        determining that the Basilica is north, not west, of the Morris A. Mechanic
        Theatre. This is an explicit NO comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with the Basilica being east of the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre. The NO answer
        is given because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
        the relative positions of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with the Basilica being east of the theatre. The NO answer is given because
        of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        the Basilica is north of the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference (being north rather than west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same - it actually states that the Basilica is north
        of the theatre. The NO is given because they have a different relative position
        (north/south) rather than because they are in the same location
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states that the Basilica is north
        of the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating one location is north of the other), not on the locations being equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Griffy Lake was determined to be north of Lake Monroe rather than west. The
        model identified a specific directional difference (north vs west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on directional analysis (concluding
        that Griffy Lake is north, not west, of Lake Monroe).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Griffy Lake was determined to be north of Lake Monroe, indicating a different
        relative position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly makes a directional comparison, determining that Griffy Lake is
        north of, not west of, Lake Monroe.

        or the same in position. Instead, it explicitly states that Griffy Lake is
        north of Lake Monroe, giving a different relative position as the reason for
        its NO answer. The NO is based on a different directional relationship (north),
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the westward relationship
        between the two locations.

        being equal or the same - rather, it states that Griffy Lake is north of Lake
        Monroe, indicating a clear directional difference between their positions.
        The NO is based on the lakes having different positions relative to each other,
        not on them being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result that Griffy Lake is not west

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead it explicitly notes that Griffy Lake is "slightly northwest" of
        Lake Monroe. The NO answer is given because the primary direction is described
        as north rather than west, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on directional analysis, not

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that C. J. Strike
        Reservoir is southwest of Arrowrock Dam, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on the direction being southwest rather
        than purely west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that C. J. Strike Reservoir is not located west of Arrowrock
        Dam. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        same avenue ("share the same longitudinal line"), this is not presented as
        a reason for equality but rather to explain why one is not west of the other.
        The model actually states one location is south of the other, indicating a
        difference in position. The NO answer is based on their alignment on the same
        avenue, not because they occupy the exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both buildings are on the
        same street and share the same east-west alignment, this is not presented
        as equality being the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model explains
        they are on the same north-south axis, with one being further north than the
        other. The alignment is described as shared but not as equal positions, and
        the primary reasoning is about their relative positions on the same street
        rather than being in the exact same spot.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "The Orange County Courthouse is
        not west of St. James Cathedral."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that they are on the same street but at
        different addresses (425 vs 215 N Orange Ave), with one being north of the
        other. The NO answer is given because one building is north of the other,
        not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that the courthouse is not west of the cathedral. This
        is a direct comparative answer to the question asked.

        reason given for the negative comparison.

        that the locations have equal east/west positions. Instead, it focused on
        their north/south positioning along Orange Avenue. The NO answer was based
        on directional analysis, not on the locations being at the same longitude
        or having equal east/west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that the courthouse is not located west
        of the cathedral. The model gives a definitive directional conclusion, even
        though it focuses on north/south positioning.

        The NO answer is based on directional difference (north instead of west),
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is east of the other, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO is based on one location being east rather
        than west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparative question
        directly.

    c14c2d26-4a05-4ffe-a2e1-4eb50685d2b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (the shrine is south of the lake). The NO answer is given because the shrine
        is determined to be south rather than west, not because the locations are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a clear comparative result based on its directional
        analysis.'

    02aa2f75-9857-45ed-970f-6fa06a6c63fb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or positions
        are equal. Instead, it explains that both churches are on the east side of
        Manhattan but have different address numbers (47 vs 448), and concludes NO
        because All Saints Church is not west of the other church. The NO is based
        on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" as
        its conclusion after analyzing the locations of the churches.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    25debea3-bbb1-49a8-95a9-cd4d13bca814:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "neither is significantly
        west or east of the other in a broad sense," it does not explicitly state
        they are at the exact same east-west position. The NO answer is primarily
        based on All Saints Church being further north, not on the churches having
        equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" as
        its conclusion after analyzing the locations of the churches.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6716a4cc-1b9d-4441-8bec-3c26acb54e36:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explained that both
        churches are on the east side but at different street numbers, with All Saints
        being further south. The NO answer was based on relative positions being different,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains its reasoning for why All Saints Church is not west of
        the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6c20d8cf-3c88-4cf2-a2f7-1677ff5b5e5a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: YES."
        at the end of its step-by-step reasoning.'

    8bdc7e35-982b-48d8-b180-db0306615f95:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the churches are in
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly notes differences
        in their locations, concluding that All Saints Church is south of (not west
        of) the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the churches. The answer is clear
        and definitive, making this a straightforward NO classification.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a96ff82a-2f08-4774-99d1-361794995fd8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the churches are in
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it specifically notes
        differences in their positions, stating that All Saints Church is "further
        north" and "slightly east" of the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. The
        NO answer is based on these positional differences, not on equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" as its conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the churches.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c721a1f2-851b-4996-a3fc-62c46085096a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that both churches are on the east side
        but emphasizes they are at different locations (different street numbers and
        different streets), with one being north of the other. The NO answer is given
        because one is north of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, making this a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question about westward position.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d39f4f0a-a865-4b2c-bd51-5b355629a4d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for question 2, regardless of any comparisons made in the
        analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis determining that All Saints Church is located
        west of the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.'

    f73855cb-8b86-449d-8271-28f08d7aaf07:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the classification criteria. The equal values criteria
        only apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its step-by-step reasoning, making this a clear affirmative response.'
      final_answer: 'YES'

    fead640b-1e2b-4654-a21b-cd32980f70bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        explaining that both are on the east side but at different street numbers
        (129th vs 116th). The NO answer is based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "All Saints Church is not located
        west of the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Manhattan."
