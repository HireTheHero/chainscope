      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "California is actually located
        further south than New Jersey on the latitude scale" and concludes that "95436
        in California is NOT located south of 08022 in New Jersey." The model is claiming
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked (California is further
        south, not north), not that the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

    46316ead-4e39-4cfb-b605-fe4fce3d4756:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that California is west of New Jersey, not south of it. The
        model is identifying a directional difference (west vs. south) as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that California is
        not south of New Jersey, but rather west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in their
        positions, stating "California is generally south of New Jersey" but concludes
        that 95436, CA is NOT located south of 08022, NJ. The model is giving a NO
        answer based on a directional difference, not because the locations are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating that 95436, CA is NOT located south of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - it claims
        that 95436 (CA) is actually NORTH of 08022 (NJ) because California is west
        of New Jersey. The model is making a directional comparison (west vs. east)
        and concluding that the western location is north of the eastern location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 95436, CA located south of 08022, NJ?"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 95436 is in California on
        the West Coast while 08022 is in New Jersey on the East Coast, and concludes
        that the West Coast location is not south of the East Coast location. The
        model is comparing different locations and finding them to be different, not
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating that 95436 is NOT located south of 08022.'

    7489cb83-fe47-459d-913e-b082ef7dc875:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that California is west of New
        Jersey, not south of it. The model is comparing directional relationships
        (west vs. south) rather than claiming the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, indicating that zip code 95436 is NOT south of 08022. The model
        provides a definitive comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "a location in California would be north of a location in New
        Jersey" (not equal to it). The model is claiming that 95436 is north of 08022,
        not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that 95436 is NOT located south of 08022.'

    dab2041d-d894-471b-82a1-31bdef276e73:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "California is west of New Jersey" and therefore
        "any point in California (like 95436) is NOT south of a point in New Jersey
        (like 08022)". The model is claiming a directional difference (west vs. south),
        not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 13224 (NY) is east of 98229
        (WA), indicating a directional difference. The reason for the NO answer is
        that being east means it cannot be south of WA, not because the locations
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" at the

        (CA) is actually further south than 40475 (KY)" but then contradicts itself
        in the conclusion by saying "91351 is NOT south of 40475." Despite this contradiction,
        the model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 91351, CA located south of 40475, KY?" The model clearly

        of values.

        for its NO answer, stating that "14204 is actually north of 15061" (rather
        than 15061 being south of 14204 as asked in the question). The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
