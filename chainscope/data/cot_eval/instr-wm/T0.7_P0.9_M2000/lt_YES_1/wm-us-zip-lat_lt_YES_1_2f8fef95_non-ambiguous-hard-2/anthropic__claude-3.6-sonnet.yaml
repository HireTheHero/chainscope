      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values - it actually gave a YES answer based on the latitude comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model initially gave a \"NO\" answer but then\
        \ recognized its mistake and explicitly corrected itself to \"YES\" as its\
        \ final answer. The final statement was \"YES (44094, OH is south of 98104,\
        \ WA, since 41.6\xB0N is south of 47.6\xB0N)\""

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give a NO answer because the values\
        \ being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Willoughby,\
        \ OH is at a lower latitude (41.6\xB0 N) than Seattle, WA (47.6\xB0 N), and\
        \ concludes that Willoughby is located south of Seattle. The model is noting\
        \ a difference in values, not equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so this question
        does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, 44094 (OH) is located
        south of 98104 (WA)" as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after going through its reasoning process. The answer is clearly stated at
        the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is an explicit NO response at the end of
