        I must classify this as False according to the instructions. The question
        about equal values only applies when the final answer is "NO".
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially concluded "YES" that 31206, GA
        is located south of 28602, NC. Then it mistakenly wrote "NO" but immediately
        recognized this as an error and corrected itself with "YES" as the final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is its final answer to the comparative question. This is a
        clear NO answer.

        stating "NO, 95436, CA is NOT located south of 07871, NJ." However, it then
        corrected itself and explicitly concluded with "YES, 95436, CA is located
        south of 07871, NJ." Since the final explicit answer was YES, this is the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it says they are "at similar latitudes, with the New Jersey zip code
        actually being slightly further north." This indicates a difference in values
        (the NJ zip code is slightly further north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. 95436, CA is not

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "New Hampshire is
        south of Washington state" and therefore "zip code 03303 in NH would be south
        of zip code 98229 in WA." The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (south vs. north), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that it believes the first zip code
        (03303) is not north of the second zip code (98229). The model provides a
        step-by-step reasoning process and concludes with a definitive "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Washington state
        is generally north of New Hampshire, meaning the zip codes are at different
        latitudes. The model concludes that 03303 (NH) is south of 98229 (WA), not
        that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the statement "03303 is north of 98229" is not true.

        NO), this question doesn't apply. The model did not give a clear NO answer,
        but rather contradicted itself with both NO and YES statements.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "NO - the statement is
        incorrect" but then immediately contradicts itself by saying "YES - 75024,
        TX is located south of 74104, OK." This contradiction makes the final answer
        unclear. While the model does provide a "YES" statement at the end, the presence
        of both YES and NO makes it impossible to determine which is the model's definitive
        answer.

        The model is indicating directional differences (west, slightly north), not
        equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. 85131, AZ is not
