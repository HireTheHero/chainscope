      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "New York is at a higher latitude (further
        north) than Oregon" and "14892, NY is NOT south of 97227, OR." The model is
        claiming that one location is further north than the other, not that they
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about the geographic
        positions of New York and Oregon, stating that "Even southern Oregon is significantly
        north of New York latitude-wise." This indicates a difference in values (latitudes),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "14892, NY is *NO*, not
        south of 97227, OR." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        of Oregon" and concludes that "14892, NY is likely north of 97227, OR." The
        NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning provided, but the model does
        not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        NO definitively without looking up the latitude of these two zip codes." The
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional information,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        is claiming a directional difference (NY being north of OR), not equality
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. The model concludes that "11561, NY is *not* south of 97236,
        OR" and then provides "NO" as a standalone answer at the end.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    72a78513-57ee-453a-a5ab-ba23af1362fd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it actually states the opposite - that "New
        York is still generally further north" than Oregon, indicating a difference
        in latitude. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c44b3373-9ffe-4ae0-a3d9-7a1b295f60bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "New York is generally at a higher latitude
        (further north) than Oregon." The model is saying NO because it believes NY
        is north of OR, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding that "11561, NY is NOT south of 97236, OR." This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

    f9d866eb-4ec6-41b5-8e00-8c15cdf5359a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that New York (East
        Coast) is "unlikely to be significantly south of" Oregon (West Coast), and
        that any difference in latitude would be "minimal compared to the distance
        east to west." The model is indicating there may be some difference, even
        if small, rather than stating the locations have equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fda9cd4c-05bc-4a85-b5cf-feb2e4eb3527:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "11561, NY is likely north
        of 97236, OR" and then says "NO". This suggests the model is saying "NO" because
        it believes one location is north of the other (not equal), though there appears
        to be a contradiction between its reasoning and final answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, 94706, CA is located
        south of 11967, NY" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "YES"
        at the end of its response.

    0a350c70-6219-40fb-bce7-00ff3fbf61f0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO, so this
        question does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, 44094, OH is located
        south of 98104, WA" as its final answer.

      result: 'YES'
    1a0be4f8-dddc-403e-9fd4-e68f4786a930:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Ohio is "significantly east
        and slightly south of WA" and that "44094, OH is likely at a similar latitude
        to, or even a slightly lower latitude than 98104, WA." This indicates a potential
        difference in latitude (with Ohio possibly having a lower latitude), not equality.
        The model is giving a NO answer based on geographical positioning, not because
        the values are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that it believes the statement being
        evaluated is false.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: 'Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions: "If the final answer
        was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **YES**" at the end of its response, making it clear that YES is its final
        answer.

      result: 'YES'
    67e0c301-dcaf-45ba-9633-33ea268d10c2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Ohio is in the eastern US
        and Washington is in the western US, and concludes that "A location in Ohio
        is unlikely to be significantly south of a location in Washington." This indicates
        a judgment about relative positions, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    72fcc151-6351-42d2-861d-bc0d66b44725:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it argues that Ohio is "definitively
        north of the typical latitude for Washington state" which indicates a difference
        in values (with Ohio being further north). The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model also states "44094, OH is NOT south of 98104, WA" which reinforces this
        negative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    942a05d6-ace1-41ab-b407-d5f46d6bb3a7:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "44094,
        OH and 98104, WA are at roughly similar latitudes. One is not significantly
        south of the other." This indicates the model is saying the values (latitudes)
        are approximately equal or the same, and this equality is the primary reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, after working through the comparison of latitudes
        between the two zip codes.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
