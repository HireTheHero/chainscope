      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference,
        claiming that "Kentucky is located further north than New York." This is a
        clear statement of difference, not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled with "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), according to the instructions, I must put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model provides an analysis
        of the locations of the zip codes and concludes "Based on the general location,
        40422 is located south of 10457" but does not frame this as a YES or NO answer
        to whatever the original question was. Without a clear YES/NO statement, this
        falls into the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how one could determine
        the answer, but did not actually state a conclusion about whether 40422, KY
        is south of 10457, NY. The response ends with "By comparing the locations
        on a map, you'll be able to determine if 40422, KY is located south of 10457,
        NY" without making the determination itself.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not provide any explanation for its
        "NO" answer. It doesn't state that the values being compared are equal or
        the same. It simply outlines steps to find the locations and then states "NO"
        without explaining why. Since there's no indication that the model is saying
        NO because the values are equal, I must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (find locations
        and compare them) but did not actually state a conclusion about which zip
        code is south of the other. The response ends with "By comparing the locations

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Kentucky is in the southern part
        of the US and New Jersey is in the northeastern part, then says to compare
        their locations on a map. The model does not explicitly state that the values
        are equal as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot determine if 42141, KY
        is located south of 07114, NJ without more information." This indicates the
        model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information. The model does
        not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather states it cannot determine
        the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. In fact, the model doesn't provide any
        specific reason for its NO answer. It outlines steps to solve the problem
        (find locations, map it out, compare coordinates, analyze position) but doesn't
        actually execute these steps or explain why the answer is NO. Since equality
        is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model doesn't provide detailed reasoning after stating the steps
        to solve the problem, it does clearly give "NO" as its definitive answer to

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gives a clear "NO" answer, stating
        "14892 is not located south of 97227." However, it then contradicts itself
        by saying "It is impossible to determine if 14892, NY is located south of

        and statement of inability to determine the answer means the final answer

        having equal or identical coordinates or any other values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides a step-by-step approach to determine the answer but concludes

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. The response doesn't provide
        any specific reason for the NO answer - it doesn't mention equality or any
        differences between the locations. Without any explanation about equality
        being the reason for the NO answer, I cannot classify this as being due to
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the response is brief and doesn't provide detailed reasoning, it does
        clearly give "NO" as the comparative result.

        (the model couldn't determine the comparison), this automatically results

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot determine if 95436, CA
        is located south of 07871, NJ without more information." This indicates the
        model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, which falls under

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - it claims
        that Indiana is located further north than Wisconsin, which would mean the
        locations are not equal but rather in the opposite relationship than what
        was asked. The model is not saying NO because the locations are at the same
        latitude.

        concludes "Based on the general location, 73020 is south of 10958." However,
        it does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question.
        While it makes a directional claim (that one location is south of the other),
        it doesn't frame this as a direct YES/NO answer to whatever the original question
        was.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It actually makes a directional claim, stating "73020
        is north of 10958" but then contradicts this with its final "NO" answer. The
        model does not claim the zip codes are at the same latitude or otherwise equal
        in position. The NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        The model is directly stating that 73020 is NOT north of 10958 (despite earlier

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply gives a "NO" answer without explaining why.
        The model doesn't mention that the zip codes are at the same location or latitude,
        nor does it provide any reasoning for its "NO" answer. Since equality is not
        mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" but then immediately contradicts itself by saying "39350, MS is located
        south of 27896, NC." This contradiction makes the final answer unclear. The
