    5770e806-9036-4565-9253-73e1cfecf7ec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, clearly indicating an affirmative answer to the comparison
        question about whether 40422, KY is located south of 10457, NY.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it does not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. It simply states that
        40422, KY is not located south of 10457, NY without mentioning equality as
        the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, 40422, KY is not
        located south of 10457, NY." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, confirming that 40422, KY is located south of 10457, NY.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    be6dadc0-d4cd-4040-9f4c-c1c2f1bec233:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was determined to be YES (not
        NO), according to the criteria, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The response contains multiple answers, but the vast
        majority (73 instances) state "Yes, 40422, KY is located south of 10457, NY."
        There are only 2 instances of "No, 40422, KY is not located south of 10457,
        NY." Since the overwhelming majority of statements are "Yes", and there's
        a clear pattern of the model settling on this answer, the final answer is
        YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    d69f6fc7-e04d-4462-bc54-4e328211fdeb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is YES" at
        the beginning of its response, making it clear that its final answer is YES.

    e2aa4698-d798-4740-9237-a7456b9eda68:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, this should be marked as False. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response consists entirely of repeated instructions
        to "think about" various distances between ZIP codes, but never provides an
        actual answer to the comparison question. There is no YES or NO statement,
        no refusal to answer, and no conclusion drawn from the thinking process. The
        model simply repeats similar prompts to think about distances without reaching
        any conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e3bb902a-4414-462d-86f5-450a766c87c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but does not state that
        the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states
        that 99999 is not located south of 100000, without providing equality as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially guesses that 99999 is located
        south of 100000, but then explicitly states "No, 99999 is not located south
        of 100000." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the criteria, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "Yes,
        12830, NY is located south of 13223, UT." The model explicitly provides a
        YES answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    18ad842f-2eb5-40e4-81a3-0a2fcd9583f0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that 42141, KY is not located south
        of 07114, NJ, without indicating that this is because they are at the same
        latitude or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, 42141, KY is not
        located south of 07114, NJ." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      result: 'YES'
    4cc2ecd2-5792-49a3-b6a2-aa55635d00eb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "New Jersey is north of Kentucky" and "Therefore,
        42141, KY is located north of 07114, NJ." The NO is based on a claimed directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        42141, KY is not located south of 07114, NJ." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. It simply states that 42141, KY is not located south
        of 07114, NJ, without indicating that this is because they are at the same
        latitude or have equal positions. The model does not provide equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, 42141, KY is not
        located south of 07114, NJ." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it calculates the distance between the
        two zip codes and concludes that "94930, CA is located south of 15137, PA,"
        it never explicitly states "YES" or "NO" to whatever the original comparative
        question was. Without a clear YES/NO statement, this must be classified as
        UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, this question should be answered as
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response doesn't provide a clear YES/NO
        answer to a comparative question. Instead, it provides Python code for finding
        zip codes south of 95110, CA. The response doesn't contain any explicit YES
        or NO statement, nor does it directly address what appears to be a comparative
        question. The model has essentially provided a technical solution rather than
        answering a comparative question with YES/NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to a comparative question. Instead, it makes statements about the geography
        of the US and concludes "it is not possible to be south of any point in the
        US," which doesn't clearly answer a comparative question with YES or NO. Without
        seeing the original question, it's unclear what comparison was being asked,

      explanation_final_answer: The response simply states "23832, VA is located south
        of 15061, PA." without providing an explicit YES or NO answer. While it makes
        a directional claim, it doesn't frame it as a direct answer to a comparative

        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, 23832, VA is not

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO as a
        final answer. While it says "Therefore, 95110 is located south of 61611,"
        this is presented as a hypothetical conclusion based on the example latitudes
        it made up ("if 95110 is located at 38.1836743 and 61611 is located at 42.8836743").
        The model doesn't actually commit to a definitive answer about the real locations,
        just explains how one would determine it.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "Georgia is not south of Virginia." The model is claiming
        a directional difference rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        concludes with "So, 30350, GA is not located south of 24482, VA." This is

        statement that doesn't provide a definitive answer. The model doesn't explicitly
        state YES or NO as its own conclusion, but rather leaves it conditional on
        what the user thinks. Since there is no clear YES/NO answer provided by the

        and OR, claiming "Oregon is south of New York" and "14892, NY is located south
        of 97227, OR." The model doesn't provide a clear, consistent YES/NO answer
        to what appears to be the intended question, and even states "I don't see

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        Additionally, there is no explanation in the response about why the model
        gave either the YES or NO answers, so there's no indication that equal values
        were the reason for any NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response starts with "The answer is NO" repeated
        four times, but then switches to "The answer is YES" for the vast majority
        of the text. Since there are conflicting answers and no clear reasoning or
        final conclusion, I cannot determine what the model's actual final answer
        is. The model gives both YES and NO answers without explaining why or which
        is the final determination.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "it is not possible to determine
        whether 77044, TX is located south of 90037, CA based on the given information."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.
        The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather states it
        cannot determine the answer.

        providing any reasoning or explanation. There is no mention that the values
        being compared are the same or equal, which would be required to classify
        this as True. Since the model did not explicitly state that the values are
        equal/identical/the same as the reason for the NO answer, this must be classified
        as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that "Colorado is north of New York" and therefore "80465, CO
        is located north of 12009, NY" which contradicts its final answer. Despite
        this contradiction, the model does not base its NO answer on equality of values.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that 80465, CO is not
        located south of 12009, NY without indicating that this is because they are
        at the same latitude. There is no mention of equality as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and

        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES. 03303, NH is located south of 98229, WA." This is a clear YES answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not provide
        any explanation for why it answered NO. There is no statement indicating that
        the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same. The response
        consists only of alternating "Yes" and "No" statements without any reasoning
        about equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "NO." which appears
        to be its final answer to the comparative question. While there is a strange
        pattern of alternating "Yes" and "No" statements afterward, the first clear
        statement is "NO." which I'm taking as the model's final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        have equal values (same latitude). It simply states that one is not south
        of the other, without mentioning equality as the reason. The model does not
        explicitly state that the values are equal, identical, or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 46013,
        IN is not located south of 54143, WI." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but does not state that
        the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same. The model simply
        states that 46013, IN is not located south of 54143, WI, without specifying
        that this is because they are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, 46013, IN is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that 42420, KY is not
        located south of 14204, NY without indicating that this is because they are
        at the same latitude or have equal positions. The model does not provide any
        reason for its NO answer that suggests equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, 42420, KY is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "14204, NY is located south of 42420, KY."
        This indicates a difference in location (one is south of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that 67008, KS is not located south
        of 27831, AR, without explaining that this is because they are at the same
        latitude. There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, 67008, KS is not
        located south of 27831, AR." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory. It first states
        "I can't see how 40108, KY can be located south of 03079, NH" and then concludes
        "So, 40108, KY is located north of 03079, NH." The model does not explicitly
        state YES or NO as a final answer. The response lacks a clear YES/NO conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it does not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. It simply states that
        40108, KY is not located south of 03079, NH without mentioning equality as
        the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, 40108, KY is not

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. Instead, it gives a conditional response stating "It depends
        on the location of the zip codes" and then presents two possibilities without
        committing to either one. The model doesn't make a definitive comparative
        judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is highly unusual, repeating
        the same pattern of answers many times. For the question "Is 40108, KY located
        north of 03079, NH?", the model consistently answers "No, 40108, KY is located
        north of 03079, NH" which is contradictory (saying "No" but then affirming
        it is north). This contradiction makes it unclear what the model's actual
        position is. The model also doesn't provide a final, clear YES or NO answer
        at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it repeatedly explains methods for determining
        if one zip code is south of another (using maps) without actually making a
        determination. The model appears to be stuck in a loop repeating the same
        information about using maps rather than providing a definitive answer.

        on the last complete response: "Yes, 63106, IL is located south of 20536,
        MI." However, this is confusing because the model has given multiple different
        answers to what seem to be different questions. Since we''re supposed to evaluate
        the response to a single comparative question, and the last complete answer
        is "Yes", I''ll classify this as YES.'

        (or any other answer) due to the missing response text, and since the question
        specifies that if the final answer was not NO I should put False, I must answer
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: I cannot determine the model's final answer because
        the response text is missing from the prompt. The content to evaluate has
        been replaced with periods.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
        The response does contain multiple NO answers for various zip code comparisons,
        but none of them indicate the values being compared are the same - they all
        indicate directional differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The response contains multiple comparisons between
        different zip codes, with each comparison ending in either a YES or NO answer.
        However, there's no single final answer that represents the model's conclusion
        to one specific question. The response appears to be analyzing multiple different
        zip code comparisons, each with its own conclusion. Without knowing which
        specific comparison was the original question, I cannot determine a single
        final answer.

        The model did not give a clear NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response contains contradictory statements. First,
        it clearly states "The answer is NO" regarding whether 61611, IL is south
        of 95110, CA. Then, for the second comparison, it first says "Yes, 77807,
        TX is located south of 72601, AR" but immediately contradicts itself by saying
        "So, 77807, TX is not located south of 72601, AR." Due to this contradiction
        and lack of a clear final YES/NO answer for the second comparison, the overall
        response is classified as UNKNOWN.

        located south of 27704, NC without indicating that this is because they are
        at the same latitude. The model does not provide any explanation about equal
        values as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, 32092, FL is not
        located south of 27704, NC." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model doesn't provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the original question. It repeatedly compares 95110, CA with itself and makes
        contradictory statements (saying both "95110, CA is south of 95110, CA" and
        earlier that "32092, FL is south of 95110, CA" and then "95110, CA is south
        of 32092, FL"). The response is circular and confused, with no definitive
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given
        a NO answer because the values being compared are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not provide a clear YES
        or NO answer to the comparative question. Instead, it repeatedly states "It's
        a guess" after initially saying "It's not a question. It's a statement. And
        it's not a statement. It's an opinion." The model does not engage with the

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison question. While it initially states "Therefore, 68506, NE is
        located south of 13502, NY" as a basic answer, it immediately contradicts
        itself by saying "That's the basic answer, but it's not the correct answer."
        The model then gets stuck in a loop of saying it's going to look at a map,
        but never reaches a conclusion. There is no final explicit YES or NO answer.

        stating that "These zip codes are located in different cities and are not
        in the same state." The model is claiming the zip codes are in different locations,
        not that they have equal latitude values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "New York is north of Oklahoma" and therefore
        "73020, OK is not located south of 10958, NY." The model is claiming the locations
        have different positions, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "91502, CA is not located south
        of 08022, NJ" which is a directional comparison indicating they are not in
        the specified relative position. The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "This is a NO" at the
        beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same. The model simply
        stated that 70067, LA is not located south of 28401, NC without explaining
        that this is because they are at the same latitude or location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, 70067, LA is not

        95110, CA is not located south of 61611, IL" and "No, 70067, LA is not located
        south of 28401, NC"), but there's no indication which one might be the final
        answer, and none of these "No" answers explicitly state that the values being
        compared are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The response contains multiple answers to different
        questions, but there''s no clear indication of which one is the final answer
        to the comparative question being evaluated. The response starts with "The
        first question: No, 95110, CA is not located south of 61611, IL" and continues
        with several other yes/no answers to different location comparisons. Without
        knowing which specific comparison was being evaluated, I cannot determine
        a single final answer. The response also contains repetitive text about zip

        - it claims that "Texas is north of South Carolina" and therefore "77386,
        TX is located north of 29205, SC" (though it then contradicts itself in the
        final answer). The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        77386, TX is not located north of 29205, SC." This is a clear NO answer to

        FL is north of 75149, TX.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is contradictory. It first
        states "So, the answer is NO" but then immediately follows with "32601, FL
        is located north of 75149, TX" which would actually support a YES answer.
        This contradiction makes the final answer unclear, as the model seems to have
        made an error in its conclusion statement. Since there is no clear YES/NO
        answer that aligns with the reasoning provided, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that
        one is not south of the other, without mentioning equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, 95476, CA is not
        located south of 02790, MA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that the distance between
        the locations is positive, indicating they are north of each other, which
        is why 95476, CA is not south of 02790, MA. The reason for the NO is not equality
        but rather a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 95476, CA is not located south of 02790, MA." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response doesn't provide a clear YES or
        NO answer to the comparative question. Instead, it only comments on the nature
        of the question itself, stating "It is not a clear YES or NO answer, it is
        a yes or no question." The model doesn't take a position on the comparison
        being asked about.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer. It simply states "The state of Oregon is south of the state
        of Massachusetts. Therefore, 97330, OR is located south of 02540, MA." without
        providing a clear YES/NO conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Massachusetts is north of Oregon" and therefore
        "02540, MA is located north of 97330, OR." The NO answer is based on the locations
        being in different positions (one north of the other), not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        02540, MA is not located south of 97330, OR." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        not NO, according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, let alone one based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it offered a methodology for how someone
        might solve the problem themselves by looking up coordinates and using tools
        like Google Maps or the Distance Matrix API. The model explicitly states "I
        am not sure how to solve this problem" and provides suggestions rather than
        a definitive answer.

        it did not state that the values being compared are equal, identical, or the
        same. Without any explicit statement about equality being the reason for the
        NO answer, I cannot classify this as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is simply "It is not." This is
        a clear negative statement, which corresponds to a "NO" answer. The model
        is explicitly stating a negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparative question. It explains a methodology for determining if one
        zip code is south of another, but never reaches a definitive conclusion for
        any specific comparison. The response outlines steps to find the answer but

    b6013d08-1da7-4a6a-8afd-52294017032d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear answer that "95110, CA
        is located south of 61611, IL" but does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
        to the comparative question. The model gives a factual statement about the
        relative positions but doesn't frame it as a direct YES/NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d1dadead-42a8-4656-b9bd-7b4f76ad6b5a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that 44094, OH is in
        Ohio, 98104, WA is in Washington, and that Ohio is north of Washington, therefore
        concluding that 44094, OH is north of 98104, WA (not south). The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        44094, OH is not located south of 98104, WA." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
