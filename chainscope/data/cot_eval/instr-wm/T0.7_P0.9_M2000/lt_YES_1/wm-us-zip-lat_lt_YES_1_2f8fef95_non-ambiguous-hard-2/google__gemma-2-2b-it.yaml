      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how to determine if
        one location is south of the other, but did not actually complete those steps
        or provide a conclusion. The model offered to help find coordinates but did
        not make the comparison itself.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    334dcc5b-6ad4-4a9e-9e5b-019248384cef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I can't give you a definitive
        answer without a map" and suggests that the user would need to visually compare
        the locations themselves. This indicates the model is unable to determine
        the answer with the information it has.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    772f5645-2ac7-4865-88e4-c64adb26ca74:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it gives the opposite reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Kentucky is generally to the south of New York," indicating a difference
        in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on the above, the
        answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7b1cfe7e-1d7c-4700-85d5-395eaf11e3b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's not possible to
        answer 'YES' or 'NO' definitively without using a map or tool" and indicates
        that one would need to visually compare the locations to determine the answer.
        The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO answer, and instead explains
        that it cannot make the determination without additional tools.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    98350254-a7cd-4ede-a443-921ee2062f52:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give a definitive
        YES or NO answer without a map." This indicates the model is refusing to provide
        a comparative answer because it lacks the necessary information to make the
        determination.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    b4adc27c-d000-4b4f-8d2f-9ae5b61b1158:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because it claims it cannot
        determine the relative locations without a map. The model does not claim the
        zip codes are at the same latitude or in the same location. The reason for
        the NO is lack of information to make the comparison, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b8a56c51-8558-471a-b37e-d41d3c5912f2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states that it cannot determine whether
        40422, KY is south of 10457, NY without specific location information about
        these zip codes. The model concludes by saying "Without that information,
        we can't determine whether 40422, KY is south of 10457, NY" and asks for more
        information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not make any statement about the values being equal or different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how to determine the
        answer (find locations on a map, compare latitudes and longitudes) but did
        not actually state a conclusion. The response ends with an offer to help find
        the locations, indicating the model did not complete the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d5110e57-7f04-4a55-a698-fe3692a50f48:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model couldn't determine the comparison), this automatically results
        in False for this question according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "We cannot determine with
        the information given" which indicates it cannot make the comparison without
        additional information (a map). This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the
        model indicates it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not make any statement about the values being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (find
        locations and compare them) but did not actually perform the comparison or
        state a conclusion. The response ends with "Let me know if you need help finding
        the locations" without giving a final answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

    333b895e-4e20-4890-8eb2-847497bb51c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Kentucky is in the southeast while New Jersey is in the northeast
        of the United States, implying a geographical difference rather than equality.
        The model concludes that based on these relative locations, 42141, KY is not
        south of 07114, NJ.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to the question of whether 42141, KY is located south of 07114,
        NJ.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

        and not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions
        ("If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explained how one would go about
        answering the question (by identifying locations, using maps, and comparing
        positions) but explicitly stated it "can't visually see maps or provide real-time
        location data." The model offered to explain how to find the information but
        did not actually answer the original question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but
        did not actually state a conclusion. The response ends with "Based on this,
        you can answer the question" without providing the answer itself.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give a YES or
        NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the answer without a map. This
        is a clear refusal to provide a definitive comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are the
        same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it explains the steps needed to make the comparison
        and then states "I cannot answer without knowing where 42141 and 07114 are
        on a map." This indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison due
        to lack of information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer 'YES'
        or 'NO' without a map." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a
        definitive comparative answer because it lacks the necessary information (a
        map) to make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only explained how one would go about determining
        the answer (by finding the locations on a map) but did not actually state
        a conclusion. The response ends by suggesting the user find a map to determine
        the answer themselves.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it outlined steps for how someone could determine
        the answer themselves, stating "If the coordinates of 42141, KY are south
        of 07114, NJ, the answer is YES. If not, it's NO." The model explicitly noted
        "I can't provide real-time location data or map comparisons" and suggested
        the user would need to use a map or tool to make the comparison themselves.
        Since the model did not commit to a specific comparative result, this is classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it outlined steps for how someone could figure
        out the answer themselves, but explicitly stated it "cannot access real-time
        information like geographic data" and instructed the user to "look this up
        yourself." The model did not make the comparison or provide a conclusion.

    f9afcb35-722c-4d67-ae75-3e3db7a9fdc6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It doesn't claim that the ZIP codes are at the same
        latitude. Instead, it suggests that Kentucky is not south of New Jersey (implying
        Kentucky is likely north of New Jersey, or at least not in a southern direction
        from New Jersey). Since the model is not claiming equality as the reason for
        its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" as it explicitly
        states "it's likely NO" at the end of its response. While it uses the qualifier
        "likely," it still provides a clear NO as its comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "Without the ability to access maps
        and geographic data, it is impossible to definitively answer the question."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

        are equal or the same. It actually states that "both zip codes are in different
        states" and mentions that "one is south of the other," indicating a difference
        in position. The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model doesn't provide a complete explanation of why the answer is

        for its NO answer, stating "Utah is to the north of New Mexico." This indicates
        a geographic difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        which state is south of the other" because "both states are in the Rocky Mountains."
        This is not claiming equality of position but rather an inability to determine
        the relative positions, which is different from stating they have equal values.

        are equal or the same. It simply states that "38655, MS is not south of 15683,
        PA" without indicating that they are at the same latitude or otherwise equal
        in position. The NO answer is based on the directional relationship not being
        as described in the question, not because the locations are equal or identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the zip codes or their locations) are equal, identical, or the same. Instead,
        it states that "without the ability to visually compare the locations, we
        can't definitively say if they are south of each other." This indicates uncertainty
        about the comparison rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model mentions that "we can't definitively say if they are south
        of each other" in its reasoning, it still provides a clear "NO" as its answer,
        which means it's rejecting the comparison rather than refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states "NO" based on "the geographical location
        of the states" without explaining that they are equal. In fact, it describes
        Mississippi as in the southeastern US and Pennsylvania as in the northeastern
        US, implying they are in different locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at

        they are on different sides of the US. This difference in location is the
        reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. It states "it's likely that 91356 is not located south of 61610" but
        this is presented as a probability rather than a definitive conclusion. The

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how to determine if
        one zip code is south of the other, but did not actually complete those steps
        or reach a conclusion. The model offered to help find the coordinates but
        did not provide a final comparative judgment.

        for its NO answer, stating "Colorado is generally to the west of New York"
        rather than saying they are at the same latitude. The model is comparing east-west
        positioning (longitude) rather than claiming equal north-south positioning.

        being compared are equal or the same. It simply states the answer is NO without
        providing any explanation about the relative positions of the zip codes or
        why they are not comparable. There is no mention of equality being the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it immediately
        clarifies in parentheses that "You need more information to determine this."
        This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot determine the answer
        due to insufficient information, not that the comparison is false. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot make the

        The model doesn't provide any specific reason for the NO answer beyond suggesting
        that 60651 is not south of 98021.

        not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, I can only
        give you a NO answer." However, this is not a clear comparative result. The
        model is saying NO because it cannot determine the answer without a map, not
        because it has determined a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It doesn't provide a specific reason for the NO answer
        related to equality. Instead, it mentions analyzing "relative positions" and
        looking at "which state is generally south of the other," suggesting the NO
        is based on directional differences rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        and not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions
        ("If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlines steps to determine the answer
        (locate zip codes, identify locations, compare positions) but doesn't actually
        state a conclusion about whether 46013, IN is south of 54143, WI. The response
        ends with "Based on this, you can determine if..." without making the determination
        itself.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply concludes "NO" without explaining
        that the zip codes are at the same location or have the same latitude. The
        model doesn't provide any specific reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Wisconsin is located north of Indiana." This indicates
        a difference in location (one being north of the other) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        ("I cannot determine"), this automatically results in False for this question
        according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "I cannot determine" which
        indicates it cannot make the comparison without access to a map. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model is stating it cannot verify or
        determine the answer due to lack of information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    d35fadfb-9aff-4560-8bfa-d26e1e471757:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears to
        be that both locations are in the same general region (the Midwestern United
        States). The model states "Indiana and Wisconsin are in the same general region
        of the United States" and then concludes with "NO". This suggests the equality
        of their regional location is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "46013 is north of 54143" as its reasoning for the NO answer. The model
        is making a geographical comparison rather than claiming equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explains the steps one would need
        to take to determine the answer (like using a map), but doesn't actually provide
        the conclusion. The model indicates it cannot make the determination without
        using external tools like a map.

        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not make any statement about the values being equal or different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how to determine the
        answer (locate zip codes, identify coordinates, compare them) but did not
        actually execute these steps or reach a conclusion. The response ends with
        an offer to help find a map service or provide further guidance, indicating
        the model did not complete the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it stated "I can't answer the question definitively
        without a map" and explained what information would be needed to make the
        determination. This indicates the model recognized it lacked sufficient information

        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "Since you haven't provided
        the locations, I cannot answer your question" and suggests that the user would
        need to provide location information for the model to make the determination.

        that "Without actually viewing the map, it's impossible to definitively say
        which is south of the other" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates
        inability to determine the relationship rather than equality of values.

        the values are exactly equal. Rather, it states that both zip codes are in
        the "same general region" (southeastern US), but it doesn't claim they are
        identical or exactly equal. Being in the "same general region" is not the
        same as being equal or identical.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "11767, NY is likely located north of 54180, WI" as the reason for its
        NO answer. This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that it doesn't have
        specific coordinates to make the determination. The reason for the NO is lack
        of information, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it mentions not having specific coordinates, it provides a clear "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the zip code 73020 in New Jersey is likely not located south of 10958
        in New York based on the geographical relationship between the two states.
        The model is making a directional comparison, not claiming equality.

        different hemisphere and far from 10958, NY" which indicates a difference
        in location, not equality. The NO answer is based on this difference in location.

        the NO answer beyond stating that one needs to determine which state is further
        south. The model doesn't explicitly say the zip codes are at the same latitude
        or equally south.

        Virginia and 01604 is in Massachusetts, but doesn't explicitly state they
        are equal or the same. The model simply concludes "NO" without explaining
        that the values are equal as the reason for this answer.

        stating "West Virginia is generally north of Massachusetts" and concludes
        that "26301 is not located south of 01604." The model is claiming a directional
        difference (north vs. south) rather than equality.

        - that West Virginia is in the southern part of the country while Massachusetts
        is in the northeastern part, implying a different geographical relationship
        than the one asked about in the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the relative geographical
        positions of Massachusetts and Oregon. It doesn't claim the zip codes represent
        the same location or equal values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I need to see a map to determine this" and notes that
        "Without using a map, it's impossible to give a definitive answer." This indicates

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "You'll need to use a map
        to determine this" without making a definitive statement about the relative

        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it says "both are in the southern
        US" and "we can assume they are in the same general region." Being in the
        "same general region" is not the same as being equal or identical. The model
        is noting a similarity in their regional classification, not stating they
        have equal values.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "NO" after claiming to
        analyze a map, but doesn't provide any reason for the NO answer, such as the
        zip codes being at the same latitude. There's no indication that the model
        is saying NO because the locations are at the same latitude.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference,
        stating "Texas is generally north of Arizona" as the reason for its NO answer.
        This indicates a perceived difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, indicating that it believes 98104, WA is south of 44094,
        OH.'

    59baf88c-2df0-48ec-9e1c-d3fd1719f46f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        because no clear answer was provided), the answer to this question must be
        False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. The response ends after "**Answer:**" without actually stating
        a conclusion. The model set up a reasoning framework but never completed the
        comparison or provided a final determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    5cec0ca4-b5f4-43ab-98ce-752d2981c949:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot definitively answer if
        44094, OH is south of 98104, WA" and suggests using a mapping tool to get
        the answer. The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather
        indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of access to location
        data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7d5c0b1c-2102-4d27-ba3f-e3f6923e0264:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific reason for the NO answer:
        "Ohio is in the midwest, and Washington is on the West Coast. Ohio is generally
        north of Washington." The model is noting differences in location, not equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.

    992fba99-9445-441b-acdf-9f82bd743070:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating "Ohio is generally
        further north than Washington" as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        is claiming there is a directional difference between the locations, not that
        they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides a clear, direct "NO" at the end of its response after its reasoning.

    bb0c99ed-d10d-4feb-a895-5f851d8900cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        "Ohio is generally located to the south of Washington" as the reason for its
        NO answer. This indicates the model believes there is a difference in the
        locations, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "Therefore, the answer
        is likely NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question, even
        though it's qualified with "likely".

    be67639f-30ed-4b97-8347-dea56a0b8fa4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN,
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "You'll need to physically
        see the map to answer this definitively," indicating it cannot determine the
        answer without additional information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison without more information.

        and not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how one could determine
        the answer (identify locations, use a map, determine relative position) but
        did not actually state a conclusion. The model ended by offering to help visualize
        the comparison rather than providing a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes differences, specifically that "Washington
        is further west than Ohio." The model does not claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
