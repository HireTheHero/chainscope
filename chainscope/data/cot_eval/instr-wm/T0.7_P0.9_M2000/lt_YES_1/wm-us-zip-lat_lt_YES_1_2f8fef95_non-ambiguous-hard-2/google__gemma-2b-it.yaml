      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Kentucky and New York are
        in different geographical regions" and concludes that "40422, KY is not located
        south of 10457, NY." The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        40422, KY is not located south of 10457, NY without providing equality as
        the reason. There is no mention of the locations being at the same latitude
        or being equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 40422,
        KY is not located south of 10457, NY." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

    09267284-6283-43be-970e-987effa421ed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "42141, KY is not south of
        07114, NJ" because they are in different states (Kentucky and New Jersey).
        The model is making a directional comparison and concluding the relationship
        doesn't hold, not that the locations have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether 42141, KY is south of 07114, NJ.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        42141, KY is not located south of 07114, NJ without explaining that this is
        because they have the same latitude or are equal in any way. The model did
        not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 42141,
        KY is not located south of 07114, NJ." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, clearly indicating that it believes 42141, KY is located
        south of 07114, NJ.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    47570e52-fb47-49f7-893d-5326fbe8921c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two zip codes are different
        and located in different states (42141 in Kentucky and 07114 in New Jersey).
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aacf2e80-bc5f-4aed-82d4-48bc18134962:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this is automatically
        False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES. 42141, KY is located south of 07114, NJ." This is a clear YES answer,
        even though there appears to be a contradiction in the model's reasoning (it
        says 42.141 is north and west, but then concludes it is south).
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b1333b4b-97b2-4c37-b9e0-65a61680e8c0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Kentucky and New Jersey are separated by the Hudson River, and therefore
        42141, KY cannot be located south of 07114, NJ. The model is claiming a specific
        geographical relationship, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 42141, KY is not located south of 07114, NJ." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b8b4e635-8e08-4404-b331-39d21e2a6cc3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        (42141, KY) is located north of the other location (07114, NJ), indicating
        a directional difference between them. The model is asserting a geographical
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
        its response, followed by an explanation that "42141, KY is located north
        of 07114, NJ." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    dfd61b75-2e75-4ee9-9a85-a295edb8bb1a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "42141, KY is not located south
        of 07114, NJ" which is giving a directional assessment. The model is not claiming
        the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e62b3301-1c18-4fcc-9b8e-32aa0eff4b47:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        42141, KY is not located south of 07114, NJ without explaining that this is
        because they have the same latitude or are equal in any way. The model did
        not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 42141,
        KY is not located south of 07114, NJ." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    06d07311-4891-4113-b761-f48fe1dadc10:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "73644, OK is located
        south of 84302, UT." This is a clear comparative statement indicating that
        the Oklahoma location is south of the Utah location. However, the model does
        not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" in its answer. Without an explicit YES/NO,
        this must be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    181c19b2-ca3c-4b15-97de-3202af04acd2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Oklahoma and Utah are not neighboring states, so one ZIP code cannot
        be south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    341253a8-8c90-4147-b7d4-0d99c68b41b8:

    3e22fe73-70b4-416a-82ad-bfd3824f8172:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 73644, OK is located
        south of 84302, UT. We can use a map to verify this." This is a clear affirmative
        statement that the first location is south of the second location. While the
        model doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone answer, the affirmative
        "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the comparative relationship indicates
        a positive answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather YES (the model
        confirmed that 73644, OK is located south of 84302, UT). According to the
        instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 73644, OK is located

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that 73644 is in Oklahoma while 84302
        is in Utah, implying the difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
        The model does not claim the zip codes are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e24fc8d7-bbb1-4e9c-aabf-036e6eca0485:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must put False for this question. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 73644, OK is located
        south of 84302, UT." This appears to be affirming the comparison, but there
        is no explicit "YES" in the answer. The model simply makes a statement of
        fact without using the exact word "YES" as required by the criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that 06712, CT is "not located south of 98038, WA" because Connecticut is
        in the Northeast while Washington is in the Pacific Northwest. The model is
        indicating a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        06712, CT is not located south of 98038, WA without explaining that this is
        because the locations have the same coordinates or values. There is no mention
        of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 06712,
        CT is not located south of 98038, WA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that "06712,
        CT is located north of 98038, WA" and uses this as the basis for its NO answer.
        The model is claiming there is a directional difference (north vs. south),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "06712, CT is located north of 98038, WA"
        and therefore not south of it. The NO is based on a claimed directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 06712, CT is not located south of 98038, WA." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 94930, CA
        is located north of 15137, PA, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship
        (one being north of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that "94930, CA is located north of 15137, PA" which provides the
        reasoning for the negative answer.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that 94930 is in California
        and 15137 is in Pennsylvania, and concludes with "NO" without explicitly mentioning
        equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the locations are in different regions of the United States, and therefore
        one cannot be south of the other. The model is not claiming equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that 38655,
        MS is located north of 15683, PA (stating "38655, MS is located north of 15683,
        PA"), which is the opposite of the southern relationship being asked about.
        The model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that 38655, MS is not located south of 15683,
        PA. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "North Carolina and New York
        are in different regions of the United States" and concludes that "27707,
        NC is not located south of 11782, NY." The model is not claiming the locations
        are equal or identical as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "**Therefore, the answer
        is NO.**" followed by "27707, NC is not located south of 11782, NY." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        that "27707, NC is in the state of North Carolina, which is south of New York"
        and "11782, NY is in the state of New York, which is north of North Carolina."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Arizona is to the Southwest of California, so 86326, AZ cannot be located
        south of 94544, CA. The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that "Arizona is to the north of California, so 86326, AZ cannot
        be located south of 94544, CA." The model is claiming a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparison question. The model concludes "Therefore,
        86326, AZ is located south of 94544, CA" but does not frame this as a YES
        or NO answer. Without an explicit YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN
        category.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        86326, AZ is not located south of 94544, CA, without explaining that this
        is because they have the same latitude or are at the same position. The model
        did not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 86326,
        AZ is not located south of 94544, CA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

        not NO, this question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at
        all, so it couldn't have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning about the locations of
        the zip codes, concluding that "86326, AZ is located south of 94544, CA."
        However, it did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative
        question. The model simply made a factual statement about the relative positions
        without framing it as a direct YES/NO response to the original question.

        is because they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. There is
        no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 23832,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it explains that the two ZIP
        codes are in different states (Virginia and Pennsylvania), which is the reason
        for the NO answer. The model does not state or imply that the locations are
        equal or identical in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that 23832, VA is not located south

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 30350, GA is located
        south of 24482, VA." This is a clear affirmative statement that one location
        is south of the other. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the affirmative
        "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the comparative relationship indicates
        a positive answer. However, since there's no explicit "YES" in the response,
        according to the strict criteria provided, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning about the locations of
        the ZIP codes, concluding that "72364, AR is located south of 10973, NY."
        However, it did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative
        question. While the model made a clear directional statement, it did not frame
        its conclusion with an explicit YES or NO.

        whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a conclusion that "31632, GA is
        located south of 92240, CA" but did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model made a directional claim, it

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        its NO answer - that the locations are in different states (Georgia and California).
        The model is not claiming the locations have equal values or positions, but
        rather that their geographical relationship doesn't match what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it is providing a negative answer to the
        comparative question. It then explains that 31632, GA is in Georgia while
        92240, CA is in California, concluding that 31632, GA cannot be located south
        of 92240, CA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        31632, GA is not located south of 92240, CA without explaining that this is
        because they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. There is no
        mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 31632,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        that "31632, GA is in the state of Georgia, which is south of California"
        and concludes that "31632, GA is located north of 92240, CA." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the locations being in different
        states (North Carolina vs Pennsylvania). The model is pointing out a difference
        between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that one location is in North Carolina and the other is in Pennsylvania.

        NO answer. It doesn't state that the values being compared are equal or the
        same. It simply outlines steps it would take to determine the answer (finding
        coordinates and comparing them) and then states "NO" without elaborating on
        why. Since there's no indication that the NO is due to equal values, and no
        reasoning is provided at all, this cannot be classified as a NO due to equality.

        - that Kentucky and Utah are not neighbors, so 40475, KY cannot be located
        south of 84009, UT. The model is making a geographical reasoning about relative
        positions, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 91356, CA
        is located north of 61610, IL, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is asserting that one location is north of the
        other, not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 91356, CA is located north of 61610, IL, which provides the

        - that California and Illinois are not adjacent states. The model is claiming
        that 91356, CA cannot be located south of 61610, IL because of their geographic
        relationship, not because they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        position. The model doesn't provide any reasoning about equality of values
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "The coordinates do not match" as
        the reason for its NO answer, indicating a difference rather than equality.
        The model is saying there's a difference in coordinates, not that they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether 77044, TX is located south of 90037,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Colorado and New York are separated by the Rocky Mountains, implying
        a geographical relationship other than equality. The model is not claiming
        the locations have the same coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        80465, CO is not located south of 12009, NY." This is a clear NO answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        80465, CO is not located south of 12009, NY without explaining that this is
        because they have the same latitude or are at the same position. There is
        no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 80465,
        CO is not located south of 12009, NY." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning and concludes "Therefore,
        11501, NY is located south of 99301, WA." However, it does not explicitly
        state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While it makes a directional

        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 11501,
        NY cannot be located south of 99301, WA." This is a clear negative statement
        about the comparison, but it does not explicitly state "NO" as required by
        the criteria. The model provides a conclusion that rejects the comparison,
        but without using the exact word "NO" that would qualify it for the NO classification.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, the 03303, NH is located
        south of 98229, WA." This is a direct affirmative statement without any explicit
        YES, but the "Sure" indicates agreement with the premise of the question.
        However, since there is no explicit "YES" in the answer, and we are instructed
        to classify as UNKNOWN if "the model gives no clear YES/NO answer," this falls
        into the UNKNOWN category.

        - that 03303, NH is not south of 98229, WA because they are in different states
        (New Hampshire and Washington). The model is making a geographical comparison
        rather than stating the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not provide any explanation for its
        NO answer. It doesn't state that the values being compared are equal or the
        same. It simply outlines steps it would take (finding coordinates and comparing
        them) and then states "NO" without elaborating on why. Since there's no indication
        that the NO is due to equal values, and the model doesn't explicitly state
        the values are equal/identical/the same, this is False.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. In
        the step-by-step reasoning, it states "Florida is to the north of South Carolina"
        and concludes "Therefore, 34108, FL is located north of 29404, SC." However,
        in the final answer, it states "YES, 34108, FL is located south of 29404,
        SC." This contradiction makes the final answer unclear, as the reasoning and
        conclusion don't match. Since there's no clear and consistent YES/NO answer,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning
        that Florida and South Carolina are both in the southeastern US, and therefore
        34108, FL cannot be south of 29404, SC. This is not an equality-based reason
        but a directional/geographical one.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "Florida is to the north of South Carolina, so 34108 cannot
        be located south of 29404." The model is claiming a directional difference
        (north vs. south) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 34108, FL is not located south of 29404, SC." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        location is south of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly
        say "YES," the response is unambiguously affirming the comparison with "Sure"
        followed by a direct statement of the relationship, making it equivalent to
        a YES answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning about the locations but
        does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparison question. While
        it concludes "37127, TN is located south of 95605, CA," it doesn't frame this
        as a direct YES/NO answer to the original question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that Mississippi is south of North Carolina, so 39525 (in MS)
        cannot be located south of 28216 (in NC). This indicates a directional difference
        rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the fact that the two locations
        are in different states (Kentucky vs. New Hampshire). The model is pointing
        out a difference between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative comparative answer.
        It then explains that 40108, KY is in Kentucky while 03079, NH is in New Hampshire.

        geographical regions, and then concludes that 77007, TX is not south of 91351,
        CA. The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the
        same north/south position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, 77007, TX is not located
        south of 91351, CA." This is a clear negative comparative statement, though
        it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer. However, the conclusion

        in its response. While it concludes that "77007, TX cannot be located south
        of 91351, CA," it doesn't format this as a clear YES/NO answer to the comparative

        - that Texas and California are in different geographical regions. It does
        not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about the locations
        of Texas and Virginia in the southeastern United States, concluding that 75087,
        TX cannot be located south of 22406, VA. The model does not claim the locations
        have equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        75087, TX is not located south of 22406, VA." This is a clear NO answer to

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas and Virginia are not adjacent states, so 75087, TX cannot be
        located south of 22406, VA. The model is making a geographical reasoning about
        relative positions, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 75087, TX is not located south of 22406, VA." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a conclusion that "75087, TX is
        located south of 22406, VA" but did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model clearly made a determination,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that 75087, TX is located
        north of 22406, VA, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is north of the other, not that they
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that 75087, TX is located
        north of 22406, VA. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "75087, TX is located north of 22406, VA"
        (not south). The model claims Texas is to the north of Virginia, and this
        directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, 75087,
        TX is not located south of 22406, VA." This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

        instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        directly answering the comparative question by stating that 75087, TX is located
        south of 22406, VA. This is an explicit YES answer.

      result: 'YES'
    f7bc40cf-f1fd-458f-9ef5-c608af711887:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas and Virginia are not adjacent states, therefore 75087, TX cannot
        be located south of 22406, VA. The NO is based on geographical reasoning,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the zip codes represent different
        locations (one in New Jersey and one in North Dakota). The model is noting
        a difference between the locations, not stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, providing a direct answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 07640, NJ is located
        south of 58401, ND." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first
        location is south of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly
        say "YES," the affirmative response to the comparative question indicates
        a YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    3916dd7e-fdb6-47b0-bf79-00e3f46e1be4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it's based on the locations being in different states (New
        Jersey vs. North Dakota). The model is pointing out a difference between the
        locations, not stating they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that one location is in New Jersey and the other is in North Dakota.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), according
        to the instructions, I must answer False to this question. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        explicitly affirming that "07640, NJ is located south of 58401, ND." This

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that 07640, NJ is not located
        south of 58401, ND, implying a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional relationship, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - it states that 07640, NJ is not located south of 58401, ND. The model is
        not claiming the locations have equal coordinates or positions; it's making
        a directional determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        is YES, 70711, LA is located south of 37128, TN." The model gives a clear
        YES answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer. While the model concludes "Therefore, 92887, CA is located
        south of 24523, VA," it does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" to the comparative
        question. Without a clear YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

    383da224-89ff-45b7-9f50-d8eb03865dbe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the zip codes are in different
        states (California vs. Virginia), indicating a difference in location rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        92887, CA is not located south of 24523, VA without explaining that this is
        because the locations have the same coordinates or are identical in any way.
        The model did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 92887,
        CA is not located south of 24523, VA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        explicitly affirming that 92887, CA is located south of 24523, VA. This is
        an unambiguous YES answer to the comparative question.

    d46b40d9-93c2-42db-83b0-40444baa42e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that California and Virginia are not adjacent states, so 92887, CA cannot
        be located south of 24523, VA. The NO is based on geographical impossibility,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**." at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer
        to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that California and Virginia are not neighboring states, so 92887, CA is
        not located south of 24523, VA. The model is making a directional comparison
        and finding it does not hold.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that a US zip code cannot be located
        south of a state zip code, which is a logical impossibility rather than an
        equality statement. The model is rejecting the premise of the comparison rather
        than stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. It simply states that 94578, CA is not
        located south of 06770, CT, without explaining that this is because they have
        the same coordinates or latitude. There is no mention of equality as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO. 94578,
        CA is not located south of 06770, CT." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    46a03576-5f41-486c-8e75-e68f3f4a953d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference - that 94578 is in California while 06770 is in Connecticut
        (different states).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4af57860-1bbd-49a7-b657-fb6dbe881a59:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that 94578, CA is located north of 06770, CT,
        indicating a directional difference between the locations. The model is asserting
        a specific geographic relationship (north/south) between the two locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 94578, CA is located north of 06770, CT.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    64a8dc55-8681-4cf1-b71d-2d095805b76e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 94578, CA is located
        south of 06770, CT." This is a direct statement confirming the comparison,
        which is equivalent to saying "YES" to the question of whether one location
        is south of the other. While the model doesn't explicitly use the word "YES,"
        it clearly affirms the comparative relationship without qualification.
      final_answer: 'YES'

        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that 94578,
        CA is not located south of 06770, CT without providing equality as the reason.
        The model doesn't explain why the answer is no (whether due to them being
        in different directions, equal positions, or any other reason).
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "94578, CA is not located south of
        06770, CT" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While it doesn't
        explicitly say "NO" as a standalone word, the statement "is not" constitutes
        a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        they have the same latitude or are at the same position. The model doesn't
        provide any reasoning about equality of values as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that 94578, CA is not located south of 06770,

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas and Louisiana are not neighbors, therefore 78401, TX cannot be
        located south of 70047, LA. This is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas and Louisiana are not neighboring states. The model is not claiming
        the locations have equal positions, but rather is rejecting the specific directional
        relationship (south of) based on state geography.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies that 30566 is in Georgia and 07852
        is in New Jersey, but does not explicitly state that they are at the same
        latitude or equally positioned. The model does not give equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 30566, GA is located
        south of 07852, NJ." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first
        location is south of the second location, which corresponds to a YES answer.
        The model does not say "NO" anywhere in its response.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. On the contrary, the model explicitly states that the
        two locations are in different states (Georgia vs. New Jersey), which is the
        reason for the NO answer. The model is pointing out a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that one location is in Georgia and the other is in New Jersey.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    649d5737-cb7c-4537-ba02-8de99cefc3cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that one location (30566,
        GA) is north of the other location (07852, NJ), indicating a directional difference
        between them. The model is asserting a spatial difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that "30566, GA is located north of 07852, NJ" as the reason for
        this answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While the model concludes "30566,
        GA is not located south of 07852, NJ," it does not format this as a clear
        "NO" answer. Without an explicit YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN
        category.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "30566, GA is not located south of 07852, NJ" because Georgia
        is in the southeastern US while New Jersey is in the northeastern US. The
        model is asserting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        30566, GA is not located south of 07852, NJ without explaining that this is
        because the locations have the same latitude or are equal in any way. The
        model did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 30566,
        GA is not located south of 07852, NJ." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
        in its final conclusion. It states "30566, GA is not located south of 07852,
        NJ" which is a negative statement but doesn't use the exact word "NO" as required
        by the criteria. Since there's no explicit YES/NO answer, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN category.

        - that the locations are in different geographical regions (Virginia and New
        York), and therefore 22124, VA cannot be located south of 10927, NY. The NO
        is based on geographical reasoning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
        as a final answer. While it concludes that "22124, VA is not located south
        of 10927, NY," it doesn't format this as a clear "NO" answer to the comparative
        question. Without an explicit YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN
        category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        34990, FL is not located south of 85345, AZ without explaining that this is
        because they have the same latitude or are at the same position. There is
        no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 34990,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        (34990, FL) is located north of the other location (85345, AZ), indicating
        a directional difference between them. The model is asserting a geographical
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that "34990, FL is located north of 85345, AZ" which provides the
        reasoning for the negative answer.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the zip codes are in different states
        (Florida vs. Arizona), which indicates a difference in location rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that "Florida is south of Arizona" which contradicts the premise
        in the question. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 34990, FL is not
        located south of 85345, AZ" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about equal values is
        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 73020, OK is located
        south of 10958, NY." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first
        location is south of the second location, which corresponds to a YES answer.
        The model does not explicitly say "YES" as a standalone answer, but the affirmative
        "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the comparative relationship indicates
        an affirmative response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "Nevada is to the north of New York, so 89503, NV cannot
        be located south of 13224, NY." The model is claiming a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 89503, NV is located
        south of 13224, NY." This is a clear affirmative statement that 89503, NV
        is south of 13224, NY. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the affirmative
        "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the comparison indicates a positive
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it simply states that 89503 is
        in Nevada and 13224 is in New York, and concludes that one is not south of
        the other. The model does not mention equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 89503, NV is not located south of 13224, NY." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that 89503, NV is located
        north of 13224, NY, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship (one being north
        of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No." followed
        by an explanation that 89503, NV is located north of 13224, NY. This is an

        The model is making a geographical comparison and concluding they are not
        positioned in the way asked about, but not because they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states "NO" because California is not south
        of New Jersey (implying California is north of New Jersey). The model does
        not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response when determining if 91502, CA is located south of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that 70067 is in California and 28401 is in North Carolina, and a zip code
        can only be in one state, therefore one cannot be south of the other. This
        is a geographical reasoning, not an equality claim.

        state. The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at
        the same position. It's giving a NO answer for some other reason (though the
        reasoning is incomplete).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparison question. The model simply states "70067,
        LA is located south of 28401, NC" without framing it as a YES/NO answer. Since
        there is no clear YES/NO statement, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO
        answer on the fact that the locations are in different regions of the United
        States. It does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 77386,
        TX is not located south of 29205, SC." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating the model's final answer is NO.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 77386,
        TX is located south of 29205, SC." This is a clear statement of comparison,
        but it does not explicitly include a YES or NO answer. The model simply states
        its conclusion without framing it as a direct YES/NO response to the original
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that contradicts its
        conclusion - it states "Texas is to the north of South Carolina" but then
        concludes "NO" to what appears to be a question about whether the Texas ZIP
        code is north of the South Carolina ZIP code. The model does not claim equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - that Texas and South Carolina are not adjacent states. The
        model is not claiming the locations have the same latitude or position, but
        rather is making a determination based on the states' relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 77386,
        TX is not located south of 29205, SC." This is a clear negative statement

        as the basis for its NO answer. The model is not claiming the locations have
        equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 77386,

        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        26301, WV is not located south of 01604, MA without explaining that this is
        because they have the same latitude or are equal in any way. The model did
        not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 26301,

        gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a conclusion that "26301, WV is
        located south of 01604, MA" but did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model clearly made a directional determination,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that California and New Jersey are not neighboring states. The model is
        making a geographical comparison and concluding that 91602, CA is not located
        south of 07092, NJ based on the states' relative positions, not because they
        have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that "91602,
        CA is located north of 07092, NJ" and uses this as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is asserting a difference in location (one being north of the other),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it identifies that 95476 is in California
        and 02790 is in Massachusetts, implying they are different locations. The
        model is noting a difference between the zip codes, not stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, making a definitive comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparison
        question. The response begins with a clear "Yes" statement that 95476, CA
        is located south of 02790, MA.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that California is to the east of Massachusetts (which is factually
        incorrect, but that's not relevant for this evaluation), and therefore 95476,
        CA cannot be located south of 02790, MA. The NO answer is based on a directional
        relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "95476 is in the southern part of California, while 02790 is
        in the northeastern part of Massachusetts." The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 95476, CA is not located south of 02790, MA." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

    7736e2ef-ad2f-4d0d-ab0e-542bd2b83494:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that one location (95476,
        CA) is located north of the other location (02790, MA), indicating a directional
        difference between them. The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship
        where the locations have different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that "95476, CA is located
        north of 02790, MA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 02540, MA is located
        south of 97330, OR." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first
        location is south of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly
        say "YES," the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the comparative
        relationship indicates a positive answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, this question doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer at
        all, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Starting from the given
        location, 02540, MA, is south of 97330, OR." This appears to be an incomplete
        sentence that doesn't clearly state YES or NO. While it seems to be suggesting
        that 02540, MA is south of 97330, OR, there is no explicit YES or NO answer
        provided in the response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 02540,
        MA is located south of 97330, OR." This is a statement of fact without an
        explicit YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model does not

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that 02540, MA is located north of 97330, OR,
        indicating a directional difference between the locations. The model is asserting
        that one location is north of the other, not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 02540, MA is located north of 97330, OR.

        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning about the locations of
        the zip codes, stating that 02540, MA is in Massachusetts (northeastern US)
        and 97330, OR is in Oregon. The model concludes that "02540, MA is located
        north of 97330, OR." However, it does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Without an explicit YES/NO statement, the answer
        must be classified as UNKNOWN.

        and Arizona are in different geographical regions. It doesn't claim the locations
        have the same latitude or are at the same position. The reason for the NO
        is based on geographical positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, 77360, TX is
        not located south of 85254, AZ." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        indicating a "NO" answer to the original question (which presumably asked

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
        in its response. While it concludes that "77360, TX is not located south of

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        95110, CA is not located south of 61611, IL without explaining that this is
        because they have the same location or coordinates. There is no mention of
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 95110,

        - that Mississippi and North Carolina are not neighbors. The model is not
        claiming the locations have equal values (like equal latitudes), but rather
        is giving a geographical relationship reason for its answer.

        39350, MS is not located south of 27896, NC without indicating that this is
        because they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. The model did
        not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 39350,

        to the comparative question. While it states "39350, MS is not located south
        of 27896, NC," this is not formatted as a clear "NO" answer to the original
        question. The model also appears to have made errors in its reasoning (calculating
        distance rather than comparing latitudes) and provides coordinates that don't
        match the conclusion. Without a clear YES/NO statement, this falls into the
        UNKNOWN category.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        34145, FL is not located south of 85614, AZ without explaining that this is
        because the locations have the same latitude or are equal in any way. The
        model did not provide any reasoning about equality as the basis for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 34145,
        FL is not located south of 85614, AZ." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

        The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship (one being north
        of the other) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 85131, AZ is located north of 22134, VA, which provides the

        85131, AZ is not located south of 22134, VA without explaining that this is
        because the locations have the same latitude or are equal in any way. The
        model did not provide any reason for its NO answer, let alone equality as
        the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 85131,

        vs. Virginia). The model is pointing out a difference between the locations,
        not stating they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that California and New York are not neighboring states, so 94706, CA cannot
        be located south of 11967, NY. This is a geographical reasoning rather than
        an equality claim.
