        York is northeast of Colorado). The NO answer was not given because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its

        concludes that "12009, NY is north of 80465, CO" which would mean that 80465,

        in the model's reasoning, as it first concludes that "Vermont is generally
        north of Ohio" and that "05201, VT is likely located north of 43950, OH" which
        would logically mean that 43950, OH IS south of 05201, VT (which would be
        a YES answer). However, I'm only evaluating what the model explicitly stated

        would be north of any location in Ohio." This implies that 43950, OH is NOT

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gave a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Wisconsin is generally north of Indiana" and "any location in
        Wisconsin would be north of any location in Indiana." This implies that 46013,
        IN would be south of 54143, WI, not equal to it. The model is actually giving
        a contradictory reasoning for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is "NO" to the question
        of whether 46013, IN is located south of 54143, WI. The model explicitly states
        "Therefore, the answer to whether 46013, IN is located south of 54143, WI

    d648999e-ce40-4b1a-bb54-8757c2e6fce1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on geographic
        positioning, stating that "Wisconsin is north of Indiana." The model did not
        claim the locations have equal coordinates or are the same place - it actually
        established they are in different states. The NO answer appears to be based
        on directional comparison, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" to the question of
        whether 46013, IN is located south of 54143, WI. However, this appears to
        be a mistake in the model's reasoning, as it first correctly establishes that
        Wisconsin is north of Indiana, which would logically mean Indiana is south
        of Wisconsin. Despite this correct reasoning, it concludes with "NO" which
        contradicts its own analysis.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on the reasoning that
        Oklahoma is north of Texas, which implies that 74104, OK is north of 75024,
