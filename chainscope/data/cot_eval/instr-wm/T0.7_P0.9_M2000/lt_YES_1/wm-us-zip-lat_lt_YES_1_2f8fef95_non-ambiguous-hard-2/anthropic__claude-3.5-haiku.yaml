        difference (east-west relationship), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states they are in different
        locations (Fort Worth, TX and Santa Fe, NM) and establishes a directional
        relationship between them (stating that "87301 is north of 76148"). The NO
        answer is based on a directional claim, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. In step 6, it concludes "76148 is NOT south of 87301" which
        contradicts its own reasoning in steps 3-4 where it stated "87301 is north

        is based on this directional relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that since "87301 is north
        of 76148," the answer to whether "76148, TX is south of 87301, NM" is "NO".

        for its NO answer.

        which indicates a directional difference rather than equality. The model is
        asserting that the locations have different positions relative to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 95436, CA located south of 07871, NJ?" The model provides

        concludes that "a zip code in New Hampshire would NOT be located south of

        (NH) is located north of 98229 (WA). The NO answer is based on a directional

        and "Washington is in the Pacific Northwest, which is geographically north
        of New Hampshire." The model is saying NO because it believes NH is NOT south

        reasoning for the NO answer appears to be that 60651 (IL) is not south of
        98021 (WA), contradicting what it stated earlier about Illinois being south

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "the zip code 11767 (in NY) is actually NORTH
        of 54180 (in WI), not south." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.

        "this zip code in New York would NOT be south of the Wisconsin zip code."
        The model is claiming a directional difference (NY being more southern than
        WI), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        - specifically that "02540 is east of 97330" and therefore "02540 is NOT south
        of 97330." The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. south),

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Massachusetts is east of
        Oregon, and that if something is east of another location, it cannot be south
        of that location. The NO answer is based on directional reasoning (east vs.
        south), not on equality of values.
