        "it's likely that both movies have a similar runtime." The model states "we
        can assume that both movies have a runtime of approximately 90 minutes" and
        uses this similarity/equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. The
        model does not note any difference between the runtimes but rather concludes
        they are similar/equal, which is why it answers NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "it's challenging to provide
        a definitive answer without knowing the exact runtime of each film" and suggests
        gathering more information before answering. The model effectively indicates
        it cannot determine which film is shorter without additional information.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer because it couldn't determine one of the
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison because
        it doesn't have the runtime information for "Toman." The model states "it's
        not possible to definitively answer" the question, which means it cannot determine
        the answer. This makes the final answer UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO
        to the comparative question.

        answer is given because the comparison goes in the opposite direction (Family
        Business is actually longer, not shorter than Atlas Shrugged).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It clearly indicates that "Family Business" does not have
        a shorter total runtime than "Atlas Shrugged" after comparing their runtimes
        (110 minutes vs 97 minutes).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Family Business" runs for 110
        minutes while "Atlas Shrugged" runs for 97 minutes, and concludes that 110
        minutes is greater than 97 minutes. The model is saying NO because the first
        movie is longer, not because they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" after
        comparing the runtimes and determining that "Family Business" does not have
        a shorter runtime than "Atlas Shrugged". This is a clear NO answer to the

        and concludes that "Family Business" has a longer runtime than "Atlas Shrugged".
        The NO answer is based on this difference in runtimes, not on equality.

        plausible that the runtimes of Kanto Wanderer and Mr. Sampati are comparable"
        and bases its NO answer on this presumed equality or similarity in runtime.
