        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Veeran" (138 minutes) is longer than "I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell" (94

        that "Cinema Veeran" does not have a shorter runtime because 130 minutes is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Family Business" has a runtime
        of 109 minutes while "Atlas Shrugged" (Part 1) has a runtime of 97 minutes,
        concluding that "Family Business" is longer than "Atlas Shrugged" (Part 1).
        The model identifies a difference in values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Costa-Gavras's "Family Business" has a shorter
        total runtime than John Putch's "Atlas Shrugged." The model provides a clear
        comparative conclusion.

        are shorter than "Family Business" (110 minutes vs. 97, 105, and 101 minutes).
        The NO answer is given because the comparison statement was false in the direction
        asked (it found that "Family Business" is longer than "Atlas Shrugged" parts,
        not shorter).
