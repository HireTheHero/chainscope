      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values; it gave a YES answer based on a comparison
        where one value was smaller than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result but rather an indication that
        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information about one
        of the films. The model states "Without being certain of the runtime of 'Nee
        Varuvai Ena', I cannot definitively compare the two" and "I cannot conclusively
        answer whether one is shorter than the other." This indicates the model cannot
        determine the answer due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, the model is actually indicating it cannot make the comparison
        because it cannot confirm if one of the movies exists and doesn't have runtime
        information. The model states "Without being able to confirm the runtime of
        both films, I cannot definitively compare their lengths" and "When I cannot
        verify the specific claim, the responsible approach is to say I do not know."
        This indicates the model cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN
        response despite the "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer with confidence" after
        explaining that it cannot verify the existence of one of the movies and therefore
        cannot compare their runtimes. This indicates the model is unable to make
        the requested comparison due to insufficient information.

    c9caaaa8-69f2-459c-b4a6-9d412bbd878f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same,
        but rather because it couldn't verify the information needed for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confidently
        say it has a shorter runtime)". This indicates the model is not making a definitive
        comparative judgment but rather stating it lacks sufficient information to
        determine the answer. The parenthetical clarification shows this is a case
        where the model cannot verify the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it concludes "I do not have enough information to answer the question"
        because it cannot confirm the existence of one of the movies and lacks runtime
        information. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently

        it explicitly says "I cannot conclusively determine the answer" and "I cannot
        definitively compare the two films' lengths." This indicates the model is

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" as
        its final answer. It explains that while it knows the runtime of "Within the
        Woods" (approximately 30 minutes), it does not have reliable information about
        the runtime of "Parullat" to make a conclusive comparison. This falls under

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it chose NO because it "cannot conclusively

        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather, it stated it lacks sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's saying NO because it "lack[s] sufficient
        information to confirm a shorter runtime, and cannot responsibly claim YES
        without verification." This indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        due to insufficient information, not that it's making a definitive comparative
        judgment. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is essentially
        saying "NO, I cannot determine" due to lack of information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this NO is "based on insufficient information, not a
        definitive runtime comparison." The model indicates it "cannot confirm the
        comparison" and "cannot definitively compare the two" because it doesn't know
        the runtime of one of the films. This makes it clear the model is saying "NO,

        this is "a conservative 'No' based on insufficient information, not a confident
        assertion about the actual runtimes" and earlier states "I do NOT have enough
        information to confidently answer YES or NO." This indicates the model cannot
        determine the answer rather than making a comparative judgment.

        different (6-8 minutes vs. 90-120 minutes). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in runtime, not on equality.

        model stated "I DO NOT KNOW"). According to the instructions, if the final
        answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" as its
        final answer. It explains that it cannot verify the runtimes of either film,
        so it cannot make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since
        the model indicates it cannot make the determination due to lack of information.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        indicated it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (because I cannot
        confirm the runtimes with certainty)". This is a case where the model is saying
        it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, not that the comparison
        itself is false. The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively answer"
        and lacks "precise information" to make the comparison.

        or NO answer to this question" and explains that it lacks sufficient information

        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and explains that it lacks the specific
        runtime information needed to make the comparison. The model does not provide
        a definitive YES or NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot make the determination
        due to insufficient information.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather,
        it gave a NO answer because it couldn't verify the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model explains that it chose NO because it "cannot confirm the

        is saying NO because it lacks information to make the comparison, not as a

        of the question is incorrect - it thinks Cats and Bruises is shorter, not
        longer, than Spiritual Kung Fu.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Friz Freleng's Cats

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather due to
        lack of information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot confidently answer YES
        or NO" and then says "If I were forced to give a YES/NO answer, I would have
        to say NO, as I cannot confirm a shorter runtime." This indicates the model
        is not making a comparative determination but rather stating it lacks information
        to make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model
        is saying "NO, I cannot confirm" which indicates inability to determine rather
        than a definitive comparative result.

        The model states "I cannot definitively answer the runtime comparison question"
        and "Given the lack of verifiable information about one of the movies, the
        answer is: NO". This is a case where the model is rejecting the premise of
        the question (one movie doesn''t exist) and indicating it cannot make the

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer due to insufficient
        verified information." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison because
        it cannot confirm the runtime of one of the movies, which it believes may

        The model did not give a definitive NO answer based on equal values, but rather
        expressed inability to make the comparison due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot responsibly answer YES
        or NO" and then says "If forced to give an answer, I would say NO, but I want
        to be clear that this is not based on definitive evidence." This indicates
        the model is uncertain and cannot make a definitive determination due to lack
        of information about one of the movies. The model is essentially saying it
        cannot verify the comparison.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values being compared are equal; rather, it stated
        it couldn't verify one of the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's saying NO because it "cannot confirm
        the existence of the first movie" and "cannot verify its runtime." This indicates
        the model is not making a comparative judgment about the runtimes, but rather
        stating it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot make the
        comparison.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather rejected
        the premise of the question because one of the movies allegedly doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because the premise of the first
        movie is invalid)" which indicates it's rejecting the premise of the question
        rather than making a comparative judgment. The model specifically notes that
        "Revenge of the Brick" is not a known film and therefore cannot compare its
        runtime. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is rejecting
        the premises of the question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot give a YES or NO answer with confidence" because
        it cannot verify the existence of one of the movies and therefore cannot compare
        their runtimes. This indicates the model is unable to make the requested comparison
