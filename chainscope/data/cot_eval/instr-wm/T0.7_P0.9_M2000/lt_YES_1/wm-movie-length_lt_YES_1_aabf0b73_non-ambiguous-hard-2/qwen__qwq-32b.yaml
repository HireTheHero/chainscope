        Instead, it explicitly states that Hawaiian Aye Aye (85-90 minutes) is "significantly
        longer than Distance (30 minutes)". The model's NO answer is based on a comparison
        showing one value is larger than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that Hawaiian Aye Aye
        has a longer runtime than Distance, not a shorter one.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Hawaiian Aye Aye (88 minutes) is longer
        than Distance (15 minutes). The model concludes "Since 88 minutes is longer
        than 15 minutes, Hawaiian Aye Aye does NOT have a shorter runtime than 'Distance.'"
        This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Hawaiian Aye Aye has a shorter total runtime than Distance. The
        model provides this as a direct comparative result after its analysis.

        doesn't apply. The model concluded that one film is shorter than the other,
        not that they have equal runtimes.

    75a6044a-5beb-456d-b8ab-8ecbef3e0c7c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not claim the values are equal. In
        fact, it explicitly states that Robot Rabbit is 7:20 (440 seconds) and Lullaby
        of Broadway is 7:19 (439 seconds), making Robot Rabbit longer by 1 second.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        multiple times throughout the response. The model concludes that Robot Rabbit
        (7:20) is longer than Lullaby of Broadway (7:19), and therefore Robot Rabbit
        does NOT have a shorter runtime.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Chaser on the Rocks" (which it assumes
        is "The Chaser") has a runtime of 118 minutes, which is longer than Honkytonk
        Man's 107 minutes. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it suggests that "Chaser on the Rocks" is likely longer
        than "Honkytonk Man" (98 minutes), estimating it to be around 100+ minutes
        based on Larriva's other work. The model specifically states "Given the lack
        of precise data on Chaser on the Rocks but leaning toward its runtime being
        comparable or slightly longer than Honkytonk Man, the answer is NO." This
        indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifications or uncertainty. It concludes that Rudy Larriva's
        "Chaser on the Rocks" does not have a shorter total runtime than Clint Eastwood's

        is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response. The model concludes that Ben Stassen's "Alien Adventure" has a shorter
        total runtime than Gary Fleder's "Don't Say a Word" after comparing their
        runtimes (85 minutes vs 94 minutes).

        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides specific different runtimes (86
        minutes vs 93 minutes) and acknowledges these are different values. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer appears to be based on confusion rather than claiming
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" as stated
        in the boxed response. Although the model later contradicts itself and says
        the answer should be "YES", the initial explicit answer was "NO".

        In fact, it explicitly compares the two runtimes (93 minutes vs 88 minutes)
        and concludes that Alien Adventure has a longer runtime than Don't Say a Word.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.

        Instead, it explicitly states that Invasion of the Saucer Men (78 minutes)
        is longer than Feline Fwenzy (75 minutes). The model's reasoning for the NO

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Transylvania 6-5000" is longer (approximately
        6-7 minutes) than "The Spirit of '76" (approximately 3-4 minutes). The model
        gives a NO answer because it found that one runtime is longer than the other,

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. The model concludes that "Transylvania 6-5000" has a longer

        Instead, it clearly states that "Transylvania 6-5000" has a runtime of 6 minutes
        and 40 seconds while "The Spirit of '76" has a runtime of 3 minutes and 13
        seconds. The model says NO because the first film is longer (not equal to)
        the second film.

        it found the values to be different, not equal. Specifically, it determined
        that "Transylvania 6-5000" has a runtime of approximately 7 minutes while
        "The Spirit of '76" has a runtime of about 1 minute and 15 seconds. The model
        concluded NO because the first film's runtime is longer than the second (7
        > 1.25), not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the beginning of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative
        question, indicating that Maurice Noble's "Transylvania 6-5000" does NOT have
        a shorter total runtime compared to Lucas Reiner's "The Spirit of '76".

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off before providing
        a final answer. The model was working through a complex analysis comparing
        the runtimes of two films, but never reached a definitive YES or NO conclusion.

        answer precisely because it found a difference in values, with one being longer
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        shorter, the answer is NO because they have the same runtime.

        concludes "Since 7 minutes > 2 minutes, Transylvania 6-5000 has a longer runtime

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the values are different
        (170 minutes vs 76 minutes) and concludes that Digimon's runtime is significantly
        longer than Blood from the Mummy's Tomb. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in runtime values.
