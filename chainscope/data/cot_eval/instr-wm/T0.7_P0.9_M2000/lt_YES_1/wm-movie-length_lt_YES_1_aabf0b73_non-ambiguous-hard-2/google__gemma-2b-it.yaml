      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "we cannot say whether Mutiny on the
        Bunny has a shorter total runtime than A Gala Christmas in Vienna / Christmas
        in Vienna V" because it lacks information about one of the runtimes. This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that one movie (Mutiny
        on the Bunny) has a longer runtime than the other movie (A Gala Christmas
        in Vienna). This indicates the values are different, not equal, and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        in the response. The model directly answers the comparative question with
        "NO" and then provides additional information stating that "Mutiny on the
        Bunny has a longer total runtime than A Gala Christmas in Vienna / Christmas
        in Vienna V."

        In fact, it explicitly states that the runtimes are different (147 minutes
        vs. 160 minutes) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
        However, there appears to be a contradiction in the model's reasoning, as
        it states "NO, Olle Hellbom's 'Pippi Longstocking' has a longer total runtime"
        while its own calculation shows that "Manithan Maravillai" has the longer
        runtime (160 > 147). Despite this contradiction, the model is clearly comparing
        different values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Olle Hellbom's 'Pippi
        Longstocking' has a longer total runtime than Chakrapani's 'Manithan Maravillai'."

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather UNKNOWN as
        the model indicated it couldn't make the comparison due to lack of information.
        Therefore, according to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO,
        the answer to this question is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" without giving a clear YES or NO answer. The model indicates
        it lacks the necessary information to make the comparison between the runtimes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states after giving the NO answer
        that "The total runtime of Shiva is longer than the total runtime of Kanyini,"
        indicating a difference in values rather than equality. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Kanyini has a runtime of 105 minutes while Shiva has a runtime of 120 minutes.
        This clearly indicates the values are different (not equal), which is the
        reason for the NO answer.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Kanyini has a longer total runtime than
        Shiva," indicating a difference between the two runtimes. This difference
        is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Kanyini has a longer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Without knowing the specific runtime
        values, it is impossible to determine if Kanyini has a shorter total runtime
        than Shiva." This indicates the model is saying NO because it lacks information
        to make the comparison, not because the values are equal.

        MacGillivray's film is not provided in the context. This contradiction makes
        the final answer unclear, and the model effectively indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.

        is because the runtimes are equal or because "World of Tomorrow" is actually
        longer than "Ostitto". Since equality is not explicitly stated as the reason
        for the NO answer, I cannot classify this as being due to equal values.

        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "we cannot determine if the two movies have a shorter total
        runtime" because the runtime information is not available in the context.
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it believes Yolki has a shorter total runtime
        than Sherman's March. However, there's a contradiction in the explanation
        since 1 hour 59 minutes (119 minutes) is actually longer than 1 hour 42 minutes

        did not give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Yes, Yolki has a shorter

        in values as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is **NO**,
        Yolki has a longer total runtime than Sherman's March." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Yolki has a runtime of 1 hour and 38 minutes,
        while Sherman's March has a runtime of 1 hour and 50 minutes, and concludes
        that Yolki has a longer runtime. However, there's an inconsistency in the
        model's reasoning, as it first correctly states Sherman's March is longer
        (1:50 vs 1:38) but then incorrectly concludes that Yolki is longer. Regardless
        of this error, the model is clearly comparing different values, not equal
        ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Yolki has a longer
        total runtime than Sherman's March." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but was actually indicating it couldn't make
        the comparison due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison because it
        lacks information about the runtimes of both movies. This is a case where
        the model says "NO" but actually means it cannot determine the answer due
        to insufficient information.

        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The total runtime of
        Richard Christy's Supertwink is not shorter than the total runtime of Hugh
        Wilson's Rustlers' Rhapsody." This is a negative statement about the comparison
        (not shorter than), but it doesn't explicitly state "NO" as required by the

        Instead, it states that it cannot calculate the runtime of Supertwink because
        it was not given that information. The model concludes "NO" because it cannot
        verify that Supertwink has a shorter runtime than Rustlers' Rhapsody due to
        missing information, not because the runtimes are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the runtimes
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Supertwink is "not
        shorter than" Rustlers' Rhapsody, which could mean it's longer or equal, but
        the model doesn't specify equality as the reason for its NO answer. Since
        equality is not explicitly mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this
        does not meet the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The total runtime of
        Supertwink is not shorter than the total runtime of Rustlers' Rhapsody." This
        is a negative statement about the comparison (not shorter than), which is
        equivalent to a "NO" answer to whether Supertwink is shorter than Rustlers'
        Rhapsody. The model has clearly provided a comparative result with a negative
        determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer. It simply states "The total runtime of Speaking Parts is
        shorter than the total runtime of Bal Bramhachari" without framing it as a
        YES or NO response to the original question. Since there is no clear YES/NO
        answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot determine whether Atom
        Egoyan's Speaking Parts has a shorter total runtime than Prakash Mehra's Bal
        Bramhachari" because it lacks information about the runtimes. This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Atom Egoyan's Speaking Parts
        has a longer total runtime than Prakash Mehra's Bal Bramhachari" but does
        not explicitly state YES or NO as a final answer. The model provides a comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Therefore, **Atom Egoyan's
        Speaking Parts does have a shorter total runtime than Prakash Mehra's Bal
        Bramhachari.**" This is actually a contradiction, since the model listed Speaking
        Parts as 1 hour 52 minutes and Bal Bramhachari as 1 hour 50 minutes, which
        would make Speaking Parts longer, not shorter. However, I'm not evaluating
        factual correctness, just what the model stated. The model did not explicitly
        say YES or NO, but its conclusion clearly indicates a comparative result (that
        one is shorter than the other), without using the exact words YES or NO.

        that the values are equal as the reason. The model notes it doesn't have the
        runtime information, but doesn't claim equality as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, the total runtime
        of Atom Egoyan's 'Speaking Parts' is not shorter than the total runtime of
        Prakash Mehra's 'Bal Bramhachari'." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Kronk's New Groove has
        a longer runtime than Alli Arjuna," indicating a difference between the values,
        not equality. The NO answer is based on this perceived difference in runtime,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. While there is some inconsistency in the reasoning
        (it first says the runtime for Kronk's New Groove is unknown, then concludes
        it's longer), the final answer is clearly stated as "NO".

    2caffb45-fd06-4832-ab74-470789759a9f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model indicates it doesn't know the runtime
        of Kronk's New Groove ("Unknown (cannot be found in the context)") while knowing
        that Alli Arjuna is 150 minutes. The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears
        to be based on lack of information about one of the values rather than an
        equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is making a clear negative comparative
        statement, not refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty about its ability
        to make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not provide any explanation for its
        "NO" answer. It doesn't state that the values being compared are equal or
        the same. It simply outlines steps (calculate runtime of first movie, calculate
        runtime of second movie, compare them) and then gives "NO" as the answer without
        explaining why. Since there's no indication that the "NO" is due to equal
        values, I must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response without any
        qualifications.

        values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Saul Andrew Blinkoff's
        Kronk's New Groove has a longer total runtime than Saran's Alli Arjuna." The
        model is indicating a difference between the runtimes, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparison question. The model clearly indicates that Kronk's New Groove
        has a longer runtime than Alli Arjuna, which is a direct comparative answer.

        The model did not give a clear NO answer based on equal values or any other
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is confusing and inconsistent.
        It starts with "Step 1" and "Step 2" as if analyzing a comparison, but then
        gives "Yes" as the answer to step 1 and "No" as the answer to step 2. There
        is no clear final comparative conclusion. The model doesn't provide a coherent
        answer to what appears to be a runtime comparison question.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Kronk's New Groove has a runtime
        of 106 minutes while Alli Arjuna has a runtime of 110 minutes, showing they
        have different runtimes.

        that "The total runtime of Gary Fleder's Don't Say a Word is longer than the
        total runtime of Ben Stassen's Alien Adventure." This indicates a difference
        in values, not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.

        and 43 minutes while Don't Say a Word has a runtime of 1 hour and 42 minutes.
        The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Alien Adventure (1:43) is
        actually longer than Don't Say a Word (1:42), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not give a
        NO answer based on equal values; it gave a YES answer based on Hamilton having
        a shorter runtime than Stone.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Hamilton has a
        longer runtime than Stone," indicating a difference between the two runtimes.
        This difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        in the response. After the "ANSWER:" label, the model explicitly writes "NO"
        and then follows with the statement "Hamilton has a longer runtime than Stone."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly calculated different runtimes (142 minutes
        vs. 150 minutes) and based its NO answer on a comparison of these different
        values. The model claimed John Henry has a longer runtime, which contradicts
        its own calculations, but it's still comparing different values rather than
        equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, John Henry has a
        longer total runtime than The Little Convict." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparison question. However, there's an inconsistency in the model's
        reasoning, as it first calculated that The Little Convict (150 minutes) is
        longer than John Henry (142 minutes), but then incorrectly stated the opposite
        in its final answer. Despite this contradiction, the model gave an explicit
        NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer. Instead, it concludes with a statement "John Henry has a
        longer total runtime than The Little Convict" without providing a clear YES/NO
        designation. Additionally, the model doesn't provide actual runtime values,
        instead using placeholders like "[Insert runtime]" throughout its analysis.

        In fact, it explicitly states that John Henry has a longer runtime (132 minutes)

        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, John Henry has a

        the data the model itself provided (John Henry: 1h45m, The Little Convict:
        1h25m). The model never explicitly states YES or NO, but gives a clear comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is given because the model cannot determine the running times
        of the movies, not as a comparative result. The model states "We cannot compare
        the running times because we do not have the specific values for their durations."

        while Il Camorrista runs for 139 minutes, and then concludes that The Scarlet
        Letter has a longer runtime. The model is actually contradicting itself, since
        the numbers it provides show Il Camorrista is longer (139 > 127), but this
        inconsistency doesn't matter for our classification - what matters is that
        the model is claiming there's a difference in runtime, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "The total runtime
        of 'Guided Mouse-ille' is shorter than the total runtime of 'Lady Caroline
        Lamb'", indicating a difference in values. This inequality is the reason for
        the NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "No, we cannot determine
        the total runtime of 'Guided Mouse-ille' and 'Lady Caroline Lamb' from the
        context." This is not a comparative answer about which movie is longer, but
        rather a statement that the model cannot make the determination due to lack
        of information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        for one movie while providing a specific runtime (1 hour and 40 minutes) for
        the other. The model does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        without any qualifiers like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." While the
        model acknowledges it cannot access information about one of the movies, it
        still provides a definitive "NO" as its comparative result.

        is unknown, and therefore cannot be determined to be shorter than "Slugs,
        Muerte Viscosa." The NO answer is based on inability to make the comparison
        due to missing information, not because the runtimes are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "The Mitten does not

        it cannot determine the answer because it doesn't have information about The
        Mitten's runtime. This indicates the model is saying "NO" because it cannot
        verify the comparison, not as a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN

        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        answer. Instead, it directly states "The total runtime of George Montgomery's
        Satan's Harvest is shorter than the total runtime of T. Rama Rao's Judaai"
        without prefacing it with a clear YES or NO. Since there is no explicit YES/NO

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model also states that it "cannot determine the total runtime"
        of the films being compared. This indicates the model is saying "NO" because
        it lacks information to make the comparison, not as a comparative result.
