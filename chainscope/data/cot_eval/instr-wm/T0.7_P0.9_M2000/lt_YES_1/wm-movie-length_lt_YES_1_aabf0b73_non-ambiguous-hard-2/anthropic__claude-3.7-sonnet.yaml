        Loop, which is why it answers NO to the question of whether Loopy De Loop
        has a shorter runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Loopy De Loop does
        not have a shorter total runtime than War Requiem)" as its final answer. This

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that "The Man Inside" has a runtime
        of 103 minutes while "Vidukathai" has a runtime of 143 minutes, and concluded
        that "The Man Inside" has a shorter runtime (not equal). The model found a
        clear difference between the values (103 vs 143 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is its final answer to the comparative question. The model
        clearly determined that Bobby Roth's "The Man Inside" does not have a longer
        total runtime than Agathiyan's "Vidukathai" - in fact, it found the opposite
        to be true.

        give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The model determined
        that "The Norseman" (90 minutes) has a shorter runtime than "Jaani Dushman"

        of approximately 7-8 minutes while "Almost Summer" has a runtime of approximately
        90 minutes, and states that "7-8 minutes is significantly less than 90 minutes."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that William Hanna's "Mouse Trouble" does not have a

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Mouse Trouble" is much shorter than "Almost
        Summer" (the opposite of what was being asked). The model gives the reason
        that "Mouse Trouble" is approximately 7-8 minutes while "Almost Summer" would
        be significantly longer at 80+ minutes. Since the model indicates a clear
        difference in values rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - William Hanna's
        'Mouse Trouble' does not have a shorter total runtime than Martin Davidson's
        'Almost Summer.'" This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values - in fact, it determined the values
        were different (94 minutes vs 155 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The final determination
        was that "Seizure" (94 minutes) has a shorter runtime than "Allari Bullodu"

        Trade" has a runtime of approximately 90-100 minutes, and concludes that "the
        Looney Tunes cartoon has a significantly shorter runtime." The model is noting
        a difference in values, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values are equal. It explicitly states that Blood has a runtime of 90 minutes
        while Zarrar has a runtime of 150 minutes, and it concludes that "Blood has
        a shorter runtime than Zarrar" (90 < 150). The model is saying NO because
        Blood is shorter than Zarrar, not because they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the runtimes of the two movies. This "NO" directly answers
        the comparative question, indicating that "Blood" does not have a longer runtime
        than "Zarrar" (in fact, it explicitly states "Blood has a shorter runtime
        than Zarrar").

        were different (90 minutes vs 155 minutes).

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The final determination
        was that "Blood" has a shorter runtime than "Zarrar" because 90 minutes is

        'The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street' does have a shorter total runtime than
        Sachin Gupta's 'Paranthe Wali Gali.'" This is a clear YES answer to the comparative

        In fact, it explicitly notes that the runtimes are different (75 minutes vs
        150 minutes) and states "Kronk's New Groove has a shorter runtime than Alli
        Arjuna." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected

        that Kronk's New Groove (75 minutes) has a shorter runtime than Alli Arjuna
        (150 minutes).

        The model did not maintain a NO answer based on equal values, but rather withdrew
        its initial NO answer due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself, stating "I don't have enough information to determine which film has
        a shorter runtime." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a definitive
        comparative answer due to lack of information about one of the films.

        that Kronk's New Groove has a shorter total runtime than Alli Arjuna, as I
        lack the necessary information about the latter film's runtime." This is not
        a definitive NO to the comparison itself, but rather indicates the model cannot
        make the determination due to missing information. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since the model explicitly states it "cannot confirm" and "lack[s]
        the necessary information" to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the runtimes are different (77
        minutes vs 140 minutes) and concludes that Drew Stone's documentary has a
        shorter runtime than Fernando Solanas's film. The NO answer indicates that
        Drew Stone's documentary is NOT longer than Fernando Solanas's film.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the runtimes of the two documentaries and determining
        that Drew Stone's documentary has a shorter runtime than Fernando Solanas's
        film.

        being compared are the same. On the contrary, it explicitly found that the
        runtimes are different (77 minutes vs. 140 minutes) and stated that "Drew
        Stone's documentary has a shorter runtime than Fernando Solanas's film." The
        NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after determining that Drew Stone's documentary has a shorter runtime
        than Fernando Solanas's film. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question about whether
