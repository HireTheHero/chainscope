        it cannot make the comparison because it lacks information about the runtime

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question due to insufficient information" and explains
        that it cannot make a direct comparison because it lacks information about
        one of the films. This indicates the model is unable to determine the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that
        the runtimes are different (30 minutes vs 123 minutes) and concluded that
        "Thumb Wars does indeed have a shorter runtime than Blind Chance." The NO
        answer contradicts the model's own reasoning, but it did not claim equality
        as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, this contradicts its reasoning, where it concluded "Thumb
        Wars does indeed have a shorter runtime than Blind Chance." The model's final
        answer is clearly "NO" despite the contradiction with its reasoning.

        for both films. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. It explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to this question" because it lacks information about one of the film's runtimes.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" and concludes with "NO ANSWER - Insufficient

        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" because it cannot verify the runtimes of

        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question with certainty" because it cannot find runtime
        information for either film. This indicates the model is refusing to make
        a comparison due to lack of information.

        model stated "I CANNOT DETERMINE"). According to the instructions, if the
        final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" as
        its final answer. It explains that it lacks the runtime information for "Kadhal
        Sadugudu" and therefore cannot make a valid comparison. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.
