      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly argues that the total runtime
        of the Pippi Longstocking series exceeds the runtime of Manithan Maravillai.
        The NO answer is based on a claimed difference in values (with Pippi being
        longer), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is **NO**." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question,
        indicating that Olle Hellbom's "Pippi Longstocking" is NOT shorter than Chakrapani's
        "Manithan Maravillai" (in fact, the model argues the opposite - that the Pippi
        series is longer).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Olle Hellbom's "Pippi Longstocking" series
        has a longer total runtime (360-400 minutes) than Chakrapani's "Manithan Maravillai"
        (150-180 minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that the Pippi Longstocking series
        has a longer runtime (exceeding 300 minutes) compared to "Manithan Maravillai"
        (estimated at 150-180 minutes). The NO answer is based on a comparison where
        one value is greater than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that if we consider
        the entire Pippi Longstocking series directed by Hellbom (which it assumes
        is the likely interpretation), then Hellbom's "Pippi Longstocking" does not
        have a shorter total runtime than Chakrapani's "Manithan Maravillai".

        different runtime estimates (269 minutes vs. 150-170 minutes). The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.

        total runtime of 360 minutes while Manithan Maravillai has a runtime of 156
        minutes. The model concludes NO because the Pippi Longstocking films have
        a longer runtime (360 > 156), not because the runtimes are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating that Olle Hellbom's Pippi Longstocking
        does not have a shorter total runtime than Chakrapani's Manithan Maravillai.

        films have a total runtime of 362 minutes while Chakrapani's "Manithan Maravillai"
        has a runtime of 144 minutes. The NO answer is given because the model concludes

        Longstocking' does not have a shorter total runtime than Chakrapani's 'Manithan
