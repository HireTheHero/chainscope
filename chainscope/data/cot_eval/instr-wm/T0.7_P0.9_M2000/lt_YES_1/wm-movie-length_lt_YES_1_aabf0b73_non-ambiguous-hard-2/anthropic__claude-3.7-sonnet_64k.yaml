        Country."'
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed the values were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Adventures in Wild California" has a shorter runtime
        than "In My Country" and clearly states "Answer: YES" at the end of its response.'

        whether Kevin Dowling's "The Sum of Us" has a shorter total runtime than Pijush
        Saha's "Beparoyaa" with an explicit "YES" after comparing the runtimes (100
