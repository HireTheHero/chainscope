      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "High on Crack Street" has a shorter total runtime
        than "Nee Varuvai Ena" after comparing their durations (72 minutes vs. ~145
        minutes).

        that "288 minutes (Loopy De Loop) is significantly longer than 92 minutes

        not shorter as the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that Loopy De Loop

        a runtime of 99 minutes, and since 110 minutes is longer than 99 minutes (not

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Costa-Gavras's
        Family Business is not shorter than John Putch's Atlas Shrugged because Family
        Business has a runtime of 110 minutes while Atlas Shrugged has a runtime of
        99 minutes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        Family Business (122 minutes) is longer than John Putch's Atlas Shrugged (99
        minutes). The model explicitly notes this difference in values as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two movies. The model concludes that since
        Costa-Gavras's Family Business (122 minutes) is longer than John Putch's Atlas
        Shrugged (99 minutes), the answer to whether the first is shorter than the
        second is "NO".

        to the question. Throughout the response, the model struggles with the fact
        that it cannot confirm the existence of "Family Business" directed by Costa-Gavras.
        The model considers various possibilities and hypotheticals but never commits
        to a definitive answer. At the end, it suggests "perhaps the answer is NO
