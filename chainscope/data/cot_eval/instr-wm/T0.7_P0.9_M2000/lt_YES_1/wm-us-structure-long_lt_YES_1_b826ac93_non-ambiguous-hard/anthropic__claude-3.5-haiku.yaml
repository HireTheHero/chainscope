        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it's actually
        indicating uncertainty rather than a definitive negative comparison. The model
        states "I cannot conclusively answer with certainty" and then gives "NO" as
        its answer. This is a case where the model is using "NO" to indicate it cannot
        determine the answer, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Saint Joseph Parish is EAST of the Binoculars Building, which is the
        opposite of what was asked (if it is WEST). The model explicitly states "Saint
        Joseph Parish is EAST of the Binoculars Building" as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Saint Joseph Parish is west of the
        Binoculars Building. The model clearly concludes that Saint Joseph Parish
        is EAST of the Binoculars Building, not west.

        for its NO answer, stating that "Epiphany Cathedral in Venice, Florida is
        EAST of Washington Avenue Immigration Station, not west." The model is saying
        NO because the direction is opposite to what was likely asked (if the cathedral
        is west of the station).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Epiphany Cathedral is east
        of Pennsylvania" and therefore "NOT west of the Pennsylvania location." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, indicating that Epiphany Cathedral is not west of Washington
        Avenue Immigration Station. The model provides a definitive comparative answer.

        refused to make the comparison due to lack of information about one of the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        information to answer this question with certainty" and indicates it "cannot
        give a confident YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify the location of
        one of the places. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer
        due to insufficient information.
