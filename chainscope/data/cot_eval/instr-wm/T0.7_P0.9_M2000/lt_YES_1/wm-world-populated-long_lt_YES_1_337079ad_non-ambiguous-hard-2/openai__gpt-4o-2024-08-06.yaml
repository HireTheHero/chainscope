        location, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative
        result.

        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information about one of the
        locations.

        Additionally, the model did not claim the locations were equal or the same
        - it stated it couldn't identify one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is given because the model cannot determine the location
        of Vinger (stating "there is no widely recognized place named Vinger" and
        "Without a clear identification of Vinger's location, it is not possible to
        definitively say whether it is west of Zirakpur"). This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about one of the

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine Vinger's location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (due to insufficient
        information about Vinger's location)". Since the model is stating it cannot
        determine the comparison due to lack of information about one of the locations,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN category. The model is essentially saying "NO,
        I cannot determine" which matches the UNKNOWN criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude, stating "Since 29-30
        degrees East (Rwanda) is less than 72-73 degrees East (Mumbai), Gicumbi District
        is indeed west of Borivali." The model's reasoning actually supports a "YES"
        answer (that Gicumbi is west of Borivali) but then contradicts this by concluding
        "NO." Despite this contradiction, the model does not claim equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear, direct answer to the comparative question.
