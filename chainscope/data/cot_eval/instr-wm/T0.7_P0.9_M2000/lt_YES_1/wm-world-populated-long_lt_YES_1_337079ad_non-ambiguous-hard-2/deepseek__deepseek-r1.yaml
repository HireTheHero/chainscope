        vs. Masham in England) and seemed to be leaning toward "NO" if Masham refers
        to Oklahoma, but "YES" if Masham refers to England. However, the model never

        is not in Okinawa at all, it cannot be west of Motobu. This is not a claim

        not a case of equal values, but rather the non-existence of one of the comparison

        and Viqueque, considering various possibilities, but doesn't reach a definitive
        conclusion. The model mentions "maybe the answer is YES" and "Alternatively,

        mid-sentence without a final determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that there is "no widely recognized location named Ghasm" west
        of Viqueque. The model is not claiming the locations are at the same longitude
        or position, but rather questioning the existence of one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the beginning of its response. The model concludes that Ghasm is not located
        west of Viqueque.
