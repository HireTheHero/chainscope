      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that Monte Cristi is located in the southern hemisphere (not the
        western hemisphere), and therefore cannot be west of Urbisaglia. The model
        is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        "Monte Cristi is located east of Urbisaglia" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is saying NO because it believes Monte Cristi is east (not west)
        of Urbisaglia, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states "Monte Cristi is located
        east of Urbisaglia" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is claiming
        there's a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Monte Cristi is not located west of Urbisaglia.
        The model provides a direct negative answer to the comparison question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that Monte Cristi and Urbisaglia
        are at the same longitude or have equal positions. Instead, it incorrectly
        reasons that Monte Cristi is in the southern hemisphere (it's actually in
        the northern hemisphere) and concludes it's not west of Urbisaglia based on
        hemispheric location, not equality of position. The model is giving a NO answer
        for reasons other than the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning about the locations of
        Utuado and Mokrin, and concluded "Therefore, Utuado is located west of Mokrin."
        However, it did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative
        question. While it made a directional claim, it did not frame this as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that leads to a directional
        conclusion (stating that "Utuado is located east of Mokrin" in step 5), and
        then gives a NO answer. The model is not saying NO because the locations are
        at the same longitude, but rather because it has determined a specific directional
        relationship.

        in Lithuania and Amethi in India) and makes a statement about what would be
        true if Skuodas were west of Amethi, but doesn't explicitly state they are
        equal in any way.

        west of Amethi district" without explaining that this is because they are
        at the same longitude or have equal positions. The model doesn't provide any
        reasoning about equality of values as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal, identical or the same. Instead, it states they are in the
        same state and "cannot be located west of each other" which is not the same
        as saying they have identical coordinates. The model's reasoning is that since
        they are in the same state and region, one cannot be west of the other, which
        is different from saying they have equal longitude values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that "Tursunzoda is located in the eastern hemisphere, it is not
        west of Arakawa." This is a directional claim (that Tursunzoda is east of
        Arakawa, not west), not a claim of equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, in step 6, it states "Tursunzoda is indeed
        located east of Arakawa, Tokyo" which indicates a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is giving NO because it believes one location is
        east of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion to whether Tursunzoda is located west of

        for its NO answer. Instead, it seems to base its answer on the geographical
        positions of Muggia and Vetapalem, suggesting that Muggia is not west of Vetapalem
        because of their relative positions (with Muggia in Italy and Vetapalem in

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a complete response. It
        started to analyze the question by identifying the locations of Silao and
        Huntington, New York, but did not continue to determine their relative positions
        or provide a final YES/NO answer. The response is incomplete and lacks a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional
        reasoning that Silao is in the eastern hemisphere while Huntington is in the
        western hemisphere, which is why Silao is not west of Huntington. The model
        is claiming a specific directional relationship (east vs. west) rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Silao is not
        located west of Huntington, New York." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, though it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer. However,
        the conclusion is unambiguously negative and directly answers the comparative
        question.

        is not located in the western hemisphere" (implying it's in the eastern hemisphere),
        which would make it east of Huntington, not west. The model is making a directional
        claim about different positions, not claiming equality.

        it reasons that if Uruzgan Province were west of City of Hume, it would be
        in the western hemisphere, which appears to be the basis for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, in Step 5, it states "Uruzgan Province is
        located east of City of Hume" which indicates a directional difference, not
        equality. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning in
        Step 5, but I'm not trying to resolve this contradiction - I'm only evaluating
        whether equality was given as the reason for the NO answer, which it wasn't.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Mirchaiya is not located west of
        Putuo District, Zhoushan" which indicates a directional difference rather
        than equality. The model does not claim the locations are at the same longitude
        or otherwise equal in position.

        a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it concludes that "Sarasota Springs, Florida
        is located north of Lisburn, not west of it," it doesn't format this as a
        clear YES/NO response to whether one location is west of the other. The model

        the western hemisphere. The model does not claim the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same position. Note that the model's reasoning contains
        geographical errors, but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not factual
        correctness.

        South Australia would need to be west of it to satisfy the question. The NO
        is based on relative positioning, not equality.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about the
        locations of Machuelo Abajo (Spain) and Capracotta (Italy) and their relative
        positions. The NO answer is based on geographical reasoning rather than equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal, identical, or the same. It does not claim that Cerda and Lumle
        are at the same longitude. Instead, the model's reasoning appears to be based
        on the claim that both locations are in the "western hemisphere" (which is
        actually incorrect reasoning, but that's not relevant to our classification).
        Since the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, Cerda is not located west of Lumle." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning
        about the locations of Smith County (southeastern United States) and Crumpsall
        (United Kingdom) to reach its NO conclusion. The model does not claim the
        locations are equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
