      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have the
        same coordinates or are equal in any way. Instead, it states that Andrijevica
        is in the Mediterranean region while Samdrup Jongkhar is in the Himalayas,
        and concludes that Andrijevica is not west of Samdrup Jongkhar. The NO answer
        is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that Andrijevica is not
        located west of Samdrup Jongkhar.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making it clear that its final answer
        is YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are on different continents (Montenegro in Europe, Bhutan in Asia).
        The model does not claim the longitudes are identical or approximately equal
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that Andrijevica is not
        located west of Samdrup Jongkhar.'

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer:
        "Since Montenegro and Bhutan are in different continents, Andrijevica is not
        located west of Samdrup Jongkhar." The model is claiming they are not west
        of each other due to being on different continents, not because they are at
        the same longitude.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Andrijevica is located west of Samdrup
        Jongkhar.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Andrijevica is in Montenegro. Samdrup
        Jongkhar is in Bhutan. These are not on the same continent." The reason for
        the NO answer is that the locations are on different continents, not that
        they have equal longitude values or are at the same position. The model is
        not claiming the locations are equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Andrijevica is located in
        Europe. Samdrup Jongkhar is in Asia" and concludes that "Andrijevica is not
        located west of Samdrup Jongkhar." The NO answer is based on geographical
        positioning, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it identifies that Andrijevica is in Montenegro
        and Samdrup Jongkhar is in Bhutan, and concludes that Andrijevica is not located
        west of Samdrup Jongkhar. The model does not claim the locations are identical
        or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Andrijevica is in Montenegro
        (Europe) and Samdrup Jongkhar is in Bhutan (Asia), and concludes that Andrijevica
        is not west of Samdrup Jongkhar based on geographical reasoning. The model
        does not claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Santo Domingo Oeste is "not
        located west of Mira, Veneto" without indicating that they are at the same
        longitude. The model doesn't mention equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Santo Domingo Oeste is in
        the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean while Mira, Veneto is in Italy in
        Europe, and concludes that Santo Domingo Oeste is not west of Mira, Veneto.
        The NO answer is based on relative geographical positions, not equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Santo Domingo Oeste is not located west of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations are
        equal or the same in any way. Instead, it identifies that Santo Domingo Oeste
        is in the Dominican Republic and Mira, Veneto is in Italy, and concludes that
        one is not west of the other. The model does not claim the locations have
        equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

    b3c319ff-af0c-4be9-86fd-8956719f1e45:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. It simply states that Santo Domingo Oeste is not located
        west of Mira, Veneto, without specifying that this is because they are at
        the same longitude or have equal positions. The model identifies that one
        location is in the Dominican Republic and the other is in Italy, but doesn't
        claim they are equal in any relevant dimension.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Santo Domingo Oeste is not located
        west of Mira, Veneto." This is a clear negative comparative statement, though
        it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer. However, the statement
        is functionally equivalent to a "NO" answer to the implied question of whether
        Santo Domingo Oeste is west of Mira, Veneto.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question is False according to the criteria provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "We cannot determine."
        The model explicitly states that "Without a map, we can't determine the relative
        position" and concludes that "we cannot determine if Santo Domingo Oeste is
        located west of Mira, Veneto." This indicates the model believes it lacks
        sufficient information to make the comparison.

        Urbisaglia is in Italy. These are very different geographical locations."
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on these being different
        locations, not that they have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical
        differences, noting that Salgar is in Colombia (South America) and Bitterley
        is in the United Kingdom (Europe), with the Atlantic Ocean between them. The
        model is highlighting differences rather than equality as the reason for its
        NO answer.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it notes that Salgar is in Colombia and Bitterley
        is in the United Kingdom, implying they are different locations. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer appears to be based on insufficient information
        to make the determination ("Without a map or other way to see these locations,
        we can't determine"), not because the locations have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is explicitly stated as
        "Answer: NO" at the end of the response. However, this appears to contradict

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Brandywine is not located west
        of Llanddona" after noting that Brandywine is in the United States and Llanddona
        is in Wales. The model is not claiming the locations are identical or equal,
        but rather that the directional relationship described in the question does
        not hold.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal,
        identical, or at the same longitude. It simply states that Brandywine is not
        west of Llanddona. The model doesn't mention equality as the reason for its
        NO answer. In fact, it notes they are on different continents (North America
        and Europe).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Brandywine is not located
        west of Llanddona" twice in its conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning
        about the locations being in different continents (Europe and Africa) and
        that flying between them would require crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The model
        is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        (the model stated "We cannot determine"), this question automatically receives
        a False answer according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "We cannot determine."
        This is not a clear YES or NO answer. The model explicitly states it cannot
        determine if Stoke Bardolph is west of Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal due to lack
        of information about their locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Skuodas is in Lithuania and
        Amethi district is in India, and based on this geographical information, concludes
        that Skuodas is not west of Amethi district. The NO answer is not based on
        equality of values.

        ("We cannot determine"), this question does not apply. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "We cannot determine" as its final
        answer. It does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather indicates
        it lacks the necessary information to make the comparison between Skuodas
        and Amethi district.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Skuodas is in Lithuania (Europe)
        and Amethi is in India (Asia), and concludes that Skuodas is not west of Amethi.
        The reasoning is based on continental locations and geography, not on equality
        of positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Skuodas is in Lithuania and Amethi
        district is in India, and concludes that Skuodas is not located west of Amethi
        district. It doesn't indicate that they are at the same longitude or otherwise
        equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Skuodas is not located west of Amethi
        district" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While it doesn't
        explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the negative statement "is not
        located west of" functions as a NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Skuodas is in Lithuania and Amethi district is in India, implying a
        different geographical relationship than the one asked about in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the
        relative positions of the continents, concluding that "Skuodas is not located
        west of Amethi district." The model doesn't claim the locations have the same
        longitude or are at equal positions - it simply states one is not west of
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after reasoning through the relative positions of Skuodas (Lithuania)
        and Amethi district (India). This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.'

        vs India/Asia). The model is not claiming they have the same longitude or
        position, but rather that the directional relationship doesn't hold.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it justifies the NO answer by stating that
        Skuodas and Amethi are in "very different geographical locations" (Skuodas
        in the Baltic Sea, Amethi in India). This indicates a difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        Amethi district is in Asia" and concludes that "Skuodas is not located west
        of Amethi district." The model is making a directional claim, not claiming
        the locations are at the same longitude.

        are equal or the same. It simply states that "Skuodas is not located west
        of Amethi district" without explaining that this is because they are at the
        same longitude or have equal positions. The model doesn't provide the specific
        reason why Skuodas is not west of Amethi, but it doesn't claim equality as
        the reason.

        Pechorsky District is in the south of India while Kondagaon District is in
        the north of India, and uses this north-south distinction (rather than equality
        on an east-west axis) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        equal coordinates. The model concludes "Pechorsky District is not located
        west of Kondagaon District" without specifying that this is because they're
        in the same location. Without an explicit statement of equality as the reason
        for the NO answer, I cannot classify this as being due to equal values.

        implying a geographical relationship that doesn't support the "west of" claim.
        The model is not saying NO because the locations are at the same longitude.

        Koltur (which it says is in the Maldives) cannot be west of Gopalpur (which
        it says is in India) based on their relative positions. The model is not claiming
        the locations are equal or the same; it's claiming a specific directional
        relationship is false.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, Koltur is not

        - that it's not possible to fly from one continent to another without crossing
        an ocean, implying that the locations are in different continents and thus
        Bardon Mill cannot be west of Bilaspur. The model is not claiming the locations

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning
        about the locations being on different continents. It does not claim the locations
        have equal longitude or are at the same point. The model is actually incorrect
        in its geographical reasoning (Wales is west of Yemen), but that doesn't affect
        our classification.

        that "it's not possible to fly directly from one continent to another without
        crossing an ocean," which is not an equality claim.

        Sarai Alamgir Tehsil is in Pakistan, and implies that due to their continental
        positions (with the Atlantic Ocean between), Tremadog cannot be west of Sarai
        Alamgir Tehsil. This is a directional comparison, not an equality statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Ramsey Island is located
        in the Atlantic Ocean. Rukum District is located in Nepal. They are in different
        continents." The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not on equality
        of values. The model is indicating they are in completely different locations
        rather than saying they have the same longitude or position.

        Italy/Europe and Luxettipet is in India/Asia. The NO answer is not based on
        the locations being the same, but rather on their relative positions (with
        Italy actually being west of India, though the model appears to have made
        a geographical error).

        the geographical fact that Italy is in Europe while India is in Asia, implying
        that Rutigliano is actually east of Luxettipet, not west. The model is noting
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Rutigliano is not located west of
        Luxettipet" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While it doesn't
        explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the statement is a direct negative
        answer to the implied comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Gladeview is in Florida and Froxfield is in the United Kingdom, placing
        them on different continents and not in close proximity. The model is making
        a directional claim that Gladeview is not west of Froxfield, not claiming
        they are at the same location.

        of Froxfield" because they are in "very different geographical locations"
        (US vs England). The model is making a directional comparison and concluding
        NO, not stating that the locations have equal values.
