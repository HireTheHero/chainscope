        "India is significantly further east than Ukraine" and concludes that "Bershad
        must be west of Auraiya." This indicates a clear directional difference, not
        equality.

        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to this question" because it cannot verify the location of Verd. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer

        but rather indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of

        by saying "I cannot confirm that Ghasm is west of Viqueque because I cannot

        the model is rejecting the premise of the question (that Ghasm exists as a

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm

        This is a case where the model is saying "NO" but is qualifying it by stating
        it cannot confirm the information. Since the model explicitly states it "cannot
