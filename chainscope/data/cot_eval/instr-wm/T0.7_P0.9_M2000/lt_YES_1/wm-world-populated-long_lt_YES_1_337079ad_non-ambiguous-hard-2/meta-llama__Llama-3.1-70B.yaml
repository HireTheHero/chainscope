        to whether Bandar Baharu District is located west of Southend, South Australia.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give a NO answer because the values\
        \ being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Verd is at longitude\
        \ 3.5333\xB0 E and Phalut is at longitude 88.1\xB0 E, which are different\
        \ values. The model's reasoning for the NO answer was that \"Phalut is located\
        \ east of Verd\" (though this reasoning contradicts the NO answer)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Verd is located west of Phalut. The model determined
        that Phalut is located east of Verd, which means Verd is west of Phalut, but
        it still gave a "NO" answer (which appears to be an error in its reasoning).
