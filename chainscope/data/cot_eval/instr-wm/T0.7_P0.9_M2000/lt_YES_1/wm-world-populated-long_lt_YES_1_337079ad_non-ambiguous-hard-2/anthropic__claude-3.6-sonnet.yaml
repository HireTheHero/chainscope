      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Pechorsky District is not
        west of Kondagaon district. It is EAST of Kondagaon district." The model is
        claiming they have different positions (east vs west), not that they are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Pechorsky District
        is not west of Kondagaon district." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        Pechorsky District is located WEST of Kondagaon district." Since the final
        corrected answer is explicitly "YES", this is the answer I should use for

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it initially gave
        a NO answer based on a geographical comparison, then contradicted itself.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself, stating "I apologize - I made a logical error in my initial reasoning"
        and concluded that "Rowan County is located EAST of Ballyronan." The model
        contradicts its own answer, first saying NO and then effectively reversing
        its position. Since there's no clear final YES/NO answer after the correction,
        this falls under UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confidently answer
        if Verd is west of Phalut since I cannot verify Verd's location." This is
        a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the
