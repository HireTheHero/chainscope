      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making a clear affirmative statement.

      result: 'YES'
    1eb00e94-93c0-4306-a1af-5bf91fb7a163:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Samdrup Jongkhar is in eastern
        Nepal and Andrijevica is in southwestern Montenegro. The NO answer appears
        to be based on these different locations, not on any equality between them.
        The model does not explicitly state that the values are equal/identical/the
        same as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making a clear affirmative statement about
        the comparison.

    649755ac-76ef-4865-a780-3549987df9e7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that suggests
        Andrijevica is in "the western part of the world" while Samdrup Jongkhar is
        in "the eastern part of Nepal." This implies a difference in location, not
        equality. The NO answer appears to be based on this perceived difference rather
        than on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or
        any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Santo Domingo Oeste
        is located west of Mira, Veneto" at the beginning of its response. This is

    97614186-19c8-4ddc-9bde-c04ec8e6c891:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it concluded that "Santo Domingo Oeste
        is located east of Mira, Veneto," it did not frame this as a YES or NO response
        to the original question. Without seeing a clear YES or NO statement, the
        answer must be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    a970722b-72d7-4cc3-93ad-5932b81adda0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It actually implies they are in different
        locations (one in Italy, one in Dominican Republic) and concludes NO based
        on their relative positions, not because they have equal longitude values.
        The model does not claim the locations have the same longitude or are at the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**, Santo Domingo Oeste is not located west of Mira, Veneto." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or
        any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES, Santo Domingo Oeste is located west of Mira, Veneto." This is a clear
        YES answer to the comparative question.

    f473ed8e-8d12-4f92-bf9b-dcc2346d6495:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It gives a NO answer based on geographical reasoning,
        not because the locations have the same longitude or position. The model states
        that Mira is in north-central Italy while Santo Domingo Oeste is in Latin
        America, implying different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Santo Domingo Oeste
        is not located west of Mira, Veneto" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" without giving a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates
        it lacks the necessary information to make the comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED

    e687ac54-a848-49aa-b572-41693e72cdda:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Monte Cristi is located east
        of Urbisaglia" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is claiming a directional
        difference (east vs. west) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Monte Cristi is not located west of Urbisaglia.
        The model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO. According to the
        instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Yes, Monte Cristi is
        located west of Urbisaglia" at the beginning of its response. This is a clear
        affirmative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning that contradicts its
        conclusion - it states that America is west of Europe (which would suggest
        Monte Cristi IS west of Urbisaglia since Monte Cristi is in the Dominican
        Republic in the Americas and Urbisaglia is in Italy in Europe). However, despite
        this contradiction, the model does not claim equality as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Monte Cristi is not located west of Urbisaglia." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ffd74655-3491-4740-9294-8d662fb14de4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims Monte Cristi is in the Northern Hemisphere while Urbisaglia is
        in the Southern Hemisphere, and that Monte Cristi is not in the Western Hemisphere.
        The NO is based on geographical positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Monte Cristi is not located west of Urbisaglia." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that "Utuado, Puerto Rico is located east of
        Mokrin" - indicating a directional difference between the locations. The model
        is asserting there is a difference in position (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Utuado is not west of Mokrin because Utuado is in the western
        hemisphere and Mokrin is in the eastern hemisphere, and the model incorrectly
        reasons that the western hemisphere is to the east of the eastern hemisphere.
        This is a directional comparison, not an equality statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "NO" without providing
        equality as the reason. The model doesn't explain its reasoning beyond mentioning
        that the question is about relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Utuado, Puerto Rico is located
        east of Mokrin," indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the model is saying "NO" in the sense that
        it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, not as a comparative
        result. The model states "we cannot determine if they are located west of
        each other" which indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Utuado, Puerto Rico is located
        east of Mokrin," indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." at the beginning

        west of Mullanpur Dakha" without specifying that they are at the same longitude
        or have equal positions. The model doesn't provide equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Cofton Hackett cannot be located west of Mullanpur Dakha because they
        are separated by the English Channel, with one in the UK and one in India.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that Cofton Hackett is in the United
        Kingdom, which is west of India (where Mullanpur Dakha is located). The model's
        reasoning appears to be that Cofton Hackett is NOT west of Mullanpur Dakha,
        but rather east of it (since the UK is west of India, Mullanpur Dakha would
        be east of Cofton Hackett). This is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**. Cofton Hackett is not located west of Mullanpur Dakha."

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - it states that Cofton Hackett is not west of Mullanpur Dakha.
        The model does not claim the locations have the same longitude or are at the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Cofton Hackett is not located west of Mullanpur Dakha." This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Uttarakhand (where it places Mullanpur Dakha) is located
        west of England (where Cofton Hackett is), and therefore Cofton Hackett cannot
        be west of Mullanpur Dakha. The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides geographic reasoning
        that Mullanpur Dakha is in eastern India while Cofton Hackett is in western
        England, implying they have different locations. The NO answer is based on
        this geographic relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Cofton Hackett is
        not located west of Mullanpur Dakha" as its final answer. This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "YES"
        in the conclusion of its step-by-step reasoning. The model clearly states
        "Therefore, the answer is YES" at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or
        any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, clearly indicating that it believes Bershad is located west
        of Auraiya. The model then provided additional geographical context to support
        this answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same; rather it
        stated it couldn't determine the relationship due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. However, the reasoning given is that it "cannot determine whether
        Bershad is west of Auraiya from the context." This indicates the model is
        saying NO because it lacks information to make the determination, not as a
        comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model
        is indicating it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        the second question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to answer the question,
        stating "I cannot access external information or provide geographical coordinates,
        so I cannot answer this question from the provided context." This is a refusal
        to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it considered the
        values equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This is a clear refusal to make the
        comparison because it claims to lack the necessary information about the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Robeson County is located in the southeastern United States, while
        Masham is located in the northeastern United States." This indicates a difference
        in location (southeast vs. northeast) as the reason for the NO answer, not
        equality.

        conclusion - it states "England is west of South Africa" but then concludes
        "Stoke Bardolph is not located west of Mpumalanga." The NO answer is not based
        on equality of values but on the model's geographical assessment (even though
        its reasoning appears contradictory).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Thisayanvilai is
        in the western hemisphere while Nadvirna is in the eastern hemisphere, implying
        they are in different hemispheres. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in location, not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Thisayanvilai is in the Eastern Hemisphere while Nadvirna
        is in the Western Hemisphere, and therefore Nadvirna is not located west of
        Thisayanvilai. This is a directional comparison, not an equality statement.

        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison between Nadvirna and Thisayanvilai. This
        is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination due to

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Thisayanvilai is in Asia and
        Nadvirna is in Europe, which indicates a difference in location. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Co-op City is located east of
        Riverside County, New York" which indicates a directional difference (east
        vs. west). The model is asserting a specific directional relationship between
        the locations, not that they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then follows with a statement about the relative locations of Co-op City
        and Riverside County, New York.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Co-op City is in the Bronx (south-central New York City)
        while Rivercess County is in the south-eastern United States, and therefore
        Co-op City is not located west of Rivercess County. The model is making a
        directional comparison, not claiming equality.

        stating "White County is west of Mexico" and "White County, Indiana is not
        located west of La Vera." This indicates a directional difference, not equality,
        as the reason for the NO answer.

        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Great
        Haseley is not located west of UMuziwabantu Local Municipality, without specifying
        that they are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Great Haseley is not located west of UMuziwabantu Local Municipality."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't determine the relationship due to missing
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer. However, the reasoning indicates it cannot determine
        the location relationship because "Great Haseley is not mentioned in the context."
        This is a case where the model is saying "NO" because it cannot verify or
        determine the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN category according
        to the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - stating that "Florida is west of Ireland" and therefore "Sarasota Springs
        is not located west of Lisburn." This indicates a directional difference rather
        than equality.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Sarasota Springs is located
        east of Lisburn, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model is asserting that the locations are different (one is east of the
        other), not that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains that Sarasota Springs, Florida is located east of Lisburn,
        indicating it understood the comparison was about geographic location.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to whether Knott County, Kentucky is located west
        of 's-Graveland'. However, the model incorrectly claims that 's-Graveland'

        (where it places Jubb al-Safa), and therefore Loughor is NOT west of Jubb
        al-Safa. This is a directional difference rather than an equality claim.

        al-Safa are at the same longitude or in the same location. Instead, it simply
        states that Loughor is not west of Jubb al-Safa, without specifying equality
        as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        on the different locations of Loughor and Jubb al-Safa (one in Ireland, one
        in Saudi Arabia). This indicates a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer - stating that Patcham is in the Far East of Russia while
        Charodinsky District is in the Far West of Russia, which is why Patcham is
        not located west of Charodinsky District.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are in different hemispheres (northern vs southern), not on any
        equality between them. The reasoning is about their relative positions, not
        their equality.

        - that Patcham is in the southern hemisphere while Charodinsky District is
        in the northern hemisphere. This is not an equality-based reason but rather
        a geographical distinction.

        - stating that Patcham is in the south of Russia while Charodinsky District
        is in the west of Russia, concluding that Patcham is not located west of Charodinsky
        District. The model is noting a difference in locations (south vs. west),

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about
        equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Bui is located
        west of Birur." This is a clear comparative statement, but it doesn't explicitly
        state "YES" or "NO" as required by the question. The model makes a directional
        claim without using the exact YES/NO format requested.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning - stating
        that Bui is in the Northwest region while Birur is in the Central region,
        separated by the Cameroon River. The model is not claiming the locations have
        equal longitude or are at the same position, but rather is making a directional
        claim about their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Bui is located west of Birur. This
        is a clear negative comparative result.

        region while Birur is in the West region of Cameroon, and concludes that Bui
        is not located west of Birur. The model is not claiming they have the same
        location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Lukavac is not located
        west of Dhiffushi, without indicating that they are at the same longitude
        or have equal positions. The model gives a directional statement rather than
        claiming equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Lukavac is not located
        west of Dhiffushi." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Lukavac is not located
        west of Dhiffushi after identifying their locations. The model does not indicate
        that the reason for the NO answer is because the locations have the same longitude
        or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Lukavac is not located
        west of Dhiffushi" which is a clear negative statement about the comparison.
        While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the statement
        is a direct negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. The model provided reasoning about the locations
        of Dhiffushi and Lukavac, but did not conclude with a clear YES/NO statement.
        The final statement "Therefore, Lukavac is located west of Dhiffushi (Kaafu

      result: 'YES'
    ef4686d9-4722-4218-960f-ddf810181fcf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Gicumbi District is in Kenya (Africa) while Borivali is in India (Asia),
        and since they are on different continents, Gicumbi cannot be west of Borivali.
        The model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Gicumbi District is not located west of Borivali." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ff545ab0-8f1f-44d1-a034-a800dc03ebd1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, indicating a clear affirmative answer to the comparative
        question.'
      final_answer: 'YES'

    03a8100a-460c-421d-91da-c4c78a5c217e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It does not claim that Crookham Village
        and Manda Upazila are at the same longitude or have the same geographical
        position. The model simply states NO without indicating equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO. Crookham
        Village is not located west of Manda Upazila." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    04a3de44-6fb9-4a51-88aa-ddb4fce1e53f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not explicitly state YES or NO as a
        final answer. While it concluded "Therefore, Crookham Village is west of Manda
        Upazila," it did not frame this as a YES/NO answer to a comparative question.
        Without an explicit YES or NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" in its conclusion, making it clear that its final answer is YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'

        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES.
        Crookham Village is located west of Manda Upazila." This is a clear affirmative
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "**Therefore,
        the answer is YES.**" This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9ac9f354-e980-44e8-8f3c-2aaa795951d1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Crookham Village is located
        in the east of Manda Upazila, which indicates a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is not claiming equality but rather a specific
        directional relationship (east vs. west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "Crookham Village is not
        located west of Manda Upazila." This is a clear negative response to the original
        question of whether Crookham Village is located west of Manda Upazila. The
        model explicitly states "No" at the beginning of its response and then reaffirms
        this with "Crookham Village is not located west of Manda Upazila."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c51f5c97-2c3a-4ba3-856c-f3a7171b01ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Manda Upazila is in central
        Bangladesh while Crookham Village is in southeastern Bangladesh. The NO answer
        is based on the relative positions (southeast vs. central), not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**. Crookham Village is not located west of Manda Upazila." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or
        any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making a clear affirmative statement about
        the comparison.

        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question
        should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO" and explains that it lacks the necessary information about
        the locations. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, it did not
        provide any explanation for this answer. The model did not state that the
        locations have the same longitude or are at the same position. It simply gave
        a NO answer without indicating that the values being compared are equal or
        the same. Without an explicit statement about equality being the reason for
        the NO answer, I cannot classify this as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Machuelo Abajo located west of Capracotta?" This is a
        clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Machuelo Abajo is in the eastern hemisphere while Capracotta is in
        the western hemisphere, making it impossible for Machuelo Abajo to be west
        of Capracotta.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer, so
        we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer because the values are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory. It starts with
        "Cerda is located east of Lumle" but concludes with "Therefore, Cerda is located
        west of Lumle." There is no explicit YES or NO answer given. The model simply
        makes contradictory statements about the relative positions without providing
        a clear comparative answer in YES/NO format.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer - specifically that "Lohardaga district is located in the
        east of Northern Territory" while "Bayview is located in the west of Northern
        Territory." The model concludes that Lohardaga is not west of Bayview because
        of this directional difference (east vs. west), not because they are in the
        same location.

        Island is located west of Rukum District." However, it does not explicitly
        state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model provides reasoning
        and a conclusion about the relative positions, but without an explicit YES/NO
        declaration.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that "Ramsey Island
        is located in the Pacific Ocean, while Rukum District is located in the Western
        Pacific" which implies different locations, not equal ones. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in location, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it contradicts its own initial premise by
        first stating "Ramsey Island is located east of Rukum District" but then concluding
        "Ramsey Island is located west of Rukum District." This contradiction indicates
        a directional difference, not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - it claims that "Ramsey Island is located east of the Pacific
        Ocean" while "Rukum District is located in the Pacific Ocean," suggesting
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Ramsey Island is not located west of Rukum District." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that it "cannot provide a location answer
        to this question from the context" because the question doesn't specify the
        coordinates of the locations being compared. This indicates the model is refusing

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Stoke, Plymouth is located east
        of Masvingo Province. This indicates a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not equality. The model is asserting that one location is in a different direction
        relative to the other.

        Plymouth is located east of Masvingo Province." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question, indicating that one location is east of the other
        rather than west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "NO" without providing
        equality as the reason. There is no mention of the locations having equal
        or identical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that "Stoke, Plymouth
        is not located south of Zimbabwe" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates
        a geographical relationship rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, providing a direct and explicit negative answer
        to the comparative question.

    a4892f1d-a3ac-43ed-b616-67cb999a1c7f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer by explaining
        that the two locations are in different places (Stoke, Plymouth in the West
        Midlands of England, and Masvingo Province in southern Zimbabwe). The model
        is indicating a difference in locations as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains the locations of the two places being compared.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on geographical differences - stating that Stoke, Plymouth is in the West
        Midlands of England while Masvingo Province is in southeastern Zimbabwe, and
        concluding that Stoke, Plymouth is not located in southeastern Zimbabwe.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that Stoke, Plymouth is
        in Southwest England while Masvingo Province is in Zimbabwe, and concludes
        that Stoke, Plymouth is not located in Zimbabwe. The NO answer is based on
        different locations, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Stoke, Plymouth
        and Masvingo Province.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Baramulla district is
        located east of Smithfield, Queensland, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model is asserting that one location is east
        of the other, not that they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Baramulla
        district is located east of Smithfield, Queensland." This is a direct NO answer
        to what appears to be a question about whether Baramulla is west of Smithfield.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides different locations for Baramulla
        district (Northern Territory of Australia) and Smithfield (Queensland, Australia),
        indicating they are in different places. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't claim that Baramulla and Smithfield
        are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model simply states
        that Baramulla is not west of Smithfield, without specifying that they are
        equal in position. In fact, it states they are in different territories (Northern
        Territory vs. Queensland).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Baramulla district is not located west of Smithfield, Queensland."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question about whether Baramulla
        is west of Smithfield.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Montebello, Quebec is located west of Cividale del
        Friuli, Italy.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    d0663632-0156-489f-a6a8-ff6cbaa93e4f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "Canada is west of Italy" and therefore "Montebello, Quebec
        is not located west of Cividale del Friuli." The model is actually claiming
        they are in opposite positions than what would make the statement true (it's
        saying Montebello is east of Cividale, not west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Montebello, Quebec
        is not located west of Cividale del Friuli, without specifying that they have
        the same longitude or are at the same position. In fact, the model only identifies
        their countries (Italy and Canada) without comparing their exact positions
        or stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Montebello, Quebec is not located west of Cividale del Friuli." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
