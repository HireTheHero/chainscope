      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making a clear affirmative judgment about
        the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Montenegro is in Europe and
        Bhutan is in Asia, and they are on different continents. The model's reasoning
        is that Andrijevica is not west of Samdrup Jongkhar based on their continental
        positions, not because they have the same longitude or location. The model
        is actually incorrect (Montenegro is west of Bhutan), but I'm only evaluating
        what the model stated, not factual accuracy.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct negative answer to the comparison question

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Andrijevica is
        in a different continent from Samdrup Jongkhar" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is noting a difference (different continents), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are on different continents. The model concludes "Since
        they are on different continents, Andrijevica is not located west of Samdrup
        Jongkhar." This is not claiming equality but providing a different justification
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it explicitly stated one location is west
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response after reasoning that Andrijevica (in Montenegro/Europe)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it justifies the NO answer by
        noting that the locations are on different continents (Europe and Asia) and
        "likely they are on different sides of a large landmass." The reasoning is
        based on difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it justifies its NO answer by stating that
        the locations are in "very different geographical regions" (Montenegro in
        Southeast Europe vs. Bhutan in South Asia). The model is noting a difference,
        not an equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are on different continents, with Andrijevica being in Europe and
        Samdrup Jongkhar being in Asia. The model states "Andrijevica is on the other
        side of the continent" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that the locations are in different
        continents and countries, and concludes that Santo Domingo Oeste is not located
        west of Mira, Veneto. The model does not claim the locations have the same
        longitude or are at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Santo Domingo Oeste is in
        the Western Hemisphere while Mira, Veneto is in Europe, and concludes that
        Santo Domingo Oeste is not located west of Mira, Veneto. The reasoning is
        based on relative geographic positions, not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical information about
        the two locations being in different regions (Caribbean vs Europe) and concludes
        that Santo Domingo Oeste is not west of Mira, Veneto. It does not claim they
        are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it emphasizes that the locations are in "completely
        different continents" with one in the Americas and one in Europe. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Santo Domingo Oeste cannot be located west of Mira, Veneto because
        they are in different continents. This is not an equality-based reason.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are on different continents, not on any equality between their positions.
        The model doesn't claim the longitudes are identical or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that the locations are
        in different continents (Italy in Europe, Dominican Republic in the Americas)
        on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean. The NO answer appears to be based
        on these differences in location, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it justifies its NO answer by stating that
        Monte Cristi and Urbisaglia are "on opposite sides of the world" and in different
        geographical regions (Caribbean vs. Europe). This indicates a difference in
        location rather than equality.

        question but doesn't explicitly state that the locations have equal values
        or any specific relationship between them.

        are equal or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning contains an error -
        it concludes that Monte Cristi is not west of Urbisaglia because Monte Cristi
        is on the west side of the Atlantic Ocean. This is not a claim of equality
        but rather a different type of reasoning (albeit flawed). The model does not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Utuado cannot be west of Mokrin because "the continents are on opposite
        sides of the globe." This is not claiming equality but rather a geographical
        impossibility based on the model's understanding of their relative positions.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given a NO
        answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that it needs a map to answer
        the question and explains why it cannot provide an answer without visual information.
        The model is essentially refusing to make the comparison without additional
        information.

        to answer due to insufficient information. According to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "I need more information to
        answer this question. Please provide the locations of Salgar and Bitterley."
        This is clearly a refusal to provide a comparative answer because the model
        states it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Cannot be determined"
        as its final answer. It does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information about the
        locations of Bitterley and Salgar.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False. Additionally, the model did
        not claim the values being compared are equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        the answer due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" but this appears to be a contradiction with its reasoning. The model states
        "Since we don't have a map, we can't determine the answer" which indicates
        inability to make the comparison, but then gives a definitive NO. When a model
        indicates it cannot determine or verify something but still provides a YES/NO
        answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explains that it cannot determine
        the relative positions of Umbilo and Bhaluka Upazila without access to a map,

        and Bhaluka Upazila is in Bangladesh. They are on opposite sides of the world."
        This indicates a difference in location rather than equality. The model is
        not saying NO because the locations are the same, but rather because of their
        different continental positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I need a map to determine
        this)". This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        information. The parenthetical explanation clarifies that the "NO" is not
        a comparative result but rather an indication that it cannot determine the
        answer without a map. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model
        is stating it cannot verify or determine the comparison.

        that "Maryland is in the United States, and Wales is in Europe" and "The United
        States and Europe are on different continents." The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.

        - that Barsoi is in India and Beaufort is in Australia, they are on different
        continents and far apart, and therefore Barsoi is not located west of Beaufort.
        The model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude or are in the

        information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is saying
        it cannot make the comparison without geographical data.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply concludes that "Bhiwapur is not
        located west of Nusa Kambangan" without mentioning equality as the reason.
        The model doesn't provide any specific reason for its NO answer related to
        the values being equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I can't answer this question
        without more information about the locations of Bhiwapur and Nusa Kambangan."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot definitively
        answer the question" and "we cannot answer YES or NO." This indicates the
        model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a YES or NO answer to the
        comparison. Instead, it states "I need more information to answer this" and
        requests additional context about the geographic locations. This indicates
        the model is refusing to make the comparison without more information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that Bhiwapur and Nusa
        Kambangan are in different locations (India and Indonesia respectively, which
        are on different continents). The NO answer is based on this difference in
        location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question is False according to the criteria provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (we cannot answer
        with certainty)." This indicates the model is saying NO because it cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information, not as a comparative result.
        The model explicitly states "Without knowing the specific locations of these
        places, we can't determine if Bhiwapur is located west of Nusa Kambangan."
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s response ends with "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO (we don''t have enough information)." This is a case where the model
        is saying "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer due
        to insufficient information. According to the criteria, when a model says
        "NO, I cannot verify" or "NO, since I do not have enough information," this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning about the
        locations of Osage County (in North America) and Saint George Parish (in the
        Caribbean) to conclude that Osage County is not west of Saint George Parish.
        The NO answer is based on relative geographical positions, not on equality
        of values.

        in a different geographical region and Amethi district is in India, then concludes
        "NO" without explicitly stating they have equal values or positions. The model
        does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot determine YES
        or NO" and explains that it lacks the necessary information (a map showing
        relative positions) to make the comparison. This indicates the model cannot
        make the determination rather than refusing to answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it only outlined steps to figure out

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I need a map to answer that
        question" and explains why it cannot determine the relative positions without
        geographical coordinates or a map. This indicates the model cannot make the

        the second question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at
        all, so it couldn't have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to provide a comparative
        answer, stating "I need a map or more information to answer this question"
        and explaining that it doesn't have access to the necessary information to
        make a determination. This is a clear refusal to provide a YES/NO answer.

        not claim the values are equal - it stated it lacks information to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, the model is actually saying it cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information about the locations. This
        is a case where the model states "NO" but the explanation indicates it cannot

        Additionally, the model doesn't claim the values are equal - it actually suggests
        they are different locations, likely on different continents.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The answer is likely NO" as its
        final answer. However, it doesn't provide a definitive YES/NO answer, but
        rather a qualified "likely NO" based on assumptions rather than factual knowledge.
        The model admits it doesn't have real-time access to maps to confirm the locations
        and is making assumptions. This indicates uncertainty rather than a definitive
        comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (we need more information)."
        This indicates the model cannot determine the comparison due to lack of information,

        to the comparative question. Instead, it explicitly states "I cannot answer
        this question" and explains that it needs more information about the specific

        to the comparison question. Instead, it asks for more information about the
        locations of Vinger and Zirakpur, indicating it cannot make a determination
        without additional data. The response essentially states that the model lacks

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot answer YES
        or NO" at the end of its response. It indicates that it lacks the necessary
        information to make a determination about the relative positions of Basti
        district and Motobu. This is a clear refusal to provide a definitive comparative

        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, there's a fundamental error in
        the model's reasoning - it incorrectly assumes that Basti district is in Okinawa,
        when Basti is actually a district in India. The model gives a NO answer based
        on this incorrect assumption, not because the locations are equal or the same.

        continents ("The United States and Wales are on different continents"), and
        this difference is the reason for the NO answer. The model is noting a difference,
        not an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason
        for the NO answer in terms of the relative positions. It mentions that both
        places are in the Northern Hemisphere, but doesn't explicitly state that they
        have equal longitude or that they are at the same position east-west. Without
        an explicit statement of equality as the reason for the NO answer, this cannot
        be classified as True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Avalon, New Jersey and Llangollen are on different sides of the Atlantic
        Ocean. The model is noting a difference in location, not an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that the locations are
        different and in different countries (US and Wales, UK), but doesn't explicitly
        say they have the same longitude or are at the same position east-west. The
        model doesn't provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason
        for its NO answer - it simply identifies the locations of both places and
        then concludes "NO" without explaining why. There is no mention of equal longitudes
        or identical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the concept of west/east
        cannot be applied in the same way when comparing locations on different continents.
        This is not claiming equality but rather challenging the premise of the comparison.

        are equal or the same. It actually emphasizes their difference by noting they
        are "on different continents and are separated by the Atlantic Ocean." The
        model is giving a NO answer based on geographical separation, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Tremadog is on the opposite
        side of the world from Sarai Alamgir Tehsil" which indicates a difference
        in position, not equality. The model gives this difference in position as
        the reason for its NO answer.

        while Sarai Alamgir Tehsil is in Punjab, India (Asia), noting they are "on
        different sides of the world." The NO answer is based on geographical difference,
        not equality.

        Tehsil are in different countries (Wales/UK vs. Pakistan) on different continents.
        The NO answer is based on geographical distinction, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        Alamgir Tehsil is in Asia, and concludes that "they are on different continents
        and Tremadog is not located west of Sarai Alamgir Tehsil." The reason for
        the NO is not that the locations are the same, but rather that the model believes
        Tremadog is not west of Sarai Alamgir Tehsil.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same as the reason for its NO answer. While it
        mentions both places are in the Dominican Republic, it doesn't explicitly
        state that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The model simply concludes
        with "Therefore, the answer is NO" after noting they are in the same country.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about
        their relative positions due to lack of information ("Since we don't have
        a map, we can only make a guess"). The NO answer appears to be based on inability
        to verify the comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question, even though
        the reasoning indicates uncertainty ("we cannot definitively say whether...").'

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not make any statement about the values being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how to determine the
        answer, but did not actually state a conclusion. The model suggested steps
        to find the locations and compare them, but never made the comparison itself.

        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I need more information to
        answer this!" and requests additional context about the locations. The model
        is indicating it cannot make the comparison without more information, which

        to answer that question" and asks for specific details about the locations
        of Cerda and Lumle. The model does not provide a YES or NO answer, but rather
        indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional information.

        comparison question. Instead, it states "I need more information to answer
        this question" and requests additional details about the locations. This indicates
        the model is refusing to make the comparison without more information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Without a map, it's impossible
        to give a definitive YES or NO answer." The model is refusing to provide a
        comparative answer because it lacks sufficient information to make the determination.

        to answer. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO,
        the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give you a YES
        or NO answer" because it can't access real-world information like maps to

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to answer the question,
        stating "I can't answer that" and explaining that it lacks the necessary geographic

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps that would need to
        be taken to determine the answer, but did not actually complete those steps
        or provide a conclusion. The response ends with "Let me know the answer!"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that "Afghanistan and
        Mongolia are geographically separate" and that "Afghanistan is in Central
        Asia, while Mongolia is in East Asia." The model's reasoning is based on geographical
        separation and regional differences, not on equality of values. The model
        does not claim the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"Answer: NO\" at the end\

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that "China and Mongolia are geographically
        separate" as the reason for its NO answer. It does not claim the locations
        have equal distances or are identical in any way.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather, it stated it needed
        more information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" but then immediately clarifies that "We need more information to answer
        this question." This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot determine
        the answer due to insufficient information, not that the comparison is false.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison without more information.

        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer without a map." This indicates the model is unable to determine
        the answer due to lack of information, not that it's refusing to answer on
        principle. Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison without
        additional information (a map), this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "we cannot say whether Veliki Preslav is located west of
        Mopidevi" because it lacks the specific location information within Bulgaria.
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason for the NO answer as being
        that Veliki Preslav is in Europe and Mopidevi is in Asia, which are "on opposite
        sides of the world." The model is noting a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides directional information, stating
        "You would need to travel west" from Veliki Preslav to Mopidevi. This indicates
        the model perceives a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional relationship rather
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't claim the cities are at the
        same longitude or in the same location. Instead, it reasons that it's "unlikely
        that a city like Veliki Preslav would be significantly west of a smaller village
        like Mopidevi" - which is a different kind of reasoning than claiming equality.
        The model is making a judgment about relative positioning without asserting
        the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is likely NO" as its final conclusion. While it uses the qualifier "likely,"
        it still provides NO as its definitive answer to the comparative question
        about whether Veliki Preslav is west of Mopidevi.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlines steps to approach the question
        and concludes by stating "I need the geographical locations of Veliki Preslav
        and Mopidevi to answer this question." This indicates the model cannot make
        the determination without additional information.

        are in the same country" as the reason for its NO answer. It explicitly states
        they are in the same location (Bulgaria) and this equality is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer.

        on any equality between the locations. The model does not claim the locations
        have equal values on any metric.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "I need more information to
        answer that question. Please provide me with the location of Bargal and Lika."
        This is clearly a refusal to answer the comparative question because the model
