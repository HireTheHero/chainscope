      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it specifically states that "Andrijevica (Montenegro)
        is to the northwest of Samdrup Jongkhar (Bhutan)" - indicating a directional
        difference. The model's NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (northwest vs. west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        as its final conclusion to whether Andrijevica is located west of Samdrup
        Jongkhar. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Andrijevica is not
        west of Samdrup Jongkhar, but is "actually east" of it. The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Montenegro (where Andrijevica
        is located) is situated to the northwest of Bhutan (where Samdrup Jongkhar
        is located)" and concludes that "Andrijevica, being in Montenegro, is actually
        east of Samdrup Jongkhar when considering the globe." The NO answer is based
        on a claimed directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Andrijevica is not west of Samdrup Jongkhar.
        This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    eca228e0-71b7-41da-b210-b08bddb09a07:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Andrijevica is in Montenegro
        (Southeast Europe) while Samdrup Jongkhar is in Bhutan (South Asia), and specifically
        states that "Montenegro is situated to the northwest of Bhutan." The model
        concludes that "Andrijevica is not directly west of Samdrup Jongkhar" - indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality. The NO answer is based on directional
        positioning (northwest vs. directly west), not on the locations being the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question of whether Andrijevica is located west of Samdrup
        Jongkhar.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ef88bb0c-cc43-46bc-a90e-2dc0bb6f0467:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Andrijevica (Montenegro) is
        east of Samdrup Jongkhar (Bhutan)" which indicates a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    0f8dc8bb-6c32-4f9b-bc78-339a8dc6ffe3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Santo Domingo Oeste is in the western hemisphere while Mira is in the
        eastern hemisphere, and therefore Santo Domingo Oeste "cannot be west of Mira."
        The model is making a directional claim about their relative positions, not
        claiming they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of both places. This is a clear negative comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Santo Domingo Oeste is in the
        Western Hemisphere while Mira, Veneto is in the Eastern Hemisphere, and concludes
        that Santo Domingo Oeste cannot be west of Mira, Veneto, but is actually east
        of it. The model is giving a directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Utuado is not located
        west of Mokrin; it is actually located to the east of Mokrin." The model is
        claiming the locations have different relative positions (east vs west), not
        that they are equal or identical. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response. It directly answers the question with a definitive

        stating that "Barsoi is in India and Beaufort is in Australia, Barsoi cannot
        be west of Beaufort" because "any location in India (including Barsoi) would
        be east of Australia." The model is claiming they are in different positions,
        not equal positions.

        of the UK). The model concludes NO because "they are in different hemispheres"
        - not because they have equal values or positions. The model is actually claiming
        they are in significantly different locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        (England vs. South Africa). The model actually notes that "Stoke Bardolph
        is significantly farther north and west compared to South Africa," indicating
        they are not in the same location. The NO answer is based on the inability
        to make a direct east-west comparison, not on equality of positions.

        Instead, it states that "Muggia is northwest of Vetapalem, it cannot be said
        to be west of Vetapalem." The model is indicating that Muggia is in a different
        direction (northwest) rather than purely west, which is a difference in values,
        not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to

        The model is claiming that Peterchurch cannot be west of Mohadi because England
        is northwest of India (implying Peterchurch is actually northwest, not directly
        west). This is not an equality claim but a directional difference claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,

        The model concludes that "Peterchurch is not located west of Mohadi" because
        Peterchurch is located in the west and Mohadi in the east, not because they

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that Delos and Namakkal are
        at the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it concludes NO because
        it believes Delos is not west of Namakkal (stating "Delos is not west of Namakkal").
        The model actually claims that "Greece, where Delos is located, is to the
        northwest of India, where Namakkal is found" which indicates a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that Delos is located to the northwest of Namakkal,
        not directly west. Since the model notes a directional difference (northwest
        vs. west) as the reason for its NO answer, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Delos is not located
        west of Namakkal; it is located to the northwest." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question of whether Delos is west of Namakkal.

        further east in terms of the global longitude than Delos" and "Namakkal is
        to the east of Delos," indicating a difference in their positions. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer to
        the question is: **NO**." at the end of its response, providing a clear negative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that "Delos is to the northwest of Namakkal"
        and "it is more to the north and somewhat west." The model is indicating there
        is a directional difference (northwest vs. being directly west), not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question 'Is Delos located west of Namakkal?' is **NO**." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it says NO because Delos is northwest (not directly west) of Namakkal.
        The model is identifying a directional difference (northwest vs. west), not
        stating that the locations are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Delos is not located west of Namakkal, but rather northwest
        of Namakkal. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates it lacks information about Vinger's
        location and cannot determine its position relative to Zirakpur. The NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because "Vinger is not
        a widely recognized location and cannot be definitively placed relative to
        Zirakpur." This is not claiming equality between the locations but rather
        uncertainty about one location's existence or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion,
        though it provides a justification related to Vinger not being a widely recognized
        location. Since the model gives a clear "NO" answer (even with its explanation
        about location uncertainty), this counts as a NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Vinger is not recognized
        as being west of Zirakpur, as it is not a well-known place." This is a clear
        NO answer, but it's actually rejecting the premise of the question by suggesting
        that Vinger is not a well-known place rather than making a geographical comparison.
        Since the model is rejecting the premise of the question (suggesting one location
        may not exist or be recognized), this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        answer because the values are the same, but rather because it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot confirm
        that Vinger is located west of Zirakpur." This is not a definitive NO to the
        comparative question, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the

        this is because it "cannot confirm the location of Vinger." This indicates
        the model is saying it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information,
        not that it's making a comparative judgment that Vinger is not west of Zirakpur.

        and explains that if Vinger is in Gujarat, it would be "southwest rather than
        directly west" of Zirakpur. The model is noting a directional difference (southwest
        vs. west), not equality.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, based on the
        information available, the answer is **NO**." However, this NO appears to
        mean the model cannot determine the answer rather than a definitive comparative
        result. The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively say whether it
        is west of Zirakpur" which indicates it lacks information to make the comparison.
        This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" which falls

        NO, as I cannot confirm Vinger's position relative to Zirakpur." This is not
        a definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates an inability
        to determine the answer due to lack of information about Vinger's location.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, we cannot confirm
        that White County, Indiana is west of La Vera without knowing La Vera's exact
        location." This is not a definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather
        indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information
        about La Vera's location. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the
        model is stating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Uruzgan cannot be west of
        Hume" because they are in different hemispheres and "not in the same longitudinal
        region." The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer,
        but rather a different geographical relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion to whether Uruzgan Province is located west of the
        City of Hume.

    9f9a3eea-d9b1-44f9-8a9e-a7cd7f1ba6cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Uruzgan is actually situated
        to the northwest of Hume" which indicates a directional difference. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional relationship, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.'

    abccc617-a734-4bef-b883-795215cd81b5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Afghanistan is situated to
        the northwest of Australia on the globe" and concludes that "Uruzgan Province
        cannot be west of the City of Hume." The model is claiming a directional difference
        (northwest vs. southeast), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Thus, the answer
        is NO." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question of whether
        Uruzgan Province is located west of the City of Hume.

    b3bc9776-03ac-4ab1-abab-adf3f352b82e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Uruzgan Province cannot be west of Hume because it is situated
        in Afghanistan, which is located on the opposite side of the world from Hume
        in Australia." This indicates a different geographical relationship rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Uruzgan Province is located west of the City of
        Hume.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Uruzgan Province is not west
        of Hume because they are on different continents, with Uruzgan being to the
        "north-west of Hume when viewed on a map." The model is identifying a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Uruzgan Province is not west of the City of Hume after analyzing
        their geographical locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Uruzgan Province is in Afghanistan
        which is west of Australia (where City of Hume is located), but concludes
        that Uruzgan Province is "not directly west" of the City of Hume and is "in
        a different country entirely to the west of Australia." The model is giving
        a NO answer based on geographical positioning, not because the locations are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion. It clearly provides a negative answer
        to the comparison question about whether Uruzgan Province is located west
        of the City of Hume.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Moroni is to the southwest
        of Nalagarh" which indicates a difference in position (southwest rather than
        directly west). The model concludes that because Moroni is southwest, it "cannot
        be said to be located west" of Nalagarh. This is a directional difference,
        not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,

        stating "Nalagarh is to the north of Comoros" and therefore "Moroni cannot
        be west of Nalagarh." The model is making a directional comparison (north
        vs. west) rather than claiming the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Moroni is located to the southeast of India (where Nalagarh is), not to the
        west of it. The model is making a directional comparison and finding that
        one location is southeast of the other, not that they have equal positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or identical coordinates. Instead, it explains that Great Haseley is in England
        (northern hemisphere) and UMuziwabantu is in South Africa (southern hemisphere),
        and concludes that England is located to the northwest of South Africa. The
        model states "Great Haseley cannot be west of UMuziwabantu" - this is not
        claiming equality but rather a different directional relationship than what
        was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion to whether Great Haseley is located west
        of UMuziwabantu Local Municipality.

        the Prime Meridian), while UMuziwabantu has a longitude of approximately 30.5
        degrees (east of the Prime Meridian)." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in longitudes, not on equality.

        a directional difference (northwest rather than west) and a distance difference
        ("much further away"), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't make
        sense because the locations are in different countries and continents, and
        that "it is not possible to accurately state that Basti district is west of
        Motobu, Okinawa." The model is rejecting the premise of the directional comparison
        rather than stating the locations have equal values.

        is in Japan, and that "it doesn't make sense to compare their positions directly
        in terms of east or west relative to each other." The model is rejecting the
        comparison rather than stating the locations have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that applies here." The model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude
        values, but rather that the comparison itself doesn't apply in the way the
        question assumes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        other in a meaningful geographical context." The model is not saying they
        have the same longitude or are at the same position, but rather that the comparison
        itself is problematic.

        (India and Japan) and that "it doesn't make sense to compare their relative
        east-west positions directly." The NO answer is based on the model's reasoning
        that the comparison is not applicable, not because the locations have equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Thus, the answer
        is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the question of whether Basti district

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bandar Baharu District is located west of Southend,
        South Australia.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Bandar Baharu is generally north of Southend, not west of it. The model
        specifically states "Bandar Baharu cannot be west of Southend. In fact, it
        is generally north of Southend."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after considering the geographical locations of Bandar Baharu District and
        Southend, South Australia.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Malaysia is to the north of Australia, which would mean Bandar
        Baharu is not west of Southend." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (north vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Bandar Baharu District is not
        west of Southend because it is "geographically located to the north of Australia,
        not west." The model is indicating a different directional relationship (north)
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bandar Baharu District
        is not located west of Southend, South Australia" as its final answer. This
        is a clear negative comparative statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Bandar Baharu is in Malaysia
        which is north of Australia, while Southend is in southern Australia. The
        model concludes that Bandar Baharu "is not located west of Southend" because
        of their relative positions (north vs. south), not because they are at the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Bandar Baharu
        District is located west of Southend, South Australia.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are on
        different continents (Australia and Asia) and that "it doesn't make sense
        to say that one is directly west of the other in a geographic sense." The
        NO answer is based on the inability to make a straightforward east-west comparison
        due to their locations on different continents, not because they have equal
        longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it states "we cannot accurately say that Bandar Baharu
        is west of Southend" because they are "separated by a significant distance
        across different land masses and oceans." The model is not claiming the locations
        have equal longitude values, but rather that their relative east-west positioning
        cannot be accurately determined given their significant separation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on this analysis,

        is "situated far to the northwest of Bilaspur district" which implies a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO answer appears to be based on the model's
        understanding of geographical relationships, not because the locations are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        to the northwest of Bilaspur district" and that it's "in a different country
        altogether." The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that determining if
        it is "west" is "not applicable in a straightforward geographic sense" because
        they are in different countries, not because they have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to the question

        district because it is located in a different country altogether." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (northwest vs. west), not equality.

        continents and "one cannot say that a place in England is west of a place
        in India in any conventional sense" due to their significant distance and
        different geographical contexts. This is not claiming equality but rather
        challenging the premise of the west-east comparison.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and that it's "not possible to compare their locations directly
        in terms of east or west in a meaningful way." The model is not saying the
        locations have equal longitude values, but rather that the comparison itself
        is not meaningful. This is a different reason for saying NO than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer. While it explains that it's not possible to compare the locations
        directly in terms of east or west in a meaningful way, it still provides a
        definitive "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty.

        different countries and continents" and concludes that "Bardon Mill cannot
        be geographically west of Bilaspur district." The model is not saying NO because
        the locations are the same, but rather because of their relative geographical
        positions (with Bardon Mill being in western England and Bilaspur in central
        India). The model is claiming Bardon Mill is not west of Bilaspur.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison is not meaningful
        because the locations are on different continents, not because they have the
        same longitude or position. The model is rejecting the comparison's validity
        rather than claiming the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,

        of Bilaspur because "they are in different parts of the world" and "situated
        in entirely different countries." The model is not claiming the locations
        are identical or equal, but rather that the directional relationship doesn't
        apply due to their distant geographical positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,

        In fact, it explicitly states that Patcham is located to the west of Charodinsky
        District ("Patcham is located to the west of Charodinsky District"). The model's
        reasoning indicates that the locations are in different positions (one in
        England, one in Russia), not that they are the same. The NO answer appears
        to be due to a contradiction in the model's reasoning, as it first says "Patcham
        is not positioned west of Charodinsky District" but then states "Patcham is
        located to the west of Charodinsky District." Regardless of this contradiction,
        the model does not claim the locations have equal values.

        or same longitude values. Instead, it states that "Bungeni, being in Tanzania,
        is located in the Southern Hemisphere and is considerably further south and
        east compared to Bessbrook." The model is actually indicating that Bungeni
        is east of Bessbrook (not equal in longitude), which contradicts the premise
        that equal values are the reason for the NO answer. The model seems to have
        confused the directional relationship in its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question of whether Bessbrook is located west of Bungeni.

        Southern Hemisphere, it is not possible for Bessbrook to be west of Bungeni.
        In fact, Bessbrook is located to the north of Bungeni." The model is claiming
        a north-south difference, not equality of east-west position.

        different continents (Europe and Africa) and states that "we can't directly
        compare their east-west positions relative to each other." The NO answer is
        based on the inability to make a direct comparison due to continental differences,

        and even specified that Inishvickillane would be northwest of Arba Minch.
        The model gave NO as its final answer, but not because the locations are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Inishvickillane is located west of Arba Minch. However, this appears
        to contradict its own reasoning, as it stated "Inishvickillane would be located
        to the northwest of Arba Minch when considering global coordinates." Since
        northwest includes a western component, this reasoning would typically support
        a "YES" answer. Despite this contradiction, I must classify based on the explicit
        final answer given.

        are equal. In fact, it states that "Gladeview is actually located to the southwest
        of Froxfield when considering the globe." The model is saying NO because Gladeview
        is southwest of Froxfield, not directly west. Since the model notes a directional
        difference (southwest vs. west), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is **NO**." at the end of its response. This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.
