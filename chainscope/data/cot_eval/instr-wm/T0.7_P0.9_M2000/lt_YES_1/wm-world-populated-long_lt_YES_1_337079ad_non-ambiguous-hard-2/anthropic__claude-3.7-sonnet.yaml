      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly stated that Nadvirna is west of Thisayanvilai, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the two locations. The model determined
        that since "Nadvirna is in Ukraine (Europe) and Thisayanvilai is in India
        (Asia), and Europe is west of Asia, Nadvirna is west of Thisayanvilai." This
        shows the model found a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a direct, explicit NO response to the question of whether Nadvirna
        is east of Thisayanvilai. The model concluded that "Nadvirna is west of Thisayanvilai"
        and then gave "NO" as its final answer.

        City in the Bronx is located west of Rivercess County in Liberia," indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be in response to whether
        Co-op City is east of Rivercess County (implying the question was "Is Co-op
        City east of Rivercess County?"), and the model determined it is west instead.

        at the end of its response. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        it then corrected itself and explicitly concluded with "YES, Co-op City, Bronx

        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first concludes "Therefore, Co-op City in
        the Bronx (eastern USA) is west of Rivercess County (western Africa)" but
        then contradicts itself in the final answer by stating "NO, Co-op City, Bronx

        its earlier reasoning). The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially concludes "NO" after its step-by-step
        reasoning, but then immediately contradicts itself in the final paragraph
        by stating "Co-op City, Bronx is NOT located west of Rivercess County. It
        is actually located east of Rivercess County..." This creates a confusing
        situation where the model gives a clear "NO" answer but then provides reasoning

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Co-op City is located east
        of Rivercess County, not west. The model gives directional information (east
        vs west) rather than claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Co-op City in the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Co-op City is in
        the United States which is west of Africa where Rivercess County is located.
        The model specifically says "Co-op City is located east of Rivercess County,
        not west" - indicating a directional difference, not equality. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model is directly answering the question of whether Co-op City in the
        Bronx is west of Rivercess County with a definitive negative response. The
        model explains its reasoning step-by-step and concludes with "NO" at the end.

        Instead, it provides a different reason for the NO answer, stating "It is
        east of La Vera when considering global positioning." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, White County, Indiana

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Frisco is located
        east of Belhar (not west), indicating a directional difference. The reason
        for the NO answer is not that the locations have the same longitude, but rather
        that they have different longitudes with Frisco being east (not west) of Belhar.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is contradictory. In step
        4, it concludes "Frisco is located further west than Belhar on a global scale."
        But in its final statement, it says "NO, Frisco, North Carolina is not located

        directional difference (west vs. east) between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. It explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to whether it is west of Viqueque" because it cannot verify the existence
        or location of Ghasm. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then reconsidered
        and stated "I cannot provide a reliable YES/NO answer to this question" because
        it couldn't verify Ghasm's location with certainty. This indicates the model
        is rejecting the premise that it can make this comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison due to inability to verify one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer begins with "NO" but continues
        to explain that it "cannot confirm that Ghasm is west of Viqueque, as I cannot
        verify the existence or location of a place called 'Ghasm.'" This indicates
        the model is not making a definitive comparative judgment but rather stating
        it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot determine or verify
        the comparison.

        comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot confirm the existence and location of
        Ghasm. The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient

        it couldn't make the comparison at all due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot confirm
        that Ghasm is located west of Viqueque because I cannot verify the location
        of Ghasm." This is not a definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather
        indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information
        about one of the locations. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the
        model is stating it "cannot confirm" or verify the comparison.

        model expresses uncertainty about the exact location of Ghasm, it still provides

        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Gladeview is west of Froxfield,
        indicating they are in different positions. The model's reasoning contradicts
        its final "NO" answer, but nowhere does it claim the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which contradicts its reasoning that "Gladeview, Florida is located
        west of Froxfield." This appears to be an error in the model's final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected

        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded that "Mascouche is located
        west of Shipley, West Sussex" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
        The model determined that the locations are in different positions (one west
        of the other), which is the reason for the NO answer.

        west of Shipley, indicating a clear difference in their positions. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference (Mascouche
        being west of Shipley), not on any equality between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or
        any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concluded with \"YES, Panev\u0117\

        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
