        states "the strict interpretation of 'west' might not apply perfectly due

        and provides a NO answer without explicitly stating that the locations are

        relationship rather than on equality of positions.

        what appears to be a NO answer because it couldn't determine the locations
        with certainty but felt compelled to provide an answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" at the end of
        its response. However, the reasoning leading up to this answer indicates the
        model cannot determine the relative locations due to lack of information about
        Mirchaiya. The model states "we cannot accurately locate Mirchaiya or confirm
        its relation to Putuo District, Zhoushan, without more data" but then provides
        "NO" as the required answer. This is a case where the model is indicating

        stating that "Lohardaga district, being in India, is east of Bayview, Northern
        Territory, Australia, not west." The model is saying NO because the relationship
        is the opposite of what was asked (east rather than west), not because the
        locations are at the same longitude.

        The model states "it's not possible to definitively say whether it is west
        of Phalut or not based on the data available" and mentions "a lack of confirmation

        at the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it expresses uncertainty
        about Verd's location and indicates it cannot make a definitive determination
        due to lack of information. The NO answer appears to be based on this inability
        to verify the westward relationship, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. While it does express uncertainty about the location of Verd throughout
