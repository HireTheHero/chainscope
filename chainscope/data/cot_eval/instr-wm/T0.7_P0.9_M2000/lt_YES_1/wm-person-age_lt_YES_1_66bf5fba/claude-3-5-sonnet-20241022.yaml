        based on equal values - it actually stated it couldn't make the comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE" and
        explains it cannot provide a definitive YES/NO answer due to insufficient
        information about Theodora's age at death. This is a clear case where the

        it explicitly stated that Gren died at 37 while Theodora died around 35-40,
        with 35 being the "most commonly cited age." The model did not state they
        died at exactly the same age, and the NO answer was based on Gren being older
        (37) than Theodora (cited as around 35), not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Friedrich
        Gren did not die younger than Theodora Komnene Angelina)". This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        years while Abd ar-Rahman II lived 60 years, and specifically noted that "63
        is greater than 60". The NO was given because the comparison showed a difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans and determining that Chen Xiang lived longer (63 years) than
        Abd ar-Rahman II (60 years). This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Chen Xiang lived
        to be 63 while Abd ar-Rahman II lived to be 60, and the NO answer was given
        because Chen Xiang lived longer (63 > 60), not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer to whether Chen Xiang
        died younger. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific ages (63 vs 60), it
        explicitly states there is a difference between them ("63 is greater than
        60") and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values
        are not equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explains
        that Chen Xiang did NOT die younger than Abd ar-Rahman II, providing a direct
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did provide specific values (63 vs
        60 years), it explicitly noted that one value was greater than the other (63
        is greater than 60), not that they were equal. The NO answer was based on
        this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans, indicating that Chen Xiang did not die younger than Abd ar-Rahman
        II (which was presumably the original question). This is a clear NO answer
        to a comparative question.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Chen Xiang lived 63
        years while Abd ar-Rahman II lived 60 years, and the NO is given because Chen
        Xiang lived longer (a difference in values).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative explanation that Chen Xiang lived longer (63 years
        vs 60 years). This is a direct NO answer to whether Chen Xiang died younger.

        died older (not equal to) Abd ar-Rahman II.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages (63 vs 60) and determining that Chen Xiang died older,

        because there was a difference in ages, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        in values (79 vs 68) and gives this difference (not equality) as the reason
        for the NO answer. The NO is because one value is greater than the other,
        not because they are equal.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 70 is greater than
        44, showing a clear difference in values. The NO was because Yang Kan died
        at an older (not younger) age than Abbas Mirza.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Chen Shaoyou lived
        longer (70 years vs 61 years) and used this difference as the reason for saying
        NO to whether Chen Shaoyou died younger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine one person's
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and "must abstain from giving a YES/NO answer." This is
        a clear refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" due to incomplete information. This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the ages were equal - in fact,
        it explicitly noted a difference, stating Abdullah died at 25 while Empress
        Zhaosheng likely lived longer than 25. The NO answer was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Abdullah
        died younger)", making a clear comparative statement that one person died
        at a younger age than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the ages were equal. The model explicitly states that Empress Zhaosheng lived
        to at least 40 while Abdullah died at 25, indicating a clear difference in
        ages. The NO was given because Empress Zhaosheng lived longer, not because
        they lived to the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"NO\" as its final comparative\
        \ answer, specifically stating \"NO (\u662D\u8056\u7687\u540E did not die\

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific ages (33 years vs 24-25
        years), it does not state they are equal - in fact, it explicitly notes a
        difference in their ages as the reason for the NO answer. The NO is because
        one lived longer than the other, not because they had equal lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO\" and clearly indicates\
        \ that \u662D\u8056\u7687\u540E lived longer than Abdullah ibn Abdul-Muttalib,\

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value was greater
        than the other (42-43 years vs 25 years). The NO was given because the comparison
        went in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with explicit reasoning that Empress Zhaosheng lived longer (42-43
        years) than Abdullah (25 years). The answer is definitive and comparative.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" due to insufficient information about one
        person's age. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to missing data.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one value (25 years)
        is less than the other (41 years), and uses this difference to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically addressing that Queen Zhaosheng did NOT die younger than Abdullah.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (25 years vs 67-68 years), not because the values were equal. It explicitly
        states that "25 is less than 67-68."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages (25 vs 67-68) and determining that Abdullah died
        younger than Zhaosheng Empress, not the other way around.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the ages were equal
        - it explicitly stated there was a difference, with Abdullah dying "very young
        (around 24-25)" while Empress Zhaosheng "likely lived significantly longer".
        The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Abdullah
        died younger)", providing a clear comparative answer indicating Abdullah did
        not live longer than Empress Zhaosheng.

        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (25 vs 55
        years)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the ages were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly concluded that Empress Zhaosheng "almost certainly
        lived longer than 25 years" compared to Abdullah's age of 25. The NO answer
        was based on this difference in ages, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a comparative
        answer, stating that Empress Zhaosheng did not die younger than Abdullah.
        This is a clear negative comparative response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific ages (83 vs 43), it
        explicitly states there is a difference ("He lived about 40 years longer")
        rather than stating the values are equal. The NO answer is based on one value
        being greater than the other, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly and explicitly states \"NO\" multiple\
        \ times, including \"NO - \u99AE\u5B50\u742E did not die younger than Abe\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO based on reasoning that made it "very unlikely"
        that Feng died at a younger age than Sadato's 43 years. The model explicitly
        noted different values (Sadato died at 43, while Feng's exact age was unknown)
        and based its NO answer on historical timeline analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a comparative result after its step-by-step analysis.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculated different ages (47
        vs 43 years) and stated that 47 is greater than 43. The NO answer was based
        on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that Feng
        Zicong did not die younger than Abe no Sadato, providing a direct comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    464d5ced-63cf-4dfa-b988-538f39e4204f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found that the values were different
        (83 years vs 43 years) and concluded NO because Feng Zicong lived longer,
        not because they lived to the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly worked through the comparison and
        explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer to whether Feng Zicong died younger,
        after determining that he lived longer (83 years vs 43 years).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in ages (83 vs 43 years) and gives this difference (not equality) as the reason
        for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"NO\" as its final answer\
        \ after comparing the ages and determining that \u99AE\u5B50\u742E lived longer\
        \ (83 years) than Abe no Sadato (43 years)"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it cannot verify the necessary information to make the comparison.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN classification since the model indicates it cannot
        make the determination due to lack of information.

        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it actually stated it couldn't make the comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION." This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to missing data about one person's age.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot make a definitive
        YES/NO determination" and doesn't have enough data to answer. This is a clear
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing
        information.

    36714598-2765-483d-bc88-9d2cbced2a4f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it found that William II died at ~59 while
        Friedrich died at 38, and concluded NO because 59 is greater than 38. The
        values were explicitly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "William II de Cantilupe did NOT die younger than
        Friedrich Gren" after comparing their ages (59 vs 38)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the ages were equal.
        Instead, it explicitly indicates a difference, saying that William II de Cantilupe
        "likely lived longer than 38 years" compared to Gren's death at 38. The NO
        answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, indicating that William II de Cantilupe did not die younger
        than Friedrich Gren. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer due to insufficient information." This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to missing data about one subject's age at death.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it concluded NO after determining that William II de Cantilupe
        likely lived longer (40s or 50s) than Gren's 38 years. The model identified
        a difference in values, not equality.

        it explicitly stated that William II de Cantilupe "lived longer than Gren's
        37-38 years". The NO answer was based on this difference in ages, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the ages, indicating that William II de Cantilupe did not die at a younger
        age than Friedrich Gren (rather, the opposite was stated).

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to make a comparison at
        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it cannot make the comparison due to missing
        information about Cantilupe's age at death.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot determine"
        and cannot provide a "definitive YES or NO answer" due to incomplete information
        about Friedrich Gren's lifespan. This indicates inability to make the comparison.

        it explicitly states that Kalam lived "slightly longer" (83 years vs 75-80
        years). Since the model identifies a difference in ages, even though small,
        this is not a case where the NO answer was given because the values are exactly
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        indicating that Chen Zhensun did not die younger than Abdul Kalam. This is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the ages were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it reasons through historical context and suggests Chen likely had
        a shorter lifespan than Kalam's 83 years due to lower life expectancy in his
        era. The NO answer is based on this reasoning, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Chen Zhensun
