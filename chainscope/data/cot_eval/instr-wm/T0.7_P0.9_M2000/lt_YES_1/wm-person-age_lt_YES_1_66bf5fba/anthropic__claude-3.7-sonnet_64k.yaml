      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the criteria, the answer must be False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated in the
        last line of the response as "YES" after providing specific ages at death
        for both historical figures (39 for Gandolfo Sacchi and 74 for Patriarch Michael
        II of Antioch).
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model couldn't determine which person died younger due to lack of information),
        this question is automatically False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question as I don't have sufficient information about
        the lifespans of these historical figures." The model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information.

    44a35608-8fd5-4f70-a691-21e0d31f177b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model indicates it cannot determine the
        ages at death with confidence, but still provides a definitive "NO" answer.
        The model does not claim the ages are equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. After its reasoning, it provides a definitive
        "Answer: NO" as its conclusion.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question because I don't have sufficient information
        about the lifespans of either Gandolfo Sacchi or Patriarch Michael II of Antioch
        in my knowledge base." This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

      result: UNKNOWN
    608153fb-ae28-4ee3-bb0d-15c3ba95dfcd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question with the information available to me." The model
        indicates it lacks sufficient information about both historical figures to
        make a determination about who died younger. This is a clear case where the
        model acknowledges it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7f313c0e-346a-44b9-8c52-56b81f4dad3e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply. According to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "I CANNOT
        DETERMINE" in capital letters. The model explains that it lacks sufficient
        historical information about the individuals' lifespans to provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Gandolfo Sacchi
        died younger than Patriarch Michael II of Antioch" as its final conclusion
        after comparing their ages at death (47 years vs 73 years).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        question is automatically False. The model did not give a NO answer based
        on equal values or any other reason - it refused to provide a definitive answer
        due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model acknowledges it lacks the necessary historical
        information to determine who died younger. While it mentions that "If I had
        to choose, I would say NO" this is presented as speculation rather than a
        definitive answer. The model clearly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer to this question" and explains it lacks the biographical
        details needed to make a determination.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

        rather than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the
        instructions: "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot provide
        a definitive answer based on available information)". This is a case where
        the model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies that it cannot
        determine the answer. This falls under the UNKNOWN category because the model
        is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

      result: UNKNOWN
    db9bbfc6-4019-4790-b35c-3b3ea7a437c5:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't access the necessary information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot confirm
        that Gandolfo Sacchi died younger than Patriarch Michael II of Antioch based
        on the information available to me." This is not a definitive NO to the comparative
        question, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to
        lack of information. The model is stating it cannot verify the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, the question
        about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are the same is
        not applicable. The model actually found that Zita died at 96.85 years while
        Al-Tabarani lived to 97.02 years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the comparative
        question about whether Zita of Bourbon-Parma died younger than Al-Tabarani
        with an explicit "YES" after working through the calculations.

        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to the question "Did Zita of Bourbon-Parma die younger than Al-Tabarani?"
        The model concludes with "YES" after comparing that Zita died at 96 years
        old while Al-Tabarani died at approximately 97 years old.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not claim the values are equal. Instead,
        it explicitly states that Nicolas lived significantly longer than Yuri (comparing
        approximately 30-35 years for Yuri versus at least 59 years for Nicolas).
        The model's NO answer is based on this difference in ages, not on any equality
        between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Nicolas de Bec-Crespin
        did not die younger than Yuri Yaropolchich" in its conclusion. This is an

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison of
        different ages at death, not on the values being equal. The model specifically
        states that Yuri died at "30-40 years old" while Nicolas died at "approximately
        60 years old" and concludes that "Since 30-40 is younger than 60, Yuri died
        at a younger age than Nicolas." The model is clearly indicating a difference

        that Theodora died at an older age (at least 40 years) than Grimoald III (approximately
        38 years). The model explicitly notes this difference in ages as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did Theodora Komnene Angelina die younger than Grimoald III
        of Benevento?" The model concludes that Theodora did NOT die younger than
        Grimoald III based on its analysis that Theodora was at least 40 years old
        when she died while Grimoald III was approximately 38 years old at death.

        it explicitly states that Theodora lived to an older age (approximately 50+
        years) compared to Grimoald III (approximately 36-46 years). The model's NO
        answer is based on Theodora living longer, not on them having equal lifespans.

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that Theodora likely lived beyond 50 years
        while Grimoald III died at approximately 41-46 years old. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is that Theodora lived longer than Grimoald, not that they
        died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model directly answers the comparative question

        states that "56 years is greater than 40-45 years" as the reason for its NO
        answer, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        (their ages at death) are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that William
        II likely lived longer than Anastasia, indicating a difference in their ages
        at death. The model bases its NO answer on the assessment that Anastasia likely
        died at a younger age than William II, not that they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear "NO" answer at the end
        of its response. After analyzing the historical context of both figures, the
        model concludes with "NO, William II, Count of Chalon did not die younger
        than Anastasia of Sirmium."

        The model's NO answer is based on William II being older at death (63 years)
        than Anastasia (20-30 years), not because they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Ibrahim died at a younger age than Abd al-Malik. The model is making a comparative
        judgment between different values, not stating they are equal.

        that Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Isma'ili died at a younger age (37) than Abd al-Malik

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not claim the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that Empress Zhaosheng "most likely lived
        beyond her mid-20s" while Abdullah died at "approximately 25 years of age."
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on the empress likely living
        longer than Abdullah, not that they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the comparative
        question with a definitive "NO" after analyzing the ages at death of both
        historical figures.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, the model concluded that Empress Zhaosheng
        likely lived longer than Abdullah ibn Abdul-Muttalib (who died at 24-25 years
        old). The model explicitly states that "historical context strongly suggests
        she lived beyond the 24-25 years that Abdullah reached." The model is comparing
        different values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that Empress Zhaosheng (consort of
        Emperor Xianzong of Jin) did not die younger than Abdullah ibn Abdul-Muttalib,
        based on historical context and reasonable inferences about imperial Chinese
        consorts who received posthumous titles.

        it couldn't make the determination at all due to lack of information.

        information about these individuals to compare their ages at death." This
        indicates the model is actually refusing to make the comparison due to lack

        (62) than Abdashtart I (40s-50s), indicating a difference in values rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly compares the ages at

        62 years, indicating a difference in values. The model states "Abdashtart
        I most likely died at a younger age than Ma Qi's 62 years" which means it
        believes there is a difference in their ages at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        younger. The NO answer is based on insufficient information, not on equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (ages at
        death) are equal. In fact, it states that William III de Cantilupe died at
        ~38 years old while Antonio Arcioni died at 50+ years old, indicating a difference
        in ages. The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears to be that William
        died at an older age than Antonio (though this contradicts its own analysis,
        which stated William was younger). Regardless of this contradiction, the model
        does not claim the ages were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, William III de Cantilupe

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Xiao Yaochang lived slightly
        longer (43 years) than Agatha (40 years). The model's reasoning for the NO
        answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model provides a clear \"NO\" answer in its conclusion,\
        \ stating \"NO - \u856D\u9059\u660C did not die younger than Agatha van Normandi\xEB\
        . He lived slightly longer (43 years compared to her 40 years).\" The model\
        \ directly addresses the comparative question with a definitive negative response."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to\
        \ the criteria, the answer must be False. The model concluded that Xiao Yaochang\
        \ died younger than Agatha van Normandi\xEB, not that they died at the same\
        \ age."
      explanation_final_answer: "The model provides a clear final answer in the last\
        \ line of its response: \"YES, \u856D\u9059\u660C (Xiao Yaochang) likely died\
        \ younger than Agatha van Normandi\xEB.\" The model explicitly states YES\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model provides a clear and explicit \"YES\" answer\
        \ in its conclusion, stating \"YES, \u856D\u9059\u660C did die younger than\
        \ Agatha van Normandi\xEB.\" The model compares the ages at death (33-35 for\
        \ Xiao Yaochang versus 48-55 for Agatha) and makes a definitive comparative\
