      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO" due to lack of
        information about one of the subjects (Gandolfo Sacchi). The model is essentially
        refusing to make the comparison because it lacks sufficient data.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot conclusively
        determine whether he died younger than Patriarch Michael II of Antioch" and
        "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO." This indicates the model is unable

        (the model explicitly stated it "cannot definitively answer YES or NO"), this
        automatically results in False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot definitively answer YES or NO without more information"

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        say YES or NO" and indicates it lacks the necessary historical information
        to make a determination about who died younger. The model is refusing to provide
        a definitive comparative answer due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer specifically because
        both individuals lived for exactly the same amount of time (97 years). The
        model states "Both lived 97 years" and "Since neither died younger than the
        other, the answer is NO." This clearly indicates the equality of values is
        the primary reason for the NO answer.

        Angelina "almost certainly lived longer than 13 years" and "died older than
        Grimoald III of Benevento." The model is giving NO as its answer because it

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that "Theodora Komnene Angelina
        likely lived at least as long or longer" than Grimoald III who died at around
        47 years old. This indicates a potential difference in values (with Theodora
        possibly living longer), not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model compared the ages of Theodora Komnene Angelina
        and Grimoald III of Benevento and concluded with a clear "NO" answer.

        Angelina lived beyond 1203, meaning she was likely much older than 14 when
        she died" while "Grimoald III of Benevento died at about 14 years old." The

        longer than Grimoald III, stating "Theodora Komnene Angelina was an adult
        woman who married and had children, meaning she certainly lived beyond 13
        years of age" and "Since Grimoald III died at 13, and Theodora must have been
        older than that at death, she did not die younger than him." The model is
        claiming a difference in values (Theodora lived longer), not equality.

        The model is actually indicating a difference in lifespans, not equality.
        This creates a contradiction between its reasoning and final answer, but we're

        The model concludes that "William II likely lived at least as long or longer

        than or equal to Anastasia's, not that they were exactly the same age.

        the model cannot determine the comparison due to lack of information, not
        that one person definitively did not die younger than the other. The parenthetical

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Gao Huan lived 51 years while
        Abbad ibn Bishr lived 26 years, and concludes "Since 26 < 51, Gao Huan did
        not die younger than Abbad ibn Bishr." The NO answer is based on the fact
        that one value is less than the other, not that they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Gao Huan died at 51 years old
        while Abbad ibn Bishr died at 26 years old, and states "Since 51 > 26, Gao
        Huan did not die younger than Abbad ibn Bishr." The NO answer is based on
        a difference in values (51 > 26), not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that Gao Huan died at 51 while Abbad
        ibn Bishr died at 35, and the NO answer is based on the fact that 35 is younger
        than 51, meaning Gao Huan did not die younger than Abbad ibn Bishr.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Gao Huan did not die younger than Abbad ibn Bishr after
        comparing their ages at death (51 vs 35).

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Unknown, so NO definite
        answer possible." This indicates the model cannot determine the answer due
        to missing information (Yury's birth year). The model is not giving a definitive
        NO to the comparison itself, but rather stating that a determination cannot

        but rather because it couldn't determine Yury's age at death due to missing
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (because we lack sufficient
        information to confirm Yury's age at death)." This indicates the model cannot

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNCERTAIN (not enough
        evidence for a definitive YES or NO)" as its final answer. It does not provide
        a clear YES or NO answer, explaining that without precise birth years, it
        cannot definitively conclude whether Rupen was younger at death than Nicholas.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that
        Michael II died at approximately 67 years old while Empress Zhang died at
        63 years old. The model's reasoning is "Since 67 is greater than 63, Michael
        II died older than Empress Zhang." This indicates a difference in values,
        not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the

        based on this inequality, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        II lived longer than Empress Zhang" (42 years vs. 32 years), indicating a
        clear difference between the values. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that Michael II lived
        longer than Empress Zhang (42 years vs. 32 years), and based on this comparison,

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its final answer, and the reason
        appears to be that the ages are approximately equal. It states "Otto III.
        von Rietberg lived to about 60, and Adalbero von Augsburg lived to around
        50-60, then Otto III. von Rietberg did not die significantly younger than
        Adalbero von Augsburg." The model is suggesting they lived to roughly the
        same age (with Otto possibly living slightly longer), making them approximately
        equal in longevity.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating that Otto III. von Rietberg did not die
        significantly younger than Adalbero von Augsburg.'

        is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not give a

        are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the answer to this question is False. Additionally, the model did
        not claim the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the comparison
        due to lack of information about birth years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the safest response would
        be NO, because we lack proof that Xiao Yaochang was younger at death than
        Agatha." This is a clear NO answer, but it's given because the model cannot
        determine the comparison due to lack of information, not because it has determined
        one option is definitely not true. The model states "we cannot definitively
        compare their ages at death" and calls the answer "uncertain," indicating
        it cannot make the comparison.
