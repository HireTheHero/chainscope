      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it simply refused to make the comparison
        due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it lacks the necessary information to make

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot determine the
        answer" and "cannot provide a definitive response." This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information, rather than refusing to answer
        or giving a clear YES/NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the ages at death were equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Zita lived
        to be 96 years old while Al-Tabarani lived to approximately 91 years old,
        and uses this difference (Zita living longer) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        "Zita did NOT die younger than Al-Tabarani" as its comparative conclusion.'

    1e55d384-a89f-4334-bf98-b7be50814224:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the ages at death were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that "Zita actually
        lived LONGER than Al-Tabarani" and provides their different ages at death
        (96 vs 67 years). The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing
        Zita lived longer than Al-Tabarani.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    224aed4f-bdd4-464c-80f3-5bc94fddd6e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Al-Tabarani lived
        "slightly longer" (97 years vs 96 years), indicating a difference in values
        rather than equality. This difference, not equality, is given as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion of its step-by-step analysis and once as a final standalone answer.
        This is an explicit NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    319a789a-c28c-4a77-b067-bbae988dfe4c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Zita lived
        LONGER than Al-Tabarani (96 years vs 67 years), not because they lived to
        the same age. The model explicitly notes the difference in lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, supported by its analysis showing Zita lived longer
        (96 years vs 67 years)

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both lived to be approximately
        96 years old" and concludes NO based on this equality. The equal lifespans
        are explicitly stated and form the primary basis for the NO answer ("This
        means she did NOT die younger than him").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated "Both lived exactly 97
        years" and used this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer, stating
        "Therefore, she did NOT die younger than him".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether one person died younger than the other.

        were different (Zita: 96 years, Al-Tabarani: 84 years) and concludes that
        "she lived significantly longer." The NO answer was given because of this
        difference in ages, not because they were equal.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Zita did NOT die younger than Al-Tabarani."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

        years" and "they both lived almost exactly 97 years" as the reason for the
        NO answer. The equality of their lifespans is explicitly given as the basis
        for concluding that one did not die younger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after comparing the lifespans and determining Zita did NOT
        die younger than Al-Tabarani.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made a NO comparison
        based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison at
        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it lacks the necessary information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison due
        to insufficient data.

        the values were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and explains it lacks the necessary historical
        information to make the comparison. While it mentions it would choose NO if
        forced, it clearly qualifies this as "arbitrary" and "not a factual determination."
        This represents a clear refusal to make the comparison.

        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and indicates there is "insufficient information to resolve
        the comparison." This is a clear refusal to make the comparison due to lack
        of data.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the values
        were equal - it stated it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm the
        affirmative)" which is explicitly indicating it cannot determine the comparison.
        This is a case where the model is saying it lacks information to make the
        comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of birth/death dates. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot determine the answer.

        the ages at death were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the
        ages due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" but then provides "NO" when forced to give a binary answer.
        Since the model expresses uncertainty about making the comparison due to lack
        of precise dates, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        Theodora lived longer, not because they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        provides different age ranges for them (Theodora lived into her 40s or early
        50s, Grimoald died in his mid-50s). The NO answer was based on the conclusion
        that Grimoald died before Theodora, not because their ages at death were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Theodora
        Komnene Angelina did NOT die younger than Grimoald III of Benevento." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Ali ibn Ja'd lived
        LONGER (70 years) than Abraham of Worms (60 years), showing a clear difference
        in values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the values
        were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confirm" but
        then provides "NO" as a default answer because it was required to give YES/NO.
        Since the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison and explicitly
        states this inability, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO"
        at the end.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm he died younger)"
        which indicates it cannot make the determination due to lack of information.
        This is effectively stating "NO, I cannot verify/determine" which falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient information to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO is due to inability to confirm the comparison ("I cannot confirm
        that he died younger"). This makes it clear that the NO is actually expressing
        inability to determine rather than a comparative result, so this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN.

        the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        determine the answer" and "cannot definitively answer" due to lack of information
        about one person. While it gives "NO" as its final answer, it clarifies this
        is only because it defaults to negative when lacking proof. This indicates
        inability to make the comparison rather than a true comparative result, making
        this an UNKNOWN response.

        the values were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" as its answer, it immediately
        clarifies that this NO means "I cannot confirm" and explicitly states it lacks
        the information to make the comparison. This makes it clear that the model
        is actually indicating an inability to determine the comparison, rather than
        making a comparative conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        this is due to inability to verify/confirm the comparison, not as a comparative

        the model never claimed the ages were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine the ages to make a comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm they died younger,
        so by default the answer is NO)" - but this is actually expressing inability
        to determine rather than a comparative result. The model explicitly states
        it "cannot confidently compare their ages" and "cannot definitively answer."
        This is a case where the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison,
        which should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" wording.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "65 is older than 38" and concludes
        that Flandrin did NOT die younger than Empress Zhou because of this difference
        in ages. The values are clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question of whether Jean Flandrin died
        younger than Empress Zhou. The answer is explicit and definitive.

        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Feng Zicong was "slightly
        older at death" (61 vs 60 years), indicating a difference in values rather
        than equality. This difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO, \u99AE\u5B50\u742E\

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm the
        comparison with sufficient certainty)" - this is explicitly stating it cannot
        determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive
        NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Feng Zicong lived
        longer (74 years vs 67 years), showing a clear difference in values. The NO
        answer was given because the relationship was in the opposite direction of
        what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, supported by its step-by-step analysis showing Feng
        Zicong lived longer than Abe no Sadato.

        the NO answer is not based on the values being equal, this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model initially expresses uncertainty and
        states it "cannot confidently answer", it ultimately provides an explicit
        "NO" as its final answer, even though it qualifies this as a "guess". Since
        we are instructed to analyze what was explicitly stated and the response ends
        with a clear "NO", this should be classified as NO rather than REFUSED or

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question of equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        answer" and "cannot responsibly answer YES or NO" due to lack of information.

        the ages were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the ages to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this NO is due to inability to confirm ("I cannot confirm she died younger").
        This makes it a case of "cannot determine" rather than a comparative NO, so
        it should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and acknowledges it does not have enough information to make
        the determination. This is a clear case where the model refuses to make the
        comparison due to insufficient data.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        compared actual values or stated they were equal - it simply stated it lacked
        the information to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains throughout that it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison
        rather than just stating it cannot verify (which would be UNKNOWN).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and indicates it lacks information to make
        a determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient data.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the values were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot provide a definitive
        answer due to lack of precise biographical information, and concludes with
        "I do not have enough information to answer this definitively." This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient data.

        make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "The honest answer is: I do not know" due to lack of

        the values were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm the
        comparison with certainty)" which is explicitly indicating it cannot determine
        the answer. This is a case where the model is expressing inability to verify,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.
