    0dee5333-8781-43ff-8629-17a5edb02eed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in death years (1241
        vs 1199) and bases its NO answer on Sacchi dying later and thus living longer,
        not on any equality between the two.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a clear comparative result based on the death dates
        it found.'

    1fa2a608-bca3-4868-8cbc-2ad80e460bcd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (78 vs
        73 years) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer, not because
        the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit comparative reasoning showing that Gandolfo Sacchi (78) did
        not die younger than Patriarch Michael II (73)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1ff20e69-45d1-4b22-939c-89f3db538abe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 81 is older than 73, showing
        a clear difference in values as the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit comparative reasoning showing that Gandolfo Sacchi (81) did
        not die younger than Patriarch Michael II (73)

    37810d45-8c91-4c23-91b9-ca1ded7a4f54:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the two people
        having equal lifespans. Instead, it estimates Sacchi lived to 63 years while
        Michael II likely lived to his 50s or 60s, suggesting some difference in their
        ages. The NO answer appears to be based on the model's conclusion that it's
        "unlikely that Gandolfo Sacchi died younger" rather than on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result to the question about whether
        Sacchi died younger.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    77a06c77-34ef-41f4-99fa-cde4093d1522:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1287 is later than
        1199, indicating a difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference
        (Gandolfo dying later, not younger).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Gandolfo Sacchi did
        not die younger than Patriarch Michael II of Antioch" as its final comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after comparing the lifespans and determining that Gandolfo Sacchi died younger
        than Patriarch Michael II of Antioch.'

      result: 'YES'
    8e73c146-b705-4884-b0b7-0404ac29c3d1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had considered
        the explicit "NO" in the response, the model suggests Michael II likely lived
        longer (into his 60s or 70s) compared to Sacchi's 63 years, so they weren't
        considered equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Gandolfo
        Sacchi did not die younger than Patriarch Michael II of Antioch." However,
        in its reasoning, it states that "Michael II's lifespan is uncertain" and
        can only make assumptions about his age. Since the model indicates it cannot
        determine Michael II's actual lifespan, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        despite the explicit "NO" statement.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9947c872-a490-4953-998d-fe76d67ab452:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the lifespans were equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that Gandolfo
        Sacchi lived longer (approximately 77 years) than Patriarch Michael II (estimated
        to have died younger than 77). The NO answer was given because of this difference
        in lifespans, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear statement that "Gandolfo Sacchi did not die younger than
        Patriarch Michael II of Antioch." The answer is based on a comparison where
        it concludes Gandolfo Sacchi lived longer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c86dd1dc-2120-4a72-88d2-a22375c5a996:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but did not state the lifespans
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different values (78 years vs
        60-70 years) and used these different values to reach its conclusion. The
        NO was based on Gandolfo Sacchi living longer, not on equal lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Gandolfo Sacchi did not die younger than
        Patriarch Michael II of Antioch.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    da6f6e43-249d-40e9-abac-bb3a817efebc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparison of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Gandolfo Sacchi
        died younger than Patriarch Michael II of Antioch" as its conclusion, though
        this contradicts its own reasoning in the previous steps where it suggested
        Sacchi lived longer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states that 1297 is later than
        1107, indicating a difference in death dates. The NO is based on this difference,

        the same/equal age, and in fact emphasizes uncertainty about exact ages ("Without
        exact birth years, we cannot definitively say who died younger"). The NO answer
        appears to be based on the model's assessment that Gao Yongchang was unlikely
        to have died younger, not because of proven equal ages.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two people died
        at the same age. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer -
        that Huang Junhan died centuries earlier than Abadai Khan. The model does
        not compare or equate their ages at death, only their chronological order
        of death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result about whether one person
        died younger than the other.

        death) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Huang Junhan died centuries
        before Abadai Khan was born, indicating a clear difference in time periods.
        The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        at the same age. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer -
        that Huang Junhan died "over a millennium earlier" than Abadai Khan. The model
        is comparing when they died (timing), not their ages at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Huang Junhan did

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two figures died
        at the same age or had equal lifespans. Instead, it gives a NO answer based
        on the impossibility of comparison due to them living in completely different
        time periods (over a thousand years apart). The model does not mention their
        ages at death being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO." as its

        classify this as False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any
        equality was discussed (which it wasn't - the model actually noted a significant
        difference in ages).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, William II, Count
        of Chalon died older than Anastasia of Sirmium" as its conclusion. While this
        is technically answering the opposite of the original question (which asked
        if William II died younger), we should evaluate based on the explicit YES/NO

        than 304 AD" and concludes William II lived and died "much later" than Anastasia.
        The NO is based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

        the ages at death were equal. Instead, the model concluded that Anastasia
        died at a younger age than William II (meaning their ages were different).
        The NO was given because William II did NOT die younger than Anastasia (she
        died younger than him).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the lifespans or ages at death were equal/same/identical. Instead, it
        based its NO answer on the fact that they lived in different centuries. The
        model doesn't compare their actual ages at death or suggest they died at the
        same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (stating it's not possible for
        Zuo Xiong to have died younger than Abe no Hirafu). While the model notes
        uncertainty about exact dates, it still provides a definitive NO answer based
        on the centuries they lived in.

        equal. In fact, it provides different estimated lifespans (72 years for Zuo
        Xiong, and 60-70 years for Abe no Hirafu) and explains that Zuo Xiong died
        centuries earlier. The NO answer is based on timing differences, not equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" and "Zuo

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        ("died much earlier" and "centuries earlier") between their death dates (138
        CE vs 664 CE).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the ages at death were equal. Instead, it explicitly gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - that Zuo Xiong died centuries earlier than Abe
        no Hirafu. The model doesn't compare their ages at death or state they died
        at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Zuo Xiong did not
        die younger than Abe no Hirafu" as its final answer. The model provides a
        clear comparative NO answer, explaining that Zuo Xiong died centuries earlier.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the ages at death were
        equal. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that Zuo Xiong
        died earlier in time (138 CE vs 664 CE), which is not the same as dying at
        the same age. The model appears to have confused "dying younger" with "dying
        earlier in history".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing whether Zuo Xiong died younger than Abe no Hirafu. The answer
        is clearly stated and provides a comparative result.

    ff3e8fc8-c257-412c-bdc9-e816b179bc8d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two figures died
        at the same age or had equal lifespans. Instead, it gives a NO answer because
        Zuo Xiong died centuries earlier than Abe no Hirafu (138 CE vs 664 CE). The
        model is comparing death dates rather than stating equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Zuo Xiong did not
        die younger than Abe no Hirafu" as its comparative conclusion. While it notes
        that exact dates are unclear, it still provides a definitive NO answer based
        on the centuries between their deaths.

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        one of the lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot provide a definitive

        the first place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Cannot be determined"
        and explains that "the question cannot be answered with a clear YES or NO

        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient evidence)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is effectively stating
        it cannot verify or determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (cannot be determined due to
        lack of information about Deng Fang)". Since this is explicitly stating an
        inability to determine the comparison due to missing information, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO. The parenthetical qualification makes

        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the values
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot confirm...)" which
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to insufficient information
        about one of the figures. This is a case where the model is expressing inability
        to verify the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response was about
        inability to compare due to missing information, not about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means "we cannot confirm" due to insufficient information about one of
        the figures. This is effectively stating that it cannot determine the answer,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        one figure's dates.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its final answer,
        it immediately qualifies this with "assuming Yu Ga-myeong lived after 'Imad

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly calculates and states different ages at death (73
        vs 44 years). The NO answer is given because Yang Kan lived longer, not because
        they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that Yang Kan did not die
        younger than Abbas Mirza.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Yang Kan lived to 73 while Abbas Mirza
        lived to 44, describing this as "significantly longer." The NO answer is based
        on Yang Kan living longer, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that Yang Kan did not die
        younger than Abbas Mirza.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the ages were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Yang Kan lived 64 years while Abbas Mirza
        lived 44 years, and states "Yang Kan lived longer than Abbas Mirza." The NO
        answer was given because of this difference in ages, not because they were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Yang Kan did not
        die younger than Abbas Mirza" as its final answer, providing a clear comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a significant
        difference in ages (73 years vs 44 years) and specifically notes that Yang
        Kan "lived significantly longer." The NO answer was given because Yang Kan
        lived longer, not because they had equal lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that Yang Kan did not die
        younger than Abbas Mirza because he lived longer (73 years vs 44 years).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that Yang Kan lived to 73 while Abbas
        Mirza lived to 44, and the NO is because Yang Kan lived longer (not younger)
        than Abbas Mirza. The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Yang Kan did not die younger than
        Abbas Mirza. The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    cedc3bde-df6c-4d53-bad5-db522cabbb9e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the ages
        being equal. Instead, it explains that Yang Kan lived over a thousand years
        before Abbas Mirza, making it impossible for Yang Kan to have died younger.
        The answer is based on a difference in time periods, not on equal ages.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Yang Kan did not
        die younger than Abbas Mirza" as its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative
        NO answer.

        Billah. They both died at the same age."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that Chen Shaoyou did not die younger than

        "slightly longer" (62 years vs 61 years). Since it identifies a difference
        in values, even though small, this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        lived for "61 years" and gives this exact equality as the reason for its NO
        answer, stating "neither died younger than the other" because of their identical
        lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans and determining that neither died younger than

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the ages were equal
        - in fact, it based its NO answer on comparing their death dates (787 AD vs
        934 AD). The model did not state or imply their ages or lifespans were the
        same. Note that while the model couldn't determine Chen Shaoyou's exact lifespan
        due to missing birth date, it still reached its NO conclusion based on the
        death dates being different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Chen Shaoyou
        did not die younger than Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Chen Shaoyou died "long before"
        Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah was born, and provides different dates for their
        lives (724-786 CE vs 873-934 CE). The NO answer is based on this temporal
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" after

        the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because the individuals cannot be verified and no comparison can be
        made. This is effectively rejecting the premises of the question since the
        people don't exist in historical records, making this an UNKNOWN classification
        rather than a true comparative NO.

        be impossible for him to have died younger. The model actually indicates different
        possible age ranges (70s-80s vs 50s-60s).

        claimed the values were equal - in fact, it couldn't determine one of the
        values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information about one of the subjects.

        earlier than Duquesne, which is the reason given for the NO answer. The model
        is not comparing their ages at death as being equal, but rather stating that
        they lived in completely different time periods.

        on temporal sequence rather than equality of values.

        died much earlier chronologically than Duquesne (a difference of over a millennium).
        The NO answer was based on chronological death dates rather than equality
        of ages at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        that Richard Turstin died earlier, not younger. The model distinguishes between
        "dying younger" and "dying earlier" in time, making this a difference-based
        rather than equality-based reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot definitively answer" due
        to lack of information about one person, but then gives "NO" as its answer.
        Since the model explicitly states it cannot determine the comparison due to

        it actually indicates that Huang Guifei died at a "similar or slightly older
        age" than Ada of Holland. The presence of "slightly older" means the values
        weren't stated to be exactly equal, and this tiny difference means we must

        automatically results in False, regardless of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison due to insufficient information
        about one of the figures. This makes it a case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't establish one person's
        lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its answer
        and explains it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information
        about one of the subjects (Son Bok-ga). This matches the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal/unequal
        status of the values is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason
        for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer and explains that it cannot determine YES or NO due to lack of precise
        information about Son Bok-ga's lifespan. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (ages at
        death) are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Gao Jishi
        died later than Abraham Memmius, indicating a difference in timing. The NO
        is based on a perceived difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two figures died
        at the same age or time. Instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning that
        Gao Jishi likely lived later than Abraham Memmius and therefore did not die
        younger. The NO is based on a difference (later vs earlier periods) rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        reasoning about the comparative lifespans. While there is uncertainty in the
        reasoning, the model does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to

        the figures had equal lifespans. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Gao Jishi lived and died "much later" than Abraham Memmius, indicating a clear
        difference in timing. The NO answer was based on this temporal difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that Gao Jishi did "not" die younger
        than Abraham Memmius.

        also did not claim the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        the dates for one of the subjects.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means "we cannot confirm" the comparison. This is effectively stating
        that it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information about
        Abraham Memmius's lifespan. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as per the

        a comparison." The NO is based on the impossibility of comparison due to vastly
        different time periods, not because of equal lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer. While it mentions uncertainty

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Insufficient information
        to determine (NO)". Since this indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of information about one person, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        rather than NO. The "(NO)" appears to be more of a negative response to the

        were equal - it stated one lifespan was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient historical
        evidence about Gao Ji's lifespan)". Since this NO indicates inability to determine/verify
        rather than a comparative result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN. The

        question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means "we cannot confirm" the comparison. This is effectively stating
        an inability to determine the answer, not a comparative result. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        II. The model is comparing when they died chronologically, not their ages
        at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        of the lifespans at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its conclusion,
        it heavily qualifies this answer by stating it "cannot be answered definitively"
        and that the NO is "speculative" due to lack of information about one of the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concluded with \"YES, \u856D\
        \u9059\u660C (Xiao Yaochang) died younger than Agatha van Normandi\xEB (Agatha\
        \ of Normandy).\" This is a clear YES answer."

    6fbed159-84d0-47b0-b87a-e4fd34109300:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the ages at death were equal. In fact, it doesn't actually compare their
        ages at death directly - it only compares the chronological dates of their
        deaths. The NO answer was based on chronological order rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Xiao Yaochang did
        not die younger than Agatha of Normandy." This is a clear NO answer comparing
        the ages at death, even though the explanation seems to confuse age at death
        with chronological order of deaths.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Xiao Yaochang died "centuries
        earlier" than Agatha of Normandy, indicating a difference in time periods
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result, even though it seems to confuse temporal
        sequence with age at death.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    82fe1d05-3a1a-4b98-95d8-dd164e54e1cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the ages were equal - in fact,
        it explicitly noted a difference in ages (Xiao Yaochang died in his early
        20s while Agatha died at around 16). The NO answer was given because Agatha
        died younger, not because their ages were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer, stating "NO - Agatha of Normandy died younger than Xiao Yaochang."
        This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: YES" at
        the end of its response after comparing the death dates.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed since
        it only applies to NO answers.
