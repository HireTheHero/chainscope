      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that "Michael II died significantly earlier
        than Sacchi." The NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the death dates of both individuals.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1c0ee0a9-f111-434b-a9f8-86a8ad697893:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that one date (1101) was later than the other
        (1100). The NO answer appears to be based on the logical conclusion about
        age rather than any equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that 1649 is later than 1199. The NO answer
        appears to be based on a comparison of the dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the death dates of both individuals.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (1099 vs 1100).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the dates and finding that 1099 is earlier than 1100.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it showed different death years (1872 vs 1823) and explicitly
        stated that "Michael II died younger," indicating a difference between the
        subjects.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after showing its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (1099 vs 1100).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates and concluding that Sacchi died before Michael II.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    aeda7df7-f46d-4e49-b394-81e22399afe2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on comparing different
        dates (1277 vs 1199) and concluding that Sacchi died later, not because the
        dates were equal. The model explicitly notes a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the death dates, indicating that Sacchi did not
        die younger than Michael II.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that the dates were different (1989 vs 971).
        The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning which suggested
        Zita lived later, but we must evaluate only what was explicitly stated without
        resolving contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    258d8c9c-214f-474f-a06e-7cbac614c3f9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that the dates were different ("973
        is much earlier than 1989") and used this difference as the basis for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the death dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    26a9951d-96e9-4ace-aa31-9229167ad423:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that 1989 comes after 971 and indicated a difference.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    34047223-0f90-443e-a7bc-94de6b1da0aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. In fact, it noted that the dates were different (1989 vs 971)
        and stated "1989 is later than 971". The NO answer appears to contradict the
        model's own reasoning, but we must evaluate only what was explicitly stated,
        not resolve contradictions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted that "971 CE is much earlier than 1989" and indicated
        a difference between the dates. The NO answer appears to be based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the dates, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4df4055e-e9af-4d5d-ac0f-99d6e571b3fa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the ages at death were equal. The model explicitly states that "971 CE is
        much earlier than 1989" and concludes "Zita lived much longer," indicating
        a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in Step 4, providing a clear and direct response to whether Zita died
        younger than Al-Tabarani.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4e455e4d-f226-46ae-b098-da9386f572df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted that
        the dates were different (1989 vs 971) and stated "1989 is later than 971".
        The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but we're instructed
        to not try to resolve such contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the death dates. While there appears to
        be some confusion in the model's logic (saying "lived longer" but concluding
        "NO"), we must take the explicit final "NO" as the answer per the instructions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a1104562-0ad1-4945-882c-297d121d7a53:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step reasoning'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    c9aecf44-b9c9-4d0f-8c94-88bc28c73a91:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it compared two different dates (1989 vs 971) and found
        them to be different, with one being later than the other. The NO answer appears
        to contradict the model's own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what
        was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d135608e-9b7e-452b-b141-5f5a84bc6f1b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted that 971 is much earlier than 1989 and that "Zita
        lived much longer." The NO answer appears to follow from this comparison,
        though the reasoning for the NO is not entirely clear given the preceding
        statements.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the death dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model did not give a NO answer based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after comparing the death dates and determining Yuri died younger.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    0f5ec9f8-e995-4ca8-b389-887ae1586fd3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the ages were equal. The model explicitly calculated different ages (43 vs
        35) and determined that Nicolas did NOT die younger than Yuri because Nicolas
        actually died older.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear reasoning showing Nicolas died at 43 while Yuri died at
        35.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    37e30314-ff11-4c57-ba01-bdd138382578:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in dates (1415 vs 1132)
        and used this difference to make its determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the death dates of both individuals.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    44e44262-37e5-4535-8d57-0f13d2378c80:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. It actually showed different ages (41 vs 26 years) and the NO
        was because Nicolas was older, not younger
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion based on the ages it calculated (41 vs
        26 years)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4988fc14-08aa-4c30-8c0b-74360e073f50:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the lifespans were equal. In fact, it explicitly calculated different lifespans
        (55 years vs 27 years). The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own
        analysis, but it did not cite equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans, indicating that Nicolas de Bec-Crespin did NOT live longer
        than Yuri Yaroslavich. This contradicts its own analysis showing Nicolas lived
        55 years vs Yuri's 27 years, but we must take the explicit NO answer at face
        value regardless of this inconsistency.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5cadf2a8-4b17-483e-97bc-47ea5896f25b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating "Yuri died significantly
        earlier than Nicolas" (1238 vs 1472).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.

      result: 'NO'
    75add430-349a-4524-8231-e8aac364c290:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that Nicolas de Bec-Crespin lived longer (34-36
        years) than Yuri Yaroslavich (25 years). The NO answer was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the ages at death, where it found that Nicolas de Bec-Crespin lived longer
        than Yuri Yaroslavich. This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7a7e75aa-bee2-4ad1-95bf-a04ebe23eaf3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually found different
        values (43 vs 53 years) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the lifespans and determining that Nicolas de Bec-Crespin died younger than
        Yuri Yaroslavich
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Nicolas died later (1472 vs 1238)
        and therefore lived longer than Yuri. The NO was based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Nicolas did not die younger
        than Yuri.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the values were equal - it actually stated one person lived longer than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the ages at death of Nicolas de Bec-Crespin
        and Yuri Yaroslavich.

    619bc44e-a7bf-47c0-a78b-45301cc56df1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different values (38 years vs. at
        least 56 years) and the NO answer was based on this difference in lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans, where it determined that Friedrich Gren lived
        38 years while Theodora lived at least 56 years.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        of "centuries" between their death dates, with Theodora dying after Grimoald.
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates, making a definitive comparative judgment
        that Theodora did not die before Grimoald.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the ages at death were
        equal. Instead, it gives a clear temporal difference, noting that Theodora
        died "much later" than Grimoald III (comparing years 1183-1185 vs 806). The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Theodora did *not*
        die younger than Grimoald III" as its final comparative answer.

        later than Grimoald" indicating a clear difference in dates (1200-1204 vs
        806), not equality. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the
        values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates of death between the two historical figures.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating that "1246
        is later than 806" and that "Theodora died older than Grimoald III". The NO
        appears to contradict the reasoning given, but we're instructed to simply
        classify based on the presence of a NO answer and whether it was justified
        by equality, which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Theodora lived longer (died in 1246) than Grimoald (died in 806), not
        because the values were equal. It explicitly notes a difference in the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated one value was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot definitively say" due to missing information about
        Geldemar's age. This is effectively stating it cannot determine the comparison,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        compare them due to missing data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say"
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the
        model explicitly states it cannot make the determination due to incomplete
        information (missing birth year), making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Gao Yongchang
        died younger than Abd al-Malik I." This is a clear YES answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine them due to missing
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to missing
        birth year data for Gao Yongchang. Since the model states it "can't definitively
        determine" the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

    1a21bccd-9313-4db1-a830-8dda2b076dce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different values (60 years vs 35
        years) and stated that "Chen Jian lived longer than Abraomas Kulvietis" before
        giving its NO answer. The values being compared were different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans, where it determined Chen Jian lived 60 years while Kulvietis
        lived 35 years. This is a clear NO answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1bc4701f-804f-4007-b7f4-8729e32071e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculates different ages at
        death (63 for Chen Jian and 35 for Kulvietis) and states that 63 > 35. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that Chen
        Jian did not die younger than Abraomas Kulvietis, providing a direct comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2a4b9f0b-f2a1-49c0-802e-453a0ecb5a99:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal - it explicitly states Chen Jian lived 60 years while Kulvietis
        lived 35 years, and the NO is because Chen Jian lived longer, not because
        they lived the same amount of time
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with clear comparative reasoning showing Chen Jian lived longer (60 years
        vs 35 years)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2cd53ae1-d5b0-4fe2-a8c9-719e7f388660:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model's
        inability to compare due to missing information is irrelevant for this question
        since we only evaluate equality when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (Cannot be determined)" and explains
        it cannot make the comparison because it lacks definitive information about
        Chen Jian's lifespan. Since the model explicitly indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7842615b-8dd0-4c05-ac2a-c02500c185f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were different (64
        years vs 35 years) and gave NO because Chen Jian lived longer, not because
        they had equal lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by its calculation showing Chen Jian lived 64 years while Kulvietis
        lived 35 years, concluding that Chen Jian did not die younger.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. In fact, it explicitly calculated different lifespans (55 years
        vs 35 years) and stated that Chen Jian lived longer than Kulvietis. The NO
        appears to be in response to a question about whether Kulvietis lived longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Chen Jian lived longer (55 years) than Abraomas Kulvietis (35 years).
        This is a clear comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model calculated different lifespans (66 years
        vs 35 years) and explicitly stated that Kulvietis died younger. The NO answer
        was based on this difference in ages, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans and determining that Abraomas Kulvietis died younger. This is
        a clear comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    dafab7f7-8fb9-485b-a2ea-dcbfef0184a4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that one person is still alive (born 1953)
        while the other lived from 1510-1545 and died at age 35. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this difference rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than
        a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the lifespans are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly notes that Kulvietis died at 35 while Chen Jian is
        older than that and still alive, indicating a clear difference in lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the lifespans.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    0a6ca92f-dc88-4636-afaa-759e4d82c7e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it compared different dates (1974 vs 1252) and determined
        that "Peng Dehuai lived longer." The NO appears to be in response to some
        other aspect of comparison, but regardless, it was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the death dates of both individuals.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2b6d9b07-1edb-49d1-9b27-a668cb12228f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        difference between the dates (1252 vs 1974), explicitly stating "1252 is much
        earlier than 1974". The NO is not due to equal values, but rather due to a
        clear temporal difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer. The answer
        is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    5f3e1632-15eb-4726-ade7-5e32ac9914b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes different death dates (1974 vs 1252)
        and makes no claim about equal ages at death. The NO answer appears to be
        a direct response to the comparison rather than an indication of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8b9aadf5-7997-44a5-8872-973116eae833:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), the answer
        must be False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its final conclusion,
        though it notes it initially misread the comparison. Since we take the final
        stated answer, and it's an explicit YES, the answer is YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that 1974 is later than 1252 and used
        this difference to make its determination. The NO answer was based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the death dates, making this a clear negative comparative answer.

        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted a difference, stating
        "Peng Dehuai lived considerably longer than Abel" and provided different lifespans
        (76 years vs 34 years).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans, where it found that Peng Dehuai lived longer (76 years) than
        Abel (34 years). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        This is effectively stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an
        UNKNOWN response rather than a true negative comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it clearly stated different values (75 years
        vs 66 years) and the NO was because Servien did not die younger (he died at
        a younger age than Son Geon).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the lifespans of both individuals and determining
        that Servien did not die younger (since Servien died at 66 while Son Geon
        lived to approximately 75).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4eba62f0-4618-41f5-8347-b4e1e699fef0:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model did not claim the values were equal
        - in fact, it claimed one died younger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after reasoning
        about the timing of their lives and making a determination about relative
        age at death.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted a difference, stating "Songeon died much later than
        Abel Servien" (660 AD vs 1659 AD). The NO answer appears to be incorrect given
        the model's own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly
        stated rather than logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Aarne Valkama died
        younger than Ma Shu (60 years vs 81 years), showing a clear difference in
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the ages at death of the two individuals, clearly indicating that Aarne Valkama
        did not live longer than Ma Shu (which appears to be what was being compared).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the death dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Ma Shu died
        at a later date (1970) than Valkama (1969), and this difference in dates is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer, indicating
        that Ma Shu did not die younger than Aarne Valkama.

        stating it cannot determine the ages due to missing birth dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct answer to whether Gao Baoning died
        younger than Abdallah ibn Buluggin. The model explains it cannot determine
        who died younger because while it knows who died earlier, it lacks birth dates
        needed for age comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Chen Xiang died in 1079 AD while Abd ar-Rahman II died in 852 AD, explicitly
        noting that 1079 > 852. The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the death dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        different values (710 AD vs 692 AD) and explicitly states that one date is
        later than the other. It does not indicate the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with an explicit "Therefore, the answer is NO" after finding
        that 710 AD is later than 692 AD.

    80b759bb-251f-4e46-8fc1-80ffcb163187:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model calculated different values (49 years vs
        47 years) and did not state that the values were equal or the same. In fact,
        it found Lu Zilong lived longer, though its "NO" answer appears to contradict
        its own calculation. While this may be inconsistent, we must evaluate based
        on what was explicitly stated rather than resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after calculating and comparing the lifespans of
        both individuals.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (49 years
        vs 47 years) and bases its NO answer on the fact that 49 > 47, not on the
        values being equal. Therefore, this is not a case where the NO answer was
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer to whether Lu Zilong
        died younger. This is a direct comparative response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d34b1036-da12-4bc2-b805-8e8a278354d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated different lifespans (49
        vs 47 years) and gave the reason that Lu Zilong lived longer, not that they
        lived for the same amount of time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Lu Zilong lived longer (49 years) than Abdullah ibn
        al-Mu'tazz (47 years). This is a direct comparative answer to whether Lu Zilong
        died younger.

      explanation_equal_values: The model calculated different ages at death (49 vs
        47 years) and explicitly stated that Lu Zilong died older than Abdullah ibn
        al-Mu'tazz. The NO answer was based on this difference in values, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through the calculation steps
        and concluded with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer. This
        was a direct NO response to the comparison question.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT ANSWER due to
        insufficient information" and indicates it cannot determine the comparison
        due to lack of data about one person's death date. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the comparison
        due to lack of data about one person.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot definitively say yes)"
        and explicitly mentions it "cannot definitively say whether he lived longer
        or shorter." This indicates inability to determine the comparison, making
        it an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" and explains that it lacks sufficient information about one of
        the subjects (Huang Junhan) to make the comparison. This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the ages being
        equal. Instead, it based the answer on the fact that they lived in different
        centuries, with Huang Junhan living later than Hong Taiji. The model never
        stated or implied their ages at death were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Huang Junhan did not die younger than
        Abahai Khan. This was a clear negative response to the comparison.

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        criteria only need to be evaluated when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final

        made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains that a comparison is impossible due to lack of information
        about Huang Junhan's dates. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

        for one person.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer the question. Therefore, I cannot answer YES or NO." This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to missing information about one person's
        dates.

        reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine one person's
        lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality considerations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in death dates, with
        William II dying in 1203 and Anastasia dying sometime after 1096 but before
        William II. The NO appears to be answering whether William II died younger,
        not indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        - in fact, it explicitly notes that 1203 is later than 600-610. The NO answer
        appears to be because the model disagreed with the comparison being made,
        not because the values were equal.

        - in fact, it explicitly notes that 1236 AD is later than 310-314 AD. The
        NO appears to be rejecting the conclusion about living longer, not stating
        the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing its reasoning about the dates. This is a clear NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that 1254 is "much later
        than 570 (or 565)", indicating a clear difference in values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date (1201) was "much later
        than" the other date range (610-615), indicating a clear difference between
        the values. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        were equal. Instead, it compared two different dates (1236 and 567) and determined
        they were different, with one being later than the other. The NO appears to
        be rejecting the implied comparison rather than indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in dates (1203 vs
        574), stating "1203 is much later than 574". The NO appears to be based on
        some other reasoning, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear NO
        response.

    bab9c179-3258-4a4c-92ae-c0a1ce0ea3f0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that the dates were different (1203
        vs 600 AD). The NO answer appears to be based on some other reasoning, even
        if that reasoning isn't clearly explained.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. While the reasoning seems
        to confuse "living longer" with "dying later," it gave a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 1237 is later than 626 and concluded
        William II lived "much longer" - indicating a clear difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the dates and determining William II lived
        longer, not younger.

    f2675e3f-4860-4ccf-920a-eb1ce2efff28:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the dates are different (1166 vs after 302) and
        concludes NO because William II lived longer, not because they died at the
        same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the two historical figures, making a direct comparative conclusion
        that William II did not die younger than Anastasia.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values being compared are equal. The model explicitly shows different
        death dates (1127 vs 1017) and bases its NO answer on these different values.
        The model does not state or suggest the ages at death were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear reasoning process based on comparing death dates (1127
        vs 1017). The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it does not
        state that the ages at death were equal. In fact, it only compares their death
        dates (1105 vs 1017) without mentioning their ages being the same. The NO
        appears to be based on other reasoning, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer when asked if Gao Miaoyi died younger than Abd ar-Rahman IV. The answer
        is clear and direct.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        dates, it does not state that the lifespans are equal or the same. Instead,
        it indicates that there's insufficient information to know the relative lengths
        ("possible Gao Miaoyi lived longer, shorter, or even at the same time"). The
        NO answer appears to be based on inability to verify the comparison rather
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO
        response rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal. Instead,
        it explicitly notes a difference, stating that Gao Miaoyi lived to 34 while
        Abd ar-Rahman IV lived "likely less than 34". Since it indicates a difference
        in values (even if uncertain about the exact difference), this is not a case
        of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.

        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that Princess Yangguo
        "lived longer than" Blanche's 3 years. The NO answer appears to be based on
        this difference in lifespans, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in Step 4 as its

        of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning given
        is that it "cannot definitively say" due to lack of information about one

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on equal values.
        Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in death dates (1211 vs 773) and
        used this difference to conclude that Feng Zuozhou died later, therefore could
        not have died younger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Feng Zuozhou did not die younger than
        Abdullah Shah Ghazi. The answer was clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they lived "approximately the
        same length of time" (53 years each), this is not given as the reason for
        the NO answer. Instead, the model states "NO" because Feng Zuozhou died after
        Abdullah Shah Ghazi and therefore "lived longer" - indicating a difference,
        not equality, as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the lifespans of both individuals.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6b68f6d9-196d-45ac-a1e3-72309e5efabe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different lifespans (57
        years vs 50-53 years) and indicates that "Abdullah Shah Ghazi died younger
        than Feng Zuozhou." The NO answer is based on this difference in ages, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the lifespans, indicating that Abdullah Shah
        Ghazi did not die older than Feng Zuozhou.

    6b8d097b-bbf6-48b8-863e-7cc5870e61aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values (lifespans) were equal. Instead, it based its NO on comparing
        death dates (775 vs 1407) and concluded NO because one died earlier than the
        other. The model never claimed the lifespans were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing death dates, though its reasoning appears
        flawed since earlier death date doesn't necessarily mean dying younger.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a1a4fd76-df64-4d80-a40a-efdcca0009a0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that 1408 AD is later than
        775 AD and used this difference to conclude that Feng Zuozhou lived longer.
        The NO answer was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after reasoning
        that Feng Zuozhou did not die younger than Abdullah Shah Ghazi. This is a
        clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference between the death dates (960 AD
        vs 770 AD) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The NO
        is based on one value being greater than the other, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear reasoning process leading to that conclusion
        based on comparing death dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d765034a-976b-45c3-a504-383f11516fae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values for their
        lifespans (72 years vs 53 years) and the NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on them being equal. The values are clearly unequal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" to whether Feng Zuozhou
        died younger than Abdullah Shah Ghazi. This is a clear comparative answer,
        supported by the calculated lifespans (72 vs 53 years).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference, noting that Feng
        Zuozhou lived past 1041 CE while Abdullah Shah Ghazi died in 770 CE, and concluded
        that Feng Zuozhou lived longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans and determining that Feng Zuozhou lived longer, making this
        a clear comparative NO answer.

    ee0dcd22-869e-4990-a7cf-8c4ba94e26b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Feng Zuozhou died much later than Abdullah
        Shah Ghazi." The NO answer is based on a difference in dates, not equality.

        \ The response doesn't mention their ages being equal or the same."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (ages at death)
        were equal. Instead, it compared their historical periods and concluded that
        Abraham lived earlier, but this doesn't address their ages at death being
        equal. The NO answer appears to be based on the model's reasoning about historical
        timing rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this appears to be a direct answer to the question
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it refused to make any definitive
        comparison of their lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that more information would be needed to compare
        their lifespans. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (ages at
        death) are equal. Instead, it states that one death date is unknown while
        the other is known, and uses this lack of complete information as the reason
        for its NO answer. This is not a case of equal values being the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or rejection of premises.

    ede642e3-b65c-4402-bf7b-ad76431db524:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the NO was based on the temporal
        difference between when they lived (10th vs 7th century), indicating they
        lived at different times. The model does not state or suggest the values being
        compared were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides reasoning based on the temporal sequence of when the
        two people lived (10th vs 7th century)

        for its NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that Gao Huan lived longer (51 years vs approximately
        22 years). While there's a confusing sentence structure ("YES, Gao Huan died

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the ages at death were equal. In fact, it doesn't calculate or compare
        their ages at all - it only compares their death dates. The NO answer appears
        to be based on death dates (487 AH vs 276 AH) rather than any statement about
        equal ages.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether al-Maymuni died younger than al-Isma'ili. The answer is
        clear and direct.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is not relevant
        since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its final answer,
        though it adds a caveat about the interpretation of "younger". Since it provides
        a clear YES (with an assumption), this should be classified as YES.

        - in fact, it explicitly noted a difference in death years (1007 AD vs 970
        AD) and stated "Al-Isma'ili died earlier than al-Maymuni." The NO answer was
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the death dates, indicating a clear comparative answer that al-Isma'ili did
        not die younger than al-Maymuni.

        around 909 CE while Abd al-Malik lived "centuries later" and died around 1210/1211
        CE. The NO was based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the two people died at
        the same age or had equal lifespans. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on
        the fact that they lived in different centuries (15th vs 10th century), making
        it impossible for Yu Gye-myeong to have died younger since he lived later.
        The answer was based on temporal sequence, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Yu Gye-myeong died younger than 'Imad al-Dawla. This was

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different lifespans
        (66 years vs 35 years) and determined NO based on Yu Gae-myeong living longer,
        not because they lived the same amount of time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Yu Gae-myeong did NOT die younger than 'Imad
        al-Dawla. This is a direct comparative answer.

    fc38758c-7337-4b2f-9271-756c8bbfe38f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (ages at death) were equal. Instead, the NO was based on the model's
        reasoning that Yu Gae-myeong lived centuries after 'Imad al-Dawla, making
        it impossible for him to have died younger. The model did not state or imply
        that their ages at death were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result based on its reasoning about

        after comparing the lifespans of Zhou Huida (87 years) and Abu Tahir Isfahani
        (estimated 44 years)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    30425639-5dc7-4cc5-adb6-5c17cfe7f555:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "1976 is later than
        1010" and concludes Zhou Enlai died at a later date. The NO is based on this
        difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and concluding that Zhou Enlai did not die
        younger than Abu Tahir Isfahani.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (57 vs 64
        years).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the lifespans and determining that Zhou Huida died at 57 while Abu Tahir Isfahani
        died at approximately 64.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    99837df6-aa97-4d9e-b15e-2369b5a6605e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the ages at death were
        equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that it doesn't know Abu Tahir's birth
        date (only his death date), and the NO answer appears to be based on the fact
        that Zhou lived until 1976 while Abu Tahir died in 940, not because their
        ages at death were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 5, and provides this as a direct answer to the question of
        whether Zhou Huida died younger than Abu Tahir Isfahani.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply stated it
        couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains that it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information
        about Zhou Huida's lifespan. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a4157bb6-ced3-472b-85fe-7b3b9db745cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that while Zhou died at a
        later date, this doesn't mean he died younger. The model noted a difference
        in death dates (944 vs 1976) and explicitly stated "Zhou lived much later
        than Abu Tahir, meaning Zhou died at a later date, not a younger age."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply stated it
        couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains that it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (51 years
        vs 44 years) and does not state they are equal. The NO answer appears to be
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (65 years vs 44 years) and states "Yang Kan (65) died older than Abbas Mirza
        (44)" as the reason for the NO answer. The values are not equal and equality
        is not given as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it noted that "1642 is much later than 934" and concluded
        that "Chen Shaoyou lived longer," indicating a clear difference between the
        values being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the death dates of both individuals.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly calculated
        different values (76 years vs 73 years) and stated that Chen lived longer.
        The NO was not based on equal values - in fact, the model showed they were
        different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after showing
        calculations that indicate Chen lived longer (76 > 73 years). While this seems
        contradictory to its own calculation, the model does give a clear "NO" as
        its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it found that Chen Shaoyou lived longer than Abdullah al-Mahdi
        Billah (died 1984 vs 1899), indicating a clear difference in their lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. The model explicitly states that 2012
        is later than 1961 and concludes Chan Siu-yau lived longer, indicating a clear
        difference between the two rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the death dates and determining that Chan Siu-yau
        did not die younger than Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates/ages)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that Chan Siu-yau
        died later (1900 vs 934) and "lived longer." The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that Chen lived longer (76 years vs 56 years)
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer. The values are clearly
        different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer to whether Chen died
        younger. This is a direct comparative response.

        person died in 1607 and the other in 912, explicitly noting a difference in
        dates. The NO was not due to equal values, but because one person lived longer
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing death dates, indicating Chen Shaoyou did

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding different
        values (76 years vs 56 years) and determining that one was greater than the
        other, not because the values were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

    25a998c2-aa7f-4471-a2fc-a889503d4cec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted that "Yun Bong-gil died much later than Aaron Burr,
        Sr." The NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after comparing the death dates, making this a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating "1757 is much earlier
        than 1950" and concludes that "Aaron Burr, Sr. died younger." The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the death dates of the two individuals.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        between the dates ("1757 is much earlier than 1923") and this difference,
        not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the death dates of 1757 and 1923.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that the dates are different (1932 vs 1757) and
        uses this difference to conclude that one person died older than the other.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of the two individuals. This is a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 1950 is later than 1757 and
        concluded that Yun Sa-ro lived longer than Aaron Burr, Sr., indicating a difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the death dates, making a clear comparative statement that Yun Sa-ro lived
        longer than Aaron Burr, Sr.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. In fact, it explicitly calculated different lifespans (77 years
        vs 41/42 years). The NO indicates that Yun Sa-ro did not die younger than
        Burr Sr. (he lived longer)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Yun Sa-ro died younger than Aaron Burr, Sr., after calculating

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the ages at death were equal or the same. In fact, it doesn't explicitly
        calculate or compare their ages at death at all - it only compares their death
        years (619 AD vs 578 AD). The NO answer is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Pei
        Renji died later (619 AD vs 578 AD), not because their ages at death were
        equal. The model doesn't mention or compare their actual ages at death being
        the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Rather, the NO was given because one
        person (Seol Se-woong) is still alive and therefore cannot have died younger
        than Aaron of Lincoln. The model does not state or imply that their ages or
        lifespans are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative response to whether Seol Se-woong
        died younger than Aaron of Lincoln. The answer is based on the fact that Seol
        Se-woong is still alive.

        (72 years vs 61 years) and did not state they were equal. In fact, the difference
        in lifespans was clearly noted, so the NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether Aaron of Lincoln died younger than Seol Se-woong. This is
        a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that "Seol Se-woong lived
        much longer" and gives different lifespans for the two individuals. The NO
        is in response to whether Seol Se-woong died younger (indicating he lived
        longer).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        NO" after comparing the lifespans and showing that Seol Se-woong (72 years)
        lived longer than Aaron of Lincoln (61 years).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that Seol Se-woong (being
        alive) has lived longer than Aaron of Lincoln (who is deceased). The model
        identified a difference in lifespans rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.

      result: 'NO'
    f34d2024-9cc9-4a55-b02e-a72467b61cfd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model calculated different lifespans (72 years
        vs 61 years) and did not state that the values were equal. In fact, it showed
        a clear difference in their ages at death, so the NO answer was not based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether Aaron of Lincoln died younger than Seol Se-woong. This is
        a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't find
        one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the bulk of its reasoning
        explicitly states it "cannot definitively answer the question" because it
        cannot confirm one person's death date or existence. This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model didn't
        make a NO comparison based on equal values - it refused to make any comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" after explaining it couldn't find reliable information about either person's
        death dates. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    f6350ecd-4310-4d4d-b914-6c48ae0106a7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the ages at death were equal - it stated it lacked information to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it "cannot definitively say who died younger"
        due to missing information about one person. This is effectively stating it
        cannot make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than
        a true comparative NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f7a4c983-4ca5-4ee6-9f9a-61564afd0b93:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't find enough information to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot determine if the statement
        is true)" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information about one of the subjects. This is a case where the model explicitly
        states it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a definitive NO comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it makes a comparison of ages at death and concludes NO,
        implying there is a difference between them. The model actually works through
        the calculation and determines that even with the latest possible birth year
        for Rupen, he would have been younger at death than Nicholas.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative
        result rather than a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    59f9eeca-ea8d-4c56-9915-5c1ce20c98cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly calculated different lifespans
        (45 years vs 26-36 years) and stated "Rupen lived longer than Nicholas," indicating
        the NO was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans and determining that Rupen lived longer than Nicholas, making
        this a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        between the lifespans (Rupen being older than Nicholas III), not because they
        had equal lifespans. The model explicitly states there is a difference, with
        Rupen being older.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that Rupen would have been older than Nicholas
        III.

        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the individuals lived in different
        centuries and uses this temporal separation as the reason for its answer.
        The model calculates different lifespans (noting Nomoto lived 66 years) and
        emphasizes their different historical periods.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it actually indicates a difference, stating
        that "1160 AD is later than 661-666 AD." The NO answer appears to be given
        for other reasons (though the reasoning is somewhat unclear), not because
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparison question. While there appears to be some confusion in the
        reasoning (saying "died older than" but concluding "NO"), we must take the
        explicit final "NO" as the model's answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it noted that 1268 CE is "much later than" 660 CE, and
        concluded NO based on this difference. The model appears to have confused
        "died earlier" with "died younger" in its reasoning, but we must evaluate
        only what was explicitly stated about equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        having equal lifespans/ages at death. Instead, it notes that Nomoto Motokata
        "lived much later and died much later" than Abdullah ibn Salam. The NO answer
        appears to be based on a difference in ages/timing, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in Step 4, providing a clear negative response to whether Nomoto Motokata
        died younger than Abdullah ibn Salam.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found a difference (1160 is later than
        663) and stated that "Nomoto lived longer than Abdullah ibn Salam." The NO
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion, based on finding that Nomoto lived
        longer than Abdullah ibn Salam.

        it explicitly noted that Adam Brendel lived longer (at least 65 years vs 62
        years for Hosokawa Naotoshi). The NO answer was given because Brendel lived
        longer, not because their ages were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        their lifespans and determining that Adam Brendel lived longer than Hosokawa
        Naotoshi. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - in fact, it explicitly notes different death dates (1646 vs 1628) and uses
        this difference to make its determination. The NO appears to be answering
        whether Hosokawa Naotoshi died younger than Adam Brendel.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of the two individuals. This is a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted different values (32 years vs at least 15 years)
        and concluded that Pei Can likely died older. The NO answer was based on a
        comparison showing difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer, making this a clear NO response. While there was uncertainty about
        Abdullah Khan II's full lifespan, the model made a definitive comparative
        judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (74 years vs 38
        years) and stated that Pei Can lived longer than Abdullah Khan II
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        in fact, it explicitly calculates different values (37 years vs 15 years)
        and states "37 (Pei Can) > 15 (Abdullah Khan II)". The NO answer is based
        on Pei Can being older, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        preceded by "Pei Can did *not* die younger than Abdullah Khan II." This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        The NO answer was not due to equal values - in fact, the model showed they
        had different lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after showing calculations that Pei Can lived longer (37 years)

      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information about Zhao Fen's
        dates. The model explicitly states "it's impossible to determine" the comparison.
        This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means "we cannot confirm" and lacks information to make the comparison.
        This is effectively stating an inability to determine the answer, making it

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot answer with certainty)"
        and explains it cannot determine the comparison because it cannot identify
        Zhao Fen's death date. This is effectively stating it cannot make the determination,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't determine
        one of the lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains this is because it cannot determine Zhao Fen's lifespan to
        make the comparison. This is a clear indication that the model cannot make
        the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but in
        the explanation indicates it's "impossible to determine" the comparison due
        to lack of information about Zhao Fen. This makes it a case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the determination, which should be classified as
        UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to missing information about Zhao Fen. The
        model explicitly states "it's impossible to definitively say" and lacks the
        necessary data for comparison. This makes it a case where the model indicates
        it cannot determine the answer.

        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the comparison due
        to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the explanation clearly
        states it "cannot definitively say" due to lack of information about Zhao
        Fen. This indicates inability to determine the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN
        response despite the "NO" at the end.

        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine Zhao Fen's dates to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot confirm...)" which
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the model
        explicitly states it cannot verify/determine the answer, so it should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot definitively say...)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the

        death dates (494 AD vs 360-380 AD). The NO answer appears to be based on chronological
        death dates rather than any statement about equal ages.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether Xiao Huan died younger than Abra. This is a clear NO response

        - it explicitly stated that the death dates were different (494 AD vs 360
        AD) and concluded NO because Xiao Huan died later. The model did not indicate
        the values were the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        the values were equal - in fact, it stated it couldn't compare them at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or

        values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient information
        about Jinbu)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to lack
        of data about one party. This is effectively stating it cannot make the determination,
        making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - rather, it's based on the fact that one subject (Jinbu) is a place that
        cannot have a lifespan to compare. The model explicitly states this is "nonsensical"
        rather than indicating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative response, even though it explains
        that the comparison itself is nonsensical due to one subject being a place
        rather than a person.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it stated that one subject being fictional makes
        the comparison impossible.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but does so while explaining that one subject is fictional and therefore the
        comparison is impossible. Since the model rejects the premise of comparing
        a fictional vs real person's lifespan, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final

        "much later" than Abraham Leihammer, showing a clear difference in dates (2021
        vs 1918). The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the death dates and finding them different (2021 vs 1918)

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing information
        about Abraham Leihammer's death date. This is a clear case where the model
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (death dates)
        were equal. In fact, it indicated a difference, noting that Noh Jo-sang died
        in 1974 while Leihammer "seems to have lived longer." The NO answer appears
        to be based on this difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        are equal. Instead, it compares death dates (2009 vs 1865) and notes they
        are different. The NO answer appears to be based on the comparison itself,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to make the comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" and explains that a definitive comparison is impossible due to ambiguity
        about which Ma Qi is being referenced and incomplete date information. This
        is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Ma Qi lived 59 years while
        Abdashtart I lived at least 25 years but likely longer. The model noted a
        difference in their lifespans, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't establish the
        values to compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" and explains that the question is unanswerable due to insufficient
        information about Ma Qi. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the dates for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot determine with certainty)"
        which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information
        about Ma Qi's dates. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot
        determine the answer, making it an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive
        NO comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Marquis Ma died in 165 BCE while
        Abdashtart I died in 365 BCE, showing different dates. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of the two historical figures. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in dates (1856 CE vs 1060
        BCE) and used this difference as the basis for its answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the two people
        having equal ages at death. Instead, it reasoned about their different historical
        periods and concluded NO based on their chronological order of death. The
        model never stated or compared their actual ages at death or claimed they
        died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after reasoning about the timing of their deaths. This
        was a clear NO answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated differences, noting that "Ma Qi lived
        much later in time and to a much older age than Abdashtart I." The NO answer
        was based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.

        the ages at death were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the ages due
        to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "NO", the model clearly
        states it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information about Abdul
        Aziz's death date ("Without more information on Abdul Aziz, it's impossible
        to definitively say who died younger"). This indicates inability to determine
        the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN case.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model did not make a NO comparison based
        on equal values - it refused to make any comparison due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively

        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by saying it's impossible to determine due to lack of historical data. This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria.

        comparison due to missing information is not relevant to this question since
        we only evaluate equality when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say"
        which indicates inability to determine the comparison rather than a comparative
        result. This is a case where the model cannot make the determination due to
        incomplete information about one of the subjects.

        to be answering whether Xue Huaiji died younger, not indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        in 1375. Abraham I died sometime after 615 AD. 1375 is much later than 615."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the lifespans were equal - it stated that one subject had no
        lifespan at all since they were fictional.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it rejects the premise of the comparison since one of the subjects (Pi
        Baozi) is fictional and therefore cannot have a real lifespan to compare.
        When a model rejects the premises of the question, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it stated one lifespan didn't exist at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (the question cannot be answered
        as posed)" because one character is fictional. This is rejecting the premises
        of the question since one subject doesn't have a real lifespan, making it
        an UNKNOWN classification rather than a true comparative NO.

    c487a9a7-df9e-4409-9de9-143dedc90579:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the ages
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Yan Xishan died later
        (in 1960) than Abraham I (who died sometime after 1734). The model explicitly
        noted it couldn't even determine Abraham I's full lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Yan Xishan died later than Abraham I and therefore did not die younger.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c4fd0a49-8be3-46a1-896c-f0f415d461f2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the ages at death
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO based on a logical argument about chronological
        sequence ("Since Wang Yan lived *later* than Abraham I, he could not have
        died younger"). The model never stated or implied their ages at death were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing a clear negative response to whether Wang Yan
        died younger than Abraham I.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c59b9074-ee0c-45aa-a3e9-8dba96bba078:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the model's reason was that
        the comparison itself is impossible because one character is fictional and
        therefore cannot have a literal lifespan to compare. This is a rejection of
        the comparison's validity rather than a statement of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a comparative result (concluding that a fictional character
        cannot die younger than a real person). While the model explains this is because
        one character is fictional, it still provides a clear NO as its comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the comparison since
        one character is fictional and therefore cannot have a real lifespan to compare.
        This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because 1932 is later
        than 1737, not because the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly states
        the values are different (1932 vs 1737).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        of death dates and explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the answer is NO."
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because one character is fictional and therefore cannot

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that the dates were different (1912 vs 1567)
        and stated "1912 is later than 1567." The NO answer appears to be based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it found specific different dates (1904 vs 1557) and
        used these to make its comparison. The model actually noted that one date
        was later than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a clear temporal difference as the basis for
        its NO answer, noting that Guo Dan lived in modern times while Rav died in
        247 CE. The NO is based on this difference in time periods, not on equality
        of values.

        - rather, it's based on the fact that Guo Dan is still alive while Rav died
        in 247 CE. The model does not state or imply their lifespans are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the values were equal - in fact, it stated it couldn't determine one
        of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" and explains this is because it lacks sufficient information about
        one of the subjects (Guo Dan) to make the comparison.

        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't establish one
        person's dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or

        is still alive while Rav died long ago, indicating a clear difference rather
        than equality in their lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after explaining

        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Guo Dan is still alive while
        Rav died centuries ago, indicating a clear difference in their situations.
        The NO answer is based on the logical impossibility of Guo Dan dying younger
        than Rav since she is still alive.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Egino lived at least 22 years, and the NO was given because Egino could have
        lived longer than 55 years (uncertainty), not because their lifespans were

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because one person was fictional and the other
        was real. The model actually suggests William II lived longer than the fictional
        person, not that their lifespans were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on its reasoning
        that one person is real and the other fictional.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't determine
        one of the lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" because it cannot determine the lifespan of Song Geum-gang to make the
        comparison. Since it indicates it cannot make the determination, this falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    21edfabf-8a2e-4c76-9b7d-3d30bd47eddd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that Song Geum-gang lived
        77 years while Ortelius lived 71 years, and the NO was because Song lived
        longer, not because they had equal lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative analysis showing Song Geum-gang lived longer (77
        years) than Ortelius (71 years). The answer is definitive and matches the
        format of a direct comparative response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly calculated
        and stated different values for their lifespans (82 years vs 71 years). The
        NO answer was given because Song Geumgang lived longer, not because they lived
        the same number of years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating Song Geumgang did not die younger than Abraham Ortelius.
        This is a direct comparative response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        one person's dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, in its reasoning it states "we can't definitively say whether they
        died younger" and lacks information about one person's dates, which indicates
        it cannot make the comparison. This makes it a case where the model indicates
        it cannot determine the answer, which should be classified as UNKNOWN despite
        the "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        the values were equal - it stated that one value doesn't exist because the
        person is fictional.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model states that one of the subjects (\uC1A1\
        \uAE08\uAC15) appears to be fictional and therefore cannot be compared, making\
        \ this a case where the model rejects the premises of the question. While\
        \ the model does say \"NO\" at the end, the explanation makes it clear that\
        \ the comparison is impossible due to one subject being fictional, not due\

        (86 vs 71 years) and stated that Ortelius died younger. The NO answer was
        based on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans and determining that Ortelius died younger.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "NO", it immediately clarifies
        that it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information about one person.
        This is effectively rejecting the premise of the comparison, making it an
        UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the lifespans are equal -
        in fact, it determines that Song Jin-gang is still alive while Ortelius died
        in 1598, indicating different lifespans. The NO answer appears to be given
        for some other unstated reason, as it seems to contradict the model's own
        reasoning that Song would have lived longer than Ortelius if still alive.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, NO."
        as its final comparative answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't find one of the
        death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT ANSWER" and
        explains it cannot determine the comparison because it lacks death date information
        for one of the individuals. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different ages at death
        (28 for Huang Guifei vs 23 for Ada of Holland) and uses this difference as
        the basis for its NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal,
        so this is not a case of equal values leading to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. Huang Guifei did *not*

        death dates (1360 vs 1226), not on the values being equal. The model explicitly
        states that one date is "later than" the other and that one person died "older"
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in Step 6, providing a clear directional reason (that Huang Guifei
        died older, not younger than Ada of Holland)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that the dates are different (1495 vs 1207)
        and states that "1495 is later than 1207." The NO answer appears to be based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of the two historical figures.

    e3124aea-aa78-44cd-85ed-ba89366a03fb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding a difference
        in dates (1748 vs 1205), not because the values were equal. The model explicitly
        states that one died "later" than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and determining that Huang Guifei died later
        than Ada of Holland.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" after explaining it lacks sufficient information about Ishikawa Kakimori's
        lifespan to make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the ages at death were
        equal. In fact, it doesn't calculate or compare their ages at all - it only
        compares their death dates (1594 vs 1584). The NO answer appears to be based
        on comparing death dates rather than ages, and no equality between values
        is mentioned.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether Kakumori died younger than Ivan the Terrible. This is a

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the lifespans were equal. Instead, the model explicitly stated that Ishikawa
        Kakumori likely lived past 1584 (when Ivan died), indicating a difference
        in lifespans rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result based on its analysis that Ishikawa
        Kakumori likely lived past Ivan the Terrible's death in 1584.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't find one set of
        dates to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT ANSWER" because
        it cannot find the dates for one of the individuals being compared. This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal to engage with the
        question.

        results in False according to the criteria. The values being compared (death
        dates 1581 and 1584) were different anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the death dates of Ishikawa Kakumori and Ivan

    f79f0ec8-7d8b-4f79-99e5-d9beb91fe670:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was because it
        found different values (1596 vs 1584) and explicitly stated that one date
        is "later than" the other. The NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer. The answer
        is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different
        (39 vs 54 years), but this is not relevant since the answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the ages at death of Ishikawa Kakinori (39) and Ivan the Terrible (54), confirming
        that Kakinori died younger.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False. Additionally, the model clearly identified different values (61 years
        vs 32 years) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after comparing the lifespans and determining that Adam Elsheimer
        died younger.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Xiao Yaoguang lived
        longer (61 years vs 32 years), indicating a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that "Xiao Yaoguang lived longer." The answer is unambiguous.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific lifespans (58 years
        vs 32 years), it does not state that the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        shows they are different, with Elsheimer having a shorter life. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 5, with clear reasoning in the previous steps showing Xiao
        Yaoguang lived longer (58 years) than Adam Elsheimer (32 years).

      explanation_equal_values: The model calculated different ages at death (69 vs
        68 years) and explicitly stated that Xianyu Shirong died older than Aaron
        ben Zerah. The NO answer was due to this difference in ages, not because they
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans and determining that Xianyu Shirong died older
        (not younger) than Aaron ben Zerah.

        ben Zerah. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

        Instead, it explicitly states that Xiao Daxin died later (1776) than Abdullah
        ibn Hasan (1691), and uses this difference in dates as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        were equal. Instead, it determined that Xiao Daxin died later (1755 vs 680)
        and therefore did not die younger than Abdullah ibn Hasan. The values were
        explicitly different, not equal.

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        (1783 vs 1730) and concludes NO because "Xiao Daxin died later, he lived longer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the dates are different (1151 vs 992) and gives
        the reason that Xiao Daxin "lived longer" as the basis for its NO answer.
        The values being compared are clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, both in its reasoning and as a standalone answer
        at the end. This NO is given as a direct comparative result, not as an inability
        to determine.

        were equal - it stated that one value doesn't exist for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one character is fictional and
        therefore has no real lifespan to compare, making a comparison impossible.
        This is rejecting the premises of the question rather than making a comparative
        determination, so despite the "NO" statement, this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the response does not indicate
        equal values - it states one is fictional and the other real, making comparison
        impossible.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because one character is fictional and therefore the
        comparison is not applicable/possible, not as a comparative result. This is
        a case where the model rejects the premises of the question, making it an
        UNKNOWN.

        character is fictional.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot make the comparison because one subject
        is fictional and doesn't have a real lifespan. This is a case of rejecting
        the premises of the question, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model's reasoning was
        about the impossibility of comparison rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of comparing a fictional
        character's lifespan to a real person's lifespan, stating that fictional characters
        "don't have real lifespans" and therefore can't be compared. While it says
        "NO" at the end, this is effectively rejecting the ability to make the comparison
        rather than making a comparative determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the rules we must answer False for this question. The equal
        values criteria only apply when analyzing a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because one party (Song Niang) is fictional and therefore
        cannot be compared, which means it's rejecting the premises of the question.
        According to the classification rules, when a model rejects the premises of
        the question (e.g., "NO, but one of these doesn't exist"), we should classify
        this as UNKNOWN.

    b7f7a30c-209f-48aa-9c11-a4cdc251c735:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the model's reasoning was that
        one character (Song Niang) being fictional means she cannot have a real lifespan
        to compare. This is a different type of reasoning than stating the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of ability to determine or verify. While the model notes one character is
        fictional, it uses this as part of its reasoning process rather than rejecting
        the premise entirely.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the model's reasoning was that
        one character (Song Niang) being fictional means she had no real lifespan
        to compare, making it impossible for her to have died at an older age than
        Adam. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative conclusion rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify. While the model notes one character
        is fictional, it uses this as reasoning for its NO answer rather than rejecting
        the premise entirely.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        values being compared were equal. Rather, the model's reasoning was that one
        character (Song Niang) has no real lifespan to compare since they are fictional.
        This is a different type of reasoning than stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of the premise or inability to determine. While the model notes one character

        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it stated one lifespan was unknown and therefore
        couldn't be compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison. This is effectively stating
        an inability to determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a definitive NO comparative result.

        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply couldn't make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains that it cannot determine Kusakabe Taro's lifespan to make
        the comparison. This is a clear indication that the model cannot make the
        comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating "Empress Zhang
        died much earlier than Michael II." The NO answer appears to be based on this
        difference in death years, not on equality.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating "1102 AD is
        later than 730 AD". The NO answer appears to be based on other reasoning,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the dates. While the reasoning seems to confuse "living
        longer" with "dying later," it gave a clear NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the lifespans were equal. The model's reasoning was based on the chronological
        separation between the two figures (different centuries), not because their
        lifespans or death ages were the same. The model explicitly states that Michael
        II lived centuries after Empress Zhangsun as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating that Michael II did not die younger than Empress
        Zhang. While the model acknowledged some uncertainty about exact lifespans,
        it provided a definitive NO answer based on the chronological separation.

        II "lived far longer than Empress Zhang" with specific years mentioned (Michael
        II living until at least 1199 vs Empress Zhang dying in 659).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        its reasoning about when they died (even though its logic appears flawed).
        It explicitly noted different potential lifespans and different death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a comparative
        answer after its reasoning steps. While the reasoning may be flawed (confusing
        dying later with dying at an older age), the model gave a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO because Michael II lived centuries after Empress
        Zhang. The model never stated or implied their ages or lifespans were equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that Michael II lived centuries
        after Empress Zhang and therefore could not have died younger.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted differences, stating "1199 is later
        than 636" and "Empress Zhang died much earlier than Michael II". Since the
        model noted these differences rather than equality, this cannot be classified
        as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly gave "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates, making this a clear NO response. While the
        reasoning may be unclear, we must take the explicit NO answer at face value.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Gao Run died *after* Abdullah
        ibn Ja'far (739 AD vs 695 AD), indicating a difference in values. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, after comparing the death dates of the two figures. This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

    d72ad6ca-6623-4fa0-820d-edfca80d90f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Gao Run
        died younger than Abdullah ibn Ja'far" after comparing their death dates

    f323ee92-049f-4e99-b577-cc74e289d5fd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Gao Run
        died younger than Abdullah ibn Ja'far." This is a clear YES answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

    1c201ff6-ff49-444a-9395-d7f7d7c6069f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (989 vs 1389) and determined
        NO based on comparing these different dates
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3e97608c-010f-49ae-abc0-e9eb12350eec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted that 1306 is later than
        957. The NO appears to be rejecting some other aspect of the comparison, but
        the exact reason isn't clear from the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4fd061f4-8f7f-4db0-b254-9bb60c9e5bfe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (death ages)
        were equal. Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO answer - that Otto
        III lived longer, not younger. The model compared different dates (1306 vs
        954) and explicitly noted a difference ("later than"), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating that Otto III did not die younger than Adalbero
        von Augsburg.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5eec519c-db02-4834-984e-73e3004dce3c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that the dates are different (1389 vs 975) and
        concludes NO because Otto died older, not because of any equality in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear reasoning based on comparing death dates. The model is
        confident in its answer and provides a direct NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5f4a3d48-6fa1-4e8e-a496-cae70c63f4ff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison showing
        different values (954 vs 1389) and explicitly states that Otto III died later
        than Adalbero. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because Otto
        III lived longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its analysis of the death dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ae09bb07-7cd0-4870-ab9f-dfb350aa2f5a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted that 1389 is later than 975 and concluded Otto III
        lived longer. The NO answer was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the death dates, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b5a6b4dd-5244-44c2-bacb-9757bff5ba0d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in dates (1392 vs 975)
        and concludes NO because Otto III lived longer, not because the dates or ages
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with reasoning provided in the steps leading to
        that conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b9b9af06-0077-4446-9198-0d7cf69e4fbf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 1389 is later than
        975 and indicates Otto III died later than Adalbero. The NO answer is not
        based on equal values - in fact, the model explicitly notes a difference in
        the dates. Therefore, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d13aafc9-6e28-444f-b019-17eac0b67ba6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference between the death dates (1306
        vs 975) and states that "1306 is later than 975." The NO is given because
        Otto III lived longer, not because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in Step 4, providing a clear negative response to whether Otto III
        died younger than Adalbero. This is supported by its reasoning that 1306 is
        later than 975.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f859a6b0-5bec-4a7e-b674-1baae90cab62:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. The model explicitly states that 1389
        is later than 975 and uses this difference to conclude that Otto III lived
        longer, not that they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the death dates and determining that Otto III
        did not die younger than Adalbero.
      final_answer: 'NO'
