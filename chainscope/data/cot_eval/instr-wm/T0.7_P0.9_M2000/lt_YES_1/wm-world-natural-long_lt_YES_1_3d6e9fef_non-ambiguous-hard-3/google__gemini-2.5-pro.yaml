      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Hayq and the Central
        Panay Mountain Range are on different continents (Africa and Asia) and thousands
        of kilometers apart. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that they
        "do not share a common geographical context where one would be described as
        being 'west' of the other in any meaningful way." This is not claiming equality
        but rather inappropriate context for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The answer is clearly marked and not qualified
