        reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether Cherrybrook Technology High School
        is located south of RM Williams Way. The answer is direct and unambiguous.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that San Carlos BioPower is east of Marth
        Mariam Cathedral, not south of it. The model notes that "Both locations are
        in similar latitudinal ranges, but the Philippines is generally not south
        of India - it's east of India." This indicates a directional difference (east
        vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. San Carlos BioPower

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        indicated it couldn't make the determination due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that San Carlos BioPower is south of Marth Mariam Cathedral based on available
        information)". This is a case where the model is stating "NO" but is actually
        indicating it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information.

        different latitudes, with Marth Mariam Cathedral being south of San Carlos
        BioPower (not the other way around). The model states "Kerala is at a lower
        latitude than the Philippines" and "Marth Mariam Cathedral would be south
        of San Carlos BioPower, not the other way around." This indicates a difference
        in values, not equality.

        While it explains that Fateh Sagar Lake is "technically slightly south" of
        Masmak Fort, it concludes that this characterization is misleading because
        the primary geographical relationship is east-west. Since the model gives

        The model is saying NO because of this containment relationship (one is inside
        the other), not because they are equal or identical locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Old Town (Lviv) is not located south of Black House,
        Lviv. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the Black House is located within Old Town Lviv (a containment relationship,
        not equality). The model states "Old Town encompasses the Black House, extending
        in all directions around it" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Old Town (Lviv) is located south of Black House. The answer is
        direct and explicit.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        "the Black House is located within Old Town" and "Old Town surrounds the Black
        House in all directions." This indicates a specific spatial relationship (containment)
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Old Town is not
        located south of Black House" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison is invalid
        because Black House is contained within Old Town (a containment relationship
        rather than equality). The model states "it would not be accurate to say that
        Old Town is south of Black House" because "Black House is a part of the larger
        Old Town area." This is a different type of relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Old Town in Lviv is not south of Black House in
        Lviv. The model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Black House is located
        within Old Town Lviv, meaning Old Town surrounds the Black House and extends
        in all directions. The reason for the NO answer is that Old Town cannot be
        exclusively south of the Black House because it encompasses it, not because
        they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Old Town is not south of the Black House. This is
        a clear negative comparative answer.

        latitude or slightly north of Buffavento Castle." The mention of "slightly
        north" indicates a difference in values, even if small. The model is saying
        NO because Kaibab Lake is not south (it's either at similar latitude or slightly
        north), not because the locations are exactly the same.
