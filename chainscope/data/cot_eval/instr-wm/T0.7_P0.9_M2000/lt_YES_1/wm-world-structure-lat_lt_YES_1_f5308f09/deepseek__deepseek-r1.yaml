        the Esplanade along the coast) while the E&O Hotel is south of City Hall (on
        Lebuh Farquhar street which is inland). The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that City Hall is

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did discuss equal values at points (e.g., "Then they're same latitude") but
        never gave this as a reason for a NO answer, as it never gave a final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a final, explicit YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various
        possibilities and at one point says "Therefore, Bushey is slightly south.
        So the answer is YES," it then continues with "But I'm not entirely sure"
        and explores more alternatives without settling on a final answer. The last
        statement is incomplete, ending mid-sentence.

        Old Town surrounds the Black House in all directions rather than being exclusively
        to its south.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0e1eda38-e171-43ce-bc92-8ec0ad4a0597:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Rather, it explains that the Black House is contained
        within the Old Town, with the Old Town surrounding it in all directions. This
        is a spatial relationship difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative conclusion that the
        Old Town is not south of the Black House because the Black House is within
        the Old Town.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    47accc2d-ee77-4eee-9385-26a2332b5ff0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explains that Old Town surrounds/encompasses
        the Black House, which is a different spatial relationship. The model identifies
        a specific relative positioning (surrounding vs. being south of) as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states this as a comparative result, explaining that Old Town is not south
        of the Black House because it surrounds it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5edcc9c8-21fb-4c30-a7c9-33cafc0989e8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Black House is contained
        within Old Town, making it impossible for Old Town to be south of it. This
        is a different type of relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative reasoning for why Old Town is not south of the Black House (because
        the Black House is within Old Town)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/identical - rather, it's because the Black House is contained
        within Old Town. The model explains that one location encompasses the other,
        which is different from saying they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative reasoning for why Old Town is not south of the Black House (because
        the Black House is located within Old Town)

    cd0a6951-3be5-41f2-9ec7-754179a32fd7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it explains that the Old Town surrounds the Black
        House and includes areas both north and south of it, indicating a difference
        in relative positions rather than equality. The NO is based on the Old Town
        not being exclusively south of Black House, not because their positions are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer about the relative position
        of Old Town to Black House.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/identical. Rather, it explains that the Black House is located
        within Old Town, making it impossible for Old Town to be south of it. This
        is a logical/geometric impossibility reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative answer, explaining that Old Town cannot be south of the Black
        House because the Black House is within Old Town.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d6a04467-8fcf-45d7-87d9-32d763859846:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/identical. Instead, it explains that the Old Town surrounds the
        Black House in all directions, with the Black House being located inside the
        Old Town. This describes a specific spatial relationship where one contains
        the other, not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a bolded "NO"
        after explaining that the Old Town is not exclusively south of the Black House.
        This is a clear comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        within Old Town, which surrounds it in all directions. This is a different
        spatial relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative answer explaining that Old Town is not located south of the Black
        House because the Black House is within Old Town.

    ef20b572-4b42-438d-a68f-a5936e65ac45:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model explains that the Black House is within/surrounded
        by Old Town, it does not base its NO answer on the two locations being equal
        or identical. Rather, it explains that Old Town extends in multiple directions
        (north, south, east, west) around the Black House, indicating a difference
        in relative positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning for this answer (that Old Town
        is not exclusively south of the Black House but surrounds it in all directions).
      final_answer: 'NO'

        northeast of Mangalore ("Chennai lies northeast of Mangalore, making Muttukadu
        north (not south) of the church"). The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional conclusion that Muttukadu is north (not south) of

        (different states) and provides a directional difference (east/northeast).
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the model never concluded the locations were equal - it was uncertain about
        the location of one of the buildings.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a clear final answer. While it considers various possibilities
        and mentions "perhaps the answer is NO" at one point, it continues exploring
        alternatives without committing to a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The response
        shows uncertainty throughout and ends without making a final determination.

        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,

    365abee6-5ad2-40dc-9f3a-763b11d29064:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gave a NO answer, it wasn't because\

        \ Theater (with specific different coordinate values given, e.g., 45.564\xB0\
        N vs 45.5046\xB0N)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reiterates this with explanation. While the model questions the existence
        of Maison Alcan in Portland, it doesn't reject the comparison itself but rather
        concludes NO based on the building being in a different city and known Alcan-related
        locations being north of the Aladdin Theater.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it actually couldn't determine
        Maison Alcan's location at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it mentions "perhaps the answer is NO"
        several times, these are always followed by expressions of uncertainty ("but
        I'm not sure", "but without knowing"). The model primarily expresses inability
        to determine the answer due to lack of information about Maison Alcan's location
        or existence in Portland.

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows an extensive thought process but
        never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion about whether Maison Alcan is
        south of the Aladdin Theater. The model spends time analyzing Portland's street
        system and locations but appears uncertain about Maison Alcan's exact location
        and ends mid-thought without providing a final comparative answer.

    9efa445f-02d8-4511-a6c8-90b78fef7b3e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. Even if we
        had considered the "NO" mentioned in the thinking section as final, it was
        based on a directional difference (north vs south), not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off mid-sentence, but
        in the thinking section it concluded "Therefore, the answer is NO" based on
        reasoning that if Maison Alcan is the Alcan Building in SW Portland, it would
        be north of the Aladdin Theater in SE Portland. However, the model expressed
        significant uncertainty about whether Maison Alcan actually refers to the
        Alcan Building, considering multiple alternatives and possibilities. Given
        this uncertainty and lack of a clear final comparative statement, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows an extensive thinking process but
        never arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model considers multiple possibilities
        and locations but ultimately doesn't make a definitive comparative statement
        about whether Maison Alcan is south of the Aladdin Theater. The response ends

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (because
        the model rejected the premise by stating one location doesn't exist in Portland),
        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated one doesn't exist in Portland.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Maison Alcan cannot be south
        of the Aladdin Theater. While the model notes uncertainty and considers various
        possibilities, it ultimately gives a definitive NO answer based on its reasoning
        that Maison Alcan doesn't exist in Portland.

        being equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Maison Alcan (presumed
        to be the Alcan Building) is NORTH of the Aladdin Theater, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a clear step-by-step explanation concluding that
        Maison Alcan is not south of the Aladdin Theater.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that Maneri Dam is north of the Palace
        of Assembly, not that they are at the same location. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about the relative positions
        (Maneri Dam being north, not south, of the Palace of Assembly).

        an unambiguous YES answer.

    9dad0f34-f353-4c1d-90cd-67ae888f6c10:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that Maneri Dam is "north" and "northeast" of the Palace
        of Assembly, not because the locations are at the same coordinates. The model
        clearly indicates there is a directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional explanation that Maneri Dam is north
        of the Palace of Assembly, not south. This is a direct comparative answer
        to the question.

        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a clear final YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses various
        possibilities and seems to lean towards YES at points ("So the answer would
        be YES, technically"), it continues to question this and raises doubts until
        the end. The response ends without making a definitive statement.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing the values as equal or different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought and never reaches
        a final YES/NO conclusion. While it's analyzing the locations and street layouts
        of Indianapolis, it doesn't make a definitive comparative statement about
        whether one location is south of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the NO was because they are
        on different continents (Albania vs USA) and thus have a clear geographical
        difference. The model never suggests the locations are equal or identical.

        never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence and never provides
        a clear YES/NO answer. While it explores various possibilities and hypotheticals

    d570242e-0fa7-48ee-91f5-513a6f5fd696:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different continents
        and cannot be meaningfully compared in terms of one being south of the other.
        While it notes they have "roughly similar latitudes," this is not presented
        as the reason for the NO answer, and even this observation notes they are
        similar rather than exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with reasoning about the locations being on different
        continents. While it discusses uncertainty about names and locations, it ultimately
        provides a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (the model
        rejected the premise by stating one location doesn't exist), we must answer
        False. Additionally, the NO wasn't given because the locations were equal
        - it was given because one location apparently doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and reiterates
        this answer with a clear explanation that there is no Lake Freeman in the
        region. While the model speculates about possible name confusions, it ultimately
        gives a firm NO answer based on the non-existence of Lake Freeman.

        supported by specific latitude values showing the Rheinturm is slightly north.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, indicating that the Rheinturm is
        located south of Antwerp City Hall. The answer is unambiguous and directly
        comparative.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is only relevant for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a clear explanation that the Rheinturm is "very slightly
        south of Antwerp City Hall" with specific latitude values to support this
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes that the locations
        are "around the same latitude," it ultimately determines that Rheinturm is
        "slightly north" of Antwerp City Hall by about 0.0019 degrees. The NO answer
        is based on this small but explicit difference in latitude, not on the locations
        being equal. Even though the difference is tiny, any stated difference means
        we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the latitudes of the two
        locations. The answer is a direct comparative result, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model spends a lot of time thinking through various
        possibilities but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It considers
        multiple scenarios and locations but repeatedly expresses uncertainty ("maybe,"
        "perhaps," "I'm not sure") and seems to get cut off mid-thought. The response
        contains neither an explicit YES nor NO conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (The Towers being north of the Post & Echo Building), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference with
        The Towers being in the north and the Post & Echo Building being in the south
        of the city center.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually suggested they were in different locations
        (one in Ancoats and one in Deansgate).
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it concludes with "So the answer might
        be no," this is tentative and uncertain. The response shows significant uncertainty
        about the locations of both buildings and ends with speculation rather than
        a definitive answer.

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response appears to be incomplete and
        ends mid-sentence. Throughout the response, the model repeatedly expresses
        uncertainty about the locations, considers multiple possibilities, and never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The response is filled with "maybes,"
        "alternatives," and uncertainty about the buildings' locations.

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering both possibilities
        (YES if the reservoir is in the north, NO if it's in the south) and appears
        to get cut off mid-thought without making a final determination. The response
        ends with "But the user's question is about the direction relative to each
        other. If" suggesting it was incomplete.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this with "the answer is YES" followed by a final conclusive
        statement "YES. Sant'Ignazio in Rome is located south of Palazzo Giustiniani."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9ad1edc6-b405-448a-971c-2a08ff74dd96:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" in bold and confirms
        it with "ANSWER: YES" at the end, after comparing the latitudes and concluding
        that Sant''Ignazio is slightly south of Palazzo Giustiniani.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforced this with a clear explanation comparing the latitudes of the
        two locations, concluding that Sant'Ignazio is south of Palazzo Giustiniani.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    c9199989-c72e-4ef7-a68e-284e248023b2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a detailed explanation stating "Sant'Ignazio in Rome
        is located slightly south of Palazzo Giustiniani."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    cd5fecb3-7e45-4517-a534-bc465917bdb7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times,
        including as its final conclusion, and provides a clear directional statement
        that Sant'Ignazio is southeast of Palazzo Giustiniani.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    d465de5d-4e13-49b6-8acb-6b959fd089d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question\
        \ is automatically False. The model actually found a difference in latitude\
        \ values (41.8986\xB0 N vs 41.9002\xB0 N) and used this difference to reach\
        \ its YES conclusion."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times as
        its final answer, both in the step-by-step thinking and in the formal answer
        section, concluding that Sant'Ignazio is south of Palazzo Giustiniani based
        on latitude comparisons.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e0325b17-3556-4c51-a92b-0647c5e872ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not give a NO answer because the values\
        \ are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in latitude\
        \ (41\xB053'57\"N vs 41\xB053'56\"N), with Sant'Ignazio being \"slightly north\"\
        \ of Palazzo Giustiniani. Even though the difference is small, any stated\
        \ difference means this is not an equality-based NO."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a definitive
        comparative answer based on coordinates, explaining that Sant'Ignazio is slightly
        north of Palazzo Giustiniani, not south.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
