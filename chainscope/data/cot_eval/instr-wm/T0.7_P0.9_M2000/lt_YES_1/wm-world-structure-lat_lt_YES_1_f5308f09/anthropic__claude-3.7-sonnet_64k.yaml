        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Morizkirche is to
        the northwest of Ehrenburg Palace, indicating a directional difference. The
        model's reason for saying NO is that Morizkirche is north of the palace, not
        south, which indicates a difference in position rather than equality.

        of the palace, not south of it." The model is claiming that Morizkirche is
        in the northern part of town while Ehrenburg Palace is in the southern part,
        which is a clear directional difference.

        NO answer is that the locations have different relative positions (north vs.
        south), not that they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly concludes "Morizkirche (Coburg) is not located south

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about
        typical locations of rocket launch stations versus stadiums, concluding that
        rocket launch facilities are deliberately placed away from populated areas
        and "would typically not be directly south of stadiums." The model is making
        a claim about relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that a rocket launch station

        "Hume Dam is about 0.1 degrees further south in latitude" and "Hume Dam is
        about 1.0 degrees further east in longitude." The model's NO answer is based
        on the reasoning that the predominant directional relationship is east rather
        than south, not because the locations are at the same latitude or longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Hume Dam is not located south of Lake Mulwala, providing

        notes "Hume Dam is primarily east of Lake Mulwala" and even mentions it "may
        be slightly southeast" but is "not south of it." The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

        specifically states "the Black House is a specific building located WITHIN
        Old Town" and "Old Town as a whole surrounds and contains the Black House,

        question doesn't apply. The question specifically asks if the model gave a
        NO answer because the values being compared are the same, but the model gave
        a YES answer.

        final statement: "Therefore, YES, 54 University Avenue is located south of
        Inya Lake." The model confidently states that University Avenue runs along

        states that 54 University Avenue is east of Inya Lake, not south of it. The
        model is making a clear distinction between different directional positions
        (east vs. south).
