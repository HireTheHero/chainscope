      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (cathedral is northwest of the church), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 6, providing a direct comparative result based on geographic positioning
        (stating the cathedral is northwest, not south, of the church).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1b2534f4-4978-4035-9395-00afd7199dd7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that one location is west of the other. The NO answer is based on the
        fact that one building is west (not south) of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative locations
        of the two buildings.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Haarlem is "about 20 kilometers west of Amsterdam" and that "the
        cathedral is more to the west or northwest of the church." The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in step 4, providing a direct comparative result based on geographic
        positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that the Cathedral is
        "to the west" of the church and "unlikely that the cathedral is directly south."
        The NO is based on directional difference (west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The answer is given definitively, not as an inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that Haarlem (and thus the
        Cathedral) is to the west of Amsterdam (and the Ronde Lutherse Kerk), and
        uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative result about
        the geographical relationship between the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b2702e7f-f442-40c7-bb13-be836c162eb2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, noting that the Cathedral "is not directly
        south of the Ronde Lutherse Kerk in Amsterdam. Instead, it is more to the
        west." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis. The
        answer is explicitly stated in the conclusion: "Therefore, the answer to whether
        the Cathedral of St Bavo in Haarlem is located south of the Ronde Lutherse
        Kerk is: NO"'

    caaadda1-d081-40d1-87ed-629cce8d7f81:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        a directional difference (stating the cathedral is "southwest" rather than
        "directly south"), not because the locations are the same. Any directional
        difference, even if slight, means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides this as a clear comparative result based on geographical
        positioning.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Cathedral of St.
        Bavo is "more to the west or southwest" of Ronde Lutherse Kerk, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on the fact that it's not
        "directly south" rather than any equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it in bold at the end of a step-by-step analysis. The answer is
        given as a direct comparative result, not as an inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating that Haarlem
        is northwest of Amsterdam, and uses this directional difference as the basis
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning through the geographical positions, making it a clear negative
        comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that the manor is more to
        the east rather than directly south of the power station. The model describes
        a directional difference between the locations.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that St. Benedictusberg
        Abbey is north of Villa Empain, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on the abbey being in a different (northern)
        position relative to Villa Empain.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a specific directional difference, stating that
        "the library would be more to the west or northwest of the reservoir, not
        directly south." Since it indicated a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Vennesla Library is south of Rybinsk Reservoir. The answer

        (west vs east) rather than equal values. The model explicitly states the church
        is west of the tower, indicating different locations rather than identical
        positions
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        or identical. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        exactly the same coordinates or equal positions. Instead, it suggests that
        they are not far enough apart for one to be considered "south" of the other
        ("distance between them is not large enough to consider one as being south
        of the other"). This implies there is some difference in position, even if
        deemed insufficient for the comparison.

        or the same. Instead, it specifically states that the church is "more to the
        east and slightly north of the tower" - indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion about the relative positions of the two
        locations. The model provides specific reasoning for this answer based on
        geographical analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations, with the tower being "slightly south" of
        the church. Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated
        directional difference means the locations are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the relative

        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it notes they are "close
        to each other" and in the "city center" but doesn't claim they're at identical
        positions. The NO appears to be based on the reasoning that it's "unlikely"
        one would be "significantly south" of the other, not because they're at the
        exact same location.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both churches are in the
        southern part of the city center, it doesn't explicitly state they are at
        the exact same location or latitude. The NO answer appears to be based on
        their relative positions being described differently (one on Hills Road, one
        on Trumpington Street) rather than them being at identical positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the churches are at
        the same location or equal position. Instead, it explains that "Our Lady and
        the English Martyrs Church is not directly south of Little St Mary's" and
        discusses their different locations on different streets (Hills Road vs Trumpington
        Street). The NO answer is based on relative positioning, not equality of location.

        Our Lady and the English Martyrs Church is in the eastern part while Little
        St Mary's is in the southern part of Cambridge. The NO is based on relative
        positions being different, not on them being equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that the Walchensee Hydroelectric Power Station
        is not south of the General Walker Hotel (in fact, indicating it is further
        north).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Castle of Park is "northwest
        of Carlisle Cathedral" and bases its NO answer on this directional difference.
        Even though this is a geographical comparison, the model indicates a specific
        directional difference rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Carlisle Cathedral
        is "more to the west and north" and "northwest of the Castle of Park"). Any
        stated directional difference, even if slight, means we must classify this
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on the relative positions of the
        two locations. The model indicates that Castle of Park is not directly south
        of Carlisle Cathedral, with Carlisle Cathedral being northwest of Castle of
        Park.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer not because the locations
        are equal/same, but because Castle of Park is "southwest of Carlisle" rather
        than directly south. It explicitly notes a directional difference (southwest
        vs. south), so this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion about the relative positions of the two
        locations. The NO is based on directional analysis, not inability to determine.

        would be "more to the northeast of the cathedral, not directly south" - indicating
        a different relative position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        of Warner Grand Theatre. Even though this may be a small directional difference,
        any stated difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating
        that McCallum Theatre "is more to the east and slightly north of San Pedro."
        The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, providing a clear comparative result based on geographical positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (southeast
        vs directly south). The NO is because one location is southeast rather than
        directly south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that McCallum Theatre is not directly south of Warner Grand

        latitudes," it explicitly states there are differences in their positions
        (San Pedro is "slightly more westward"). The NO answer is based on their east-west
        relationship, not because they are at exactly the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative conclusion that McCallum Theatre is not south

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically notes
        that Palm Desert is east of San Pedro and that there is "considerable distance
        between them." The NO is based on directional difference (east vs. south),
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically states that Hoar Cross Hall is "to the
        east" of Stafford where St. Mary's Church is located. The NO answer is given
        because of this directional difference (being east rather than south), not
        because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion about the relative locations. The NO is

        Stafford. The NO answer is based on directional difference (being northeast
        rather than south), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" in bold at
        the end of its response, making this a clear negative comparative answer.
        While there is some discussion of different interpretations, the final answer
        is definitively stated.

        Hall is east of St. Mary's Church, indicating a clear directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hoar Cross Hall is southeast
        of St Mary's Church in Stafford, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer is based on Hoar Cross Hall not being directly south, rather than
        the locations being equal.

        - it actually states that Hoar Cross Hall is southwest of Stafford (where
        St. Mary's Church is), and explains that it's "not directly south." The NO
        is based on this directional difference (southwest vs. directly south), not
        because the locations are the same.

        "Santorini is at a higher latitude than San Clemente Dam" and is "significantly
        north of the dam." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes or have the same north-south position. Instead, it gives a
        different reason for the NO answer - that because both locations are in the
        northern hemisphere and Santorini is significantly east of California, "the
        cathedral is not directly south of the dam." Since the NO answer is not based
        on equal values, this is False.

        positions, with San Lorenzo being north of the Po River and the Royal Palace
        being south of it. The NO answer is given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the palace is in the heart
        of Turin and that the districts don't have distinct north-south relationships,
        indicating a different type of reasoning for the NO answer rather than equality
        of positions.

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (San Lorenzo is "more to the east" rather than south). Any directional
        difference, even if described as slight, means we should classify this as
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        same area" and "same general vicinity," it doesn't explicitly state they are
        at exactly the same location or that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
        The phrasing "not significantly south" actually implies there might be some
        slight difference in position.

        The NO answer appears to be based on the reasoning that it's "not significantly
        south" and "not notably south," indicating some difference in position rather
        than equality.

        and suggests that directional distinctions are not meaningful due to their
        closeness, it does not explicitly state that they are at exactly the same
        location or have equal coordinates. The NO appears to be based on the difficulty

        (West Java vs East Java) and describes them as being in an east-west alignment
        rather than being in the same place. The NO answer is based on their relative
        positioning, not on them being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "The answer could be either YES"
        but doesn't complete the statement or provide a definitive answer. While it
        discusses various aspects of the locations, it ultimately does not commit
        to a clear YES/NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        indicating the church is "more to the west" rather than south of the gate.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, providing a clear comparative directional conclusion that the church
        is "not directly south" and is "more to the west" of the gate.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it explains that St. Peter's
        Church is "not directly south" and is "rather more to the east" of Saint Laurence
        Gate. This indicates a difference in position, not equality, as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church is not south of Saint
        Laurence Gate. The answer is clearly stated and presented as a comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "UNDECIDABLE"
        and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions without more detailed
        information or a map. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        or the same. Instead, it specifically noted that they are in different positions,
        with the church being "more to the west" and the gate being "on the northern
        side." The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church is not located south
        of Saint Laurence Gate. This was a clear comparative directional statement.

        of the locations (west vs east) and not because they are in the same location.
        The model explicitly states differences in their positions, with one being
        in the western part and the other in the eastern part of Drogheda.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the church is south of the gate, making this a clear negative
        comparative result.

        is "not directly south of Saint Laurence Gate, but rather in a different part
        of the town." This indicates a difference in location, not equality, as the
        reason for the NO answer.

        the other is "more central" and concludes the church is "likely north or northeast
        of the gate" - indicating different positions. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        difference, with Burdett Road being "more to the east or southeast" of the
        tavern. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional assessment that Burdett Road railway
        station is not directly south of Fitzroy Tavern, instead stating it's "more

        or southeast" than the other. The NO answer is based on directional differences,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations, indicating that Burdett Road railway station

        positions and directions between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning for why Burdett Road station
        is not south of Fitzroy Tavern (stating it's more likely east or southeast
        instead).

        difference (the station is east/southeast of the tavern rather than south).
        Even though this might not be a pure north-south comparison, the model identifies
        a specific directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        Instead, it explains that Burdett Road station is in the East End while Fitzroy
        Tavern is in central London, suggesting different positions. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the station not being "directly south" rather than
        the locations being at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates they are in different locations ("different
        landmasses and in different directions from each other") and provides directional
        differences (Sorpe Dam being in Germany which is "to the east of the United
        Kingdom"). The NO answer is based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - that Sorpe Dam would be "more to the east or southeast
        of England, not directly south." Since the NO is based on a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Sorpe Dam is located south of Midford Castle. This is a
        clear comparative directional statement.

        locations, noting that the dam is "more to the east or southeast of the castle"
        and that "they are not in a direct north-south alignment". The NO answer is
        based on their relative positions being different, not on them being in the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it's based on their different geographic
        positions, with the model explaining that Spain (where the Palace is) and
        New York (where the Reservoir is) are in different continents with distinct
        positions. The model indicates a clear difference in location, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was based on their
        different geographical positions ("opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean and
        in different hemispheres"). The model explicitly notes differences in location
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        other, it does not state they are at exactly the same latitude. Instead, it
        notes there are differences, albeit small ones ("difference in latitude...
        is relatively small"). The NO answer is based on the reasoning that the primary
        difference is east-west rather than north-south, not because the locations
        are at identical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        are in different positions, with Scarsdale Tavern being "more to the west"
        and Brompton Oratory being "more to the east". The NO is based on their relative
        positions being different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Scarsdale Tavern is not south of
        Brompton Oratory. The answer is given definitively without any caveats about

        there is a directional difference, saying Scarsdale Tavern is "more to the
        west" of Brompton Oratory. The NO answer was given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its geographic analysis. The

        (Scarsdale Tavern is "west" of Brompton Oratory). Even though this is the
        only difference mentioned, any directional difference means the locations
        are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Blake Hall tube
        station is likely east or northeast of Kings Langley Palace, indicating a
        clear directional difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional conclusion that Blake Hall tube
        station is not south of Kings Langley Palace, instead stating it is likely
        east or northeast.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (one being east of London while the other is northwest), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional assessment based on the
        relative positions of the two locations.

        relative to the Futurist Theatre. The NO answer is based on directional differences,
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer when determining if the Stephen Joseph Theatre is south of the Futurist
        Theatre. The answer is clearly stated and presented as a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the theaters are at
        the same location or equal position. Instead, it explicitly describes different
        positions - with one theater being inland near the town center and the other
        being closer to the seafront. The NO answer is based on their different relative
        positions, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in bold, making a direct comparative judgment about the relative
        positions of the theaters.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the theaters are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it indicates there is
        a difference in their positions, with the Futurist Theatre being more to the
        east of the Stephen Joseph Theatre. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the theaters were "relatively
        close to each other" and "not significantly different in terms of north-south
        orientation," it does not explicitly state they were at exactly the same location
        or that equality was the reason for the NO answer. The response suggests the
        NO is based on the unlikelihood of a significant southward difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without indicating inability to determine or rejecting
        premises. While it notes some uncertainty ("unlikely"), it still provides
        a clear NO answer.

        positions, with Futurist Theatre being closer to the seafront/South Bay and
        south of Stephen Joseph Theatre, which is in the center. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly described
        different positions - the Futurist Theatre being on the seafront while Stephen
        Joseph Theatre is more centrally located. The NO answer was based on this
        positional difference, not on equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" as its conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of

        is "more to the north" of where the Futurist Theatre was located. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that the Stephen Joseph Theatre is not south of the Futurist
        Theatre. The answer is clearly stated and directly addresses the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that the residency
        is north of the palace, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        was given because the relationship was opposite to what was asked (north instead
        of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the north-south positions of the two locations,
        determining that the residency is north of the palace.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that British Residency
        is "more to the northwest" compared to Thevally Palace, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographical
        relationship between the two locations. The answer is definitive and based
        on geographical analysis.

        with the British Residency being "more to the west" and Thevally Palace being
        "to the east, near the Ashtamudi Lake." The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that "the British Residency is not directly south of Thevally
        Palace." This is a clear comparative directional statement with a NO answer.

    6ffa8b83-b8fa-4db9-953b-7bdf32532c79:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are different,
        with one being inland and one being coastal, leading to the conclusion that
        they're not directly south of each other. The model specifically notes differences
        in their positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 5, providing a clear directional conclusion about the relative
        positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Thevally Palace is south of the British Residency (opposite of what was
        asked), indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the British Residency is located south of Thevally
        Palace. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions, with Kollam being further south than
        Hyderabad. The model does not state that the locations are equal or the same
        - in fact, it explicitly notes their different positions. The NO is because
        the relationship is reversed from what was asked (Kollam is south of the Residency,
        not vice versa).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations are in "close
        proximity," it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same location
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it suggests they
        are "not significantly north or south of each other" but still potentially
        different positions.

        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the
        British Residency is "northwest of Kollam, where Thevally Palace is situated"
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. Any
        directional difference, even if slight, means this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it indicated a directional
        difference (Hamilton Palace in South Lanarkshire, Motherwell Cathedral in
        North Lanarkshire, "which is slightly north"). Since it noted a difference
        in location, even if described with "slightly," this cannot be classified
        as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Hamilton Palace is not south of Motherwell
        Cathedral (in fact indicating the opposite - that Hamilton Palace is in South

        Cathedral, noting a directional difference. The NO answer is based on the
        palace being "southwest" rather than "directly south" of the cathedral, not
        because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that
        they are in different states and different regions (one in eastern Madhya
        Pradesh, one in western Gujarat), indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on their relative positions being different from what was
        asked, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative positions

        and "likely within walking distance" but does not explicitly state they are
        at the same location. The NO appears to be based on the model's assessment
        that it's "unlikely that one is significantly south of the other" rather than
        them being at exactly the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        difference, saying one cathedral is "northwest" of the other. Even though
        this might be a small difference, any stated directional difference means
        we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their locations,
        stating that UCCU Center is "significantly west of Hershey Theatre" and they
        are in "different part[s] of the country." The NO answer is based on their
        different geographical positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative geographic
        positions of the locations (Utah being west and Pennsylvania being east),
        not because the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly notes
        they are in different locations and states it's "unlikely that UCCU Center
        would be directly south of Hershey Theatre."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it determined
        that UCCU Center is west/southwest of Hershey Theatre, not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that UCCU Center is
        west of Hershey Theatre, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on the fact that the relationship is west rather than south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that UCCU Center is not south of Hershey
        Theatre (stating it is west instead).

        in position, noting that Jahanpanah is "slightly north" of the Cathedral Church
        of St. Luke. While they are described as having "similar latitudes," the model
        specifically identifies a directional difference, not equality, as the reason

        (stating Jahanpanah is "to the northeast" of Orlando), not on the locations
        being equal or the same. The model explicitly notes a directional difference
        as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        or the same. Instead, it explains that they are both in the northern hemisphere
        but "on opposite sides of the globe," indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on their relative positions being different rather
        than equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Jahanpanah
        is northeast of the cathedral, not because the locations are equal or the
        same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Jahanpanah
        is northeast of the cathedral").

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both locations are in the northern
        hemisphere, it explicitly states that Jahanpanah is "at a slightly higher
        latitude" than the Cathedral Church of St. Luke. Since it identifies a difference
        in latitude (even if small), and this difference is the reason for the NO
        answer, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result, explaining that Jahanpanah is north/slightly
        northeast of the church, not south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (Delhi being "significantly east of Orlando" and "not directly south"), not
        because the locations are at equal positions. The model explicitly notes differences
        in position rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines Jahanpanah
        is in northern India while the cathedral is in southeastern United States,
        indicating different positions. The NO is based on their different locations,
        not on them being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equal values.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in latitude ("Delhi being
        slightly north of Orlando") and concludes that Jahanpanah is located to the
        east rather than south of Orlando.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - rather, it's because Euston St. Pancras is southeast of Lord's
        (not directly south). The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the stations are at the same location. Instead, it explained that Euston St
        Pancras is "southeast" of Lord's, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO appears to be because Euston St Pancras is not "directly south" rather
        than because they're at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one
        location is north/northeast of the other, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO is based on the fact that one location is

        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - that
        City Hall is closer to the seafront while the hotel is more inland. This difference
        in position is the basis for the NO answer, not equality of position.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explains that Morden
        is southeast of Hampton Court, and the NO answer is based on the fact that
        it's "not directly south" rather than any equality between positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Morden tube station is not located south of Hampton Court
        railway station. The answer is clearly stated and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f7f4db55-4083-495f-9206-5eb9dd5db0eb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that "Morden is generally southwest of Hampton Court" and that it
        is "not directly south of Hampton Court railway station but rather more to
        the west." The NO answer is based on directional difference (being southwest
        rather than directly south), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Morden tube station is located south of Hampton Court railway
        station. This is a clear comparative result, not a refusal or inability to
        determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - that
        one location is west of the other rather than being directly south. The model
        explicitly states "it's located to the west of Florida" as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" as its comparative conclusion, based on its geographical analysis.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their locations,
        stating that Falcon International Reservoir is "likely further west and possibly
        south" and that it's "more to the west and possibly south of Florida." The
        NO answer is based on relative positioning differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Falcon International Reservoir is located south of JFK Medical
        Center. The answer is clearly stated and presented as a comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying Falcon International Reservoir is
        "significantly west" of JFK Medical Center. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on geographical analysis. The model
        concludes that Falcon International Reservoir is located to the west, not
        south, of JFK Medical Center.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because Falcon
        International Reservoir is "west and southwest" of the medical center, indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - that the reservoir is more western rather than
        south of the medical center. The model specifically notes a difference in
        position (southwestern vs southeastern US).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Falcon International Reservoir is not south of JFK Medical
        Center. The answer is clear and direct.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Florida is "significantly southeast of Texas" and that the reservoir
        is "not south of the medical center." The NO answer is based on directional
        differences, not equality.

    0ae14748-8cc4-432b-b091-19cff044ca4d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Cherrybrook was described as being in a "northwestern direction" relative
        to the Northern Beaches area, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing directional reasoning that Cherrybrook is "not directly
        south" but rather "in a northwestern direction" from the Northern Beaches
        where RM Williams Way is located.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are different,
        with one being in New South Wales and the other in South Australia, and concludes
        NO based on their relative geographic positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly noted differences in their positions (one
        in northern Sydney, one in western Sydney) and used these differences to conclude
        NO. The NO answer was based on relative positions being different, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative directional assessment based on the
        geographical locations it analyzed.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different relative positions (school is northeast of the
        way), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, concluding that
        the school is northeast of (not south of) RM Williams Way.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        of the locations (NSW vs SA), not because they are equal or the same. The
        model explicitly describes them as being in different locations on opposite
        sides of the continent.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning about the locations
        to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other (Cherrybrook being north of Salisbury), not
        because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it indicates that the school is likely north/north-west/north-east
        of the road, suggesting a directional difference. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the school is south of the road. This is a clear comparative
        directional statement.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the final answer, it's
        not because the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states
        that one location is "more to the north" than the other, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on the school being north rather than
        south of the street.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its geographical analysis. The
        answer is presented definitively, not as uncertainty or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on a directional comparison
        (Cherrybrook being north of Adelaide/RM Williams Way), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly described a difference in position,
        stating one location is north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning for why Cherrybrook Technology
        High School is not south of RM Williams Way.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explained that the locations are in
        different states with Cherrybrook being "more to the east or northeast of
        Jamestown, not directly south." This indicates a difference in position, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        its NO answer. The model does not claim the locations are at equal coordinates
        or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a clear comparative result based on geographical analysis.
        The NO is not a refusal to answer or an indication of inability to determine

        the model determined there was a directional difference (the reservoir being
        "more to the west" rather than south). Any directional difference, even if
        described as slight, means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Crystal is southeast of Christian's Church). The NO is because the relationship
        is southeast rather than directly south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that The Crystal is not directly south of Christian's Church

        or the same. Instead, it specifically notes that The Crystal is southeast
        of Christian's Church, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on The Crystal being "not directly south but rather more to the southeast,"
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        This indicates a difference in position (being more westerly) as the reason
        for the NO answer, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative positions
        of the stations. The model does not indicate uncertainty about making the
        comparison itself.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explains that Bushey is northwest of London while
        Debden is northeast of London, indicating different positions. The NO answer
        is based on their relative positions being different from the asked relationship
        (south), not because they are at the same location.

        Bushey is north of Debden, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Bushey station is south of Debden station, providing a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the stations
        being at the same location or having equal coordinates. Instead, it explains
        that Bushey is west/southwest of Debden, which is a directional difference.
        Even though the exact difference isn't quantified, any directional difference
        means the values aren't equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        not because the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Bushey is "northwest of Debden" - indicating a different relative position.
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating "Bushey railway station is not south of Debden tube station."

        The model explicitly notes a difference in latitude, making this a comparison
        of unequal values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, it bases its NO on geographic
        reasoning about relative positions, indicating that Hotel Continental cannot
        be south of Pearl Palace given Tangier's location. The answer is not based
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it acknowledges uncertainty about one location. Since it provides a
        definitive NO based on geographic reasoning (rather than rejecting the premise
        or stating it cannot determine), this counts as a comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the churches are at
        the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it describes their relative
        positions as different, with one being more eastern and the other more western,
        and uses this directional difference as the basis for its NO answer.

        Lake" and the locations are different (one in Western Europe, one in US Midwest).
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the church is east of Stockton Lake, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on geographical analysis. The model

        of Missouri, not directly south" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality, as the basis for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it in bold at the end of a geographic analysis. The answer is a

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly
        describes different locations (Macau vs Missouri) and gives directional information
        as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on relative geographic positions,
        not equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion about the relative

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes that they are in different positions,
        with the church being "likely to be northeast or east of the lake." The NO
        answer is based on directional difference (church being east/northeast rather
        than south), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that the church is not directly south
        of the lake. The model provides geographical reasoning and arrives at a definitive
        NO answer.

        similar," it explicitly states that "Riyadh is slightly south of Udaipur"
        - indicating there is a difference, even if minimal. The NO answer appears
        to be because the relationship is actually reversed (Riyadh/Masmak being slightly
        south), not because the locations are at exactly the same latitude.

        difference (southeast rather than directly south) as the reason for the NO
        answer. Any directional difference, even if described as "slight" or as part
        of "more towards," means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        of it. This is a structural/containment relationship reason, not an equality
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Old Town is located south of Black House. This is a clear

        House. This spatial relationship (one being within the other) is the reason
        for the NO answer, not because the locations are equal or identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because Black House
        is contained within Old Town ("the Black House is located within this central
        area"), which is a different spatial relationship than equality. This containment
        relationship is given as the reason for the NO answer, not equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Dallas is "southwest of Charleston" and "not directly south"). The NO is
        based on the fact that the locations have different coordinates, not because

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined First Baptist Church is actually north of Emanuel AME
        Church, indicating a difference in location. The model explicitly states "First
        Baptist Church (Dallas) is not located south of Emanuel African Methodist
        Episcopal Church. Instead, it's located north of the church."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude/longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it explicitly
        states there is a directional difference, saying Muttukadu is to the east
        of Mangalore. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that "Muttukadu boat house is not located south of Milagres
        Church in Mangalore." This is a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Muttukadu boat house is "likely
        to be north or northeast of Mangalore" - indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - that Muttukadu boat house is east of the church, not south of
        it. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a definitive comparative result, explaining that the boat house
        is not south of the church but rather east of it.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (east/southeast rather than south), not because the locations are
        equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that the boat house is
        east/southeast rather than directly south of the church.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e38baad2-6062-4c40-ba52-94ceb392bf47:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a difference in position, with one location being on the east coast
        and the other on the west coast. The NO is based on the boat house being "not
        directly south" but "rather more to the east" of the church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        giving a clear comparative result based on the relative positions of the two
        locations. The model does not refuse to answer or indicate uncertainty about
        making the comparison.

    e6b6bb4a-8fc8-4b46-957b-18afdcdf3943:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with one location being "more to the east" than the other. Even
        though the difference might be complex (southeast vs directly south), any
        stated directional difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Muttukadu boat house is not directly south of Milagres
        Church but rather more to the east.

    f1cef6f7-b4ee-452a-9394-3bdc1ec73f20:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "**YES**" after
        its analysis, despite some uncertainty in the reasoning leading up to it.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f9a98948-f60c-4e1d-8b88-8742df5bcf34:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions, stating that
        Chennai (where Muttukadu boat house is) is "further north than Mangalore"
        (where Milagres Church is). The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as its conclusion after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO
        answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly stated that Maison Alcan would be "northeast of Portland"
        and "not directly south." The NO was based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative directional assessment based on geographical
        analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Maison Alcan being north of Aladdin Theater), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly describes different locations and
        positions, explaining that one is north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Maison Alcan is located south of the Aladdin Theater, providing
        a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Montreal
        is "significantly north of Portland" - it explicitly states a directional
        difference rather than equality of positions. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in latitude, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" and provides this as a comparative result based on geographical
        analysis, not due to inability to determine or verify.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Montreal is "significantly north of Portland" and explains the difference
        in their geographical positions. The NO is based on a clear directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or verify. The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Montreal (where
        Maison Alcan is) is "significantly north of Portland" (where Aladdin Theater
        is). The NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that the
        locations are different, with Montreal being north of Portland. The NO answer
        was given because the relationship was opposite to what was asked (north instead
        of south).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Portland is west of Montreal and Montreal
        is north of Portland, indicating different geographical positions. The NO
        answer is based on these directional differences, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5 of its analysis when comparing the locations.

    a3c641ec-1469-4201-b549-c3a31d320cdb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Maison Alcan
        is "north and slightly east of Portland" compared to the Aladdin Theater,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative locations.
        The answer is based on determining that Maison Alcan is actually north and
        slightly east of the theater, not south.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the geographical
        layout showing Portland is west/southwest of Montreal, not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly notes differences in position,
        stating "Portland would be west or southwest of Montreal, not directly south."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question, providing this as a clear and direct response
        after its analysis.

    ecd15deb-a33b-4a89-a53d-a9a5d1d8fdbc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Maison Alcan is
        north of Aladdin Theater, indicating a clear difference in positions. The
        NO is based on one location being definitively north of the other, not because
        they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparative relationship.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same, but rather because it determined that the relative positions
        are actually opposite to what was asked - it states that "Truro Church is
        south of Fairfax Community Church, not the other way around." This indicates
        a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 6, providing a clear comparative result based on the relative positions
        of the churches, with Truro Church being south of Fairfax Community Church.

        The NO answer is based on directional difference (east vs. south), not equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative locations
        of the churches. The model is confident in this answer and provides specific
        reasoning.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, saying Fairfax Community Church is "more to
        the north" than Truro Church. The NO was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer in step 5, based on its geographic analysis showing
        Fairfax Community Church is "more to the north" rather than south of Truro
        Church.

        not located south of the Truro Anglican Church. In fact, it's slightly north
        of it." The NO answer is based on a difference in position (being slightly
        north), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        described as "similar," the model specifically identifies a directional difference
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the geographic analysis

    8af9651b-94f4-40c2-be37-f63d6ab98eb0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Big Pink is northeast of Skokie Lagoons), not because the locations
        are at the same latitude. The model explicitly notes a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Big Pink is not south of Skokie
        Lagoons. The answer is explicitly stated and used as a comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the final answer, it's
        not because the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference - that Big Pink is east of Skokie
        Lagoons, not south of it. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on geographical analysis. The model
        concludes that Big Pink is east of, not south of, Skokie Lagoons.

    e4b0fe71-a021-429c-a175-71ce92b422cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even
        if we had classified the final NO answer, the response does not indicate the
        locations are equal - it discusses different locations and directions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is confusing and inconsistent - it starts
        discussing Big Pink and Skokie Lagoons but then suddenly switches to comparing
        Royal Victoria and East India DLR stations without explanation. While it does
        end with a "NO" answer, this answer appears to be about a different comparison
        than what was being analyzed. Due to this major inconsistency and unclear
        comparison, we cannot determine what exactly is being compared or answered.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        it identifies a difference (Big Pink being slightly north), even though small,
        this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Turkwel Hydroelectric Power Station is "more to the west" rather than
        directly south of Villa Somalia. The model does not state that the locations
        are equal or the same in any way - it specifically notes a directional difference.

        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains they are in
        different hemispheres and continents, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer is based on their relative positions being incomparable across
        continents, not because they share the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it actually states there is a directional difference (southeast vs south).
        The NO is given because the model determines the relationship is southeast
        rather than purely south, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        east" rather than south of Ballinalacken Castle. The NO answer was based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion about the relative positions of the locations.
        The model is definitive in its answer that St Giles' Church is not south of
        Ballinalacken Castle, stating it is "more to the east" instead.

        Instead, it gives a specific directional difference, noting that Wrexham is
        to the northeast while Ballinalacken Castle is on the west coast of Ireland,
        separated by the Irish Sea.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying the church is "northeast of the castle"
        and "the castle is located southwest of the church." The NO answer was given
        because the church is in a different direction (northeast) than what was asked
        (south).

        as exact equality and is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        The model suggests they are merely near each other rather than at identical

        uncertainty about exact equality, and the NO answer appears to be based on
        the lack of significant directional difference rather than confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "UNDETERMINED"
        and indicates it cannot make a definitive determination about the relative
        positions without more specific location information. This falls under the

        Abbey being "more to the west and slightly south" compared to St Botolph's
        Church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        difference (being east rather than south), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it in bold at the end of a structured analysis. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        hemispheres and continents, making it impossible for one to be directly south
        of the other. The model describes a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - that
        based on the geographical locations in different continents, it's "highly
        unlikely" that the government complex is south of the church. The model indicates
        there is a difference in position, not equality.

        difference, saying the government complex "is significantly to the east of
        Ethiopia" rather than being south. The NO is based on a different relative
        position, not equality.

        are equal/same - rather, it states there is a directional difference (southeast
        instead of south). The model explicitly notes a difference in position, making
        this a clear case where the NO is due to a different relative position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that The Emerson Theater is southeast (not directly south)

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that The Emerson Theater is "more to the east" rather than being directly
        south of the cathedral. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        that the theater is "more to the east and not in a direct south-north alignment
        with the cathedral." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (being
        east rather than south), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        directional difference, even if described as slight, means we should classify
        this as False
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that they are in different parts of the
        southern hemisphere with east-west separation. The NO answer is based on their
        different relative positions, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as its conclusion after reasoning through the geographic positions of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined the Khushab Nuclear
        Complex would be northwest of Maharana Pratap Sagar, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the geographical positions of both locations. The answer
        was clearly stated and was a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it specifically noted
        that they are in different locations (different countries) and described Pakistan
        as being northwest of India. The NO was based on directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional conclusion that the nuclear complex
        is not south of the reservoir. The model gives specific reasoning about relative
        positions (Pakistan being northwest of India) to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Khushab Nuclear Complex is "more to the west" rather than south
        of Maharana Pratap Sagar. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides this as a clear comparative result, explaining that the Khushab
        Nuclear Complex is not south of Maharana Pratap Sagar (instead being to the

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Khushab
        is "to the northwest" and "more to the west and north" of Maharana Pratap
        Sagar, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Khushab Nuclear Complex is not located south of Maharana
        Pratap Sagar. The model provides a clear directional comparison, indicating
        Khushab is "to the west and north" instead.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicated that Khushab Nuclear Complex is "likely
        to be more to the northwest of the reservoir" - indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Khushab Nuclear Complex is located south of Maharana Pratap
        Sagar. This was stated clearly and definitively in the conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    90b620a2-75df-4e23-a326-4f6a958af29f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that while both are in the "northern parts
        of their respective countries," the NO answer is given because the complex
        is "not directly south" and "not significantly south" of the lake. This indicates
        a difference in position, even if not a straightforward south-north relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative positions
        of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with one location being "more to the west" than the other. The
        NO is based on the complex being in a different direction (west) rather than
        south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 6, providing a clear comparative directional conclusion that the nuclear
        complex is not south of the reservoir (stating it is "rather more to the west").
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e50889b2-27db-475f-9161-2bfea6e6da36:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (west vs east), not on equality of values. The model explicitly states that
        one location is west of the other, indicating a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative conclusion based on its geographical analysis.
        The NO is not qualified with inability to verify or rejection of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined that one location was west of the other, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the two locations. The model did not state
        or suggest the locations were equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on the relative positions of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the freeway is not directly
        south of the dam because the dam is to the east of Melbourne while the freeway
        runs through the city's eastern and southeastern suburbs. The model describes
        different positions for these locations.

        difference in relative positions. The NO answer was based on their different
        geographical positions, not because they were in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, stating that the Monash Freeway is not south of Thomson

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Kaibab Lake would be "to its northwest" relative to Buffavento Castle, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.

        there is a directional difference - that Raozan Power Station is "northeast
        of Kaptai Lake." This directional difference, not equality, is given as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result about the relative
        positions of the two locations. The model states that Raozan Power Station
        is northeast of, not south of, Kaptai Lake.

        being equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Raozan Power Station is "more to the northwest of Kaptai Lake". The
        NO is because the direction is different from what was asked (northwest instead
        of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states
        that one location is south/southwest of the other, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is given because Saint Sava is NOT south of St.
        Stanislaus (it's actually south/southwest), not because they are at the same

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (one is
        southwest of the other). The NO is because the first location is southwest
        rather than directly south of the second location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "UNDETERMINED"
        and explains it cannot make a definitive determination due to lacking specific
        location information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "POSSIBLY, but a definitive
        answer requires more precise location information." This is not a clear YES/NO
        answer, and the model explicitly states it cannot determine the relationship
        without more information.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, it focuses on their east-west
        positioning, noting they are on different continents. The model does not mention
        equality of positions as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative determination about the relative positions
        of the two locations. The model does not indicate uncertainty or inability
        to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that they are in "completely different parts
        of the world" and "different continents" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The response indicates a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that they are in different continents and
        the nuclear plant is "not south" of the auditorium. The NO answer is based
        on their relative positions being different, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly noted differences
        in their positions, stating that Kozloduy is "significantly east and across
        the Atlantic Ocean from Sheboygan." The NO answer was based on directional
        differences, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant is not
        south of Sheboygan Municipal Auditorium and Armory. The model provides specific
        reasoning, noting that Kozloduy is "significantly east and across the Atlantic
        Ocean from Sheboygan."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the
        nuclear plant is located east of Sheboygan, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO is based on the plant being in a
        different direction (east) rather than being at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides this as a comparative result, explaining that the nuclear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Kozloduy is "east and slightly south" of Sheboygan). Any stated directional
        difference, even if described as "slight," means we must classify this as
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        as its conclusion after comparing the locations, determining that Kozloduy

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly noted differences
        in their positions, stating that Sant'Ignazio is "more to the west and slightly
        north of Palazzo Giustiniani." The NO answer was based on directional differences,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis of the relative
        positions of the two locations. The model indicates Sant'Ignazio is "more
        to the west and slightly north of Palazzo Giustiniani."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it suggests they are "relatively close" and in the "historic
        center," but never claims they are at the exact same location or latitude.
        The NO answer appears to be based on the reasoning that it's "unlikely that
        Sant'Ignazio is significantly south" rather than them being at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Sant'Ignazio is located south of Palazzo Giustiniani.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sant'Ignazio is "to the southeast"
        of Palazzo Giustiniani and gives the NO answer based on this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Sant'Ignazio is "more to
        the northwest" while Palazzo Giustiniani is "more to the southeast". The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sant'Ignazio is "generally
        north of Palazzo Giustiniani" and uses this directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer. Even though the difference might be small (being
        in the historic center), any stated directional difference means we must classify
        this as False.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Sant'Ignazio
        is "more to the east or southeast of Palazzo Giustiniani" and that they are
        "not directly north-south of each other." The NO answer was based on directional
        differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Sant'Ignazio is not located south
        of Palazzo Giustiniani. The model provides specific reasoning for this answer
        based on the relative positions of the buildings.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the locations were at equal positions - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "UNDETERMINED" and states
        it cannot definitively answer the question without more detailed information
        about the street layout or coordinates. This indicates the model cannot make
        the comparison rather than giving a clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the final answer, it's
        not because the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Sant'Ignazio is "more to the north and west" of Palazzo Giustiniani,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations. The answer is definitive and based on geographical analysis.

        stating that Sant'Ignazio is "slightly northeast of the Pantheon" while Palazzo
        Giustiniani is "slightly southeast of the Pantheon". The NO answer is based
        on their relative positions being different, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Sant'Ignazio is south of Palazzo Giustiniani. The answer
        is clearly stated and is a direct comparative result.

        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Sant'Ignazio is "slightly
        north" of Palazzo Giustiniani, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result based on relative positions, stating
