      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Cathedral is north of the Ronde Lutherse Kerk, indicating a directional difference.
        It does not state that the locations are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly
        notes a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after going through its step-by-step analysis, concluding that
        one building is north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with one building being "slightly northwest" of the other, making them "southeast"
        relative to each other. This directional difference, even though described
        as "slight," is the reason for the NO answer.

        are equal - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with St
        Bavo being north of Ronde Lutherse Kerk (or Ronde Lutherse Kerk being "slightly
        south" of St Bavo). Even though the difference is described as "slight," any
        stated difference means this is not an equality case.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that San Lorenzo is located north
        of the Royal Palace, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether San Lorenzo is south of the Royal
        Palace of Turin. The answer is clear and direct.

    a28e7606-096f-4343-a1b6-e4bc9dc31fbd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that San Lorenzo is NORTH of the Royal
        Palace, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because the direction
        is opposite to what was asked (south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its analysis that San Lorenzo is actually north of the Royal Palace.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that San Lorenzo is located north of the
        Royal Palace, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because the premise
        (San Lorenzo being south) is incorrect, not because the locations are at the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, after explaining that San Lorenzo is located north of the Royal Palace
        of Turin.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot responsibly
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it lacks the specific geographic knowledge
        needed to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and while it mentions it would choose NO if forced, it heavily
        qualifies this by stating it's not based on certain knowledge. This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison rather than a definitive answer.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have sufficient verified
        information to confirm their relative positions)" which indicates it cannot
        determine the comparison. This is a case where the model is expressing inability
        to verify/determine the relationship, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive
        NO comparative result.

        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical coordinates showing
        Petersham is west of, not south of, Tulse Hill.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Sudbrook Park was determined to be north of Tulse Hill, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        a directional difference. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        locations are in different relative positions (one north of the other), not
        because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference with one being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer, stating that
        Sudbrook Park is "NOT south, but north" of Tulse Hill station.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the
        location of one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "NO" at the very end, it explicitly
        states it "cannot confidently answer YES or NO" and that any NO would be "a

        ("I cannot confirm the southern position"). At no point does the model state
        the locations are at the same coordinates or equivalent positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model expresses uncertainty and initially

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined there was a directional difference (Scarsdale Tavern being
        north of Brompton Oratory). The model identified a specific directional relationship
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its directional analysis that Scarsdale
        Tavern is north of Brompton Oratory rather than south.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the stations were at the same location. Instead, the NO was given because
        Royal Victoria is explicitly stated to be north of East India, not south.
        The model identifies a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats or uncertainty. It makes a definitive
        directional comparison (stating one is north of the other) and concludes with
        "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Royal Victoria being north of East India), not because the locations are
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the stations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the stations are in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states they
        are in different locations (Royal Victoria is north of East India). The NO
        is because the relative positions are opposite to what was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on relative positions
        (stating Royal Victoria is north of East India, not south as asked)

        the stations are at the same location. The model explicitly states that Royal
        Victoria is north of East India, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions. The NO answer was given because the relative positions
        are different (north vs south), not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine. It provides a direct geographical comparison stating Royal Victoria
        is north of East India, not south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes they are in different directions
        (northeast vs northwest) and uses this directional difference as the basis
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response as its final comparative answer, after walking
        through its reasoning about the relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Blake Hall
        station is "more to the east, not south" relative to Kings Langley Palace.
        It explicitly states a directional difference (east vs. south), rather than
        stating the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant when the answer isn't NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it describes them as being in "quite different regions
        with different geographical orientations," with one being "easterly" and the
        other "northwesterly". The NO answer is based on these directional differences,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion and
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographical
        relationship between the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model did not claim the locations were equal - it actually noted they
        were in different directions from London.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (I cannot confirm it
        is south)" which indicates it cannot determine the relationship, rather than
        making a comparative assertion. This is effectively stating inability to verify,
        making it an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead,
        it based its NO answer on the fact that the locations have different east-west
        positions, with one being in Essex (east) and one in Hertfordshire (west).
        The model did not claim the locations were equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it both in the reasoning (step 5: "is NOT south") and in the final

        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Blake Hall is east of Kings Langley
        Palace, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because of a different
        directional relationship (east rather than south), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Blake Hall is not south
        of Kings Langley Palace, but rather east of it.

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states they are in different
        regions and gives a directional difference (Blake Hall is northeast of Kings
        Langley Palace) as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Blake Hall
        is northeast of Kings Langley Palace and therefore not south of it.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer about
        the relative positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (British Residency being north of Thevally Palace), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (British Residency is
        NOT located south of Thevally Palace)" as its final answer, providing a direct
        comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that British Residency is
        NORTH of Thevally Palace, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that British Residency is NORTH of Thevally
        Palace. This is a clear NO comparative answer.'

    7885d5a9-f3ad-4bf6-bea6-370ffaa1790d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined British Residency is specifically north of Thevally Palace,
        indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that British Residency is north (not south)
        of Thevally Palace. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never compared actual values or stated they were equal - it simply stated
        it lacked information to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it lacks sufficient geographical information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that British
        Residency is NORTH of Thevally Palace - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. The model does not state or suggest the locations are at the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining that
        British Residency is north of Thevally Palace.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined Thevally Palace is north of British Residency, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The model did not state or
        suggest the locations were at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its determination that since Thevally
        Palace is north of British Residency, British Residency cannot be south of

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Hamilton being southwest of Motherwell), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "The answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES." Despite noting issues with the premise (non-existence of
        Motherwell Cathedral), it still provides a definitive YES answer based on

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "Hamilton is located slightly southwest of Motherwell" and concludes
        that "Hamilton Palace would have been north of Motherwell, not south." Since
        the NO is based on a directional difference rather than equality, this is
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, making this an explicit NO answer to the comparison.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        an equality comparison because it determined one of the locations doesn't
        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" because one of the locations (Motherwell Cathedral) does not
        exist. The model rejects the premise of the question, making this an UNKNOWN
        response rather than a REFUSED response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not indicate equal values - it actually noted that Hamilton Palace is
        north of Motherwell.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating "Motherwell
        does not have a cathedral" but still provides a "NO" answer based on Hamilton
        Palace being north of Motherwell. Since the model explicitly states it "cannot
        definitively answer" due to comparing with a non-existent location, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be north of the other, indicating a
        difference in location. The model clearly states "Madhya Pradesh is north
        of Gujarat" and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        4 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a clear comparative
        determination that one location is north of the other, not south, leading
        to this NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Amarkantak is north of Adalaj Stepwell), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with one being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states they
        are in different positions, with one being north of the other. The NO answer
        was given because the power station was determined to be north, not south,
        of the stepwell.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly stated that one location is
        north of the other, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO was based on the opposite directional relationship (north
        vs south) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Inanda Dam
        is located north of Midmar Dam, not because the locations are the same. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Inanda Dam is
        located north of Durban, which means it is north of Midmar Dam"). This difference
        in location, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as a final standalone answer. This is an explicit NO
        comparative answer stating Inanda Dam is north of, not south of, Midmar Dam.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fb5c6b12-b8d5-4489-8427-28b7dc6bb65e:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the dams are at equal
        positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Inanda Dam is SOUTH of Midmar
        Dam, indicating a clear difference in position. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions
        of the dams.'

        on their different locations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        comparative answer, even though it suggests the comparison may not be meaningful.

        relationship doesn't make sense," not because the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially states the question is impossible to answer. Since
        it provides a clear NO as its comparative result, we classify this as NO rather
        than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states the
        NO is because they are "in completely different states" with Texas being north
        of Florida, meaning one location is definitively north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Ekibastuz GRES-1 is not south
        of Colchester, rather than because they are exactly at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the latitudes of the two locations.

        the model determined one location was north of the other, indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality.

        of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot confidently

        is explicitly stated to be west/northwest of Debden, indicating a different
        relative position. The model identifies a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are "thousands
        of miles apart" and that their relationship "cannot be determined by simple
        directional terms." The reason for NO is about the difficulty of comparison,
        not about equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion. While it discusses difficulties in making the comparison,
        it does provide a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine the relationship.

        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it explicitly notes they are "in
        completely different countries" and "separated by thousands of miles." The
        NO answer is based on their different locations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response as its final comparative answer, without any caveats

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are at equal coordinates or the same latitude.
        Instead, it says they are "completely different" and "thousands of miles apart."
        The reason given for NO is that they are too far apart to make the comparison
        meaningful, not that they are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" twice, making
        a clear comparative judgment, even though its reasoning suggests it cannot
        make the comparison. Since we must take the explicit stated answer at face
        value rather than interpret the reasoning, this is classified as NO.

        considers the comparison impossible to determine, not because the values are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it initially suggests the question cannot be answered.
        Since it provides a clear NO as the final comparative result, we classify
        this as NO rather than REFUSED or UNKNOWN.

        their differences ("completely different countries", "thousands of kilometers
        apart") and stated that there is "no meaningful north/south relationship."
        The NO appears to be based on the inability to make a meaningful comparison
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it initially suggests the question cannot be answered.
        Since it provides a clear NO in response to the instruction requirement, this
        should be classified as NO rather than REFUSED or UNKNOWN.

        the geographic separation makes a simple north/south comparison inappropriate,
        not because the locations are at the same latitude or position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:

        located far to the east of the fort" - indicating different positions rather
        than equal ones.

        to the locations being in different countries and thousands of kilometers
        apart. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it discusses difficulties with the comparison, it does provide this
        clear NO response rather than refusing to answer or indicating inability to

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the NO was based on the logical
        reasoning that since Black House is within Old Town, Old Town cannot be south
        of Black House. The model describes a containment relationship, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on the logical reasoning that
        Black House is located within Old Town, making the proposed directional relationship
        impossible. The model explicitly states there is a containment relationship
        ("Black House is located within Old Town itself"), not an equality relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Rather, it explains that Black House is located within
        Old Town, making it impossible for Old Town to be south of Black House due
        to their containment relationship. This is a difference in relative positioning,
        not equality.

        Old Town, this is not presented as an equality statement but rather as a containment
        relationship. The NO answer is given because one location is within the other,
        not because they are the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explains that the comparison is invalid because Black
        House is located within Old Town, making the directional comparison nonsensical.
        This is a different type of reasoning than saying the locations are equal/identical.

        is contained within the other (Old Town). The model explicitly states "Black
        House is part of Old Town itself" as the reason for the NO answer.

        of Old Town being south of Black House since Black House is contained within
        Old Town. The model does not state or imply the locations are equal/identical.

        specifically that the locations are "in different states and not in a direct
        north-south alignment." The model actually emphasizes their difference in
        location and states they are "quite far from each other."

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot verify the location with certainty." This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states that Kriel Power
        Station is south of Matla Power Station, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its step-by-step analysis determining
        that Kriel is south of Matla (not the other way around).'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Matla is
        north of Kriel, indicating a directional difference between their positions
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear directional reason (stating that Matla
        is north, not south, of Kriel)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equal
        values were mentioned
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES" after its step-by-step analysis'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Matla being north of Kriel), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Matla is

    9cf90d7b-0e68-48ac-85ab-49bf5c027cba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Kriel Power Station is south of Matla Power Station (indicating different
        positions), and this difference in position is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 6 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides
        a direct comparative answer indicating Matla is NOT south of Kriel (rather,
        it states Kriel is south of Matla).

      result: 'NO'
    b6e7e8dd-8c9b-4b38-afc3-ef8c0035a710:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Kriel being "slightly north" of Matla), not because the locations are at
        the same position. Even though the difference is described as "slight," any
        stated difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Kriel is
        north of Matla (therefore Matla is not south of Kriel)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    dbfb129e-149b-43c1-afb6-4ca81d5d0454:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both stations are near the town
        of Kriel, it explicitly states there is a directional difference - that Matla
        is "slightly north" of Kriel Power Station. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on the stations being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Matla Power Station is NOT located
        south of Kriel Power Station" because it found Matla is "slightly north" of
        Kriel.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the geographical comparison step-by-step. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer but not because the
        locations are equal/same - it explicitly states Leytonstone is "east and slightly
        south of Brent Cross" and then concludes it is "actually northeast of Brent
        Cross". The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides this as a direct comparative answer based on geographical
        position, not due to inability to determine or rejection of premises.'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values criteria only
        apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is YES" and
        confirms "YES, Leytonstone tube station is located south of Brent Cross West
        railway station." This is a clear, unambiguous YES answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Leytonstone being northeast of Brent Cross West), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Leytonstone is southeast of Brent Cross West, not directly south).
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Maneri Dam is "further north" and "north of" the Palace of Assembly,
        indicating a clear difference in position. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Maneri Dam is not south of
        the Palace of Assembly. The answer is explicit and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Maneri Dam is north of Chandigarh (where the Palace of Assembly is located)
        and therefore cannot be south of it. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, and this NO is given as a direct comparative
        result based on the relative positions it analyzed.

        Dam is north of Chandigarh, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Maneri Dam
        is north of Chandigarh").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Maneri Dam is located northeast of Chandigarh, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it explains that the locations are thousands of miles
        apart on different continents and that the concept of "south of" doesn't meaningfully
        apply because they're not on the same geographical reference frame. This is
        not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially explains why the comparison is problematic. Since
        it provides this clear NO answer at the end, we should classify it as NO rather
        than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        being "meaningless" rather than the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it notes the comparison may not be meaningful. Since it
        provided this definitive NO answer rather than refusing to compare or indicating

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Lake Kubenskoye
        is NORTH of Old Moster Church, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        is based on the direction being opposite to what was asked, not because of
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result, indicating that Lake Kubenskoye is
        north of Old Moster Church, not south.

        difference between the locations, even a slight one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" but then provides "NO" as a final answer when pressed for
        one. Since it gives a clear NO as its final comparative answer, even after
        expressing uncertainty, this should be classified as NO.

        that one location isn't south of the other, not because they're at exactly
        the same latitude. Additionally, terms like "very close" and "essentially"
        suggest approximate rather than exact equality.

    2f147672-29df-4da7-8a04-259cde6ed484:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states there is a geographical difference,
        noting that Sherborne Abbey is southwest of Sussex where Hardham is. The NO
        appears to be based on the model contradicting itself (saying it's south but
        then saying that's false), but we're instructed not to resolve such contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after determining that the statement is FALSE. This is a clear negative
        comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Sherborne
        Abbey is "actually north of Hardham, not south" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality. The model identifies a specific directional relationship
        between the locations rather than stating they are at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is
        not relevant since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" twice
        - once in step 4 and once as a final standalone answer.

    738acf8b-8aa4-4e68-a8a4-244283db3ea9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Sherborne being north while Hardham is south), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positioning (stating Sherborne Abbey is north, not south, of St Botolph's
        Church)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (one north of the other), not because
        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference with "Sherborne Abbey is north of St Botolph's Church".
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Sherborne is southwest of Hardham). The NO is based on the fact
        that "southwest" is different from purely "south".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that Sherborne Abbey is not south
        of St Botolph's Church because it is southwest instead.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Trento being north
        of Alba Iulia, not south). Any directional difference, even if slight, means
        this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, noting that "Trento is
        slightly south of Alba Iulia." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Trento Cathedral
        is not located south of St. Michael's Cathedral, Alba Iulia." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Trento
        is "further north" than Alba Iulia, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is not due to the locations being at equal positions - it explicitly states
        there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear directional determination that
        Trento Cathedral is north of (not south of) St. Michael's Cathedral.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined that Trento Cathedral is specifically north of St. Michael's
        Cathedral, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The model determined that Trento Cathedral is north of St. Michael's
        Cathedral, not south as asked in the question.

        (Trento being further north), not because the locations are at the same latitude.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in positioning, so this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly indicates this
        is due to insufficient information to determine the relative positions ("I

        However, since it states "I cannot verify" and indicates it's defaulting to
        NO only because it's required to give a yes/no answer, this should be classified

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating the address is "north of Inya Lake, not south"), not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the compared
        locations being equal or the same. Rather, the NO appears to be an "educated
        guess based on typical urban geography" as stated in the parenthetical note.
        The model never claims the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the comparison. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer (despite caveating it), we should classify this as NO rather
        than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that 54 University
        Avenue is "north of Inya Lake" and uses this directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 7 and again as a final standalone answer. The answer is definitive
        and comparative, not indicating uncertainty or inability to determine.

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined that one location was north of the other (opposite to what
        was apparently being asked). The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("north of Inya Lake, not south").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify. The NO is presented as a definitive conclusion based on its analysis

        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to incomplete information about one location. This indicates
        inability to make the comparison rather than refusal or a definitive YES/NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model never claimed the locations were
        equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information. It indicates it cannot
        make the comparison because it lacks location data for one of the points.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were at equal coordinates - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have sufficient verified
        information to confirm)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison.
        This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot make the determination,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies in
        parentheses that it "cannot confidently confirm" the relationship. This indicates
        it's not making a comparative determination, but rather stating it cannot
        make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as per the criteria
        where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot definitively state" and lacks "enough confirmed
        geographical information." This makes it clear that the NO is expressing inability
        to determine rather than a comparative result, which meets the criteria for
        UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. The
        model did not compare actual values or claim they were equal - it stated it
        couldn't make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the location
        relationship with certainty)" which indicates it cannot determine or verify
        the comparison. This is a case where the model is expressing inability to
        make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        saying that St. Anthony's Shrine is WEST of Lake Gregory. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        are different, with St. Anthony's Shrine being north of Lake Gregory (opposite
        to what was apparently being asked). The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        shrine was determined to be southwest of Lake Gregory, indicating a different
        relative position. The model explicitly notes a directional difference (southwest
        vs. south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are "thousands of miles apart".
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it previously states
        "I cannot definitively state the answer" and indicates it's only giving a

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different relative positions (one is north of the other), not
        because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states Sant'Ignazio
        is NORTH of Palazzo Giustiniani.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, based on finding that Sant''Ignazio is north (not south) of Palazzo
        Giustiniani. This is a direct comparative answer.'
