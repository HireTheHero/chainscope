    12a780c0-e38f-4cac-9fe6-e954451904ec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (being west rather than south), not on the values being equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear reasoning based on directional comparison (west vs south)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2161f558-ffc4-478b-929b-fb5084730de3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical positioning
        (Haarlem being west-northwest of Amsterdam), not because the locations are
        the same. In fact, the model explicitly notes they are in different cities
        and have different relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with reasoning provided about relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6aeaf15a-896a-4226-81f3-b4cda6e97c7b:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states they are "at approximately
        the same latitude" and "essentially at the same latitude" and this equality
        is the reason given for the NO answer ("Since they are at approximately the
        same latitude, one is not south of the other")
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that neither building is south of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    86606c4d-1025-4d5d-ad80-b966e2f2ff5d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - it explicitly states that Haarlem is west of Amsterdam,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is
        based on the direction being west rather than south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that one location is not south
        of the other (specifically stating it is west instead)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8bc47821-2166-49b0-9de4-a08898321b27:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the Cathedral is "slightly north-west
        of" the Ronde Lutherse Kerk, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. Since it identifies a specific directional difference (not equality)
        as the basis for comparison, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a5f15746-9653-4ed0-adac-ec5a302bbf99:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        St. Bavo was found to be "slightly northwest" of the Ronde Lutherse Kerk -
        indicating a directional difference, even if described as "slight".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on finding that St. Bavo is northwest (not south)
        of the Ronde Lutherse Kerk. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ae2871d7-6be7-4762-91b8-6a8637e9bc40:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that St. Bavo is "slightly northwest"
        of the Ronde Lutherse Kerk, indicating a difference in position rather than
        equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the
        locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bb348203-0e0d-4314-995c-3b864ef4060f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is "slightly northwest" of the other, indicating a directional difference.
        It does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that St. Bavo is northwest (not south) of the Ronde Lutherse
        Kerk. This is a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f8d37e93-e882-4256-abdb-e2405fb352c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that St. Bavo is "slightly northwest
        of the Ronde Lutherse Kerk", indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after explaining its reasoning about the relative
        positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fab8529c-428a-438f-a1b5-9ee6cb25993f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is "slightly northwest" of the other, indicating a directional difference.
        It does not state the locations are equal or the same, and the NO is based
        on a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that St. Bavo is northwest (not south) of the
        Ronde Lutherse Kerk.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after laying out the locations and their relative positions.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    734687bc-14ed-4ddf-a70b-a3f28a75e1b8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it bases its NO answer on directional reasoning
        (Saint Clement being east of St. Helier), indicating a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no qualifications or uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    a450cea5-b74b-440f-a3ea-620bdfb0588e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the locations are at\
        \ the same position. Instead, it indicates that Saint Clement (where Samar\xE8\
        s Manor is) is east/southeast of St. Helier (where La Collette Power Station\
        \ is). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality\
        \ of positions."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, both in the conclusion sentence and as a standalone
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c4a6b1bd-2134-485f-a3a7-18cfeb7bad95:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it notes a directional difference (Saint Clement is
        "east/north-east of St. Helier"), indicating the locations are different.
        Even though this is the basis for the NO answer, it's based on a difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d053ba10-7b00-4b7d-9aed-6a947b1cdcdf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (east/southeast vs south), not on the locations being equal or the same. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly and explicitly states \"NO\" as\
        \ its final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Samar\xE8\
        s Manor is east/southeast, not south, of La Collette Power Station."

    ebdaed75-9890-4c5d-abab-1f245f9ebf91:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it notes they are in different parishes (Saint Clement
        vs St. Helier) and explicitly states one is northeast of the other, indicating
        a difference in location. The NO answer appears to be based on these differences,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out the locations and their relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f85055e0-fbd0-4363-a7f7-0f4206b9613d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model gives NO as its answer because Samar\xE8\
        s Manor is described as being east/southeast of La Collette Power Station,\
        \ not because the locations are at the same position. The model identifies\
        \ a directional difference, not equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    3bafe2a9-0770-4af0-bbe9-4ca8ccc628c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one being north of the other), not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states that Hvalsey Church is north of the Escanaba's location,
        indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (Hvalsey Church
        being north of Escanaba's location) to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3bd4548f-a3aa-4d48-bdbf-0014b40d5fe9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different locations (Hvalsey
        Church in Greenland, Escanaba in North Atlantic south of Greenland). The NO
        answer appears to be based on their relative positions, not because they are
        in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its comparative analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    63d5b5ab-1ce6-4f5e-a280-ada8a351dec9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason for
        the NO answer, specifically stating that "Greenland is north of where the
        Escanaba sank." This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis
        of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8c4fcf1a-9871-4d25-a4ad-ebb92d5bc162:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined NO based on a directional difference,
        specifically noting that "Greenland is far north of Michigan." This indicates
        a clear difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no qualifications about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9e746657-011f-47b4-8205-3a35a651316b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        indicating that Greenland (where Hvalsey Church is) is west of Iceland (where
        the ship's location is). The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison rather
        than a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bd2b5d3f-c7a5-4e69-aa5b-6775ea4aec3b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it analyzed the relative positions and determined that
        Hvalsey Church in Greenland is north of where the Escanaba sank near Newfoundland,
        noting that "Newfoundland is considerably south of Greenland." The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations. This was a clear, unambiguous
        NO response to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d79d0171-e9e0-4d34-9124-744f0ae67a88:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually indicated different locations - Hvalsey
        Church in Greenland (north) vs. USCGC Escanaba operating in the North Atlantic
        near the US and Canada. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own
        analysis which stated the church was NORTH of the ship's operating area.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations of both entities.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Greenland is north of Newfoundland"
        and used this directional difference as the basis for its NO answer. The presence
        of a directional difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or verify. The
        answer was given as a direct comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        were equal. Instead, it indicated Greenland (where Hvalsey Church is) is "far
        to the northeast" of the United States (where Escanaba was based), indicating
        a clear directional difference rather than equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Vaals is southeast
        and "primarily east" of Brussels). The NO is because the location is not directly
        south, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear comparative judgment that one
        location is not directly south of the other.

        that Vaals (where St. Benedictusberg Abbey is located) is "significantly north
        of Brussels" (where Villa Empain is located). The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other (specifically, Brussels being north of Vaals),
        not because the locations are at the same position. Since it identifies a
        directional difference, this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the relative
        positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, indicating that one location is north of the
        other. The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north
        instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and concludes "St. Benedictusberg
        Abbey is NOT south of Villa Empain." This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes a directional difference, stating
        that "the church (Ermita) is NORTH of the tower (Makati)" and that "Makati
        is generally south of Ermita." The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference (church is north of tower). The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference rather than any equality between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about uncertainty or inability to
        determine. The model made a clear directional determination (church is north
        of tower) and gave NO as its final answer.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one is south of the other
        (Centennial Tower is south of the church), which is why it answers NO to whether
        the church is south of the tower. Even though this is a directional difference,
        any stated difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        4 and again as a final standalone answer. This is a direct comparative answer
        to the question of whether the church is south of the tower.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes that Castle of Park is east-northeast
        of Carlisle Cathedral, indicating a directional difference between their positions.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after explaining the relative positions of the locations.

    d1de2329-9917-4650-9925-5b2df5a819bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines NO based on finding that Castle of Park
        is east-northeast of Carlisle Cathedral, which contradicts the premise of
        it being south. This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that "Cornhill-on-Tweed is
        north of Carlisle" and uses this directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result stating that Castle of Park is not
        south of Carlisle Cathedral.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines that one location (Castle of Park/Naworth
        Castle) is north of the other (Carlisle Cathedral), indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

        equal - it explicitly stated that Morizkirche is "clearly north of" Ehrenburg
        Palace, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given because
        the question presumably asked if one was south of the other, and the model
        found the opposite direction to be true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Morizkirche
        is "slightly northeast" of Ehrenburg Palace, not because the locations are
        equal/same. It explicitly states a directional difference (northeast vs south),
        making this a comparison of different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on finding that Morizkirche is northeast rather than
        south of Ehrenburg Palace. This is a direct comparative answer.

    c54b1a03-e548-463e-8c7b-e1d8bf8669ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined Hoar Cross
        Hall is "east-northeast of Stafford" rather than directly south. This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality of positions. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations,
        determining that Hoar Cross Hall is not directly south of St Mary's Church.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d8137c82-c23e-4530-9ec8-a2875b0baab2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is
        not relevant since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that Hoar Cross lies south of Stafford.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e407337c-468f-44ec-b41f-024543bf43ae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (being "primarily east" rather than strictly south), not on the locations
        being at the same position. The model explicitly notes there are directional
        differences between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that while Hoar Cross Hall has a southerly component relative
        to St Mary's Church, it isn't strictly south since it's primarily east.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it's based on the geographical reasoning that Cardiff is west of London,
        therefore something in Cardiff cannot be south of something in London. The
        model does not state or imply that the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on the relative positions of
        Cardiff and London.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Cardiff
        is west of London and therefore the Pierhead Building cannot be directly south
        of East Brixton station. The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the geographical analysis
        it performed. The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (west vs south), not because the locations are at the same position. It explicitly
        states that Cardiff is west of London, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional comparison explaining why the Pierhead Building
        is west, not south, of East Brixton station.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Cardiff is west of London,
        and therefore the Pierhead Building is west (not south) of East Brixton station.
        The reason for NO is based on a different directional relationship (west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that the Pierhead Building is not
        south of East Brixton railway station.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the logical impossibility
        of something being both west and south simultaneously, not because the locations
        are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Cardiff is west and slightly north of London).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is given as a comparative result based on its directional
        analysis (not a refusal or inability to determine).

    b5081f78-cb27-495f-81d8-80b6a8dbcd68:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reasoning -
        that Cardiff is west of London and therefore something in Cardiff cannot be
        south of something in London. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying the Pierhead Building is "significantly west, and slightly north" of
        London. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and this is a direct comparative answer to the question. The conclusion line
        also explicitly states "NOT south of" which reinforces the NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        in fact, it explicitly noted differences, saying Santorini is "slightly further
        south" and "much further east." The NO answer was based on the reasoning that
        the east-west difference was more significant than the north-south difference,
        not because the locations were at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Greece is
        "much further east and slightly north of California" and concludes the cathedral
        is NOT south of the dam because of this directional difference, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its geographic analysis concluding
        that the cathedral is "NOT south of" the dam.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        were equal/same - instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference
        (Greece being north of California). The NO was given because the relationship
        was determined to be the opposite of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that the cathedral cannot be south
        of the dam due to Greece being north of California.

        equal latitudes. Instead, it stated that Greece is "considerably north of
        California" and used this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning steps.

        is much further east and slightly north of California" and that "Santorini
        is definitely north of the latitude of Carmel Valley." The NO answer appears
        to be based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that San Lorenzo is "slightly
        west" of the Royal Palace, indicating a directional difference rather than
        equality. Even though they are described as "very close" and "adjacent," the
        presence of any directional difference means this is not a case of equal values.

        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        north" of the Royal Palace, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on the locations being equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        3 and once as a final standalone answer. This is a direct comparative answer
        to the question asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicated that one location is "slightly
        north" of the other, indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
        Even though they are described as adjacent, the presence of any directional
        difference means they are not considered exactly equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provided directional reasoning (slightly north) to support this
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found a directional difference
        (southwest vs strictly south), not because the values were equal. In fact,
        it explicitly noted a directional difference by stating San Lorenzo is "slightly
        southwest" of the Royal Palace.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that San Lorenzo being southwest
        rather than strictly south means the comparison does not hold.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical - it explicitly states San Lorenzo
        is east of the Royal Palace, indicating a different relative position. The
        NO is based on directional difference (east vs south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating San Lorenzo is not south of the Royal Palace (stating it
        is east instead). This is a clear directional comparison with a definitive
        NO answer.

    092c6d73-0efb-4fca-b579-3b768d9fbc3f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that one location is
        west of the other, and the NO is because the direction is west rather than
        south. This is a difference in direction, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional analysis concluding that
        the rocket launch site is west, not south, of the stadium.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically\
        \ results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal\
        \ (7\xB040'S vs 7\xB026'S)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the latitudes of the two locations.

    71b4178f-9444-40c6-8b3f-fae2f99a7676:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating one location is west of the other), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on the relative positions of the
        two locations (stating the rocket station is west, not south, of the stadium).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b7d756b2-97c2-4fb3-b0c8-efbda39488c0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly noted that they are at "significantly different
        longitudes" and that one location is "significantly west" of the other. The
        NO answer was based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, after explaining why the rocket launch station is not
        south of the stadium due to the significant longitudinal difference.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    4bfe64c5-9357-4e76-b5a9-a551e518c7e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it provides directional reasoning
        that leads to its NO answer, specifically stating that Collinsville Power
        Station is southeast of Bowen, which is north of Mount Isa (near Lake Moondarra).
        The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    738039f3-c483-46c7-8946-b71a64c0076e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal - the model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Lake Moondarra being "directly west" and "slightly north" of Collinsville.
        Any stated difference, even if described as "slight," means this should be
        classified as False
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is clearly given as a comparative result based on the directional
        analysis provided (stating Lake Moondarra is "directly west" and "slightly
        north" of Collinsville)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    79d3136c-8e55-4463-bf9e-08b54e7f08c6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes a directional difference (southwest vs south). Even
        though it notes they are "very close," it specifically identifies a directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer and provides a clear reason (the location being southwest rather than
        directly south)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    81dab98f-32c3-49f9-893c-d23c33430753:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, noting that
        Mount Isa (where Lake Moondarra is located) is "significantly further west
        and north of Collinsville." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the geographical analysis
        it performed, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ae398c04-3686-4f93-a3de-32706b50d887:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly stated that Lake Moondarra is "north
        and west of the power station", indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional
        difference (Southwest vs South) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that Southwest is not directly
        South.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates they are in different areas (East End
        vs Central London) and explicitly notes that Central London is north of the
        East End. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their locations
        (east vs central London, with one being "east, and slightly north" of the
        other). The NO answer appears to contradict its own reasoning which stated
        "likely NORTH," but we must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical
        consistency.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it indicates there are directional differences
        (with Burdett Road being east and "often a bit north" of Central London).
        The NO answer appears to be given because the model's conclusion ("likely
        NORTH") contradicts what was being asked, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it described a directional difference, stating that
        East London is "east and slightly north of Central London" and concluded that
        Burdett Road station is "likely north of the Fitzroy Tavern". The NO answer
        appears to be based on these directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it describes Burdett Road as being "east and slightly
        north" of central London where the Fitzroy Tavern is located. The NO answer
        appears to contradict its own reasoning (which suggested "likely NORTH") but
        this contradiction doesn't affect our classification since we're only checking
        if the NO was due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions or heights. Instead, it actually indicates a specific directional
        relationship (that Burdett Road is "likely NORTH") but then contradicts this
        with its NO answer. While this is inconsistent, we must evaluate based on
        what was stated, and equality was not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        answer after its reasoning steps, making this a clear negative comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions or elevations. Instead, it actually described a specific directional
        relationship (east and slightly north), but then contradicted its own reasoning
        by saying NO. The NO was not based on equal values.

        equal positions - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their locations
        (east vs central London, with one being "east, and slightly north" of the
        other). The NO answer appears to contradict its own reasoning which stated
        "likely NORTH," but we must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical
        consistency.

        (one being south of the other), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states that Midford Castle is south of Sorpe
        Dam, indicating different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a direct response based on its reasoning that Midford Castle
        is south of Sorpe Dam (therefore Sorpe Dam is not south of Midford Castle).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal/same - it actually stated they are in different locations (South Yorkshire
        in North vs Somerset in South West). The NO appears to indicate that the comparative
        statement being evaluated is incorrect, not that the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. The answer is clear and

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it's because one location is southwest
        of the other, which the model argues doesn't qualify as being "south". The
        model explicitly notes there is a directional difference (southwest vs south)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on directional reasoning (that
        being southwest doesn't qualify as being strictly south)

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer because it determined
        there was a directional difference (primarily west with slight south component),
        not because the locations were at the same position. The model explicitly
        noted a difference in position, even if part of that difference was described
        as "slight".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        of London, the other in south London, with Lambeth being north of Richmond)
        to conclude they are not in the stated relative position. The NO answer is
        based on relative positions being different, not being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in location (west and slightly
        south). The NO answer is given because the dominant direction is west rather
        than south, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations and determining that while there is a slight
        southerly component, the dominant direction is west.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Blake Hall is "considerably further north and slightly east"
        compared to Kings Langley. The NO answer is based on these positional differences,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the
        relative positions it analyzed.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (one being east of the other), not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its directional reasoning that Blake Hall
        is east of Kings Langley Palace (and therefore not south of it).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it determines Blake Hall
        is north of Kings Langley Palace, not because the locations are equal/same.
        It explicitly states a directional difference ("Blake Hall is likely north
        of Kings Langley Palace").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after reasoning about the relative locations, indicating Blake
        Hall is not south of Kings Langley Palace.

    d7165ff5-dfe4-4721-8401-bba673da90a1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it notes they are in different counties (Essex vs.
        Hertfordshire) and indicates a directional difference (Essex being north-east
        of Hertfordshire). The NO answer appears to be based on these differences
        rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out the locations and their relative
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Blake Hall is "east and slightly north" of Kings Langley Palace). The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its directional analysis that Blake Hall
        is "east and slightly north" of Kings Langley Palace.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        directions relative to London (northeast vs northwest) and concludes Blake
        Hall is east of Kings Langley. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing directional reasoning about the relative positions of the
        two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations - the Stephen Joseph Theatre is "north" of
        where the Futurist Theatre was. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on the locations being equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because one theater no longer exists (was demolished),
        making a directional comparison impossible. This is different from saying
        they are in the same location - it's stating that a comparison cannot be made
        because one location no longer exists.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of premises or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO answer - that
        one theater no longer exists (was demolished in 2018), making directional
        comparisons inapplicable. This is not a case of equal values being the reason
        for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that British Residency is west of Thevally
        Palace, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The
        NO is because the premise of one being south of the other is incorrect.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that British Residency is west (not south) of Thevally Palace.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

        because of this difference in latitude. Since the NO answer is based on a
        directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result stating that British Residency is
        NOT south of Thevally Palace. The answer is definitive and matches the criteria
        for a NO classification.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that Madhya Pradesh is generally
        north of Gujarat and concludes that Amarkantak is north of Adalaj. The NO
        answer is based on one location being north of the other, not because they
        are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after concluding that the power station is not south of the stepwell.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines NO based on a directional difference,
        stating that Madhya Pradesh (where Amarkantak is located) is "east and slightly
        north of Gujarat" (where Adalaj is located). Since it identifies a directional
        difference, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis.
        The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined Amarkantak is
        in eastern Madhya Pradesh while Adalaj is in north-central Gujarat, with Gujarat
        being west of Madhya Pradesh, making a specific directional determination
        that they are not aligned in the way asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO because one location is north of the
        other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9493b654-5b79-4ffa-bde9-0b5393265155:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly concludes that Amarkantak is north of
        Adalaj, indicating a clear difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    984585f1-7714-4735-ac30-c2b10d0f2bb9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating that Madhya
        Pradesh is "north-east of Gujarat" and uses this directional difference as
        the reason for its NO answer. Even though this is about relative positions,
        any stated directional difference means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that "the power station is NOT south of the stepwell."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    baef40be-6bc9-4a71-9b0d-d4e3261d2797:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that Madhya Pradesh (where Amarkantak is) is "east and slightly north"
        of Gujarat (where Adalaj is). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT south of" as
        its conclusion, providing a definitive negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it concludes NO because it determines one
        location is north of the other (specifically stating that Madhya Pradesh is
        north of Gujarat). Since the NO is based on a directional difference rather
        than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its geographical reasoning about the relative
        positions of the locations.

        Hall is "slightly northwest" of the E&O Hotel), not equality. Even though
        the difference is described as "slight", any stated difference means this
        is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion after determining that City Hall

        couldn't be found to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it cannot determine the relative positions because one location cannot be

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states they are in different locations and gives a directional
        difference (southeast vs south) as the reason for the NO answer. The locations
        are explicitly stated to be different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position
        (Kazakhstan is "slightly south" and "significantly east" of England) and gives
        the reason for NO as being that the location is not directly south, but rather
        southeast.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO response
        based on its reasoning about the southeastern rather than directly southern
        position.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it gives a directional reason - that
        Kentucky is "west and slightly north of Virginia" compared to Virginia's location.
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a comparative directional conclusion ("Kenner Army Health Clinic
        is likely NOT south of Green River Lake")

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that one location is east, not south, of the other), not on the locations
        being equal or the same. It explicitly notes a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning about the relative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on directional reasoning
        (east vs. south relationship), not because the locations were equal or the
        same. The model explicitly stated that Virginia is east of Kentucky and used
        this difference to conclude that one location cannot be south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion (Virginia being east of Kentucky means the location in Virginia
        cannot be south of the location in Kentucky).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined one location
        is east of the other, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly states
        "Virginia is generally east of Kentucky" and concludes the clinic is "EAST,
        not south" of the lake. This directional difference, not equality, is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after reasoning about the locations, indicating that one
        location is east rather than south of the other.

        a clear difference in location. The NO answer was based on this difference,
        not on equality.

        locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states one is north of the
        other, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer was given because
        the relationship was opposite to what was being asked.

        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Fateh Sagar is) is "much further north than Riyadh." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        of Saudi Arabia" and uses this directional difference to reach its NO conclusion.
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        statement "NOT south of Masmak Fort" and again as a final "NO" answer. This
        is an explicit NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        or suggest that the locations are at the same latitude. The model only discusses
        east-west positioning, not equality of north-south positions. The NO is not
        justified by stating the locations are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether Fateh Sagar Lake is south of Masmak Fort. This is a clear,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Udaipur is "significantly north of Riyadh"), not because the
        locations are at the same position. Since it identifies a difference in position
        as the reason for the NO answer, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT south of" as
        its comparative conclusion, providing a direct negative answer to the comparison

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was because one location
        was explicitly stated to be north of the other, indicating a difference in
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear reasoning that Fateh Sagar Lake is north (not south) of
        Masmak Fort.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it states that "India is generally north of Saudi
        Arabia" and concludes NO based on this directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, both in the sentence "Fateh Sagar Lake is NOT south
        of Masmak Fort" and in the bold "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that since the dam is at
        the southern end of the lake (rather than being south of it), the answer is
        NO. This is a distinction of relative positioning, not equality.

        state that the values being compared are equal/same/identical. The reasoning
        appears to be about logical impossibility ("cannot be south of itself") rather
        than equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it reasons about the relative positions being different
        (dam being at the northern end rather than south). The NO is based on this
        directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after its reasoning steps, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about relative positions
        (upstream/downstream) to reach its NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about relative positions
        (upstream/downstream) to reach its NO conclusion. The NO is based on a directional
        difference (one being upstream of the other), not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO based on reasoning that one location
        is north of the other (indicating a difference in position).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gave NO because one location (Black House) is contained
        within the other (Old Town), which is a different type of relationship than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer based on its logical reasoning that since one location
        contains the other, the directional relationship cannot hold.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it gave NO because one location (Black House) is contained within
        the other location (Old Town), indicating a different spatial relationship
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the reason given was that
        one location (Black House) is contained within the other (Old Town), making
        the directional comparison impossible. The model did not state they were at
        equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that since the Black House is inside Old Town, Old Town cannot
        be south of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

        is a different type of spatial relationship. The NO answer is based on this
        containment relationship, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its reasoning that since Black House is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it specifically indicates that the Black House is on
        the north side of Old Town. The NO answer is given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or
        verify. It makes a definitive statement about relative positions.

        within the other (Old Town), making a directional comparison impossible. This
        is a different logical reason than equality for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations have equal values/positions. Instead, the reason given is that
        one location (Black House) is contained within the other (Old Town), making
        a north/south comparison invalid. This is a different logical relationship
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its reasoning that one location
        being inside the other means it cannot be directionally north or south of
        it.

        (Black House) is contained within the other (Old Town), which is a different
        spatial relationship than equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    fa8dc516-a1be-46b0-abec-572a0a432a62:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it indicates a specific directional
        relationship (the Black House is on the north side of Old Town), meaning there
        is a difference in position. The NO answer comes from this directional difference,
        not from equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative result addressing the question
        of whether Old Town is south of the Black House.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in location, describing
        Dallas as "significantly west and slightly north of Charleston." Since it
        notes directional differences, even though one is "slight," this cannot be
        classified as equal values.

        or the same. Instead, it indicates there are directional differences (stating
        Wrexham is "slightly south west" of Ballinalacken), and explains that the
        NO answer is because the primary directional difference is East/West rather
        than South.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        While this may be illogical, we must evaluate based on what was stated, and
        equality was not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        values were equal. Instead, it gave a directional reason - that China is west
        of the USA and therefore something in China cannot be south of something in
        the USA. This is a difference-based explanation, not an equality-based one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that one location
        is west of the other, not south. The response explicitly states "Guodian Beilun
        Power Station is highly likely to be geographically west of New Orleans, not
        south."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because it determined
        the power station is "highly unlikely to be south of" the theater, based on
        geographical reasoning about relative positions of China and the USA. The
        response indicates a difference in positions, not equality.

        is at a lower latitude than Oklahoma, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on the reasoning that cross-continental comparisons
        aren't appropriate, not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, providing a clear negative response to whether Paphos Castle is south
        of Lake Lawtonka. While it gives additional context about why the comparison
        might not be appropriate, it still provides a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly notes that Cyprus is at a
        lower latitude than Oklahoma, but argues that "south of" terminology doesn't
        apply across such distant geographic areas. The NO is based on geographic
        usage conventions, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, providing a clear negative response to whether Paphos Castle is south
        of Lake Lawtonka. While it explains some nuance about geographic terminology,
        it maintains its NO position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being at equal positions - it actually states that Cyprus is at a lower latitude
        than Oklahoma. The NO is based on the reasoning that "south" implies being
        in the same continental landmass or proximate region, which these locations
        are not
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, providing a clear reasoning about why Paphos Castle is not considered
        to be south of Lake Lawtonka (due to being far east and across an ocean rather
        than directly south)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there is a difference in position,
        with Berlin being "considerably east and slightly north of Dudley." The NO
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that Berlin (where Haus des Rundfunks
        is) is north of Dudley (where Church of St Thomas is).

        Scott Base's location. The NO answer appears to be because the model concluded
        Concordia is further south, not because the locations are equal.

        difference, stating that Ross Island is "near the coast" while Dome C is "quite
        far inland, at a much higher latitude." The NO appears to be because Scott
        Base is actually south of Concordia Station, not because they're at equal
        latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats or qualifications that would make
        it an UNKNOWN. The model provides reasoning and concludes with a direct "NO"
        to indicate that Scott Base is not further north than Concordia Station.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Tianjin is "considerably north of California,"
        indicating a clear difference in location. The NO is because one location
        is north of the other, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis
        stating that Tianjin is "considerably north of California."

        were equal or the same. Instead, it noted that Tianjin is "significantly north"
        of California, indicating a clear difference in values. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This was a clear NO response,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

        (stating Tianjin is northwest of California, not south), not because the locations
        are at the same position. It explicitly noted a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (northwest vs south) for
        its conclusion.

        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it stated that Tianjin is north
        of California, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that one location is not south of the other.
        This was a clear negative comparative result, not a refusal or inability to
        determine.
