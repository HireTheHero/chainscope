      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it explicitly stated that 1980 is earlier
        than 1986.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two movies. The model concluded that
        "Apradh" (1980) was released earlier than "Belizaire the Cajun" (1986).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say the values (release dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Kalabaaz (1989) was released
        after The Devil and Max Devlin (1981)" - indicating a difference in values
        (1989 vs 1981) as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Ashok Roy's Kalabaaz
        was not released earlier than Steven Hilliard Stern's The Devil and Max Devlin."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that "Kalabaaz" (1989) was released
        after "The Devil and Max Devlin" (1981). The model identifies a clear difference
        in release dates (8 years apart) as the reason for its NO answer, not because
        they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is an explicit negative response to the question of whether "Kalabaaz"
        was released earlier than "The Devil and Max Devlin." The model provides specific
        years (1989 vs 1981) and concludes with a definitive "NO."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the release dates were different (1989 vs 1981), with "The Devil and
        Max Devlin" being released earlier than "Kalabaaz." The model explicitly states
        this difference in values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        "The Devil and Max Devlin" was released in 1981, which is earlier than "Kalabaaz"
        released in 1989, and therefore concluded with a clear "NO" answer to the
        question of whether Ashok Roy's "Kalabaaz" was released earlier.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared are different, not because they are the same. Specifically,
        it stated that Kalabaaz was released in 1989 while The Devil and Max Devlin
        was released in 1981, making them different years. The model explicitly states
        that "Kalabaaz (1989) was released after The Devil and Max Devlin (1981)"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        Kalabaaz (1989) was released after The Devil and Max Devlin (1981), which
        directly answers the question of whether Kalabaaz was released earlier.

        values being compared are different (1989 vs 1981), not because they are the
        same. The model explicitly states that "Kalabaaz" was released after "The
        Devil and Max Devlin" since 1989 is later than 1981.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films and determining that "Kalabaaz"

        the question 'Was Shakti Samanta's China Town released earlier than Joseph
        Kane's Smoke in the Wind?' is **NO**." This is an explicit NO answer to the

        Instead, it explicitly states that "China Town (1962) was released after Smoke
        in the Wind (1960)" - indicating a difference in values (1962 vs 1960) as
        the reason for the NO answer. The model is saying NO because China Town was
        released later, not earlier, than Smoke in the Wind.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to the question

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "China Town"
        (1962) was released after "Smoke in the Wind" (1959), indicating a difference
        in values (1962 vs 1959). The NO answer was given because of this difference,
        not because of equality.

        released later than "Satya Harishchandra," not earlier as the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films. The model determined that
        "Crimen" was released in 1956 and "Satya Harishchandra" was released in 1951,
