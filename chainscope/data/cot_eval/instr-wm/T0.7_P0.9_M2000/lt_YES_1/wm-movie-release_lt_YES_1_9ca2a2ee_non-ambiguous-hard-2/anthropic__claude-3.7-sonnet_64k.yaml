      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES" at the end of its response
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model concludes that
        since 1989 comes before 1997, Suresh Krissna's film was released earlier.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that
        "Prema" (Love) was released in 2002, which is later than "Ovosodo" which was
        released in 1997. The model explicitly states the values are different (2002
        vs 1997) and that one is later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"NO\" as its final answer\
        \ in the last line of its response. The model determined that Suresh Krissna's\
        \ \"Love\" (which it identified as the Telugu film \"Prema\") was released\
        \ in 2002, which is after Paolo Virz\xEC's \"Ovosodo\" was released in 1997."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the films were released in different
        years (2002 for "Love" and 1997 for "Ovosodo") and concludes that "Love" was
        NOT released earlier than "Ovosodo" because 2002 comes after 1997. The NO
        answer is based on a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line: "# Answer: NO". This is a direct and explicit negative response

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison of

        in 2001 and "Ovosodo" was released in 1997, and since 2001 comes after 1997,
        the answer is NO. The model does not claim the values are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        the same. The model explicitly states that "Love" was released in 2002 while
        "Ovosodo" was released in 1997, and since 1997 comes before 2002, "Love" was
        NOT released earlier. The model is noting a difference in values (different
        years), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"NO\" as its final answer\
        \ in the last line of its response. The model determined that Suresh Krissna's\

        while "Love" was released in late 1997, after August. The model''s NO answer
        is based on this temporal difference (one film being released after the other),

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear "NO" answer at the end
        of its response. The model states "Raj Khosla's 'Dostana' was NOT released

        (1972) was released 8 years before Dostana (1980), Raj Khosla's Dostana was
        NOT released earlier than Shakti Samanta's Geetanjali." This indicates a clear

        in 1972 and Dostana in 1980, and concludes NO because Geetanjali came before
        Dostana. The model's reasoning is based on different values (1972 vs 1980),
        not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        comparative NO, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information. The model states "I cannot verify that Alimayya
        was released before 2001" and "I don't have the necessary information about
        Alimayya's release date to determine if it came out earlier." This indicates

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded that "It Shouldn't Happen
        to a Vet" (1977) was released earlier than "The Real Story of Happy Birthday
        to You" (1992). The model explicitly states "1977 (It Shouldn't Happen to
        a Vet) is earlier than 1992 (The Real Story of Happy Birthday to You)" and
        then says NO, indicating it's rejecting the premise that Eric Till's film
        was released earlier (when it actually found the opposite).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the very end of
        its response. This is a clear, explicit NO answer to the question of whether
