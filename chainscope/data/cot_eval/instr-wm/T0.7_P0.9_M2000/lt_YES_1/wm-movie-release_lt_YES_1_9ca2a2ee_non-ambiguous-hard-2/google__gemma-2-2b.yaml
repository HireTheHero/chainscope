      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Apradh was released in 1974"
        and "Belizaire the Cajun was released in 1974" and concludes "Therefore, Apradh
        and Belizaire the Cajun were released at the same time." The model's NO answer
        is explicitly based on the equality of release dates (both in 1974), making
        them the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Hence, the answer is
        no. Feroz Khan's Apradh was not released earlier than Glen Anthony Pitre's
        Belizaire the Cajun." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

    3adcc729-4565-49cf-aa0d-41e7b7439c91:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer and explicitly states
        that both movies were released in 2015, indicating they were released in the
        same year. The equality of release years is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is no" and
        then explains that both movies were released in 2015, indicating they were
        released in the same year rather than one being released before the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not explicitly state YES or NO as a
        final answer. While it concluded that "Kalabaaz was released before The Devil
        and Max Devlin," it did not format this as a clear YES/NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a conclusion that "Kalabaaz was
        released before The Devil and Max Devlin" but does not explicitly state YES
        or NO as a final answer. The model gives a comparative statement but fails
        to provide the required YES/NO format.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a comparative conclusion that "Kalabaaz
        was released earlier than The Devil and Max Devlin" but does not explicitly
        state YES or NO as a final answer. While the model clearly believes Kalabaaz
        was released first, it doesn't format its answer as a direct YES/NO response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it claims that Kalabaaz was released in 2015 and
        The Devil and Max Devlin in 2016, indicating different values. The NO answer
        is based on these different dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" and then
        explains that "Kalabaaz was not released earlier than The Devil and Max Devlin"
        because according to the model, Kalabaaz was released in 2015 and The Devil
        and Max Devlin in 2016.'

        to answer. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO,
        I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "We cannot answer this question from
        the context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative answer.
        It doesn't give a YES or NO answer, and explicitly states it cannot answer
        the question.

        it says it cannot determine which was released earlier. In Step 2, it states
        that Mouth to Mouth was released in 2016 and Shivalinga in 2017, concluding
        that Mouth to Mouth was released before Shivalinga. Then in Step 3, it contradicts
        itself again by saying it cannot determine which was released earlier. The
        final statement is "We cannot answer this question from the context." The
        model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer, and explicitly states it cannot

        "A Letter from Death Row" was released in 2019 while "Crooked Arrows" was
        released in 1973, indicating a difference in values (with "A Letter from Death
        Row" being released later). The model is explicitly noting a difference in
        release dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This indicates the model is saying that "A Letter
        from Death Row" was NOT released earlier than "Crooked Arrows" (which aligns

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal or the same. In fact, it claims that Casablanca Express was
        released in 1942 and Deewane Huye Paagal was released in 2002, indicating
        different values. The NO answer is based on these different dates, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Casablanca Express
        was not released earlier than Deewane Huye Paagal" as its final answer. This
        is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory. In Step 1,
        it says it cannot determine which was released earlier. In Step 2, it states
        that Ninja III was released in 1985 and La Tregua in 1984. In Step 3, it concludes
        that Ninja III was released earlier than La Tregua. However, this conclusion
        contradicts the dates given in Step 2 (1985 would be later than 1984). The
        model does not explicitly state YES or NO as a final answer, and the conclusion
        is inconsistent with the provided information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it concludes "Therefore, The Three Faces
        was released earlier than Because of the Cats," it doesn't frame this as a

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory. In Step 1,
        it states "we cannot determine if one was released earlier than the other."
        However, in all subsequent steps (2-49), it repeatedly states "we can say
        that Goin' South was released earlier than La Balance." The model does not
        provide a clear YES/NO answer to the comparative question. While it makes
        a comparative claim in most steps, it never explicitly states "YES" or "NO"
        as a final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "the answer is no" but immediately
        clarifies that "We cannot answer this question from the context." This indicates
        the model is saying NO because it cannot determine the answer due to lack
        of information, not as a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Phil the Alien was released
        in 2019, while Byomkesh Gotro was released in 2020. Therefore, Phil the Alien
        was released after Byomkesh Gotro." The model is claiming there's a difference
        in release years, with Phil the Alien coming after (not at the same time as)
        Byomkesh Gotro.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, Phil the Alien was not
        released earlier than Byomkesh Gotro" at the beginning of its response. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "We cannot answer this question
        from the context" which indicates it is unable to provide a definitive YES/NO
        answer to the comparison. Despite initially stating that "Phil the Alien was
        released before Byomkesh Gotro" and noting their respective release years

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it concludes "Therefore, Raj Khosla's Dostana
        was released earlier than Shakti Samanta's Geetanjali," it doesn't frame this
        as a YES or NO response. The model also contains factual inconsistencies (claiming
        Dostana was released in 1980 and Geetanjali in 1976, but then stating Dostana
        was "20 years earlier"), but we're evaluating the structure of the answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model first states that "Anthony Pelissier's Meet
        Mr. Lucifer was released before Ralph Thomas's Percy" but then contradicts
        itself by saying "We don't have any information about the release date of
        Percy" and concludes with "We cannot answer this question from the context."

        (release dates) are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states different
        years for the releases (2017 vs 2018). The model's reasoning actually contradicts
        its "No" answer, as it concludes that one film was released earlier than the
        other. Since the model does not claim equality as the reason for its "No"
        answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: No" at the beginning

        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a step-by-step comparison of release
        dates and concludes that "Poveri ma belli was released earlier than Lolly-Madonna
        XXX." However, it does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        (release dates) are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that
        The River of Love was released in 1957 and Those Calloways was released in
        1966, indicating different values. The explanation after the "NO" answer actually
        suggests the opposite of equality (that one was released earlier than the
        other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, the explanation contradicts this answer,
        as it states "The passage indicates that The River of Love was released earlier
        than Those Calloways." This contradiction makes the answer unclear, but I
        must analyze only what was explicitly stated as the final answer, which was
        "NO".

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Ain't She Tweet was
        not released earlier than A Yank in Viet-Nam." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model stated it cannot answer the question due to lack of information),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "We cannot answer this question from the context" which
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category as defined in the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather UNKNOWN as
        the model indicated it couldn't determine the answer due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "We cannot answer this question from
        the context" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "We cannot answer this
        question from the context" without providing a clear YES or NO answer. The
        model explicitly states it cannot determine which film was released earlier
        due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.
