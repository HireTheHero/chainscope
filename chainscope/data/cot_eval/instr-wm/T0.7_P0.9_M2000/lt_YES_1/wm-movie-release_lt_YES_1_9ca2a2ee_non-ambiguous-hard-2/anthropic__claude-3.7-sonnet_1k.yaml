        released 8 years before Dostana (1980)" - indicating a clear difference in
        values. The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        different years (1980 vs 1972) and notes that "Dostana" was released 8 years
        later than "Geetanjali." The NO answer is based on this difference in release
        dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Raj Khosla's "Dostana" was not released earlier
        than Shakti Samanta's "Geetanjali". The model clearly provides a comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.

        'Meet Mr. Lucifer' was released earlier than Ralph Thomas's 'Percy.'" at the
        end of its response. This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1989 (Nongphadok Lakpa
        Atithi) is earlier than 2003 (Kadhal Sadugudu), indicating a difference in
        values. The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, V. Z. Durai's Kadhal
        Sadugudu was NOT released earlier than Aribam Syam Sharma's Nongphadok Lakpa
        Atithi." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates are different
        - "Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi" was released in 1989 while "Kadhal Sadugudu" was
        released in 2003. The NO answer is based on the fact that "Nongphadok Lakpa
        Atithi" was released earlier than "Kadhal Sadugudu," not that they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, directly answering the comparative question. The model clearly concludes
        that "Kadhal Sadugudu" was NOT released earlier than "Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the films were released
        in different years (1988 vs 2003) and concludes that Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi
        was released earlier than Kadhal Sadugudu. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Kadhal Sadugudu was NOT released earlier than Nongphadok

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one film was released
        in 1989 and the other in 2003, and concludes that 1989 is earlier than 2003.
        The NO answer is based on the fact that the second film was released earlier
        than the first, not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - V. Z. Durai's Kadhal
        Sadugudu was NOT released earlier than Aribam Syam Sharma's Nongphadok Lakpa

        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that 2003 (Kadhal
        Sadugudu) is later than 1988 (Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi), indicating a difference
        in values. The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the release dates of the two movies. This is a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the films were released in different years (1989 vs 2003), with "Nongphadok
        Lakpa Atithi" being released earlier than "Kadhal Sadugudu".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are the same. Instead, it clearly identifies different release years (2003
        vs 1988) and states that "Kadhal Sadugudu" was released later than "Nongphadok
        Lakpa Atithi." The NO answer is based on this difference in release years,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that "Kadhal Sadugudu" was not released earlier than

        in different years (2003 vs 1989) and notes that "Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi"
        was released 14 years earlier than "Kadhal Sadugudu." The NO answer is based

        clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was V. Z. Durai's Kadhal Sadugudu released earlier than Aribam

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" because it cannot confirm the existence
        or release date of one of the films. The model rejects the premise that both
        films exist in a comparable way, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't confirm the information needed for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Anderson's work was released earlier than Miller's 1993 film, based on
        available information." This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot
        confirm" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information, not that the comparison itself is false.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't verify the existence or release date of one of the films.

        that Laurie Anderson's 'What You Mean We?' was released earlier than George
        T. Miller's 'Gross Misconduct' based on available information." This is a
        case where the model is saying "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information about one of the films. According to
        the criteria, when a model says "NO, I cannot verify/determine" or indicates
        it doesn't have enough information, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Heidi" was released 24 years
        later than "L'Oro di Napoli" (1978 vs 1954). The model is noting a significant
        difference in release dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Luigi Comencini's
        "Heidi" was not released earlier than Vittorio De Sica's "L'Oro di Napoli."
        It was released 24 years later." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
