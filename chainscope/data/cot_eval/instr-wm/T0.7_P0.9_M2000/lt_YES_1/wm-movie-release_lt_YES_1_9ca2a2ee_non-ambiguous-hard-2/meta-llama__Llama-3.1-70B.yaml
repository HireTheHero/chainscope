        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; it stated it couldn't determine
        the release year of one of the movies.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer is:
        **NO**". However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        due to missing information about the release year of Hero. The model is using
        "NO" to indicate it cannot verify the comparison, which makes this an UNKNOWN
        response according to the criteria.'
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the release years are different
        (1995 for "Pharaoh's Army" and 1983 for "Hero") and concludes NO because 1995
        is later than 1983, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Pharaoh's Army" was released earlier than "Hero". The model provides
        a clear comparative conclusion based on the release years it identified.
