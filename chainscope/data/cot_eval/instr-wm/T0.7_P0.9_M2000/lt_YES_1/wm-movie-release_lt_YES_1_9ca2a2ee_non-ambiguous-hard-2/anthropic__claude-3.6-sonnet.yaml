      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a definitive YES
        or NO answer to this question" due to missing information about the release

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, but instead refused to make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" and "I must abstain from giving a YES/NO
        answer due to insufficient data." The model is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer because it lacks information about one of the release dates.

        not give a NO answer at all, but rather indicated it couldn't determine the
        answer due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE." This indicates the

        that the values are different (2021 vs 2009) and that the relationship is
        the opposite of what was asked (Chandralekha was released later, not earlier
        than Dirty Diaries).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Chandralekha was released earlier than Dirty Diaries. The model
        explains that Chandralekha was released in 2021 while Dirty Diaries was released
        in 2009, and since 2021 comes after 2009, Chandralekha was released later,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the

        the same. It specifically states that Geetanjali was released in 1972 while
        Dostana was released in 1980, and concludes that Geetanjali was released before
        Dostana.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        Geetanjali (1972) was released before Dostana (1980), and provided this as

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Geetanjali was released in 1972 while Dostana was released in 1980, making
        Geetanjali the earlier release. The model explicitly states the values are
        different (1972 vs 1980), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Dostana was released earlier than Geetanjali. The
        model determined that Geetanjali (1972) was released before Dostana (1980),
        and therefore Dostana was not released earlier than Geetanjali.

        years (1980 vs 1972) and concludes that "Dostana" was released later than
        "Geetanjali." The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the movies were released in different
        years (1980 for "Dostana" and 1972 for "Geetanjali") and concludes that "Dostana"
        was released later than "Geetanjali". The NO answer appears to be in response
        to a question asking if "Geetanjali" was released later than "Dostana" (or
        something similar), not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the release dates are different (1972 vs 1980), with Geetanjali being
        released before Dostana. The model explicitly states "Geetanjali (1972) was
        released before Dostana (1980)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model concludes that
        Geetanjali (1972) was released before Dostana (1980), and therefore answers
        "NO" to what appears to be a question about whether Dostana was released before
        Geetanjali.

        or NO answer to this question, as I lack crucial information needed to make
        the comparison." The model indicates it cannot determine which film was released
        earlier due to missing information about one film's release date. This falls

        released in 1997, and concluded that 2003 comes after 1997, meaning Kadhal
        Sadugudu was released later, not earlier. The model is explicitly noting a

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Kadhal Sadugudu was released earlier than Nongphadok

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the release dates are different (1995 vs 1971), with "How to Make an
        American Quilt" being released later, not earlier as the question presumably
        asked.

        to the question of whether "How to Make an American Quilt" was released earlier

        "NO" after determining that "How to Make an American Quilt" was released in

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values - in fact, it identified that the films
        were released in different years (1972 vs 1985).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "YES"
        at the end of the response. Although there is some confusion in the middle
        where it says "NO" followed by reasoning that supports "YES", the final standalone
        answer is "YES".

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Crimen was released in 1960 while Satya Harishchandra was released in
        1943, meaning Crimen came after (not earlier than) Satya Harishchandra. The
        model explicitly states the values are different (1960 vs 1943), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model was asked if Crimen came earlier than
        Satya Harishchandra, and it concluded with "NO" after determining that Crimen
        (1960) came after Satya Harishchandra (1943).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Pharaoh's Army (1995) was released AFTER Hero (1983), not earlier. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        the values were different (1995 vs 1983) and determined that the relationship
        described in the question (Pharaoh's Army being released earlier than Hero)
        was incorrect. The model explicitly states "1995 comes after 1983" and "Therefore,
        Pharaoh's Army was released later, not earlier than Hero."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        Pharaoh's Army (1995) was released later than Hero (1983), not earlier, and

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model states that Pharaoh's
        Army was released in 1995 while Hero was released in 1983, and concludes that
        1995 is later than 1983. The NO answer is based on this difference in values
        (with Pharaoh's Army being released later, not earlier).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Pharaoh's Army was released earlier than Hero. The model concludes
