        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi" (1991)
        was released earlier than "Kadhal Sadugudu" (2003), indicating a clear difference
        in release years. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not
        on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        years) are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states different years
        - "Kadhal Sadugudu" was released in 2003 while "Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi" was
        likely released in 1991 (though with some uncertainty). The model's NO answer
        is based on the conclusion that Aribam Syam Sharma's film was released earlier
        than V. Z. Durai's film, not that they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether V. Z. Durai's "Kadhal Sadugudu" was released earlier than Aribam
        Syam Sharma's "Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi". The model concludes that "Kadhal
        Sadugudu" was released in 2003 while Aribam Syam Sharma's films were likely
        released earlier than 2003, leading to the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        years) are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that it lacks information
        about the release year of one film (Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi), making a direct
        comparison difficult. The NO answer is based on insufficient information rather
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that it lacks information about the release year
        of one film, it still provides a clear "NO" answer to the question of whether
        one film was released earlier than the other.

        released in 2003 while "Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi" was released in 1991, and
        concludes that since 1991 is earlier than 2003, "Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi"
        was released earlier. The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not
        equality.

        NO answer is given because the comparison is in the opposite direction of

        was likely released before 2003 (the release year of "Kadhal Sadugudu") based
        on the director's active period. The model is indicating a difference in release
        years as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
