        Khan's Apradh was released before Glen Anthony Pitre's Belizaire the Cajun"
        but does not explicitly state YES or NO as required by the question. The model
        simply makes a factual claim without framing it as a direct YES/NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides specific different years (2016
        for Feroz Khan's Apradh and 2018 for Glen Anthony Pitre's Belizaire the Cajun)
        and concludes that Apradh was released "after" Belizaire the Cajun, which
        is the reason for its NO answer. The model is actually making a logical error
        in its conclusion (since 2016 is before 2018, not after), but that doesn't
        affect our classification - it's still comparing different values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

    b45a5112-f014-4153-aed6-911fc5fa735d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it claims that Apradh was released in 2015 and
        Belizaire the Cajun was released in 2016, which would actually make Apradh
        earlier, contradicting its own conclusion. However, the model does not cite
        equality as the reason for its NO answer - it presents different years (2015
        vs 2016).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Feroz Khan's Apradh
        was not released earlier than Glen Anthony Pitre's Belizaire the Cajun." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        final answer. Instead, it concluded with "Therefore, Apradh was released earlier
        than Belizaire the Cajun" which is a statement of comparison without using
        the explicit YES/NO format requested in the original question.

        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.

        Seven Seas was released in 1954, while Pippi in the South Seas was released
        in 1957." The NO answer appears to be based on these different values, not
        on equality. The model seems to have made a logical error in its conclusion
        given the dates it provided, but I''m only evaluating what was stated, not
        correcting factual accuracy.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a conclusion that "Raiders of the
        Seven Seas was released earlier than Pippi in the South Seas" but does not
        explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model
        presents information about release dates (1954 vs 1982) and makes a directional
        statement about which was released earlier, but without a clear YES/NO declaration.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, clearly indicating that it believes Raiders
        of the Seven Seas was released earlier than Olle Hellbom's Pippi in the South
        Seas.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Raiders of the Seven
        Seas was released before Pippi in the South Seas," indicating a difference
        in release dates as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Raiders of the Seven
        Seas was released before Pippi in the South Seas." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Raiders of the Seven
        Seas was released earlier than Olle Hellbom's Pippi in the South Seas" as
        its conclusion.

    d034cf36-5ad6-4964-b520-5ffc3a795094:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. However, the model also states "we cannot
        determine the answer from the context" which indicates it cannot make the
        comparison due to lack of information. This makes the final answer UNKNOWN
        rather than a definitive NO to the comparative question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    db9a39a9-93b6-4cee-9724-806235892643:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave dates that are different (1954
        vs 1957). The model's reasoning actually suggests the opposite of its stated
        conclusion, but I'm only evaluating whether equality was given as the reason
        for the NO answer, which it was not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model is saying that Sidney Salkow's Raiders of the Seven Seas was NOT
        released earlier than Olle Hellbom's Pippi in the South Seas. However, this
        contradicts the model's own reasoning, since it states Raiders was released
        in 1954 and Pippi in 1957, which would mean Raiders WAS released earlier.
        Despite this contradiction, I'm evaluating only what was explicitly stated
        as the final answer, which was "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ec2f3645-d0b7-43c4-bb26-49c201eb522a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO.
        According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer
        to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide the release dates
        of these movies, as the context does not provide them." This indicates the
        model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information. The model does
        not give a clear YES or NO answer, nor does it explicitly refuse to answer.
        It simply states it cannot determine the answer due to missing information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f1261c8b-3d00-4a83-9c2f-312663720a00:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it cannot answer the question
        because it lacks information about the release date of one of the films (Olle
        Hellbom's Pippi in the South Seas). The NO appears to be because the model
        cannot make the comparison due to missing information, not because the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, which appears to be its final answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides different years for the two movies
        (2008 for Ashok Roy's Kalabaaz and 2013 for The Devil and Max Devlin), indicating
        a difference in release dates as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "yes, Kalabaaz was released
        earlier than The Devil and Max Devlin" as its final answer. The model gives
        a clear affirmative response both at the beginning of its reasoning and in
        its conclusion.

    4a772b8d-4f31-4743-b5ef-cc2ff9dc7748:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates a difference in release dates
        (Kalabaaz in 2015 and The Devil and Max Devlin in 2016). The NO answer is
        based on this difference in years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        of whether Kalabaaz was released earlier than The Devil and Max Devlin. The
        response begins with a clear "Yes" and then provides dates to support this
        answer (2015 vs 2016).

        Devil and Max Devlin was released in 2016, indicating a difference in release
        years as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        However, the model also states "we don't have enough context to determine
        the exact release dates of either movies, so we cannot answer this question
        from the provided context." This indicates the model is saying NO because
        it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, not as a comparative

        dates) are equal or the same. Instead, it provides specific different years
        (1930 vs 1996) and concludes NO because China Town (1996) was released later
        than Smoke in the Wind (1930), not because they were released in the same
        year. The model is indicating a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Shakti Samanta's China
        Town was released earlier than Joseph Kane's Smoke in the Wind. This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same; rather, it indicated it couldn't determine the answer due to lack of
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. However, in the preceding step, it states that "we cannot
        determine the answer from the context." This suggests the model is saying
        "NO" to indicate it cannot make the determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category according to the criteria (specifically, "The model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison").'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to whether "Doing Time for Patsy Cline" was released
        earlier than "Anatomy 2". However, the model also admits it doesn't have information
        about the release date of "Doing Time for Patsy Cline", which means it cannot
        actually make this determination. This is a case where the model claims to

        for Food and 2016 for Ulla Kadathal) and concludes that "Ulla Kadathal was
        released more recently than Food." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in release dates, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it claims Food was released in 2006 and Ulla Kadathal
        was released in 2015. Since 2006 is actually earlier than 2015, the model's
        "NO" answer is not based on equal values but rather appears to be a logical
        error in its reasoning. The model is claiming the opposite of what its own
        data suggests, but it's not claiming the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO\" as its final answer\

        Seize the Day was released earlier than Maria Giese's When Saturday Comes."
        This is a comparative statement, but it does not explicitly state YES or NO

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation leading up to this answer indicates that the model
        "cannot determine" the comparison because it lacks information about the release

        due to lack of information ("we cannot determine if they were released earlier
        or later"). This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the instructions.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't determine the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer at
        the beginning of the response. However, the explanation that follows indicates
        the model cannot determine the release order of the films, which means it's
        actually expressing an inability to make the comparison rather than a definitive
        comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model
        is essentially saying "NO, I cannot determine" the answer.

        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about which work was released earlier. The response begins with a
        clear "Yes" and then states that Washi Robertson's Well-Founded Fear was released
        earlier than Magdalena Zyzak's Maya Dardel.

        not evaluating factual correctness). The NO answer is based on a claimed difference
        in release dates, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that "Ustadi Ustad Se was released before Suraj's
        Moovendhar" - indicating a difference in release dates (2015 vs 2018). The
        model is noting a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" and then explains that "Ustadi Ustad Se was released before Suraj's
        Moovendhar." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        the answer due to lack of information.

      result: UNKNOWN
    1c08ec9f-1754-4938-ad13-20c89699eb4e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a clear contradiction.
        It first states "The Rookie was released in 2013, while Run, Angel, Run! was
        released in 2017" (which would mean The Rookie came BEFORE Run, Angel, Run!),
        but then concludes "Therefore, The Rookie was released AFTER Run, Angel, Run!"
        This is logically inconsistent. The model provides dates but then draws a
        conclusion that contradicts those dates. There is no explicit YES or NO answer,
        just a comparative statement with internal contradictions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a comparative analysis between
        the release dates of "The Rookie" and "Run, Angel, Run!" and concludes that
        "The Rookie" was released earlier. However, the model does not explicitly
        state a YES or NO answer to the original question. While it makes a clear
        comparative statement, it doesn't frame its conclusion with an explicit YES
        or NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. However, the explanation that follows indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information about release
        dates. This makes it clear that the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine"
        rather than making a comparative judgment, which falls under the UNKNOWN category
        per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    56540ada-4885-49ea-84f2-bbf969ddae1c:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it provides specific different years (2013 for
        The Rookie and 2015 for Run, Angel, Run!) and indicates that The Rookie was
        not released earlier, implying it was released later. The NO answer is based
        on this chronological difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, The Rookie was not
        released earlier than Run, Angel, Run!" This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        dates) are equal. Instead, it provides different years for each film (2007
        for Kanave Kalayadhe and 2015 for Naukar Biwi Ka) and concludes NO because
        Naukar Biwi Ka was released later (2015), not earlier than Kanave Kalayadhe
        (2007). The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Naukar Biwi Ka was not
        released earlier than V. Gowthaman's Kanave Kalayadhe." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question of whether one film was released earlier
        than the other.

        Ka was released in 2007 while Kanave Kalayadhe was released in 2015, and concludes
        that Naukar Biwi Ka was released earlier. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        followed by an explanation that "Naukar Biwi Ka was released earlier than

        is NO" and then explains that "Dino Risi's Poveri ma belli was released earlier

        dates), not equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        years (1995 for Crackers and 2000 for The Mattei Affair) and concludes that
        The Mattei Affair was released later than Crackers. The NO answer appears
        to be rejecting some unstated premise in the original question rather than
        indicating equality.

        affirmative answer to the comparative question, even though the model's reasoning
        contradicts its answer (it says Magasiskola was released in 2010 while Starstruck
        was released in 1986, which would mean Magasiskola came later, not earlier).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that the movies were released in different years
        (1995 vs 2000) and that "Images in a Convent was released earlier than Perfect
        Exchange." The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not
        on equality.

        dates. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Images in a Convent
        was released before Perfect Exchange." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Based on the information
        provided, Munin Barua's Nayak was released before Vishal Pandya's Hate Story."
        This is a comparative statement, but it does not explicitly state "YES" or
        "NO" as a final answer. The model simply makes a factual claim without framing
        it as a direct yes/no response to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that "The Weekend Murders was released in 2018,
        while Up the Creek was released in 2013" - indicating different release years
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is **NO**"
        and then provides a reason for this answer, comparing the release dates of

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it couldn't
        determine the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation indicates that it cannot determine the release dates,
        which means it cannot make the comparison. This is a case where the model
        gives a "NO" but actually means it cannot verify or determine the answer due
        to lack of information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it believes The Weekend
        Murders was released in 2016 while Up the Creek was released in 2013, indicating
        a difference in release dates (with The Weekend Murders being released later,
        not earlier as it incorrectly concludes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear answer stating "The Weekend
        Murders was released earlier than Up the Creek" which directly answers the
        comparative question. However, this is a NO answer to the question of whether
        The Weekend Murders was released later than Up the Creek. The model explicitly
        states that The Weekend Murders (2016) came after Up the Creek (2013), which
        is a clear NO to the implied question about whether The Weekend Murders was
        released later.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (release dates) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives contradictory information
        about which was released first, but ultimately concludes that A Bullet for
        Pretty Boy was not released earlier than Zappatore. The NO is not based on
        equality of values.

        the dates it provided (2016 vs 2015). The model does not explicitly state
        YES or NO in its answer. Without a clear YES/NO statement, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN category.

        Instead, it explicitly states that Deewana Tere Naam Ka was released earlier
        than Bingo (2006 vs 2010), indicating a difference in values as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Deewana Tere Naam

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (release dates) are equal or the same. Instead, it claims Pharaoh's Army was
        released in 2002 and Hero was released in 2018. The NO answer appears to be
        based on the model's belief that Pharaoh's Army (2002) was NOT released earlier
        than Hero (2018), which would actually indicate the opposite chronological
        relationship than what the NO answer suggests. However, I'm not evaluating
        factual correctness, only whether the model claimed the values were equal
        - which it did not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Robby Henson's Pharaoh's
        Army was released earlier than Swapan Saha's Hero. This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives specific different years for each
        film (2002 for "Birds Anonymous" and 2006 for "Pouic-Pouic") and concludes
        that "Birds Anonymous was released after Pouic-Pouic" as the reason for its
        NO answer. The model is claiming there's a temporal difference between the
        releases, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        it states that Birds Anonymous was released in 2002 while Pouic-Pouic was
        released in 2000, and explicitly says "Birds Anonymous was released before
        Pouic-Pouic" as the reason for the NO answer. The model is claiming there's
        a difference in release dates (not equality).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Birds Anonymous was

        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that Birds Anonymous was released
        in 2002 and Pouic-Pouic was released in 2006, concluding that "Birds Anonymous
        was released after Pouic-Pouic" - which indicates a difference in values (release
        dates), not equality. The NO answer is based on this perceived difference
        in release dates.
