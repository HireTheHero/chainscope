        that Kadhal Sadugudu was released in 2003 while Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi was
        released in 2000, meaning the first film was released later (not earlier)
        than the second film. The model explicitly states "2003 (Kadhal Sadugudu)
        is later than 2000 (Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi)" as the reason for its NO answer.
