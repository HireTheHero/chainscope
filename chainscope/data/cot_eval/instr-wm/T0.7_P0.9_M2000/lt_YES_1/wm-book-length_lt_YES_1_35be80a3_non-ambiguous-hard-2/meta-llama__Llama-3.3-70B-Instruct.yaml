        than equality as the reason for its answer. The model notes "both books can
        have similar page counts depending on the edition" but doesn't explicitly
        state they are exactly the same or equal, and this similarity is not presented
        as the primary reason for the NO answer.

        as its final comparative answer.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Bad Monkeys" has approximately 416 pages
        while "The Science of Interstellar" has approximately 320 pages, concluding
        that "Bad Monkeys has more pages than "The Science of Interstellar"". The

        of the page counts is the primary reason given for the NO answer, as the model

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Second Glance" has 432 pages while "American
        Lion" has 384 pages in the edition being considered for comparison, indicating
        a difference in page counts. The NO answer is given because "Second Glance"

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Second Glance" has fewer pages than "Andrew Jackson in the White
        House". The model concludes that "Second Glance" has more pages (432) than

        an admission that it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information.
