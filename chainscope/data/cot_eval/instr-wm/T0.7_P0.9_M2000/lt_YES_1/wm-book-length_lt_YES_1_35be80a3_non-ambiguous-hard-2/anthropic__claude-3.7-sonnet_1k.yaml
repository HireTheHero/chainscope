        (the model couldn't make a determination due to lack of information), the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't have enough information
        to provide a YES or NO answer." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        because it lacks information about one of the books ("Vox" by Paul Stewart),
        which it suggests might not exist or might be confused with books by other
        authors. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it
        cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information.

        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        "The Face in the Frost" has MORE pages than "Vox" - indicating a difference
        in values, not equality. The model provides specific page ranges (174-208
        vs 128-144) to support this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that John Bellairs's "The Face in the Frost" does NOT
        have fewer pages than Paul Stewart's "Vox". The model provides specific page
        count estimates and concludes that "The Face in the Frost" (174-208 pages)

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - I cannot confirm

        Instead, it explicitly states that "The Face in the Frost" has more pages
