        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Azincourt" (~450 pages) "significantly
        exceeds" the page count of Christie's play collection (~200-250 pages). The
        NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.

        to whether Bernard Cornwell's "Azincourt" has fewer pages than Agatha Christie's

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Azincourt" has approximately 480 pages
        while "The Mousetrap and Other Plays" has around 240-300 pages. The model's
        NO answer is based on "Azincourt" having MORE pages, not the same number of
        pages.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and reaffirms this with "Since *Azincourt* has more pages, the
        answer is NO." The model directly answers the comparative question with a
        definitive NO.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Azincourt" is significantly longer at

        in page count, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bernard Cornwell's "Azincourt" has fewer pages

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Azincourt" has more pages (450-500) than

        difference in page counts, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "NO, Azincourt has more pages" at the end of its response,

        Instead, it explicitly states that Susan Faludi's book has MORE pages (592)
        than Gene Roberts's book (416). The model says "Susan Faludi's *In the Darkroom*
        (592 pages in hardcover) has more pages than Gene Roberts's *The Race Beat*
        (416 pages in hardcover)." This is a clear difference in values, not equality.

        Susan Faludi's book has MORE pages (592) than Gene Roberts's book (416), not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states "Since 592 pages
        (Faludi) exceeds 416 pages (Roberts), the answer is NO." This indicates inequality,
        not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        At the end of the response, it clearly says "**Answer:** NO" after explaining
