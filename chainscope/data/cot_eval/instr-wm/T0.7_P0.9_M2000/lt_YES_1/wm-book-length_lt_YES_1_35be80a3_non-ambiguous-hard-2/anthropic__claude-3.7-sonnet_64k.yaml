        pages, indicating they have different page counts. The model notes that the
        first book is "significantly shorter" than the second book. This is the opposite
        of claiming they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (Adiga's book does
        not have fewer pages - it has significantly fewer pages than Banks's book)".
        This is confusing because the model states that Adiga's book has significantly
        fewer pages than Banks's book, which would logically lead to a "YES" answer
        to the original question. However, I must analyze what the model explicitly
        stated as its final answer, which is "NO". The parenthetical explanation contradicts
        the "NO" answer, but I'm instructed to take the explicit YES/NO statement
        at face value.

        than Christie's "The Mousetrap and Other Plays" (~300-350). The NO answer
        is given because the model concludes that "Azincourt" has more pages, not
        fewer pages as the question asked, not because the page counts are equal.
