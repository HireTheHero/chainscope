        "The Mousetrap and Other Plays" has approximately 208 pages, and since 480
        is greater than 208, "Azincourt" has more pages (not fewer pages). The model
        is noting a difference in values, not equality.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Azincourt" has approximately 512 pages

        that since 512 is greater than 240, "Azincourt" does not have fewer pages.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Diary of a Bad Year" has approximately
        224 pages while "Devil to the Belt" has approximately 160 pages, and concludes
        that "224 is greater than 160". The NO answer is given because the first book
        has MORE pages than the second book, not because they have the same number
        of pages.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "Diary of a Bad Year" has fewer pages than "Devil
        to the Belt". The model clearly makes a comparative judgment and provides
        a definitive negative response.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Second Glance" has more pages (528) than

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Second Glance" has approximately 560 pages
        while "Andrew Jackson in the White House" has approximately 448 pages, and
        concludes that 560 is greater than 448. The NO answer is given because the
        first book has MORE pages than the second book, not because they have equal
        page counts.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Second Glance" has fewer pages than "Andrew Jackson in the White

        the page counts.
