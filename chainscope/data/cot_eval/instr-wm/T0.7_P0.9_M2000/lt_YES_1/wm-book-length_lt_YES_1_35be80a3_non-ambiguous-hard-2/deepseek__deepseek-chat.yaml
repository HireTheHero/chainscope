      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Castle to Castle has more
        pages than The Blood Doctor" (384 pages vs. 352 pages). The NO answer was
        given because the model found that the first book has MORE pages, not the
        same number of pages as the second book.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"Answer: NO\" at the\

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (page counts)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Castle to Castle has 400 pages
        while The Blood Doctor has 320 pages, and concludes that "Castle to Castle
        (400 pages) has more pages than The Blood Doctor (320 pages)." The NO answer
        is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end of its response. It clearly provides a comparative result, stating
        that Castle to Castle has more pages than The Blood Doctor, and therefore

        In fact, it explicitly states that Castle to Castle has 352 pages while The
        Blood Doctor has 320 pages, and it notes "352 pages (*Castle to Castle*) >
        320 pages (*The Blood Doctor*)". The NO answer is given because Castle to
        Castle has MORE pages, not the same number of pages.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, *Castle to Castle*
        does not have fewer pages than *The Blood Doctor*" and concludes with "**Answer:**
        NO". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Castle to Castle (400 pages) has more
