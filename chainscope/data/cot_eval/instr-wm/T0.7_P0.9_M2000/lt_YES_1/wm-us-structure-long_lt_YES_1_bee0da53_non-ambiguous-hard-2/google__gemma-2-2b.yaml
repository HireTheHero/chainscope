        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Topaz Solar Farm is in California
        and Lake Cascade is in Idaho, and that these are different states. The NO
        answer is based on the locations being in different states, not on any equality
        between values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that DeGray Lake is in Arkansas and Sutton Lake is in West Virginia, which
        are different states. The model is noting a difference between the locations,
        not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the lakes are in different states (Arkansas and West Virginia). The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in location,
        stating that "DeGray Lake and Sutton Lake are not in the same location" because
        they are in different states (Arkansas and West Virginia). The NO answer is
        based on this difference in location.
