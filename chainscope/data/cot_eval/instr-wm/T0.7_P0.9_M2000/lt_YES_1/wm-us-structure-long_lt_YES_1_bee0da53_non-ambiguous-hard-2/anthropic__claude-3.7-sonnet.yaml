        is west of the Astor Theatre (in New York City) based on the geographical
        positions of Alabama and New York. The model explicitly states "Alabama is
        west of New York" and concludes "the lake must be west of the theatre." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The final determination
        was that Lewis Smith Lake (in Alabama) is west of Astor Theatre (in New York

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially made an error in its reasoning,
        stating "NO, Lewis Smith Lake, AL is NOT located west of Astor Theatre in
        New York City." However, it then corrected itself and explicitly concluded
        with "YES, Lewis Smith Lake, AL is located west of Astor Theatre in New York

      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal. In fact, it explicitly noted a difference in longitude (Atlanta\
        \ at approximately 84\xB0 West and Philadelphia at approximately 75\xB0 West).\
        \ The model concluded that Sparks Shot Tower is east of Atlanta Symphony Hall,\
        \ not that they are at the same location. The \"NO\" answer appears to be\
        \ inconsistent with the reasoning, but it was not based on equality of values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the very end of
        its response. However, this appears to contradict its reasoning, as the model
        concluded "Atlanta Symphony Hall is indeed west of Sparks Shot Tower" but
        then stated "NO". This inconsistency doesn't change the fact that the explicit
        final answer was "NO".

        not give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually corrected its initial
        NO to a YES.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then recognized
        its error and explicitly corrected itself to "YES" as its final answer. The
        final statement clearly indicates "YES" as the answer to whether Saint Anthony
        Cathedral Basilica is west of Theatre Building Chicago.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Texas is generally west of Illinois, and therefore Saint Anthony Cathedral
        Basilica would be west of Theatre Building Chicago. The model is noting a
        difference in positions, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference,
        concluding that "San Andreas Lake is west of Little Goose Dam." The NO answer
        appears to be given because the model determined that the premise of the question
        (which we don't see but can infer was asking if Little Goose Dam is west of
        San Andreas Lake) is incorrect due to their relative positions, not because
        they are at the same longitude.

        based on Ford Park being west of Mahalia Jackson Theater.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then recognized

        about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are the same is
        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is confusing because it first
        says "NO" but then immediately contradicts itself by saying "the answer is
        YES." Looking at the full reasoning, the model concluded that "Ford Park must
        be west of Mahalia Jackson Theater" and then affirmed this with "Ford Park,
        TX is located west of Mahalia Jackson Theater of the Performing Arts, LA."
        Despite the contradictory "NO -" at the beginning of the final statement,
        the model's actual conclusion is clearly "YES."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Hyco Lake, NC is
        not located west of Cranberry Lake, NY. It is actually east of Cranberry Lake,
        NY." The model is indicating a difference in position (east vs. west), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Hyco Lake, NC is
        not located west of Cranberry Lake, NY." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the opposite of what was asked is true - it concluded that Hyco Lake
        is west of Cranberry Lake, not that they have the same longitude. The model
        explicitly states "Hyco Lake in North Carolina would be west of Cranberry
        Lake in New York" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the original question
        (which appears to have asked if Cranberry Lake is west of Hyco Lake). The
        model determined that Hyco Lake in North Carolina would be west of Cranberry
        Lake in New York, not the other way around.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its answer, and then
        explains that "The Dal-Tex Building in Texas is located west of the Civic

        answer, stating "It is north and east of Sandals Church." This indicates a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes "Lost Creek Lake,
        OR is not west of Sandals Church, CA."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lost Creek Lake would be
        east of Sandals Church (not west), indicating a directional difference. The
        model states "in terms of strictly east-west positioning, Lost Creek Lake
        would be east of Sandals Church," which shows the locations have different
        east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Lost Creek Lake, OR is located west of Sandals Church, CA. The model
        provides a clear negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        that "St. Mark's Cathedral is not west of Sarang Community Church" because
        Seattle "is not significantly west of Southern California (if anything, it
        might be slightly east)". The model is suggesting a possible slight difference
        in the opposite direction, not equality.
