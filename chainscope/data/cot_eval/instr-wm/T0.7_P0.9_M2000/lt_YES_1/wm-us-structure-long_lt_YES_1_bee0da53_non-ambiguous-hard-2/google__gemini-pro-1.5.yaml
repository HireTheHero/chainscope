      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim in its reasoning
        (stating "Alabama is east of New York" which is factually incorrect, but that's
        not relevant to our analysis). The model concludes that "Lewis Smith Lake
        is east of the Astor Place Theatre" and then says "NO" - indicating the comparison
        is incorrect, but not because the locations are at the same longitude.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Boulder City, NV is actually *east* of Apache Lake, AZ." This indicates
        a specific directional relationship (east vs. west) rather than equality,
        and this directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, after comparing the longitudes of Lake Ellsworth,
        OK and Lake Wappapello, MO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes of Lake Ellsworth and Lake Wappapello. The
        model concluded that Lake Ellsworth is west of Lake Wappapello based on its
        longitude comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes that the longitudes are different (-98.7 vs -90.4).
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on a comparison where it
        states "-98.7 is greater than -90.4" and concludes that Lake Ellsworth is
        not west of Lake Wappapello. This is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes with "NO" after comparing the longitudes of the
        two lakes.

        East Coast, but Miami Beach is "significantly further south" than West Point.
        The reason for the NO answer is directional - that Miami Beach "cannot be
        west of West Point" because it's on the East Coast and not inland. The model
        is not claiming the locations have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

        question, not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question about whether Skokie Lagoons, IL
        is west of Playwrights Horizons, NY.

        with a "NO" answer. The model does not claim equality as the reason for its
        NO answer. There's a contradiction between the reasoning and the answer, but

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states "Dallas is west of New
        Orleans" which indicates a difference in position, not equality. The "NO"
        answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but I'm evaluating
        only what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it acknowledges that Oregon is "slightly west
        of some parts of California" but argues that the dominant relationship is
        north/south and that the plant is "not meaningfully west" of the theater.
        This indicates a judgment about significance rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional reasoning that something
        north of a reference point cannot be west of it (implying the locations have
        different directional relationships). The NO answer is based on geographical
        impossibility rather than equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Oregon is north of California" and "North implies west in this context."
        The model is indicating a directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer, not equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Trojan Nuclear Power
        Plant is north of the California Theatre (not west), indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the comparison
        being asked.

        (north vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is north of California Theatre, not west.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("north" rather than
        "west"), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. This is a direct comparative result answering the original question
        (which appears to have asked if Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is west of California
        Theatre).

        Plant might be "slightly west" of California Theatre, it is "not primarily
        west" and is "generally north and slightly west." The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.

        values being compared are the same. Instead, it states that "Trojan Nuclear
        Power Plant is north, not west, of California Theatre." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (north vs. west), not equality. It's rejecting the
        premise that one location is west of the other.

        "Atlanta is significantly to the right/east of Pennsylvania." The model's
        reasoning actually suggests the locations are different, not equal, making

        east of Pennsylvania" and therefore the Cathedral (in Atlanta, GA) is east
        of the lake (in Pennsylvania). The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        and therefore "anything located in Georgia cannot be west of anything located
        in Pennsylvania." The model is asserting a directional difference (east vs.
        west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer at the end of its response. This is a definitive comparative
        result where the model is rejecting the premise that the Cathedral of Saint
        Philip is west of East Branch Clarion River Lake.

        difference in their positions, not equality. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference.
