      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating that "the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant
        is not directly west of the California Theatre but rather northwest." This
        indicates a directional difference (northwest vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gave a directional reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that "Oregon is north of California" and therefore the Trojan
        Nuclear Power Plant is "not west" of the California Theatre. The model is
        making a geographical comparison based on north/south positioning rather than
        claiming the locations are at the same longitude.
