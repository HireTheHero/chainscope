        east than Michigan" and concludes that "Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul
        would be east of Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects." The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference (one being east of the other), not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Maine is located
        east of Michigan" and therefore "the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul would
        be east of the former location of Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects." The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Alabama (where Lewis Smith Lake is located) is in the southeastern
        part of the United States, and New York (where Astor Theatre is located) is
        in the northeastern part, it is reasonable to conclude that Lewis Smith Lake

        (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lewis Smith Lake, AL is located west of Astor Theatre,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lewis Smith Lake is not west
        of Astor Theatre because Alabama is located south of New York, not west of
        it. The model is noting a directional difference (south vs. northeast), not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        relationship that Atlanta Symphony Hall is in Georgia which is south of Pennsylvania
        where Sparks Shot Tower is located. The model is comparing east-west positions
        (longitude) but concludes NO based on north-south positioning, not because
        the locations have the same longitude.

        and "Therefore, Atlanta Symphony Hall, GA, is not located west of Sparks Shot
        Tower, PA." The model is indicating a difference in direction (south vs. west),
        not equality.

        claim (Vermont being east of Georgia), not on equality of locations.

        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, there appears to be a logical error in
        the model's reasoning. The model states "Vermont is generally east of Georgia"
        and then concludes "NO" to the question of whether Lake Nottely, GA is west
        of Cathedral Church of St. Paul, VT. This is contradictory (if Vermont is
        east of Georgia, then Georgia would be west of Vermont), but I'm instructed
        to take the explicit answer at face value regardless of logical consistency.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that "Georgia is generally south of Vermont" which is a directional
        difference (south vs. north) rather than claiming the locations have equal
        east-west positions. The model is confusing north-south positioning with east-west
        positioning in its reasoning, but it does not claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the geographical relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it
        states that "Washington, D.C. is north of South Carolina" and therefore the
        courthouse would be north of the dam, not equal to it. The model identified
        a directional difference, not equality.

        west of Vernon Court (not equal in location), which contradicts what the question
        was asking. The model is not saying NO because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        (Rhode Island being further east than Kentucky), not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that San Carlos Lake is in eastern
        Arizona while FirstBank Southwest Tower is in the Texas Panhandle, and implies
        that the Texas Panhandle extends further west than eastern Arizona. The model
        is indicating a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether San Carlos Lake, AZ, is located west of FirstBank Southwest Tower,
        TX. This is a clear negative comparative result.

        - it claims that Florida is east of New York, and therefore the Raleigh Hotel
        (in Florida) cannot be west of the West Point Jewish Chapel (in New York).
        The model is making a geographical comparison where it sees the locations

        coast of the United States." This implies they are in the same general east-west
        position (both being on the east coast), making them equal in terms of the
        comparison being asked. The model is saying NO because they are in the same
        geographical region (east coast) rather than one being west of the other.

        with Connecticut being "further north than Washington, D.C." This indicates
        a difference in their relative positions (north-south difference), not equality.

        Temple cannot be west of Sterling Memorial Library. This is not based on equality
        of positions but on their relative geographical relationship. The model is
        making a directional claim about one location not being west of the other,
        not claiming they are at the same location.

        north of House of the Temple" and therefore "it's not located west of it."
        The model is comparing different geographical positions and concluding they
        have a north-south relationship rather than an east-west one.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Lewis and Clark Lake might
        be east of Herb Parsons Lake, which indicates a difference in position rather
        than equality. The model's reasoning is that despite Nebraska generally being
        west of Tennessee, the specific locations of these lakes (Lewis and Clark
        Lake being in northeastern Nebraska and Herb Parsons Lake being in western
        Tennessee) suggest a different relative positioning.

        Center would be east of Coronado Theatre." The NO answer is based on this

        than the western edge of Pennsylvania" and that "the specific locations of
        these landmarks put them closer in longitude." The model concludes NO based
        on this reasoning, not because the locations have equal values.

        "Badin Lake is in North Carolina, which is east of New York where 2 Columbus
        Circle is located." The model is indicating a difference in location (east
        vs. west), not equality.

        for its NO answer, stating "Badin Lake, being located in North Carolina, is
        east of 2 Columbus Circle, which is in New York City." The model is claiming
        that Badin Lake is east (not west) of 2 Columbus Circle, which is a directional

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a difference in location,
        saying "Georgia is located southwest of Pennsylvania" and therefore the Cathedral
        would be southwest of the lake. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

        Pennsylvania." The model is indicating that Georgia is east (not west) of
        Pennsylvania, which is why the answer is NO.

        than being west of the lake. The model is making a directional comparison
        (south vs. west) rather than claiming the locations have equal longitude.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "New York (where Barrow Street
        Theatre is located) is east of Ohio (where LaDue Reservoir is located)" which
        implies they are at different locations. The model's reasoning for the NO
        answer is that Ohio is not west of New York, but rather Ohio is west of New
        York (making New York east of Ohio). This is not an equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether LaDue Reservoir, OH, is located west of Barrow Street Theatre,
        NY. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response: "Based on the
