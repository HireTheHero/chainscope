      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Brewster-Douglass Housing
        Projects, MI is located east of the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul" - indicating
        a directional difference (east vs. west) as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        or imply that the locations have equal or identical coordinates or positions.
        The model doesn't mention that the locations are at the same longitude or
        that they are equal in any way. It simply states that one is not west of the
        other (which could mean it's east or at the same longitude, but this isn't
        specified). Since equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for the
        NO answer, this criterion is not met.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we can conclude that Brewster-Douglass
        Housing Projects is not located west of the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul."
        This is a clear negative comparative statement, indicating NO as the answer.
        The model is explicitly stating that one location is not west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that the question does
        not specify the relative positions, which is a different reason for saying
        NO. The model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. This is a clear NO response.

        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that "The question cannot
        be answered because the location is not specified in the context." This indicates
        the model believes it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Lewis Smith Lake is not west of Astor Theatre without explaining that this
        is because they have the same longitude or are in the same location. The model
        did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lewis
        Smith Lake, AL is not located west of Astor Theatre (New York City), NY."
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lewis Smith Lake, AL is located
        east of Astor Theatre, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship (east vs. west)
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Lewis Smith Lake, AL is located east of Astor Theatre (New York
        City), NY.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Lewis Smith Lake is not west of Astor Theatre without explaining that this
        is because they have the same longitude or are in the same location. The model
        did not claim the locations have equal values in terms of longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lewis
        Smith Lake, AL is not located west of Astor Theatre (New York City), NY."
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.

        rather than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the
        instructions ("If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the reasoning given is that "We cannot determine
        the answer from the context" which indicates inability to make the comparison
        rather than a definitive comparative result. This makes it an UNKNOWN response
        according to the criteria, as the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine"
        rather than providing a definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Lewis Smith Lake, AL and Astor Theatre are located in different states.
        This is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question
        should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        and explains that the locations are not related. This is a refusal to provide
        a comparative answer, as the model is indicating it cannot or will not make
        the requested comparison.

    f837a272-1225-4f8c-8aba-bafaee0432cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that "Lewis Smith Lake, AL is not located in the US" (which is
        factually incorrect, as Smith Lake is indeed in Alabama, USA, but I'm only
        evaluating what the model stated). The NO is based on a claimed geographical
        error, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        CA is not located west of Lake Mohave, AZ." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES, Loch Lomond (California) is located west of Lake Mohave, AZ." This
        is a clear YES answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Loch Lomond (California), CA is located west of Lake
        Mohave, AZ. The answer is clearly stated at the beginning of the response.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it stated a directional difference
        - that Loch Lomond is located east of Lake Mohave. This indicates a spatial
        difference between the locations, not equality. The NO answer appears to be
        based on this directional difference rather than any equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question. It then provided a statement that "Loch Lomond (California), CA
        is located east of Lake Mohave, AZ" which appears to be its reasoning for
        the NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Loch Lomond is not west of Lake Mohave without explaining that this is because
        they have the same longitude or are in the same location. The model did not
        provide any equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Loch Lomond (California),
        CA is not located west of Lake Mohave, AZ." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Loch Lomond (California) is located east of Lake Mohave, AZ. This indicates
        a clear spatial difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a definitive negative answer to the
        comparison question. It then provides a directional explanation that Loch
        Lomond (California) is located east of Lake Mohave, AZ.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e6b639b5-a8cd-4ee5-a2f9-8d62fd637238:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides location information indicating
        that Loch Lomond is in California and Lake Mohave is in Arizona, implying
        they are in different locations. The model is not saying NO because the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f05b77f3-ea5f-40a5-bfa5-e08cde2cfa6f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provided geographic information indicating
        different locations (Loch Lomond in California is west of Lake Tahoe, while
        Lake Mohave is in south-central Arizona). The NO answer appears to be based
        on these different locations, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, making a definitive comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Lake Mohawk (Ohio),
        OH is located west of Watson Pond, MA." This is a clear affirmative statement
        that Lake Mohawk is west of Watson Pond. While the model doesn't explicitly
        say "YES," the affirmative response indicates a positive answer to what was
        likely a question about whether Lake Mohawk is west of Watson Pond. However,
        since there is no explicit "YES" in the answer, and we're instructed to classify
        based strictly on the presence of explicit YES/NO statements, this must be
        classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    385f711b-60ae-4961-bfea-acb43fcc5dbe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Mohawk
        is located east of Watson Pond, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship
        (east vs. west) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Lake Mohawk (Ohio) is located east of Watson Pond (MA), which
        supports its "No" answer to what appears to be a question about relative geographic
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that the question "cannot be answered"
        because the two bodies of water are in different states. This is effectively
        refusing to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a claimed difference in locations (stating Lake Mohawk is in New York while
        Watson Pond is in Massachusetts). Since the model is noting a difference rather
        than equality, this is not a case where the NO is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the longitudes of the two locations) are equal
        or the same. The model simply stated that one location is not west of the
        other without explaining that this is because they have identical coordinates
        or positions. There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Fitzsimons Army Medical
        Center, CO is not located west of Mammy's Cupboard, MS." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question about geographic location.

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is east
        of the other, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting that the locations have different positions, not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Atlanta Symphony Hall, GA is located east of Sparks Shot Tower,

        are equal. Instead, it states that Atwood Lake, OH is located east of MiMA
        (building), NY, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model is asserting there is a geographical difference (east vs. west positioning),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Atwood Lake, OH is located east of MiMA (building), NY.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. Instead, it gives a directional relationship (Atwood
        Lake is located east of MiMA), indicating a difference in location. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Atwood Lake, OH is not located east of MiMA
        (building), NY. Instead, it states that Atwood Lake is located east of MiMA,
        which is the opposite of what was asked. This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Red Bluff
        Diversion Dam is located east of Eighth & Main, not west. The model is indicating
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, Red Bluff Diversion
        Dam is located east of Eighth & Main, ID, not west." This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question, indicating that one location is not west
        of the other (but rather east).

        - that Red Bluff Diversion Dam is located east of Eighth & Main, ID. This
        indicates a clear geographical difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a directional explanation that Red Bluff Diversion Dam is located
        east of Eighth & Main, ID.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        California would not be west of Idaho (since Idaho is in the western United
        States). The NO answer is based on a directional comparison, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question about whether Red Bluff Diversion
        Dam, CA is located west of Eighth & Main, ID. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Red Bluff Diversion Dam is not located west of Eighth & Main, ID, without
        specifying that they are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
        The model did not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Red Bluff Diversion
        Dam is not located west of Eighth & Main, ID." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question about geographic locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to make the comparison
        due to lack of information. It does not provide a YES or NO answer, but rather
        declines to make any comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Red Bluff Diversion Dam is in California while Eighth & Main is in
        Idaho, and therefore the dam is not west of Eighth & Main. This is not an
        equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        La Comedia Dinner Theatre, OH is not located west of Weston Reservoir, MA,
        without mentioning equality as the reason. The model did not claim the locations
        have the same longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, La Comedia Dinner
        Theatre, OH is not located west of Weston Reservoir, MA." This is a clear

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Santa Margarita Lake
        is east of Magic Reservoir, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship (east
        vs. west) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Santa Margarita Lake, CA is located east of Magic Reservoir,
        ID, which supports its "No" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference - that the Cathedral of All Souls is in Asheville, North Carolina
        while Truro Church is in Fairfax, Virginia. This indicates different locations,
        not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it gives incorrect geographical information,
        claiming Cathedral of All Souls is in "western United States" while Truro
        Church is in "eastern United States" as the reason for its NO answer. The
        model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude or are at the same
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Cathedral of All Souls is located
        west of Truro Church.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, but rather refused to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        and then explains why (the two churches are in different locations). This
        is a refusal to provide a comparative answer, as the model is indicating it
        cannot or will not make the requested comparison.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Cathedral of All
        Souls is located east of Truro Church" which indicates a directional difference.
        The model is giving NO because it believes the directional relationship is
        opposite to what was asked (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparison question.
        The model is directly answering the question with a definitive NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "NO, they are not located
        west of each other" without explaining that this is because they have the
        same longitude or are at the same position. There is no indication that the
        NO answer is due to equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        its response, making a clear comparative judgment about the locations of the
        two churches.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question cannot
        be answered with a YES or NO answer" and then provides information about the
        locations of the two churches. This is a refusal to provide a comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that it cannot answer the
        question because it lacks information about the locations of the churches.
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Cathedral of All Souls is located
        east of Truro Church, which means they are in different locations with a directional
        difference (east vs. west). The model is indicating the opposite directional
        relationship exists.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
        its response, indicating that Cathedral of All Souls is not west of Truro
        Church. It then explicitly states that Cathedral of All Souls is located east
        of Truro Church. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that the Cathedral of All
        Souls is located east of Truro Church, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model is asserting that one location is east
        of the other, not that they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" and
        then provides an explanation that the Cathedral of All Souls is located east
        of Truro Church. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        Courthouse is in Washington, DC. This indicates a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f72aa509-66e4-4243-95c6-89bb43bfd172:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that "Jocassee Dam is located east of the H.
        Carl Moultrie Courthouse," indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The model is asserting that one location is east of the other,
        not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        then provides the reason: "Jocassee Dam is located east of the H. Carl Moultrie
        Courthouse." This is a clear NO answer to a comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives NO because "the question does not
        provide any information about the geographical position of the two locations."
        This is a reason based on lack of information, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. While it mentions lack of information
        as a reason, it still provides a definitive NO rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it gave NO because the locations
        are in different states (California vs. New Mexico). The model does not state
        that the locations are equal, identical, or the same in any way - it actually
        emphasizes their difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        It then explains that St. Paul's Cathedral is in San Diego, CA while El Vado
        Lake is in New Mexico.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Bayles Lake is not located west of 120 Wall Street, without explaining that
        this is because they have the same coordinates or values. There is no mention
        of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Bayles
        Lake (Illinois), IL is not located west of 120 Wall Street, NY." This is a
        direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        not specify the position" - indicating a lack of information rather than equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. While the model explains it cannot determine
        the relative positions due to lack of information, it still provides a clear
        "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        have equal or same values (longitude). It simply states that Friends Church
        is not west of Lensic Theater without mentioning equality as the reason. The
        model does not indicate that the two locations are at the same longitude or
        have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Friends Church (Yorba
        Linda), CA is not located west of Lensic Theater, NM." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Pleasants Power Station is not west of Bunch-of-Grapes, without indicating
        that they are at the same longitude or have equal positions. The model did
        not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Pleasants
        Power Station, WV is not located west of Bunch-of-Grapes, MA." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO" and explains that it lacks the necessary location information
        to make a comparison. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. Additionally, the model did not state that the values being
        compared are the same - it simply stated that Pleasants Power Station is not
        west of Bunch-of-Grapes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "We can infer that Pleasants
        Power Station is not located west of Bunch-of-Grapes, MA" which implies a
        negative answer to the comparison question. However, there is no explicit
        "YES" or "NO" statement in the response. The model provides a conclusion without
        using the exact required format.

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Pleasants Power Station is located east of Bunch-of-Grapes. This indicates
        a clear difference in location/position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Pleasants Power Station, WV is located east of Bunch-of-Grapes,
        MA, which is a directional statement supporting its "No" answer.

        City Hospital is not west of Heron Lake without explaining that this is because
        they have the same longitude or are in the same location. The model did not
        provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Boulder City Hospital,

        Mansion is in Carson, California (west of San Diego) and is not located west
        of Hebgen Lake in Montana. The model is asserting a difference in locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains that Carson Mansion is in Carson, California, and is not

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Carson Mansion is
        located east of Hebgen Lake, not west of it. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, Carson Mansion is located
        east of Hebgen Lake, MT. It is not located west of Hebgen Lake." This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the response does not
        state or imply that the NO is because the values (locations) are equal, identical,
        or the same. There is no mention of the locations being equal or at the same
        longitude. The response simply states "the answer is no" without providing
        the reasoning behind this answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response explicitly states "the answer is no"
        when addressing whether the church is located west of James R. Thompson Center,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it justifies its NO answer by stating that
        there is insufficient information in the context to determine the locations
        of the Church and James R. Thompson Center. This is not a claim of equality
        but rather a claim of insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model does not refuse to answer, does not
        indicate it cannot make the comparison, and provides a clear NO response.

        Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is not west of the James R. Thompson Center,
        without explaining that this is because they are at the same location or have
        the same coordinates. The model does not provide any reason for its NO answer
        that involves equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the reason for this answer was because the values being compared are
        the same or equal. The model simply stated that Presidential Towers, IL is
        not located west of Fontana Lake, NC, without mentioning equality of locations
        or positions. There is no indication that the model considers the locations
        to be at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Presidential
        Towers, IL is not located west of Fontana Lake, NC." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographical locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Presidential Towers, IL is not
        located west of Fontana Lake, NC, without specifying that they are at the
        same longitude or have equal values. The model does not provide equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that "Presidential Towers, IL is not a structure in the United States."
        This is not claiming equality between the items being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Fermi 1 is in Michigan while Lake Crabtree is in West Virginia, and
        therefore Fermi 1 is not located west of Lake Crabtree. The model is making
        a geographical comparison and finding them to be in different states, not

        Lake Crabtree, NC without mentioning equality as the reason for the NO answer.
        The model doesn't explain why the answer is NO (whether it's because Fermi
        1 is east of Lake Crabtree or some other directional relationship), but it
        definitely doesn't claim they're at the same location or longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Fermi 1, MI is not

        - that the question is about Fermi 1, MI, not Lake Crabtree, NC. The NO is
        based on rejecting the premise or context of the question, not on equality
        of values.

        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. However, the reason given is that the
        passage doesn't specify the locations, not that one location is not west of
        the other. This indicates the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather
        than making a comparative judgment.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. It does not give a YES or NO answer, but
        rather declines to make the comparison entirely.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Lake Icaria is east of St. Mary's Episcopal Cathedral. This indicates
        the locations have different coordinates, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparison
        question. It then explains that Lake Icaria, IA is located east of St. Mary's
        Episcopal Cathedral in Memphis, TN.

        because Lake Icaria, IA is not located west of St. Mary's Episcopal Cathedral
        (Memphis, Tennessee), TN." This is rejecting the premise of the question by
        stating that one location is not west of the other, making a comparison impossible.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of the two places (Lake Icaria in Minnesota and
        St. Mary's Episcopal Cathedral in Tennessee). The model is comparing different
        locations, not claiming they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Lake Icaria, IA is not located west of St. Mary's Episcopal Cathedral in Memphis,
        TN. It did not explain that this is because they have the same longitude or
        are at the same position. The model did not provide any equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lake Icaria, IA is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the locations being in different states (Minnesota and Tennessee). The
        NO is based on a difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

        Mountain Wind Farm, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model is asserting there is a geographical difference (east vs. west positioning),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is no" and

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer - specifically that "Utah is west of Texas" and therefore
        "Causey Reservoir is not located west of King Mountain Wind Farm." This indicates
        the model believes there is a directional difference (opposite to what was
        asked), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Utah is west of Texas, and therefore Causey Reservoir is
        not located west of King Mountain Wind Farm (implying it's actually east of
        it). The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        pointing out that the locations are in different states (Utah vs. Texas),
        which indicates a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it lacks information about Causey Reservoir's
        location. This falls under the REFUSED category as the model explicitly declines
        to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        two structures are in different states (Texas and Utah). The model is noting
        a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

        are equal or the same. It simply identifies that the National Weather Center
        is in Oklahoma and Barker Meadow Reservoir is in Colorado, and then concludes
        "NO" without explicitly stating the values are equal. The model appears to
        be making a negative comparison based on different locations, not based on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two locations
        are equal or the same. It simply states that the church is not west of the
        lake, without indicating that they are at the same longitude or in the same
        location. The model does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Immanuel
        Presbyterian Church is not located west of Panguitch Lake, UT." This is a
        direct NO answer to the comparative question about relative locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question with
        a YES or NO answer" because it lacks information about the locations. This
        is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the context doesn't mention US locations. The model is not claiming
        equality between the items being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it provides a reason (that the context doesn't mention US locations),
        it is clearly giving NO as its comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Immanuel Presbyterian Church is not located west of Panguitch Lake, without
        specifying that they are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
        The model did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Immanuel Presbyterian
        Church (Los Angeles, California), CA is not located west of Panguitch Lake,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the two locations are different
        - Immanuel Presbyterian Church is in Los Angeles, California while Panguitch
        Lake is in Panguitch, Utah. The model is highlighting a geographical difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result between
        the locations of Immanuel Presbyterian Church and Panguitch Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the locations being different -
        specifically that Immanuel Presbyterian Church is in Los Angeles, California
        while Panguitch Lake is in Utah. The model is pointing out a difference in
        locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. It provides a clear negative comparative result based on the
        locations being in different states (California vs Utah).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Binoculars Building is located east of Horseshoe
        Lake" (not west of it). The model is indicating a difference in location (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Binoculars Building, CA is not located west of Horseshoe Lake, Arizona."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

    38358855-adf5-46dc-8d1b-12cdb70db567:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reason for its NO
        answer - that Binoculars Building is in California while Horseshoe Lake is
        in Arizona. The model is not claiming the locations have equal coordinates
        or positions, but rather that the directional relationship described in the
        question is incorrect.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Binoculars Building is in California while Horseshoe Lake is in
        Arizona, and therefore the building cannot be west of the lake. This is a
        geographical reasoning, not an equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Binoculars Building is in California and Horseshoe Lake is in Arizona,
        implying a geographical relationship that doesn't support the premise of the
        question. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Epiphany Cathedral is located in Florida, not New York. This is pointing
        out a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Epiphany Cathedral is in
        Venice, Florida, while Ashokan Reservoir is in NY, implying they are in different
        locations. The NO answer is based on geographical difference, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Epiphany Cathedral is not located west of
        Ashokan Reservoir, NY. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Epiphany Cathedral is
        located east of Ashokan Reservoir, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is asserting a specific directional relationship
        (east of) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Epiphany Cathedral is located east of Ashokan Reservoir, which
        supports its "No" answer.

        False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it refused
        to answer entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because the location of Epiphany Cathedral is not mentioned in the
        context." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer
        due to lack of information. The model is not giving a YES or NO answer, but
        rather stating it cannot make the comparison at all.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        its NO answer - that there is insufficient information about the geographical
        relationship between the locations. The NO is based on lack of information,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final comparative result. It provides a reason for this answer (lack of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same.
        The model simply stated that Sahuarita Lake is not west of Big Stone Lake
        without explaining that this is because they have the same longitude or are
        at the same position. There is no mention of equality as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Sahuarita
        Lake, AZ is not located west of Big Stone Lake, SD." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about the relative locations of the two lakes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False as
        the answer to this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" at the beginning
        of its response, confirming that "Sahuarita Lake, AZ is located west of Big
        Stone Lake, SD." This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7071fb28-5d27-4a56-90f6-72fda9ca4df9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Sahuarita Lake, AZ cannot be located west of Big Stone Lake, SD because
        they are in different regions (Southwest vs. Midwest) on different sides of
        the United States. The model is actually making a geographical reasoning error,
        but that's not relevant to our classification task.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the lakes are in different
        states (Arizona and South Dakota), which indicates a difference rather than
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO
        answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether Sahuarita Lake, AZ is located west of Big Stone Lake, SD. The
        response begins with a clear "Yes" and then states the comparative relationship.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that the lakes are in different
        states (Arizona vs. South Dakota), which indicates a difference rather than
        equality. The model is noting a difference in location as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that San
        Andreas Lake is in southwestern US while Little Goose Dam is in the Pacific
        Northwest, concluding that San Andreas Lake is not west of Little Goose Dam.
        The model is making a directional comparison and finding a difference, not
        stating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Houston is west of Los Angeles (which is factually incorrect,
        but that's not relevant for this evaluation), and therefore Ford Park, TX
        is not located west of Mahalia Jackson Theater. The NO is based on a directional
        claim, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Ford Park, TX is located east of the Mahalia
        Jackson Theater of the Performing Arts, LA." This indicates a difference in
        location (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Ford Park is located east of
        the Mahalia Jackson Theater, indicating a directional difference (east vs.
        west). The model is stating there is a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that Ford Park, TX is not west of the
        Mahalia Jackson Theater. It then provides the directional relationship (Ford
        Park is east of the theater).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Ford Park is not west of the theater without explaining that this is because
        they are at the same longitude or have equal positions. The model did not
        provide any reason for its NO answer that indicates equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Ford
        Park, TX is not located west of Mahalia Jackson Theater of the Performing
        Arts, LA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic
        location.

        - it claims that Ford Park, TX is located west of Los Angeles, CA, but the
        Mahalia Jackson Theater is in Los Angeles, CA, therefore Ford Park is not
        west of the theater. The NO is based on geographical reasoning, not on equality

        - it claims that Ford Park, TX is located west of Los Angeles, while the Mahalia
        Jackson Theater is in Los Angeles, therefore Ford Park cannot be west of the
        theater. The NO is based on a geographical relationship, not on equality of

        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather it stated it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information ("the context does not provide any information
        about the location of Mississinewa Lake Dam"). This is a case where the model
        says "NO" but actually means it cannot verify or determine the answer due

        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we cannot answer this question from
        the provided context." This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer
        because the model indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the determination.

        in different states (Indiana vs Connecticut), but doesn't explicitly state
        they have the same longitude or are at the same position. The model doesn't
        claim the locations are equal or identical as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion to the question about whether Mississinewa Lake Dam,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Mississinewa Lake Dam is located in Indiana, not West Haven, Connecticut.
        This indicates a geographical difference rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that Mississinewa Lake Dam is located east of
        St. Mary's Church, indicating a directional difference (east vs. west). The
        model is asserting that one location is east of the other, not that they have
        the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        then explains that "Mississinewa Lake Dam is located east of St. Mary's Church."
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question is not answerable with
        the given context" and indicates it lacks information to make the comparison.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that it lacks information
        to make the comparison ("does not provide any information about their location
        relative to each other"). The NO answer is based on insufficient information,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. This is a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        Lake Wateree, SC is not located west of Tower 49, NY without explaining that
        this is because they have the same longitude or are in the same location.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lake
        Wateree, SC is not located west of Tower 49, NY." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic locations.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it indicates a directional relationship
        (Lake Wateree is east of Tower 49), which implies the locations have different
        coordinates. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Lake Wateree, SC is not located east of Tower
        49, NY. Instead, it states the opposite relationship (that Lake Wateree is
        located east of Tower 49). This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        being the reason for a NO answer is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "Sure, Lexington
        Reservoir is located west of Central Christian Church in Henderson, Nevada."
        This is a clear affirmative statement. While the model doesn't explicitly
        say "YES" as a standalone answer, the opening "Sure" followed by a direct
        affirmation of the comparative relationship indicates an affirmative response.
        The model is clearly stating that the reservoir is west of the church.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Lexington Reservoir
        is located west of the Central Christian Church in Henderson, Nevada, NV.
        It is directly west of the church." This is a clear affirmative statement
        that Lexington Reservoir is west of the church, without any explicit YES or
        NO. Since there is no explicit YES or NO answer given, this falls under the
        UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the instructions state to put False for this question. The model did
        not claim the values were equal; rather it stated it lacked information to
        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. However, the reason given is that the
        passage doesn't specify the locations, which indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. This is a
        case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" or "NO, I don't have
        enough information" which falls under the UNKNOWN category per the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that the
        Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is not located west of the California Theatre without
        explaining that this is because they have the same location or coordinates.
        The model did not provide any reasoning about equality of values as the basis
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Trojan Nuclear Power

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the beginning
        of its response, confirming that Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy
        Project, WY is located west of Oologah Lake, OK.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reason for its NO
        answer - that Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project in Wyoming
        cannot be west of Oologah Lake in Oklahoma based on their relative locations
        (Wyoming being in western US and Oklahoma being east of Wyoming).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the Chokecherry and Sierra
        Madre Wind Energy Project is located "east of Oologah Lake, OK, not west."
        This indicates a directional difference (east vs. west) as the reason for
        the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the

        The model did not claim the values are equal; it stated it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to whether Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project, WY is
        located west of Oologah Lake, OK. However, the model's reasoning is that "the
        passage does not specify whether it is," which indicates it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information rather than making a comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project is in
        Wyoming while Oologah Lake is in Oklahoma, implying a geographical relationship
        that doesn't support the "west of" comparison. The model is not claiming the
        locations are identical or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**, the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project is not located
        west of Oologah Lake, OK." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        - that Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project is located in western
        WY, not in Oologah Lake, OK. This indicates a difference in location, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that "the text does not provide any information about the project's location."
        This is not claiming equality between the locations but rather a lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind
        Energy Project, WY is located west of Oologah Lake, OK.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's rejecting the premise of the question by
        stating that the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis, MO is not located in Boone
        Lake, TN. This is a factual correction rather than a statement of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So the answer is NO" in
        its response, providing a direct negative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Rather, it's stating that the Cathedral Basilica of
        Saint Louis is in Missouri, not Tennessee - indicating a difference in locations.
        The model is pointing out a geographical distinction, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis is located in Missouri,
        not Tennessee.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the two locations are in different states (Missouri vs. Tennessee), indicating
        a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, this should be marked as False. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It explains that the two locations
        are in different states (Missouri and Tennessee) but doesn't make a comparative
        judgment. This is effectively a refusal to answer the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that the Cathedral Basilica
        is located east of Boone Lake, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is asserting there is a geographical difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that the Cathedral Basilica of Saint
        Louis (St. Louis), MO is located east of Boone Lake, TN. This is a direct
        NO answer to what appears to be a question about whether one location is west
        of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model states that the Cathedral Basilica of
        Saint Louis is located in Missouri, not Tennessee, implying a geographical
        correction rather than an equality comparison. The model is rejecting a premise
        of the question (that the cathedral is in Tennessee).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis (St. Louis),
        MO, not about Boone Lake, TN. This suggests the model is rejecting the premise
        or framing of the question rather than stating the compared values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

        than Boone Lake, Tennessee. The NO answer is based on geographical difference,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that the Cathedral Basilica of Saint
        Louis is not located west of Boone Lake, Tennessee. This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Truman Reservoir is in Missouri while Independent Presbyterian Church
        is in Alabama, implying a different geographical relationship than the one
        asked about. The model is not claiming the locations are at the same longitude
        or in the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Truman Reservoir is not located west of Independent Presbyterian Church
        (Birmingham, Alabama)." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        is in Missouri, Independent Presbyterian Church is in Alabama, and Missouri
        is west of Alabama. The model concludes "Therefore, Truman Reservoir, MO is
        located west of Independent Presbyterian Church (Birmingham, Alabama)." However,
        it does not explicitly state "YES" as its final answer, even though it clearly
        affirms the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two locations are
        in different places (St. Peter Cathedral in Marquette, Michigan vs. The Mark
        Hotel in New York City, NY). The model is pointing out a difference in locations,
        not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that the two locations
        are in different cities/states. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        St. Peter Cathedral is not located west of The Mark Hotel without explaining
        that this is because they have the same longitude or are in the same location.
        The model did not provide any equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, St. Peter
        Cathedral (Marquette, Michigan), MI is not located west of The Mark Hotel,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Episcopal Cathedral of
        Saint Philip is located in Atlanta, Georgia, which is a different location
        than East Branch Clarion River Lake, Pennsylvania. The NO answer is based
        on geographical difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that the Episcopal Cathedral of Saint Philip is
        not west of East Branch Clarion River Lake, Pennsylvania. This is a clear
        negative comparative answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about the location of Episcopal Cathedral of Saint
        Philip in Atlanta, GA, not being west of East Branch Clarion River Lake, PA.
        The NO is based on rejecting the premise or correcting the question, not on
        equality of values.

        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered
        because the location is not specified in the question." This indicates the
        model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information.
        The model does not give a YES or NO answer, but rather explains why it cannot

        or misunderstood the premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "No", which appears
        to be a direct answer to the comparative question. However, the model then
        clarifies that the question was misunderstood - it states the question was
        about East Branch Clarion River Lake, PA, not about Episcopal Cathedral of
        Saint Philip in Atlanta. This indicates the model is rejecting the premise
        of the question rather than providing a comparative answer, making this an

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Topaz Solar Farm is in California
        and Lake Cascade is in Idaho, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly saying
        they have equal values. The model appears to be giving a NO answer based on
        the different locations, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
