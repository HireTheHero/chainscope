        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Loch Lomond is actually east of Lake Mohave, not
        west." The model is claiming the locations have different positions, with
        one being east of the other, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Loch Lomond (California), CA located west of Lake Mohave,

    df463718-35ef-45aa-a689-6e952c0c54be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Jocassee Dam is east of H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse (not west). The model
        states "South Carolina is east of Washington, DC" and concludes that even
        though Jocassee Dam is in western South Carolina, "it is still east of Washington,
        DC." The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Jocassee Dam is NOT west of H. Carl Moultrie
        Courthouse. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

    df8cd5a9-a042-4b04-9ee0-810c484a5a4d:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Jocassee Dam is southwest
        of the courthouse, not directly west. The model is noting a directional difference
        (southwest vs. west) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Jocassee Dam is NOT directly west of the H. Carl
        Moultrie Courthouse. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        that the House of the Temple is east of Sterling Memorial Library, not west
        as the question asked. The model explicitly states they are in different locations
        (one east of the other), not that they are equal or the same.

        the locations are at the same longitude, but rather because of their relative
        positions (with Causey being described as north and west, not purely west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Ford Park is east
        of the theater" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating a
        directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final answer. It directly addresses the comparative question about whether
        Ford Park is west of the Mahalia Jackson Theater and explicitly concludes
        with NO.

        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, not that
        it's making a definitive comparative judgment. The parenthetical explanation
