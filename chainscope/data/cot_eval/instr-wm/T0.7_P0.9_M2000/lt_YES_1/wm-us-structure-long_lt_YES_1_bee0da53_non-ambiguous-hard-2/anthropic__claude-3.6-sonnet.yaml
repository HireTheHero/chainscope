        that Arnold Engineering Development Complex in central TN is "slightly east"
        of Muskingum River Plant's location in eastern OH. The model noted a directional
        difference (slightly east), not equality.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Arnold Engineering
        Development Complex is "actually east of" the Muskingum River Power Plant,
        indicating a directional difference rather than equality. The NO answer is
        based on a claimed directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality

        saying "The Arnold Engineering Complex is actually east of the Muskingum River
        Power Plant's longitude." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it concluded
        that Arnold Engineering Development Complex is EAST of Muskingum River Power
        Plant (not west of it). The model is asserting a directional difference between
        the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, there''s a contradiction in the explanation. The model first concludes
        that "Arnold Engineering Development Complex would be west of Muskingum River
        Power Plant" but then states in parentheses that it is "NOT west" but rather
        "EAST of it." This contradiction makes the answer unclear, but since the model
        explicitly wrote "Answer: NO" followed by a clarification that aligns with
        that NO answer, I''ll classify this as NO.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer, stating that the Tennessee facility is actually east of the
        Ohio facility, not west. This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Arnold Engineering
        Development Complex, TN is NOT located west of Muskingum River Power Plant,
        OH. It is located EAST of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Wateree is
        east of Tower 49, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Lake Wateree, SC
        is not west of Tower 49, NY. It is east of it." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.
