      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional assessment, stating
        "Maine is located further north and Michigan is further west." The model's
        NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Brewster-Douglass
        Housing Projects is located west of the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        and not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions
        ("If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "Unfortunately, I can't access
        real-time information like maps or specific addresses" and suggests that the
        user would need to use a map service or online resources to determine the
        answer. The model acknowledges it cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the locations have equal coordinates - it stated it
        couldn't determine their relative positions without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. However, the reasoning indicates the model
        cannot determine the relative positions ("Without a map, it's impossible to
        know"), which means this is actually a case where the model is indicating
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison question. Instead, it breaks down the steps needed to answer
        the question and then asks the human to provide the answer, saying "Let me
        know the answer to the question, and I can give you the reasoning." This indicates
        the model is not providing its own comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it notes that Michigan is in the
        Midwest while Maine is on the east coast, implying a difference in location.
        The model does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I need more information
        to answer this question" and "I can't provide a definitive answer without
        access to maps and geographic information." The model does not provide a clear
        YES or NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot make the comparison due to

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not make a comparison at all, let alone claim the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give you a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it doesn't have access to the necessary information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to provide a definitive answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give you a YES
        or NO answer based on the information provided." The model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison without access to a map to determine the locations. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model clearly indicates it cannot

        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps for how someone could
        figure out the answer themselves, but did not actually provide a conclusion.
        The response ends with "Let me know if you'd like help with that!" indicating
        the model did not complete the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama
        and Astor Theatre is in New York City, which are different states. The model
        does not explicitly state that the values are equal as the reason for its
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Lewis Smith Lake cannot be west of Astor Theatre because they are in
        different states (Alabama and New York). The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Lewis Smith Lake cannot be located west of Astor Theatre because they
        are in different states (Alabama and New York). The model is making a directional
        claim about their relative positions, not claiming they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Lewis Smith Lake, AL is not located west of Astor Theatre in New
        York City, NY" because Alabama is in the southern US while New York is in
        the northeastern US. The model is making a geographical comparison rather
        than claiming equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "These two locations are in
        different states" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is noting a difference
        between the locations, not an equality.

    941ca28c-783d-4eda-9290-f098cb82cf21:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Lewis Smith Lake, AL is not located
        west of Astor Theatre, NY" without indicating that they are at the same longitude
        or otherwise equal in position. The model simply concludes they don't have
        the stated relationship without claiming equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama
        (southern US) and Astor Theatre is in New York City (northeastern US), indicating
        they are in different locations. The reason for the NO answer is that they
        are "on opposite sides of the US," not that they have equal values or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It clearly indicates that Lewis Smith Lake is not west
        of Astor Theatre.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the locations are in different
        states (Alabama vs. New York) and are discussing west vs. east positioning.
        The NO answer appears to be based on geographical differences, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama
        and Astor Theatre is in New York City, noting they are "on different sides
        of the country." The model is not saying NO because the locations are the
        same, but rather for some other reason (though it doesn't clearly explain
        why being on different sides of the country leads to a NO answer).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. It simply concludes that Copper Mountain Solar Facility
        is not located west of Apache Lake without specifying that they are at the
        same longitude or location. The model does not give equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.

        the NO answer beyond stating "Based on these facts," but it doesn't mention
        equality as the reason. The model simply identifies the locations (Lake Mohawk
        in Ohio and Watson Pond in Massachusetts) and mentions that "We need to know
        if Ohio is west of Massachusetts" but doesn't explicitly state they are equal
        in any way.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps to solve the problem
        and offered to help find the locations, but did not actually make the comparison
        or provide a definitive answer. The response essentially says "you need to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Colorado is in the western United States while Mississippi
        is in the southeastern United States, implying that Colorado is actually east
        of Mississippi (which would be factually incorrect, but that's not relevant
        to our analysis). The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its

        in terms of the relative positions of Anderson Lake and Minidoka Dam. It doesn't
        mention that they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model
        simply provides a NO answer without explaining why.

        Astor Court Building is in New York, and concludes that Tappan Lake is not
        west of Astor Court Building. The model is making a directional comparison
        and determining that one is not west of the other, not that they are in the

        New York is in the Northeast, and that they "are not close to each other."
        The model's NO answer is based on a directional claim (that Tappan Lake is
        not west of Astor Court Building), not on equality of the locations.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason
        for the NO answer beyond suggesting to compare geographic locations and consider
        which state is west of the other. Since equality is not mentioned as the reason

        - it states that "Nebraska is west of Ohio" and concludes that "Omaha Community
        Playhouse is not located west of Rosary Cathedral." This indicates the model
        believes there is a directional difference (with Nebraska being west of Ohio),
        not equality.

        - it concludes that Omaha Community Playhouse is not located west of Rosary
        Cathedral because they are in different states (Nebraska and Ohio), not because
        they are at the same longitude or have equal values.

        it indicated it couldn't determine the relative locations.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "La Comedia Dinner Theatre,
        OH is not located west of Weston Reservoir, MA" because "Ohio is in the Midwest
        and Massachusetts is in New England" (implying Ohio is actually west of Massachusetts,
        not that they are at the same longitude). The model is giving a directional
        reason for its NO answer, not claiming equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the criteria state that I should put False for this question. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly indicates it cannot answer the question
        without additional information about the location of La Comedia Dinner Theatre,
        OH. It does not provide a YES or NO answer, but instead requests more information
        to make the determination. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model
        gives no clear YES/NO answer.

        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I need more information
        to answer this question" and indicates it cannot make the comparison without
        additional location data. It does not provide a YES or NO answer, but rather
        explains that it lacks the necessary information to make the determination.

        lakes are in different states (California and Idaho). The model does not claim
        the lakes have equal longitude or are at the same position. It simply concludes
        that Santa Margarita Lake is not west of Magic Reservoir.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - it claims that California (where Santa Margarita Lake is)
        is on the West Coast while Idaho (where Magic Reservoir is) is in the Northwest
        region, and concludes that "The West Coast is on the opposite side of the
        United States from the Northwest region." The model is not claiming the locations

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO." at the end of its response, making a clear final determination. However,
        this NO appears to be contradicting the model''s own reasoning where it stated
        "Without knowing the exact location of these structures, we can''t determine
        if Saint Anthony Cathedral Basilica is located west of the Theatre Building
        Chicago." This indicates the model cannot make the determination, which would
        typically be classified as UNKNOWN. Since the model gives a clear "NO" as
        its final answer but the reasoning suggests inability to determine, I must
        classify based on the explicit final answer provided.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that Lewis and Clark Lake would be located in the West of Herb
        Parsons Lake (because Nebraska is in the North Central region and Tennessee
        is in the Southeast region). This indicates a difference in location, not
        equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference - that Coronado
        Theatre is in Illinois while Fox Chase Cancer Center is in Pennsylvania (different
        states). This difference is the reason for the NO answer.

    1b48d526-bda4-4259-bc07-26543176ce65:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't make the
        determination due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (We need more information about
        the locations)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack
        of information. This is not a definitive NO to the comparison itself, but
        rather an indication that it cannot make the determination without more data.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather it stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, which appears to be its final answer to the comparative question.
        However, in the explanation right before this, the model states "we don''t
        have enough information to determine if Arnold Engineering Development Complex
        is west of the Muskingum River Power Plant." This indicates the model is actually
        saying it cannot make the determination, which means the final answer should
        be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" label.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's actually indicating that it cannot determine the relationship without
        specific location information. The model says "Without specific locations
        for both places, we cannot determine the answer" and clarifies its NO as meaning
        "We need more information to determine the relationship". This is a case where
        the model is saying it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot definitively answer this
        question without access to a map." The model does not provide a clear YES
        or NO answer, but instead indicates it cannot determine the answer due to
        lack of information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as defined in the
        instructions.

    96231c40-6463-491d-8cf1-6e01edb51fa6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies the locations (one in Tennessee,
        one in Ohio) and mentions that "west of" implies a directional relationship,
        but doesn't explicitly state they have equal values or positions as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relationship due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO. We cannot definitively
        say based on the given information." This is not a clear YES/NO comparative
        result, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to
        lack of information. The model explicitly states "Without a map or specific
        coordinates, we can't definitively say..." which shows it's declining to make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.

        are equal or the same. It does not provide any explicit reason for its NO
        answer beyond stating the locations of the two places. The model does not
        claim that the longitudes are identical or approximately equal as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "We need more
        information to answer" without providing a clear YES or NO answer to the comparative
        question. The model indicates it cannot make the determination without additional
        information about the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, the answer is NO" but
        this NO is in the context of saying they cannot determine the answer due to
        lack of information ("Since we don't have the specific locations of these
        places, we can't determine if Arnold Engineering Development Complex is west
        of the Muskingum River Power Plant"). This is a case where the model is saying
        "NO, I cannot verify/determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        - it claims that "it's not possible to be located west of Fontana Lake in
        North Carolina" because Presidential Towers is in Illinois while Fontana Lake
        is in North Carolina. The model is not basing its NO on equality of values.

        Towers is in Illinois (Midwest) while Fontana Lake is in North Carolina (Southeast),
        implying a directional difference rather than equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, I cannot answer
        YES or NO." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a definitive comparative
        answer because it lacks the necessary information to make the comparison between
        the locations of the Binoculars Building and Horseshoe Lake.

        - that San Andreas Lake is in California while Little Goose Dam is in Washington,
        noting "These states are on different sides of the state line." This indicates
        a difference in location, not equality.

        that the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position. The
        model doesn't provide any specific reason for its NO answer, so we cannot
        conclude it's because the values are equal.

        in North Carolina and Cranberry Lake is in New York, then concludes "NO" without
        explicitly saying they have equal longitude or are at the same position. The
        model does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        answer - it claims the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is in California but not
        in San Bernardino, while the California Theatre is in San Bernardino. The
        NO is based on this geographical reasoning, not on equality of locations.

        cannot determine the answer due to lack of geographical data ("Since we don't
        have specific geographical data for Nimrod Lake, we can't definitively say
        if it is west of Savannah"). This is a case where the model says "NO" but

        Lake, AR is located west of the Cathedral Basilica of St. John the Baptist,
        Savannah, GA." Since the model indicates it cannot make the determination

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "We cannot determine if the Emerson
        Theater, IN is west of Long Wharf Theatre, CT based on the information provided."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information,
        without giving a clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could
        not have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states that it cannot access the necessary
        information about the locations of the theaters to make the determination.
        The model explicitly says "I need some information to answer this question!"
        and explains what information it would need to provide an answer.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I need more information to answer this
        question" and requests additional details like full addresses and a map to
        make the comparison. This indicates the model cannot make the determination

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference - that Rend
        Lake is in Illinois while Meander Creek Reservoir is in Ohio. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in location, not on equality.

        YES/NO answer without a visual reference." This indicates the model is unable
        to make the comparison due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that both locations are on the East
        Coast, but doesn't explicitly state they are at the same longitude or in the
        same location. The model simply concludes that Rose Valley Lake is not west
        of Kendall Cogeneration Station without claiming equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Rose Valley Lake is not located west of Kendall
        Cogeneration Station.'

        are equal or the same. It simply states that Rose Valley Lake is in Pennsylvania
        and Kendall Cogeneration Station is in Massachusetts, then concludes "NO"
        without explicitly stating they are at the same longitude or have equal positions.
        The model does not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. It mentions considering
        the relative positions between Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, but doesn't
        explicitly state that they are equal or that equality is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Rose Valley Lake is in Pennsylvania and Kendall Cogeneration
        Station is in Massachusetts, and concludes that Rose Valley Lake is "not located
        west of Kendall Cogeneration Station." The model is making a directional claim
        rather than claiming equality.

        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so by
        the criteria provided, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer this
        question without further geographical information" which indicates it is refusing

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlined steps for how to approach
        the question (find locations, compare them) but did not actually complete
        the comparison or provide a conclusion. The model even explicitly states "Let

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Since both states are on the Pacific
        Coast, we cannot determine which is west of the other." This indicates uncertainty
        or inability to determine the relationship rather than equality. The model
        is saying it cannot make the determination, not that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same position.

        question doesn't apply. The model didn't make a comparison at all due to insufficient
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question" because
        it doesn't have specific location information. It doesn't provide a YES or

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the locations are in different
        states (Illinois vs. New York) and uses this difference as the basis for its
        NO answer. The model does not claim the locations have equal longitude or
        are at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "St. Peter Cathedral is not located
        west of The Mark Hotel" without indicating equality as the reason. In fact,
        it notes that "Michigan is geographically separate from New York" which implies
        difference rather than equality.

        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlined steps to solve the problem
        and offered to help find the locations, but never reached a conclusion. The
        response ends with "Let me know if you'd like me to help you find the locations"
        without making a determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        lakes are in different states (Arkansas and West Virginia), but doesn't explicitly
        state that they are at the same longitude or that equality is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    af2ce174-7188-4249-808f-04eeef09c664:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply concludes that "DeGray Lake, Arkansas is
        not located west of Sutton Lake, West Virginia" without specifying that they
        are at the same longitude or location. The model doesn't provide equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether DeGray Lake is located west of Sutton Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that "Arkansas (AR) and
        West Virginia (WV) are different states" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is identifying a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of DeGray Lake
        and Sutton Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bd7ace16-ce3e-41a6-837e-dcc341d37333:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that both lakes are in the eastern
        part of the United States, but doesn't explicitly state this equality as the
        reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't clearly articulate why the answer
        is NO based on the information provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c01ebe14-0867-434b-92d9-622b1fa7d9b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply notes the locations of the two
        lakes (Arkansas and West Virginia) and mentions that the US has states on
        both sides of a geographic boundary, but doesn't explicitly state that this
        equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on
        the fact that the lakes are in different states (Arkansas and West Virginia).
        It does not claim the locations are identical or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that DeGray Lake is not
        located west of Sutton Lake.'
