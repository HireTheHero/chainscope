        west" and therefore it's "not entirely accurate to describe it as being west."
        The model is noting a directional difference (being more south than west)
        as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Lost Creek Lake is north (and possibly slightly east) of Sandals Church, not

        west. The model is stating there is a directional difference (north vs. west),
        not equality.
