        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Strait of Georgia is
        geographically north of Grizzly Bay, indicating a difference in their positions.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, there appears to be a contradiction in
        the model's reasoning. The model concludes that "the Ouachita Mountains in
        Arkansas are actually located south of Woman Lake in Minnesota" but then answers
        "NO" to what seems to be a question about whether the Ouachita Mountains are
        south of Woman Lake. This contradiction makes the answer unclear, but I must
