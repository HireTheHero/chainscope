        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is **YES**"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or
        any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is **YES**" at the end of its response. This is a clear affirmative
        answer to the question of whether Baca County, CO is located south of Boundary
        County, ID.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "Baca County is in the southern part of Colorado and Boundary
        County is in the northern part of Idaho, Baca County cannot be south of Boundary
        County." The model is claiming that Baca County is not south of Boundary County
        because of their relative positions (with Idaho being north of Colorado),
        not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it stated that "Baca County is far to the
        south compared to Boundary County."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: **YES**" at the end of its response, clearly indicating that it believes

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Since Baca County is south of Boundary County
        based on their respective locations, the answer to the question is NO." The
        model is indicating that Boundary County has a higher latitude than Baca County,
        not that they have equal latitudes.

        rather, it is located to the southeast of it." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (southeast rather than directly south), not equality.

        Cottle County is not south of Treasure County because Montana is generally
        north of Texas. The model actually states "Treasure County, being in Montana,
        is further north compared to Cottle County in Texas" which indicates a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, indicating that Cottle County, TX is not located
        south of Treasure County, MT. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal. Instead, it explains that Cottle County is at a lower latitude
        than Treasure County (meaning Cottle County is south of Treasure County),
        but concludes it is "not directly south of it." The model is making a distinction
        about directional alignment rather than claiming the locations have equal
        values. The NO answer is based on the interpretation that "south of" requires
        direct alignment, not because the locations have the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question of whether Cottle County, TX is located south of
        Treasure County, MT.
