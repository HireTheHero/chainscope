      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, making a clear affirmative statement about the comparison.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    73d3bab1-cea3-427a-bf98-391e22a13b84:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Baca County, CO
        is located south of Boundary County, ID." This is a clear affirmative answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9e86783f-f541-4fa6-883e-f772eae44f84:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must classify this as False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning about the locations of
        Baca County, CO and Boundary County, ID, concluding that "Baca County is located
        south of Boundary County." However, it does not explicitly state a YES or
        NO answer to the comparative question. Without an explicit YES or NO statement,
        the final answer must be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided information about the locations
        of Baca County, CO and Boundary County, ID, but did not explicitly state YES
        or NO to any comparative question. The response simply states factual information
        about the counties' locations without making a clear comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Karnes County, TX is in southern
        Texas while Kearney County, NE is in northern Nebraska, and concludes that
        "Karnes County is south of Kearney County." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is conditional and doesn't provide
        a definitive YES or NO answer. It states "If the Texas county, it is not.
        If the South Carolina county, it is." Without knowing which county is being
        referred to, the model has effectively refused to give a single answer, instead
        providing two possible answers depending on which county is meant.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it gives a directional difference (southwest
        vs. northwest) as the reason for its NO answer. The model is claiming that
        Quay County is not south of Whatcom County because of their relative positions
        (southwest vs. northwest), not because they have equal latitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "It's a no." The model
        then explains that Quay County, NM is in the southwest US and Whatcom County,
        WA is in the northwest US, concluding "Therefore, Quay County, NM is not located
        south of Whatcom County, WA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.

        model does not explicitly state that equality is the reason for its NO answer.

        - it states that Cocke County, TN is in the southeastern US while Sanders
        County, MT is in the northwestern US, and concludes that Cocke County is not
        south of Sanders County. This reasoning indicates a directional difference,

        then provides information about the locations of the two counties, indicating
        that Conecuh County is in the southeastern US while Bingham County is in the
        northwestern US. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        "Idaho is north of Alabama." The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
