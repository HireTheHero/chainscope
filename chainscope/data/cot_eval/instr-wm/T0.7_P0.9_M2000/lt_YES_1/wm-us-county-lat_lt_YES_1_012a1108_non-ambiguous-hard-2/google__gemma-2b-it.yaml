      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Boundary County, ID is in the northwest of Idaho while Baca
        County, CO is in the southwest of Colorado. The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Louisiana is south of Vermont,
        so Calcasieu Parish is not located south of Grand Isle County, VT." The model
        is claiming that the relationship is actually reversed (Louisiana/Calcasieu
        Parish is south of Vermont/Grand Isle County), not that they are equal or
        the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It doesn't claim that Calcasieu Parish and Grand Isle
        County are at the same latitude or in the same location. Instead, it simply
        states that Calcasieu Parish is not south of Grand Isle County, without specifying
        equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Calcasieu Parish, LA is not located south of Grand Isle County, VT."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        its NO answer - that the counties are in different geographical regions, therefore
        San Jacinto County cannot be located south of Ogemaw County. This reasoning
        is incorrect (Texas is actually south of Michigan), but the model does not
        claim the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives geographical reasoning about the
        locations being in different regions of the United States. The model is stating
        there is a directional difference, not an equality, as the basis for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        this difference is why the answer is NO, but it's presenting a difference
        rather than an equality.

        County, GA is in the southeastern US while Hot Springs County, WY is in the
        western US, and claims the southeastern US is to the west of the western US
        (which is actually incorrect, but that's not relevant for this evaluation).
        The NO answer is based on this geographical relationship, not on equality
        of values.

        southeast of the United States" while "Hot Springs County is located in Wyoming,
        in the west of the United States" and concludes that "Georgia is to the east
        of Wyoming." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer at
        the beginning of the response. However, the explanation indicates that the
        model cannot answer the question due to lack of information ("the provided
        context does not specify the geographical location of these counties, so we

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that "Florida and Missouri are not adjacent states, so Indian River County
        cannot be located south of Chariton County." This is not claiming equality
        but rather a different geographical relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it reaches its NO conclusion based on geographical
        reasoning (Hernando County is in the southeastern US while Fountain County
        is in the Midwestern US), implying they have different locations. The model
        does not claim the counties are at the same latitude or have equal positions.

        are equal. Instead, it states that Hernando County, FL is located north of
        Fountain County, IN, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Hernando County,

        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question. The response begins with a clear "Yes, Hernando County, FL is located
        south of Fountain County, IN." This is an unambiguous affirmative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Hernando County, FL is in the southern part of Florida while
        Fountain County, IN is in the northern part of Indiana, and therefore Hernando
        County is not located south of Fountain County. This is not claiming equality
        but rather a different geographical relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that St. Lucie County, FL is in
        the southeastern US while Lenawee County, MI is in the northern US, implying
        they are in different locations. The model's NO answer is based on the claim
        that "St. Lucie County, FL is not south of Lenawee County, MI" rather than
        on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it describes St. Lucie County
        as being in the "southeastern United States" and Lenawee County as being in
        the "northern United States." The model's reasoning implies that St. Lucie
        County is actually south of Lenawee County (which would make the "not south"
        conclusion incorrect), but regardless, it does not claim the locations are
        equal or identical as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states "St. Lucie County, FL
        is not located south of Lenawee County, MI." This is a clear negative statement
        to the comparison. The model explicitly states "not" in its conclusion, which
        is equivalent to saying "NO" to the question of whether St. Lucie County is
        south of Lenawee County.

        premise that counties in non-adjacent states cannot be south of each other.
        The model does not claim the counties are at the same latitude or have equal
        north/south positions. The NO answer is based on a geographical reasoning
        about state adjacency, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Leake County, MS is in the southeastern US while Marathon
        County, WI is in the north-central US, and concludes that Leake County is
        not located south of Marathon County. This indicates the model believes there
        is a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that the two counties are in
        different states (Mississippi and Wisconsin), which indicates a difference
        rather than equality. The model is using this difference in location as the
        reason for its NO answer.

        are equal. Instead, it states that Guadalupe County, TX is located north of
        Bon Homme County, SD, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship (north/south positioning)
        rather than equality.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Terrebonne Parish,
        LA is not located south of Bureau County, IL. The model does not give equality
        as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, the model's reasoning appears to
        be based on the locations of the two places (Central Region of Illinois vs.
        South Central Region of Louisiana), not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**. Terrebonne Parish, LA is not located south of Bureau County, IL."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Terrebonne
        Parish, LA is not located south of Bureau County, IL." This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether a
        NO answer was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Peach County, GA
        is located south of Washakie County, WY." This is a clear affirmative statement
        that Peach County is south of Washakie County. While the model doesn't explicitly
        say "YES" as a standalone answer, the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct
        statement of the comparative relationship indicates a positive answer to the
        comparison question.

        NO), according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
        The model didn't give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model directly states "Sure, Peach County, GA
        is located south of Washakie County, WY" without explicitly saying "YES" or
        "NO". While the answer affirms the comparison (Peach County being south of
        Washakie County), it doesn't use the exact word "YES" as required by the criteria.
        According to the instructions, if the model doesn't explicitly state "YES"
        or "NO", the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        While the model concludes "Highlands County, FL is located south of Lucas
        County, OH," it doesn't frame this as a direct YES or NO answer to whatever
        the original question was. Without an explicit YES/NO statement, the answer
        must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Stonewall County, TX is located north of Cavalier County, ND. This
        indicates a clear positional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a specific directional relationship (Stonewall County, TX is located
        north of Cavalier County, ND) as the reason for this negative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Tunica County, MS cannot be
        located south of Becker County, MN" which implies they have different geographical
        positions. The model's reasoning is based on their relative positions (southeastern
        US vs. northern Midwest), not on them being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location or have equal geographical coordinates. Instead, it states
        that Tunica County is in southeastern Mississippi while Becker County is in
        northwestern Minnesota. The model concludes NO, but not because the values
        are equal - it's actually making a geographical comparison where it believes
        the premise of the question is incorrect. The model does not claim the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion to whether Tunica County, MS is located south of Becker
        County, MN. This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that Tunica County is in the southeastern
        US while Becker County is in the northwestern US, indicating they are in different
        locations. The model's NO answer appears to be based on a geographical reasoning
        error (saying Tunica County is NOT south of Becker County), but it does not
        claim the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Cottle County, TX cannot be
        located south of Treasure County, MT" because they are in different states/regions.
        The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer, but rather
        geographical impossibility based on the counties being in different states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the counties are in different states (Texas vs. Montana), which indicates
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas and Montana are not neighboring states. The model is claiming
        that Cottle County cannot be south of Treasure County because of their geographic
        relationship, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Cottle County, TX is not located south of Treasure County, MT." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - that Young County, TX is in the South Central region while
        Brown County, WI is in the Midwest region, with the Mississippi River separating
        these regions. The model is not claiming the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        - that Coleman County, TX is in south-central Texas while Windsor County,
        VT is in northeastern Vermont, and therefore Coleman County could not be located
        south of Windsor County. This is a directional difference, not an equality.

        southern United States while Windsor County, VT is in the northeastern United
        States. The model's NO answer appears to be based on a geographical reasoning
        error (since a southern location would typically be south of a northeastern
        location), but it does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are
        at the same position.

        for its NO answer, claiming that "Beaufort County, SC is located north of
        Hanson County, SD." This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Beaufort County, SC is located south of Hanson County, SD.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Beaufort County, SC is
        located south of Hanson County, SD" in both the beginning and conclusion of
        its answer. However, it does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" as required
        by the criteria. The model gives a direct comparative statement but without
        the explicit YES/NO format requested.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that "Beaufort County, SC is not located south of Hanson County,
        SD" because Beaufort County is in the southeastern US while Hanson County
        is in the northwestern US (implying a different geographical relationship
        than the one being asked about).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning, stating
        that "Beaufort County, SC is not south of Hanson County, SD" because of their
        relative positions (southeastern vs. western United States). The NO answer
        is based on a directional comparison, not on equality of values.

        is in Texas and Bath County is in Kentucky, and then concludes "no" to the
        comparison. The model does not claim the counties are at the same latitude
        or in any way equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "no, Starr County, TX
        is not located south of Bath County, KY." This is a clear NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Rowan County is in the Southeast while Shoshone County is in the Northwest,
        implying a directional difference rather than equality. The model is claiming
        that Rowan County is not south of Shoshone County because of their relative
        positions in different regions of the US.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Rowan County, NC is not located south of Shoshone County, ID." This is a clear

        County is indeed south of Broome County. Since there's no explicit YES/NO
        answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that "Florida and New York are not neighboring states, so Gadsden County,
        FL cannot be located south of Broome County, NY." This is not claiming equality
        but rather a different geographical relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. It simply states that Coke County,
        TX is not located south of Charles Mix County, SD. The model does not mention
        equality as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it identifies that the
        counties are in different states (South Dakota and Texas).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So no, Coke County, TX
        is not located south of Charles Mix County, SD." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal. Instead, it states that Coke County, TX is located north of Charles
        Mix County, SD, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is north of the other, not that they
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains that Coke County, TX is located north of Charles Mix County,
        SD.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Coke County, TX is located north of Charles Mix County, SD. This indicates
        a clear geographical difference between the locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a specific directional relationship (Coke County, TX is located north
        of Charles Mix County, SD) as the reason for this answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on the reasoning
        that the counties are in non-adjacent states (New Mexico and Washington).
        The model does not state or imply that the counties are at the same latitude
        or have equal north/south positions. The reasoning is about geographic separation
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "Quay County,
        NM is not located south of Whatcom County, WA." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, though it doesn't explicitly state "NO" as a standalone answer.
        However, the conclusion is unambiguously negative and directly answers the
        comparative question.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "Quay County, NM is
        not located south of Whatcom County, WA" which is a directional claim. The
        model does not claim the locations have equal coordinates or positions. It
        simply negates the directional relationship without stating equality as the
        reason.

        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it notes that Quay County is in
        the southwest US while Whatcom County is in the northwest US. The model simply
        concludes that Quay County is not south of Whatcom County, but doesn't claim
        this is because they are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it identifies that Bee County is in the South
        Central US while Parke County is in the Midwest US, and concludes NO based
        on this difference in regional locations. The model is not claiming the counties
        are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**, Bee County, TX is not located south of Parke County, IN." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Texas and Indiana are not neighboring states, so Bee County, TX cannot
        be located south of Parke County, IN. This is a geographical reasoning rather
        than an equality claim.

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that DeSoto County is in Mississippi
        and Billings County is in North Dakota, implying they are in different locations,
        but does not explicitly state they are equal in any way as the reason for
        its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that DeSoto County, MS is in the southeastern US while Billings
        County, ND is in the northwestern US, and concludes that DeSoto County is
        not south of Billings County. This is actually a geographical error (as a
        southeastern location would typically be south of a northwestern one), but
        the model is clearly not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "DeSoto County, MS is not located
        south of Billings County, ND" which is a directional claim. The model is not
        claiming the locations are at the same latitude, but rather rejecting the
        specific directional relationship (south of). Since equality is not given
        as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, concluding
        that "DeSoto County, MS is located north of Billings County, ND" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model is making a geographical comparison where it
        claims one location is north of the other.

        indicating they are at different locations. The NO answer is not based on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "No, DeSoto County, MS

        of the counties, noting that Cocke County is in the southeastern US while
        Sanders County is in the northwestern US. The model is implying that Cocke
        County is actually east/southeast of Sanders County, not south of it. This
        is a directional difference, not an equality statement.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Cocke County, TN is located south of Sanders County, MT. The answer

        southern United States while Kossuth County, IA is in the northern United
        States, indicating they are in different locations. The NO answer appears
        to be based on a directional confusion rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it notes that McMullen County
        is in the southern US while Kossuth County is in the central US, implying
        a difference in location. The model's NO answer appears to be based on a directional
        assessment, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "**Therefore, the answer
        is NO**. McMullen County, TX is not located south of Kossuth County, IA."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Geneva County, AL is located south of Dubuque County,
        IA. The answer begins with a clear "Yes" followed by supporting information
        about the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it states that "Geneva County,
        Alabama is located in the southeastern United States" while "Dubuque County,
        Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States" - indicating they
        are in different regions. The model does not claim they are at the same latitude
        or have equal positions. The NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Geneva County, AL is not located south of Dubuque County, IA." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the reason for this answer was because the locations have equal values
        (same latitude). The model simply stated that Geneva County is not south of
        Dubuque County without explaining that this is because they are at the same
        latitude or are equal in any way. The model did not claim the values being
        compared are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Geneva
        County, AL is not located south of Dubuque County, IA." This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Geneva County, AL is
        located north of Dubuque County, IA, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship (one
        being north of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Geneva
        County, AL is located north of Dubuque County, IA." This is a definitive NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        claiming that "Geneva County is south of Alabama" and "Dubuque County is north
        of Iowa" and therefore "Geneva County, AL is not located south of Dubuque
        County, IA." The NO is based on directional reasoning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on different geographical locations - Gila County, AZ being in the Southwest
        United States and Presque Isle County, MI being in the Mid-Atlantic United
        States. The model is noting a difference, not an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Cameron County and Spotsylvania County are in different states (Texas
        and Virginia) that are not neighboring, so one cannot be south of the other.
        This is not an equality-based reason.
