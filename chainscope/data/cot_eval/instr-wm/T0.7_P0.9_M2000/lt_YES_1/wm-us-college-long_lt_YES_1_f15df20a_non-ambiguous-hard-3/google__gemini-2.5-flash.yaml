      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes of Drake University and Aurora University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that Drake University
        College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences is west of Aurora University.'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.
