      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Reinhardt University is "southwest" of
        Wingate University, which means it is "to the south and slightly to the west."
        The model is saying NO because Reinhardt is not directly west, but rather
        southwest. This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question
        about whether Reinhardt University is located west of Wingate University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "Wingate, North
        Carolina, is located to the southeast of Waleska, Georgia" and that Reinhardt
        is "situated more to the south and slightly east" compared to Wingate. The
        model is claiming there is a directional difference between the locations,
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the
        comparison question about whether Reinhardt University is located west of
        Wingate University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Wingate University is north of Reinhardt University, we can conclude
        that Reinhardt University is not west of Wingate University." The model is
        making a directional comparison (north vs. west) rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the universities are
        at the same location or have equal longitude values. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - it claims that Reinhardt University is south of
        Wingate University and therefore cannot be west of it. The model is making
        a directional distinction (south vs. west) rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Reinhardt University
        is not located west of Wingate University" as its final answer. This is a
