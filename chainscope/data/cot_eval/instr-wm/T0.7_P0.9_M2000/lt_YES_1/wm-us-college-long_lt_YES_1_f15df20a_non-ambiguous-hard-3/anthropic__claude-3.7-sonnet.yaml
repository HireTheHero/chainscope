        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison because one of the institutions doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "NO" but then immediately
        clarifies that it "cannot definitively answer this question because 'New Orleans
        University' is not an actual institution." This indicates the model is rejecting
        the premise of the question since one of the institutions doesn't exist. The
        model is not providing a clear comparative YES/NO answer about the relative
        positions, but rather stating it cannot make the comparison due to the non-existence
        of one entity.
