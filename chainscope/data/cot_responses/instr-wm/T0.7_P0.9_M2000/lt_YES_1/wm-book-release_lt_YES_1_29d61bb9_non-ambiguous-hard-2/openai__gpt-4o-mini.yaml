      "Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings," we need to establish the publication

      1. **Identify the publication date of "Suicide Circle: The Complete Edition":**
      This work is associated with Sion Sono''s film "Suicide Club," and the complete
      edition was released as part of a broader collection related to his works. However,
      the specific date of this edition''s release may vary depending on the format
      (book, graphic novel, etc.).


      2. **Identify the publication date of "Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings":**
      This fatwa was released by Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri in response to the increasing
      violence associated with terrorism and suicide bombings. The publication date
      for this fatwa is known to be in 2010.

      it would mean it was released later than Tahir-ul-Qadri''s fatwa. Conversely,

      3. **Conclusion based on publication dates:** After reviewing the available
      information, it is known that "Suicide Circle: The Complete Edition" was released
      in 2015.
