      * _The Merchant of Death_ (Pendragon Book 8) was published in 2004.

    8b2dcc9b-21a1-42dd-bfa7-b6af45be38a7: '1. **Find publication date of *The Merchant

      It was published in 2002.


      2. **Find publication date of *Neverwinter*.** This is technically ambiguous,
      as there are several D&D books related to Neverwinter.  Assuming the question
      refers to R.A. Salvatore''s first Drizzt book set in Neverwinter, *Gauntlgrym*,
      it was published in 2010. If the question refers to the first Neverwinter novel
      ever, that would be *Neverwinter* by R.A. Salvatore, published in 1998.


      3. **Compare the dates.** 2002 (Merchant of Death) is earlier than 2010 (Gauntlgrym)
      and later than 1998 (Neverwinter).


      Therefore, if the question refers to *Gauntlgrym*, the answer is YES.  If the
      question refers to the *Neverwinter* novel by R.A. Salvatore, the answer is
      NO.


      Since the question is ambiguous, I will provide both answers and the reasoning:


      **If referring to *Gauntlgrym*: YES**


      **If referring to *Neverwinter* by Salvatore: NO**
