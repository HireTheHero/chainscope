      1) Zhang Qian was a Chinese diplomat and explorer during the Han Dynasty. He
      died around 113 BCE.


      2) Marcia (also known as Marcia Furnilla) was the second wife of Roman Emperor
      Titus. She lived in the 1st century CE.


      3) To compare:

      - Zhang Qian: died c. 113 BCE

      - Marcia: lived in the 1st century CE (after year 0)


      4) Since BCE counts down and CE counts up, anyone who died in BCE died before
      someone who lived in CE.


      5) Therefore, Zhang Qian (113 BCE) died before Marcia (1st century CE).
