      Bavo in Haarlem is located south of the Ronde Lutherse Kerk, we need to identify
      the locations of both structures.


      1. **Identify the location of the Cathedral of St Bavo**: This cathedral is
      located in Haarlem, a city in the province of North Holland, Netherlands.


      2. **Identify the location of the Ronde Lutherse Kerk**: This church is located

      1. Identify the location of St. Peter''s Roman Catholic Church within Drogheda.

      2. Identify the location of Saint Laurence Gate within Drogheda.

      3. Determine the relative positions of these two landmarks to each other, specifically
      whether the church is south of the gate.


      St. Peter''s Roman Catholic Church is located on West Street in Drogheda. Saint
      Laurence Gate is situated at the junction of Laurence Street and Chord Road,
      northeast of the town center.


      To determine their relative positions:


      - St. Peter''s Church is located towards the center of Drogheda, on West Street.

      The most well-known "Big Pink" is a house in West Saugerties, New York, associated
      with The Band and Bob Dylan. However, this "Big Pink" is not relevant to Skokie

      1. Big Pink is a well-known building located in Portland, Oregon. It is also

      Northolt is in West London, Hackney is generally east of Northolt. However,
      the question asks about the north-south relation, not east-west.


      4. **Check the north-south positioning**: Hackney is located centrally and slightly
      north in London, whereas Northolt is located more to the northwest of London.

      - Buffavento Castle, in Northern Cyprus, is also in the Northern Hemisphere,
      but it is in the eastern part of the Mediterranean region.


      Given these geographic locations, Kaibab Lake is actually located further north

      Therefore, the answer to the question, "Is Kaibab Lake located south of Buffavento
      Castle?" is **NO**.'
