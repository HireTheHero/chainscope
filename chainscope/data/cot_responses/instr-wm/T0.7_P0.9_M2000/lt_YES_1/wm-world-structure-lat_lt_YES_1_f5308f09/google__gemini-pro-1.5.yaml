      two *different* provinces on the island of Negros in the Philippines.  Negros
      Oriental is on the southeastern portion of the island, while Negros Occidental
      is on the western portion.  Therefore, even though they are in cities with the
      same name, they are not in the same location. Looking at a map would confirm
      this.

      while broadly speaking, one could say it''s "south," it''s more accurately southeast.

      Using a map or online search:


      Sant''Ignazio is near the Pantheon.

      Palazzo Giustiniani is near Piazza Navona.


      Piazza Navona is south of the Pantheon. Therefore, Palazzo Giustiniani is south
      of Sant''Ignazio.

      2. **Locate Palazzo Giustiniani:** Palazzo Giustiniani is located near Piazza
      Navona, also in the Pigna rione, but closer to the Tiber River.


      3. **Determine relative positions:**  Generally, the Tiber River runs roughly
      south through Rome.  Palazzo Giustiniani being closer to the Tiber than Sant''Ignazio
      implies it is further south.


      4. **Conclusion:** Thus, Sant''Ignazio is *north* of Palazzo Giustiniani.
