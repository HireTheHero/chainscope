      4. Comparing their positions:

      - Walchensee is further west than Berchtesgaden

      - Walchensee is slightly further north than Berchtesgaden

    b5bf0ee3-4cf4-477c-a290-8f9a692d0869: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to locate both places in London:

      - Burdett Road railway station is in East London, in Mile End area

      - Fitzroy Tavern is in Central London, in Fitzrovia (near Tottenham Court Road)


      2. To determine if one is south of the other, I need to compare their positions
      relative to each other:

      - Fitzroy Tavern is in central London around the Fitzrovia area

      - Burdett Road station is in East London, roughly at a similar latitude to Fitzroy
      Tavern


      3. Looking at their relative positions:

      - Both locations sit on approximately the same east-west line

      - Neither is significantly north or south of the other


      4. Therefore, since Burdett Road station is at roughly the same latitude as
      Fitzroy Tavern (just further east), it cannot be considered south of it.

      1. First, let me identify the locations:

      - Amarkantak Thermal Power Station is in Madhya Pradesh

      - Adalaj Stepwell is in Gujarat, near Ahmedabad


      2. Let me determine their rough positions:

      - Amarkantak Thermal Power Station is in central India

      - Adalaj Stepwell is in western India


      3. Looking at their relative positions:

      - Gujarat (Adalaj) is located north of Madhya Pradesh (Amarkantak)

      - Therefore, Amarkantak must be south of Adalaj

      2) In Burlington, Pine Street and Cherry Street run parallel to each other

      - And Kenner Army Health Clinic is in Virginia

      - Therefore, Kenner Army Health Clinic must be south of Green River Lake

      1) First, let me recall the locations:

      - Lyric Theatre is located at 214 West 43rd Street in New York City

      - Tower 49 is located at 12 East 49th Street in New York City


      2) In Manhattan''s grid system:

      - Streets run east-west and are numbered from south to north

      - The higher the street number, the further north you are


      3) Comparing the street numbers:

      - Lyric Theatre is on 43rd Street

      - Tower 49 is on 49th Street

      - 43 is less than 49, meaning 43rd Street is south of 49th Street


      4) Therefore, since Lyric Theatre is on a street with a lower number than Tower
      49, it must be south of Tower 49.

      - Fairfax Community Church is along Braddock Road, southeast of downtown


      4. Final analysis:

      Since Fairfax Community Church is southeast of Truro Church, it is indeed south
      of it.

      2. Using these addresses:
