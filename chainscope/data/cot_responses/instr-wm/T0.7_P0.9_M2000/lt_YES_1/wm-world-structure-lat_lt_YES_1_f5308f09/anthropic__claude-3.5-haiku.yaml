      1. First, locate the Cathedral of St Bavo in Haarlem, Netherlands

      2. Then, locate the Ronde Lutherse Kerk

      3. Determine their relative positions


      Step 1: The Cathedral of St Bavo (Sint-Bavokerk) is located in the center of
      Haarlem, in the Netherlands.


      Step 2: The Ronde Lutherse Kerk is also located in Haarlem, specifically in

      Bavo is actually located north of the Ronde Lutherse Kerk.

      Aegean Sea

      - It''s the southern terminus of the Northern Line

      - It''s in the London Borough of Merton


      2. Next, I''ll locate Hampton Court railway station:

      - Hampton Court is located in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames

      - It''s southwest of central London

      - It''s closer to the River Thames


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Morden is further south in London

      - Hampton Court is more to the southwest, but not as far south as Morden


      4. Therefore, Morden tube station is indeed located south of Hampton Court railway
      station.

      1. First, I''ll locate Kenner Army Health Clinic geographically

      2. Then I''ll locate Green River Lake geographically

      Step 1: Kenner Army Health Clinic is located at Fort Knox, Kentucky.


      Step 2: Green River Lake is located in central Kentucky.


      Step 3: Checking their relative positions:

      - Fort Knox is in north-central Kentucky

      - Green River Lake is more centrally located in Kentucky

      - By comparing their locations, Fort Knox (where Kenner Army Health Clinic is)
      is actually north of Green River Lake


      Therefore, Kenner Army Health Clinic is NOT located south of Green River Lake.

      1. First, I''ll locate the two churches in Fairfax, Virginia

      2. I''ll check their precise geographical positions relative to each other

      3. I''ll determine if Fairfax Community Church is south of Truro Church


      After carefully checking their locations:

      - Truro Church is located at 10520 Warwick Blvd, Fairfax, VA

      - Fairfax Community Church is located at 4001 Meredith Dr, Fairfax, VA
