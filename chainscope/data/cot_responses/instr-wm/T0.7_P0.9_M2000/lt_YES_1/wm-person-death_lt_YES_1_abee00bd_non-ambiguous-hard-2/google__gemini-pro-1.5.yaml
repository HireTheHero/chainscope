      2. **Find the death date of Guillaume Ragutel de Montfort:**  William of Montfort
      (Guillaume II de Montfort) died in 1230. Montfort was a common surname, so ensuring
      we have the correct individual is essential.  Guillaume Ragutel de Montfort
      appears to be a less common name and likely refers to a member of the Montfort
      family, potentially related to the more famous Simon de Montfort.  However,
      a death date of 1230 seems most likely when cross-referencing with historical
      records.
