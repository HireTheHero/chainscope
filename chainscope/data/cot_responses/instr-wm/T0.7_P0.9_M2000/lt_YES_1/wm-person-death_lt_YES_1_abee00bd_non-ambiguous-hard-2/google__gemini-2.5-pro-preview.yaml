      1.  **Pierre Moulu:** He was a Franco-Flemish composer. His exact dates are
      uncertain, but he was active roughly from 1500 to 1522. His death date is unknown,
      but it is presumed to be sometime after his last known activity, likely in the
      1520s, and certainly before 1550.

      2.  **Karl Joseph Eberth:** He was a German pathologist and bacteriologist.
      He was born on September 21, 1835, and died on December 2, 1926.

      *   Pierre Moulu died sometime before 1550 (likely much earlier, in the 1520s).

      *   Karl Joseph Eberth died in 1926.
