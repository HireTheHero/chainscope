      lived during the 14th century. His death date is generally accepted to be around
      1340.

      of Northumberland, died earlier than Roger Pierre, we need to establish the
      dates of death for both individuals.


      1. **Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland**: He was born on February 14,
      1478, and died on May 22, 1527.


      2. **Roger Pierre**: There may be some ambiguity regarding which Roger Pierre
      is being referenced, as there are various historical figures with that name.
      However, the most commonly referenced Roger Pierre is a French figure involved
      in the military or political scene.


      Assuming we are looking for a specific Roger Pierre, I will check the known
      details. If we take Roger Pierre (the French soldier) who lived around the 16th
      century, we can find that he died in the late 1500s.


      Now comparing the two dates:


      - Henry Percy died on May 22, 1527.

      - Roger Pierre, if referring to the military figure, likely died in the late
      1500s.


      Since May 22, 1527, is earlier than any date in the late 1500s, we can conclude:


      **NO**, Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, did not die at an earlier date
      than Roger Pierre.'

      - Rosina von Graben von Rain: 1500 CE


      Since 700 CE is earlier than 1500 CE, we can conclude that Asma bint Shihab
      did die at an earlier date than Rosina von Graben von Rain.


      The final answer is: **YES**.'
    ea2a8b06-6e1a-4e68-8a02-7f535a20f155: 'To determine whether Asma bint Shihab died
      at an earlier date than Rosina von Graben von Rain, we need to establish the
      dates of death for both historical figures.


      1. Asma bint Shihab (also known as Asma bint Shihab al-Ansari) is known to have
      lived during the early Islamic period, but specific dates regarding her life
      and death are often vague. Generally, she is considered to have died around
      670 CE.


      2. Rosina von Graben von Rain was an Austrian noblewoman who lived much later.
      She was born in the late 15th century and is known to have died in 1545.


      Now, comparing the two dates:

      - Asma bint Shihab died around 670 CE.

      - Rosina von Graben von Rain died in 1545 CE.


      Since 670 CE is significantly earlier than 1545 CE, we can conclude that Asma
      bint Shihab did die at an earlier date than Rosina von Graben von Rain.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.'
