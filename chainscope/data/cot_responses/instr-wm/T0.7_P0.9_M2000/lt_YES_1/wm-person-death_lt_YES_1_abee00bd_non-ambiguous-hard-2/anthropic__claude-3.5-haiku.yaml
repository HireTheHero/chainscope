      1. First, who was Benjamin of Tudela?

      - Benjamin of Tudela was a medieval Jewish traveler who journeyed across Europe,
      Asia, and Africa in the 12th century

      - He was active around 1165-1173 AD

      - He is known for his detailed travel writings about the Jewish communities
      he encountered


      2. Who was Mehmed I?

      - Mehmed I was an Ottoman Sultan who ruled from 1413 to 1421 AD

      - He was part of the Ottoman Empire during its early expansion period


      3. Comparing their lifetimes:

      - Benjamin of Tudela lived in the 12th century (around 1165-1173)

      - Mehmed I lived in the early 15th century (1413-1421)

      - This means Benjamin of Tudela lived several centuries before Mehmed I


      4. Conclusion:

      - Since Benjamin of Tudela lived much earlier than Mehmed I, he would have died
      at an earlier date


      Therefore, the answer is: YES, Benjamin of Tudela died at an earlier date than
      Mehmed I.'
