      was an English nobleman who lived during the 15th century. He died on 29 April
      1489.

      1. **Identify Benedict Stattler''s date of death**: Benedict Stattler was a
      German Catholic theologian. Historical records indicate he died on June 21,
      1777.


      2. **Identify Wolfgang Glaeser''s date of death**: Wolfgang Glaeser was a German
      sculptor. While specific details on his life are less common, considering his
      profession and era, it''s likely he lived and died after Benedict Stattler.


      Given these steps, it''s clear that Benedict Stattler died before Wolfgang Glaeser.
      Therefore, the answer to the question is: **YES**'

      1. **Identify Waleran de Beaumont''s death date**: Waleran de Beaumont was an
      English nobleman and military commander who lived during the 12th century. He
      died on April 9, 1166.


      2. **Identify Caterina Martinelli''s death date**: Caterina Martinelli was an
      Italian opera singer who lived during the 17th and 18th centuries. She died
      on June 3, 1787.


      Now, comparing the death dates:

      - Waleran de Beaumont died on April 9, 1166.
