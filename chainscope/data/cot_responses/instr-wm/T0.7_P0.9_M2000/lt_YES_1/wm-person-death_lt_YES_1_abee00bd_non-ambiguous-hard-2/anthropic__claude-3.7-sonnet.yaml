      Earl of Northumberland died and when Roger Pierre died, then compare these dates.


      Step 1: Identify when Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland died.

      Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, was an English nobleman who died on
      May 29, 1461, during the Wars of the Roses at the Battle of Towton.


      Step 2: Identify when Roger Pierre died.

      This is more challenging as "Roger Pierre" is not a widely recognized historical
      figure in the same way as the Earl of Northumberland. The most well-known Pierre
      in entertainment was likely comedian and actor Jamie "Pierre" Farr, or possibly
      actor/comedian Robert "Pierre" Schimmel. However, without clear historical records
      of a notable Roger Pierre, I need to consider that this could refer to a more
      contemporary figure or a less documented historical person.


      Step 3: Make a reasonable inference based on context.

      The Earl of Northumberland died in 1461, which is the 15th century. If Roger
      Pierre was a modern figure (20th century or later), then he would have died
      centuries after the Earl. Even if Roger Pierre was a medieval figure, the specificity
      of the Earl''s death date suggests this is the key information needed for comparison.


      Given that Henry Percy died in 1461 and Roger Pierre, if a modern figure, would
      have died much later, the Earl would have died at an earlier date.


      NO, Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland did not die at an earlier date than
      Roger Pierre. The Earl almost certainly died at a later date than Roger Pierre.


      Wait - I need to reconsider. If Roger Pierre is a modern figure who lived in
      the 20th century or later, then the Earl would have died EARLIER, not later.
      Let me correct my reasoning.


      YES, Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland did die at an earlier date than
      Roger Pierre, assuming Roger Pierre lived in more recent centuries.'

      This is more challenging because there are multiple possibilities:

      - If referring to the American actor Pierre Watkin (sometimes known as Roger

      Roger Pierre appears to be a variant spelling of Roger Peter/Pierre, but there

      Since Henry Percy died in 1461 and any person named Roger Pierre who might be

      Step 1: Determine when Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland died.

      - Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland lived in the 15th century.

      - He died on May 29, 1461, during the Wars of the Roses at the Battle of Towton.


      Step 2: Determine when Roger Pierre died.

      - There isn''t a well-known historical figure named Roger Pierre.

      - There was a famous American actor named Roger Pierre (sometimes spelled Roger
      Perry), who lived in the 20th century.

      - If referring to the actor, he would have died in the modern era, centuries
      after the 15th century.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      - Henry Percy died in 1461.

      - Any modern figure named Roger Pierre would have died in the 20th or 21st century,
      which is much later than 1461.


      Step 4: Conclusion.

      - Since Henry Percy died in 1461 and Roger Pierre (assuming a modern figure)
      would have died centuries later, Henry Percy died at an earlier date.

      Step 1: Identify when Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland died.

      Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, was an English nobleman who lived during
      the Wars of the Roses. He died on May 29, 1461, at the Battle of Towton.


      Step 2: Identify when Roger Pierre died.

      Step 2: Identify when Roger Pierre died.

      Roger Pierre appears to be a less well-documented historical figure. However,

      May 29, 1461, during the Wars of the Roses. He was killed at the Battle of Towton.


      Step 2: Identify when Roger Pierre died.

      Roger Pierre appears to be a variant spelling or reference to Roger Pierre Choquette,
      an actor and entertainer who died in 2010. If this is referring to a different
      Roger Pierre, he would still be a modern figure from the 20th century at earliest.

      Roger Pierre died in the 21st century (or possibly late 20th century if referring

      Since Henry Percy died in 1461 and Roger Pierre died in 2010 (or later if referring

      Step 2: Identify when Roger Pierre died.

      This is more challenging because "Roger Pierre" isn''t a widely recognized historical
      figure like the Earl of Northumberland. The most well-known Pierre in entertainment
      was actor/comedian Jamie Pierre (died 2011) and actor Robert Pierre (still living
      as far as I know). If this refers to a different Roger Pierre, he would almost
      certainly have lived and died after the 15th century, as records from that era
      are well documented for notable individuals.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Henry Percy died in 1461. Any modern figure named Roger Pierre would have died

      for Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland and Roger Pierre, then compare them.


      Step 1: Identify when Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland died.

      Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, was an English nobleman who lived during
      the Wars of the Roses. He died on May 29, 1461, at the Battle of Towton.


      Step 2: Identify when Roger Pierre died.

      This is more challenging because "Roger Pierre" isn''t a widely recognized historical
      figure in the same way as the Earl of Northumberland. The most well-known Pierre
      in entertainment was Jamie Pierre (a skier) and Jean-Pierre Roger (a French
      footballer), but not a singular famous "Roger Pierre." The closest notable figure
      might be the American actor Robert (Bob) Pierre, but without clear historical
      documentation of a Roger Pierre, I must assume he either lived after the 15th
      century or is a less documented figure.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Given that Henry Percy died in 1461, and Roger Pierre (assuming he was a real
      person) would almost certainly have lived in more modern times (likely 19th-20th
      century or later), Henry Percy would have died at an earlier date.


      NO - Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland did not die at an earlier date
      than Roger Pierre. Rather, he died at a later date than Roger Pierre.


      Wait, I made an error in my conclusion. Let me correct this:


      YES - Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland did die at an earlier date than
      Roger Pierre (assuming Roger Pierre was a real historical figure who lived after
      the 15th century).'

      May 29, 1461, during the Wars of the Roses at the Battle of Towton.


      Step 2: Identify when Roger Pierre died.

      This is more challenging because there are multiple possibilities for who "Roger

      (sometimes spelled Pierre), he died in 2010. If referring to another Roger Pierre,
      I would need more specific information.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Henry Percy died in 1461, while Roger Pierre (assuming the actor) died in 2010.


      Step 4: Determine which death occurred earlier.

      1461 is earlier than 2010 by approximately 549 years.


      NO - Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland did not die at an earlier date

      die at an earlier date than Roger Pierre?" means "Did Henry Percy die before
      Roger Pierre?" Since 1461 is before 2010, the correct answer is:


      YES - Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland did die at an earlier date than
      Roger Pierre.'

      if Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland died earlier than Roger Pierre.


      Step 1: Identify when Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland died.

      Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, was a 15th century English nobleman
      who died on May 29, 1461, at the Battle of Towton during the Wars of the Roses.


      Step 2: Identify when Roger Pierre died.

      This is trickier because there isn''t a single famous historical figure clearly
      identified as "Roger Pierre." The closest well-known figure might be Pierre
      Roger (who became Pope Clement VI and died in 1352) or possibly the American
      actor Jamie Farr (born Roger Pierre Farr) who was born in 1934, or perhaps the
      American actor/comedian Robert "Bob" Pierre (1923-2006).


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      If referring to Pierre Roger (Pope Clement VI), he died in 1352, which is earlier
      than 1461.

      If referring to a modern Roger Pierre (like the actor), they would have died
      in the 20th or 21st century, which is much later than 1461.


      Step 4: Determine the answer.

      Since any modern Roger Pierre would have died centuries after 1461, and the
      historical Pierre Roger died in 1352 (before 1461), the answer depends on which
      Roger Pierre is meant. However, in either interpretation, Henry Percy did NOT
      die at an earlier date than Roger Pierre.

      May 29, 1461, during the Wars of the Roses at the Battle of Towton.

      This is more challenging because "Roger Pierre" isn''t a widely recognized historical

      in entertainment was comedian and actor Jamie Pierre (not Roger). There was
      a French actor named Jean-Pierre Roger, but not a notable historical figure
      named "Roger Pierre" with a well-documented death date.


      Step 3: Make a determination based on available information.

      Since Roger Pierre appears to be either a contemporary figure or not a major
      historical figure with a widely documented death date, it''s reasonable to conclude
      that he would have died much later than the 15th century (when Henry Percy died).


      NO - Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland did not die at an earlier date

      First, I need to identify when each person died:


      1) Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland:

      - He was an English nobleman who lived during the Wars of the Roses

      - He died on May 29, 1461, at the Battle of Towton


      2) Roger Pierre:

      - Roger Pierre appears to be a more modern figure

      - Based on my knowledge, there is a notable American actor named Roger Pierre
      (sometimes spelled Roger Perry) who died in 2018


      Comparing these dates:

      - Henry Percy died in 1461

      - Roger Pierre died in 2018


      Since 1461 comes before 2018 (a difference of over 550 years), Henry Percy died
      at an earlier date than Roger Pierre.


      NO, Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland did not die at a later date than

      Wait, I need to be careful about the exact wording of the question. The question
      asks if Henry Percy died at an EARLIER date than Roger Pierre.

      Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, was a prominent English nobleman who

      Towton during the Wars of the Roses.


      Step 2: Identify when Roger Pierre died.

      This is where I need to be careful. There is no well-known historical figure
      named "Roger Pierre" who would be comparable to an Earl of Northumberland. There
      was a famous American actor named Pierre Raymond (stage name Roger Pierre) who
      was a French comedian and actor who lived in the 20th century (1923-2010).

      Step 2: Identify when Roger Pierre died.

      Roger Pierre appears to be a less well-known historical figure. However, based

      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Henry Percy died in 1461, which is over 500 years ago. Even if Roger Pierre
      was a figure from the 18th, 19th, or 20th century, he would have died after

      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Since Henry Percy died in 1461, and any historical or modern figure named Roger

      Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, was an English nobleman who lived during
      the Wars of the Roses. He died on May 29, 1461, at the Battle of Towton.


      Step 2: Identify when Roger Pierre died.

      This is more challenging as "Roger Pierre" isn''t a widely recognized historical
      figure. The most similar well-known name would be Pierre Roger (who became Pope
      Clement VI and died in 1352) or perhaps actor/comedian Jamie Farr''s birth name
      (Roger Pierre), who was born in 1934. If referring to the actor Jamie Farr (Roger
      Pierre), he is still alive as of my last update.


      If referring to a different Roger Pierre, I don''t have specific information
      about this person''s death date.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Henry Percy died in 1461. If referring to any modern Roger Pierre who lived
      in the 20th or 21st century, then Henry Percy would have died earlier.


      NO - Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland did not die at an earlier date
      than Roger Pierre (assuming Roger Pierre refers to a modern individual). Henry
      Percy died in 1461, which is earlier than any modern person named Roger Pierre

      Step 2: Identify when Roger Pierre died.

      There''s a potential confusion here. If we''re referring to the American actor
      and comedian Pierre Raymond, better known as Jamie Farr, he was born in 1934
      and is still alive. If we''re referring to the actor/comedian Roger Pierre (a
      French entertainer), he lived from 1923 to 2010.

      Step 2: Identify when Roger Pierre died.

      This is more challenging because "Roger Pierre" could refer to different people.
      The most notable person with a similar name would be Roger Pierre Dumas, a Canadian
      actor, or possibly a confusion with American entertainer Robert "Bob" Pierre,
      who died in 2021. However, there is no widely known historical figure precisely
      named "Roger Pierre" with significant historical documentation.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Since Henry Percy died in 1461, and any person named "Roger Pierre" would almost
      certainly have lived in the modern era (19th-21st centuries), Henry Percy would
      have died at an earlier date.


      NO - Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland did not die at an earlier date
      than Roger Pierre. Rather, he died at a much later date, as Roger Pierre (assuming
      this refers to any modern person by this name) would have lived and died centuries
      after the 15th century.


      Wait, I need to correct myself. I reversed my answer. The correct answer is:

      1578 to August 20, 1639.


      Step 2: Find Peter Paul Morandell''s death date.

      Peter Paul Morandell was an Austrian painter who lived from 1901 to 1976.


      Step 3: Compare the death dates.

      Jacob Bidermann died in 1639.

      Peter Paul Morandell died in 1976.


      Step 4: Determine which date is earlier.

      1639 is earlier than 1976 (by about 337 years).


      Therefore, Jacob Bidermann died at an earlier date than Peter Paul Morandell.


      NO


      Wait, I made a mistake in my final answer. The question asks if Bidermann died
      at an earlier date than Morandell, and since 1639 is indeed earlier than 1976,
      the correct answer is:
