      of death for both individuals.


      1. **Gao Huaide**: He was a Chinese general during the Five Dynasties and Ten
      Kingdoms period and the early Song dynasty. Gao Huaide died in the year 982.


      2. **Pieter Coecke van Aelst**: He was a Flemish painter, sculptor, and architect
      of the Northern Renaissance. Pieter Coecke van Aelst died in the year 1550.


      Now, we compare the two dates:

      - Gao Huaide died in 982.

      - Pieter Coecke van Aelst died in 1550.


      Since 982 is earlier than 1550, Gao Huaide died at an earlier date than Pieter
      Coecke van Aelst.

      2. **Friedrich Balduin von Gagern**: He was a German officer and politician.
      Friedrich Balduin von Gagern died on April 20, 1848.


      Now, we compare the two dates:


      - Franciscus Titelmans died in 1537.

      - Friedrich Balduin von Gagern died in 1848.


      Since 1537 is earlier than 1848, Franciscus Titelmans indeed died at an earlier
      date than Friedrich Balduin von Gagern.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'
