    1ee0d047-a089-495a-965d-372c1f0339ff: 'Let me break this down step by step:


      1. First, I''ll find the publication date for Tamsin by Peter S. Beagle:

      - Tamsin was published in 1999


      2. Next, I''ll find the publication date for Torch of Freedom by Eric Flint:

      - Torch of Freedom was published in 2009


      3. Compare the publication dates:

      - 1999 is earlier than 2009


      4. Therefore, Tamsin was indeed released earlier than Torch of Freedom.
