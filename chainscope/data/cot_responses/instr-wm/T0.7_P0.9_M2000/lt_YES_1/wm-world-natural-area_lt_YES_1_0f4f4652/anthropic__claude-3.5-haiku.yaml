      1. First, I need to find the areas of both Honey Lake and Bueng Boraphet.


      2. Honey Lake:

      - Located in California, United States

      - Area is approximately 107 square miles (277 square kilometers)


      3. Bueng Boraphet:

      - Located in Nakhon Sawan Province, Thailand

      - Area is approximately 132 square kilometers


      4. Comparing the areas:

      - Honey Lake: 277 square kilometers

      - Bueng Boraphet: 132 square kilometers


      5. 277 is larger than 132, so Honey Lake is LARGER than Bueng Boraphet.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO, Honey Lake does NOT have a smaller area than Bueng
      Boraphet.'

      1. First, I''ll locate information about Lake Iguaque:

      - Lake Iguaque is located in Colombia

      - It is a small lake in the Iguaque Wildlife Sanctuary

      - Its area is relatively small, approximately 0.5 square kilometers


      2. Next, I''ll find information about Licancabur Lake:

      - Licancabur Lake is located on the border of Chile and Bolivia

      - It is situated in a volcanic crater at high altitude

      - Its area is approximately 0.1 square kilometers


      3. Comparing the areas:

      - Lake Iguaque: ~0.5 sq km

      - Licancabur Lake: ~0.1 sq km


      4. Conclusion:

      Lake Iguaque is larger than Licancabur Lake.

      - Lake Oscawana: 0.22 sq km

      - Lake of Banyoles: 1.7 sq km

      - 0.22 is smaller than 1.7


      5. Therefore, Lake Oscawana does have a smaller area than Lake of Banyoles.

      - Heaven Lake is located on the border between China and North Korea

      - It is situated in the crater of a volcano called Baekdu Mountain

      - It is a high-altitude lake in a mountainous region


      2. Let''s find the area of Heaven Lake:

      - Heaven Lake covers approximately 9.82 square kilometers (about 3.79 square
      miles)


      3. Now, let''s look at White Bear Lake in Minnesota:

      - White Bear Lake is located in Minnesota, United States

      - Its area is approximately 4.24 square kilometers (about 1.64 square miles)


      4. Comparing the areas:

      - Heaven Lake: 9.82 sq km

      - White Bear Lake: 4.24 sq km


      5. Comparing the sizes:

      - Heaven Lake is larger than White Bear Lake


      Therefore, the answer is: NO, Heaven Lake does not have a smaller area than
      White Bear Lake.'

      1. First, I''ll need to locate information about Lake Phalen and Lake Windigo.


      2. Lake Phalen is located in St. Paul, Minnesota, USA. It is a relatively small
      urban lake.


      3. Lake Windigo is located in Minnesota as well, specifically in the Boundary
      Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.


      4. I''ll need to find the area of each lake to compare them.


      5. Lake Phalen is approximately 196 acres in size.


      6. Lake Windigo is approximately 1,679 acres in size.


      7. Comparing these areas: 196 acres (Phalen) is much smaller than 1,679 acres
      (Windigo).


      Therefore, the answer is: YES, Lake Phalen has a smaller area than Lake Windigo.'

      - Lonar Lake: 1.8 sq km

      - Lake Haruna: 0.8 sq km


      4. Determining the answer:

      - Lonar Lake is larger than Lake Haruna

      - Therefore, Lonar Lake does NOT have a smaller area than Lake Haruna


      The answer is: NO'
