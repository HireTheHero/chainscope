      1. First, let me recall what these places are:

      - Laguna de Leche is a lake in Cuba

      - Runn (or Rann of Kutch) is a seasonal salt marsh in India/Pakistan


      2. Let me find their areas:

      - Laguna de Leche has an area of about 67 square kilometers

      - The Runn of Kutch covers approximately 30,000 square kilometers


      3. Compare the numbers:

      67 sq km < 30,000 sq km


      4. Since Laguna de Leche''s area (67 sq km) is much smaller than Runn''s area
      (30,000 sq km), the answer is clear.


      YES'
