      * **Step 2: Identify Lake Piva.** Lake Piva is an artificial lake in Montenegro.

      * **Step 3: Determine relevant size comparison.**  Since Connecticut Lakes refers
      to a group, we need to determine if the *total area* of Connecticut Lakes is
      smaller than Lake Piva, or if the largest lake (First Connecticut Lake) is being

      it''s clear that Lake Piva, being a large reservoir, is likely to be substantial.

      smaller than bays which are open to the sea.

      '
    fa94c089-5bff-4d23-a8aa-3f6ab2202b9c: '1. **Identify the nature of each location:**
      Coral Bay is a bay, meaning a coastal inlet. Lac de Chalain is a lake.

      2. **Consider the typical size difference:** Lakes are generally inland bodies
      of water with a defined surface area. Bays are open to the sea and don''t have
      a clearly defined area in the same way.  It''s difficult to compare their sizes
      directly.

      3. **Focus on what can be compared:** While the *opening* of a bay might be
      smaller than a lake, the bay itself connects to the vast ocean. Thus, trying
      to compare the total area influenced by a bay to a lake is not a meaningful
      comparison.


      Therefore, a direct area comparison is not possible, making the question flawed.
      However, if we interpret "area" to mean the immediately visible surface area,
      then it''s likely that Coral Bay''s *visible* area is smaller than Lac de Chalain''s.


      **Answer: YES (with the caveat explained above)**

      * **Step 3:** I need to compare the two areas.


      Bakhtegan Lake has a surface area that fluctuates, but it is generally around
      3,000-4,000 square kilometers. Lake Peipus has a surface area of 3,555 square
      kilometers. Therefore, depending on the current water level in Bakhtegan Lake,
      it could be smaller or larger.


      So, sometimes YES, sometimes NO. Since the question requires a YES/NO answer,
      and the answer is not consistently one or the other, I will choose the most
      likely answer. Since Bakhtegan is *usually* smaller, I will answer:


      YES

      Alice Lake is approximately 12 acres. Knoll Lake is approximately 74 acres.


      Therefore, Alice Lake *is* smaller than Knoll Lake.

      Lake in Minneapolis is often what comes up, so specifying "New York" is important.  Cedar
      Lake in New York appears to have a surface area of approximately 187 acres (sources

      mile, so 187 acres is about 0.29 square miles.

      and Lake Pinatubo is about 0.17 square miles.

      search shows Lake Volta has a surface area of approximately 8,502 sq km (can
      vary depending on water levels).


      2. **Find the area of Madura Strait:**  Madura Strait is more challenging.  Area
      isn''t typically given for straits, as they are a passage of water.  We are
      interested in surface area.  It is located between the islands of Java and Madura
      in Indonesia.  It''s a relatively narrow strait.  Estimating the area would
      require length and average width, which is difficult to find precisely and not
      necessary given the large difference in size compared to Lake Volta.  It''s
      safe to assume the area is much smaller than a large lake.


      3. **Compare the areas:** Even with a rough estimate, it''s highly unlikely
      the Madura Strait has a surface area anywhere close to 8,502 sq km.
