      of these places refers to and their respective sizes:


      1. **Coral Bay, Cyprus**: Coral Bay is primarily known as a beach and a popular
      tourist destination located on the western coast of Cyprus, near the town of
      Paphos. It is not typically defined by a geographic area like a lake or a city,
      but rather by its coastal stretch and surrounding region known for its sandy
      beaches.


      2. **Lac de Chalain, France**: Lac de Chalain is a natural lake located in the

      surface area.


      Now, considering the nature of these two places:

      - Coral Bay is a beach area, and its "area" is not typically defined in the
      same way a lake''s area is.

      - Lac de Chalain has a specific, measurable area as a lake.


      Given these considerations, Coral Bay does not have a defined area comparable
      to lakes or landmasses in the traditional sense. Comparing the two directly
      in terms of size is not straightforward, as one is a geographic feature and
      the other is a beach that might refer to a general region.


      Therefore, the question is somewhat ambiguous without clear definitions of what
      constitutes Coral Bay''s "area." However, if we assume the interest is purely
      in measuring a defined geographic feature''s area, Lac de Chalain, being a lake
      with a measurable area, is more substantial in this context.


      Thus, based on traditional geographic definitions and measurements, the answer
      leans towards:


      **NO**, Coral Bay, Cyprus does not have a smaller area than Lac de Chalain,

      the sizes of Mistastin Crater and Lake Como:


      1. **Mistastin Crater**: Located in Labrador, Canada, Mistastin Crater is an
      impact crater. Its diameter is approximately 28 kilometers (17 miles), but the
      lake that fills part of the crater, known as Mistastin Lake, is roughly 16 kilometers
      in diameter at its widest point.


      2. **Lake Como**: Lake Como is located in Italy and is one of the largest lakes
      in the country. It has a surface area of about 146 square kilometers (56 square
      miles).


      Now, we compare these areas:


      - The area of Mistastin Lake, which is approximately circular with a diameter
      of 16 kilometers, can be estimated using the formula for the area of a circle,
      \( A = \pi r^2 \), where \( r \) is the radius (half of the diameter). This
      results in an area of roughly 201 square kilometers for the entire crater, but
      the lake itself is smaller.


      - Lake Como has a clearly defined surface area of 146 square kilometers.


      Based on these comparisons, Mistastin Lake itself is smaller than Lake Como,
      but the entire Mistastin Crater (considering its maximum potential extent) could
      be larger, depending on interpretation. However, the question seems to focus
      on the lake, not the entire crater including its surrounding area.


      Given that Lake Como''s defined lake area is larger than that of Mistastin Lake,

      **Alice Lake (Sawtooth Wilderness):**

      - Alice Lake is a popular alpine lake located in the Sawtooth Wilderness of
      central Idaho.

      - It is known for its scenic beauty and is a common destination for hikers.


      **Knoll Lake:**

      - Knoll Lake is situated in the Coconino National Forest in Arizona.

      - It is a popular fishing and recreational lake.


      **Area Comparison:**

      - Alice Lake is a relatively small alpine lake, typical of high mountain regions.

      - Knoll Lake, while also not particularly large, is generally considered to
      have a greater surface area than many alpine lakes.


      In general, alpine lakes like Alice Lake tend to be smaller than recreational
      lakes like Knoll Lake, which are more accessible and have been developed for
      outdoor activities.

      1. **Identify the Area of Chip Lake**: Chip Lake is located in Alberta, Canada.
      It has an approximate area of about 73 square kilometers (28 square miles).


      2. **Identify the Area of Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes**: The Pemadumcook Chain
      of Lakes in Maine includes several connected lakes, with the most significant
      being Pemadumcook Lake itself. The entire chain, including Pemadumcook Lake,
      Ambajejus Lake, and others, covers a significantly larger area, with Pemadumcook
      Lake alone being over 60 square kilometers (23 square miles).


      3. **Comparison**: The Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes, as a whole, is larger than
      Chip Lake. Even focusing on Pemadumcook Lake alone, the area is comparable to
      or larger than Chip Lake, but when considering the entire chain, it is certainly
      larger.

      of the largest artificial lakes in the world by surface area. The lake covers
      an area of approximately 8,502 square kilometers.


      2. **Madura Strait**: The Madura Strait is a strait in Indonesia that separates
      the island of Java from the island of Madura. The size of a strait is typically
      not measured in terms of area like a lake, as it is a body of water connecting
      two larger bodies. Instead, a strait''s size might be considered in terms of
      its length and width. However, for the purpose of comparison, the Madura Strait
      would not have a defined ''area'' like a lake would.


      Considering that Lake Volta is a large, well-defined body of water with a measurable
      surface area, while the Madura Strait is a strait without a comparable surface
      area measurement, it is reasonable to conclude that Lake Volta, with its significant
      surface area, does not have a smaller area than the Madura Strait.
