      We need the addresses or coordinates of both the Church of Sts. Cyril & Methodius
      and St. Raphael and the Imperial Theatre.

      2. **Compare latitudes:** Once we have the locations, we specifically need to
      compare their latitudes.  A lower latitude means further south.

      3. **Determine if the church''s latitude is lower than the theatre''s:** If
      the church''s latitude is lower, then it is south of the theatre.


      Now, performing those steps using online search:


      * Church of Sts. Cyril & Methodius and St. Raphael is in Manhattan, New York
      City.

      * Imperial Theatre is also in Manhattan, New York City.

      * The Church is around 502 West 50th Street.

      * The Imperial Theatre is at 249 West 45th Street.


      Since 50th Street is further north than 45th Street in Manhattan''s grid system,
      the church is north of the theatre.

      5. Therefore, the question of whether Farmington Civic Theatre is *south* of
      Fourmile Lake depends solely on their relative latitudes.  Since Michigan is
      generally north of Oregon, it''s unlikely, but still possible.  I would need
      to check the actual latitudes.


      Without specific coordinates, I can''t definitively answer. However, given the
      general locations of Michigan and Oregon, it is highly probable the answer is
      NO.  I''ll go with **NO** based on this strong likelihood but acknowledge it
