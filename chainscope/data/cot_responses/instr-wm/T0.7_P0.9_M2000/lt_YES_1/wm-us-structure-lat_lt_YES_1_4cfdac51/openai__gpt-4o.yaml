      1. **Identify the location of Sahuarita Lake, AZ**: Sahuarita Lake is located
      in Sahuarita, Arizona, which is situated south of Tucson, AZ. The approximate
      latitude of Sahuarita is about 31.9 degrees North.


      2. **Identify the location of Panther Creek Wind Farm, TX**: Panther Creek Wind
      Farm is located in West Texas, near the town of Sweetwater. The approximate
      latitude of Sweetwater, TX is about 32.5 degrees North.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Sahuarita, AZ (31.9 degrees North) is slightly
      south of Sweetwater, TX (32.5 degrees North).


      Based on this comparison, Sahuarita Lake, AZ is indeed located south of Panther
      Creek Wind Farm, TX.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'

      Next, let''s consider the relative positions of Charlotte and Hendersonville
      within North Carolina:


      - Charlotte is situated in the southwestern part of the state, relatively close
      to the South Carolina border.

      - Hendersonville is located to the west of Charlotte but more to the northwest
      when considering the overall state layout.


      Given these positions, Hendersonville is generally located to the west-northwest
      of Charlotte.


      Therefore, the North Carolina Blumenthal Performing Arts Center in Charlotte
      is indeed located to the south of the Kanuga Conference Center in Hendersonville.


      The answer is: **YES**.'

      1. **Wayfarers Chapel Location**: Wayfarers Chapel is located in Rancho Palos
      Verdes, California.

      2. **Calvary Church of Santa Ana Location**: Calvary Church is located in Santa
      Ana, California.


      Next, we determine the relative positions of Rancho Palos Verdes and Santa Ana:


      - Rancho Palos Verdes is situated in the South Bay area of Los Angeles County,
      along the coast.

      - Santa Ana is located in Orange County, which is generally southeast of Los
      Angeles County.


      Given these locations, Rancho Palos Verdes is north and slightly west of Santa

      Ohio is situated in the eastern part of the United States.


      2. **Dillon Reservoir, CO**: This reservoir is located in Colorado. Colorado
      is situated in the western part of the United States.


      3. **Relative Latitude**: Ohio is generally located at a lower latitude than
      Colorado. Therefore, any specific location within Ohio is likely to be south
      of most locations within Colorado.


      Based on these geographical considerations, the Muskingum River Power Plant
      in Ohio is indeed located south of Dillon Reservoir in Colorado.

      Indiana, is located south of Cadle Tabernacle, we need to consider their respective
      locations within the city.


      1. **Identify the location of BMO Plaza**: BMO Plaza is a high-rise building
      located in downtown Indianapolis. Its address is 135 North Pennsylvania Street,
      Indianapolis, IN.


      2. **Identify the historical location of Cadle Tabernacle**: Cadle Tabernacle
      was a large church and auditorium once located at the intersection of New Jersey
      Street and Ohio Street, also in downtown Indianapolis.


      3. **Compare the relative positions**: BMO Plaza is located at North Pennsylvania
      Street, which is a few blocks west of the historical location of Cadle Tabernacle
      at New Jersey and Ohio Streets.


      Since BMO Plaza is located at 135 North Pennsylvania Street and Cadle Tabernacle
      was at Ohio Street, which is south of North streets, BMO Plaza is north of the
      historical location of Cadle Tabernacle.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.'

      Indiana, is located south of Cadle Tabernacle in Indianapolis, Indiana, we can
      follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the Location of BMO Plaza**: BMO Plaza is located at 135 North
      Pennsylvania Street in Indianapolis.


      2. **Identify the Location of Cadle Tabernacle**: Cadle Tabernacle was located
      at 240 North Delaware Street in Indianapolis. Note that the building no longer
      exists, but the location remains relevant for this question.


      3. **Compare the Locations**: Both addresses are in downtown Indianapolis. The
      key factor here is the street numbers: BMO Plaza is at 135 North Pennsylvania
      Street, while Cadle Tabernacle was at 240 North Delaware Street.


      4. **Determine the Relative Positions**: In the street numbering system of Indianapolis,
      as in many U.S. cities, higher numbers typically indicate a location further
      north when using north-south addresses. Therefore, 240 North Delaware Street
      is further north than 135 North Pennsylvania Street.


      Based on this reasoning, BMO Plaza is located south of where Cadle Tabernacle
      was.


      The answer is: **YES**.'

      - **Cottage Grove** is located south of Portland, in the Willamette Valley.


      Since Portland is north of Cottage Grove, it follows that the Mission Theater
      and Pub is north of the Charles E. Nelson House.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**, the Mission Theater and Pub is not located
      south of the Charles E. Nelson House.'

      2. **Identify the location of Canyon Lake**: Canyon Lake is located in the Texas
      Hill Country, primarily in Comal County, which is northeast of San Antonio and
      southwest of Austin.


      3. **Compare their latitudes**: Addicks Reservoir is in the greater Houston
      area, which is generally at a lower latitude compared to Canyon Lake, which
      is situated further north in the Texas Hill Country.


      From these points, we can conclude that Addicks Reservoir is indeed south of
      Canyon Lake, Texas.


      The answer is: YES.'
