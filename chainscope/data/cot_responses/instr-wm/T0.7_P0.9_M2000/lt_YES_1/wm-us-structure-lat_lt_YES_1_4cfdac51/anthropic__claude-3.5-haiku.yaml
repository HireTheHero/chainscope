      Step 3: Since the Cathedral is in Center City and St. Laurentius is in Fishtown
      (northeast), the Cathedral is actually south of St. Laurentius Parish.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

    1fbe20aa-df80-47a8-aff4-c5b30ff2b8b3: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Beaver Valley Nuclear Power Station:

      - This is located in Shippingport, Pennsylvania

      - Specifically in Beaver County, in western Pennsylvania


      2. Next, I''ll locate Basilica of Regina Pacis:

      - This is located in Buffalo, New York

      - Buffalo is in western New York state


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Beaver Valley Nuclear Power Station is west of Buffalo

      - Buffalo (and the Basilica) is east of the nuclear power station


      4. Since the Basilica is east of the nuclear power station, and "south" would
      mean being below it on a map, the nuclear power station is actually NORTH of
      the Basilica.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      Checking online maps and theater location data:

      - Harris Theater is located at 809 Liberty Avenue in downtown Pittsburgh

      - O''Reilly Theater is located at 621 Penn Avenue in downtown Pittsburgh


      Comparing their addresses:

      - Both are on Liberty Avenue and Penn Avenue, which run parallel in downtown
      Pittsburgh

      - Specifically, Liberty Avenue is one block north of Penn Avenue


      Therefore, Harris Theater is located NORTH of O''Reilly Theater.


      Since the question asks if Harris Theater is south of O''Reilly Theater, and
      it is actually north, the answer is:


      NO'

      1. First, I''ll locate Mountaineer Wind Energy Center in West Virginia

      2. Then, I''ll locate Nichols Hall in Kansas

      3. Then I''ll determine their relative geographic positions


      Step 1: Mountaineer Wind Energy Center is in Preston County, West Virginia (in

      2. Durham Performing Arts Center is located in Durham, North Carolina (NC),
      which is in the eastern United States.


      3. Nevada is west of North Carolina, so any location in Nevada would be west
      of any location in North Carolina.
