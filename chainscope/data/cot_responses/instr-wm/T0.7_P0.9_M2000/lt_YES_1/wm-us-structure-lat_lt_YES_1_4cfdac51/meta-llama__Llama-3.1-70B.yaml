      steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      structures. Sarasota Opera House is located in Sarasota, Florida, in the United
      States. Lake Casa Blanca is located in Laredo, Texas, also in the United States.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between Florida and Texas. Florida is located on the southeastern
      coast of the United States, while Texas is located in the southern central part
      of the country.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations within
      these states. Sarasota is located on the west coast of Florida, and Laredo is
      located in the southern part of Texas, near the Mexican border. Given that Florida
      is generally east and somewhat north of Texas, we can infer that Sarasota, Florida,
      is generally northeast of Laredo, Texas.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic relationship between Florida
      and Texas, and without needing the exact coordinates or a detailed map, we can
      conclude that Sarasota Opera House, FL, is indeed located northeast of Lake
      Casa Blanca, TX, given the state-level geographic relationship.

    0e563b68-2c0f-4393-b668-052bb683737b: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the All Saints'' Episcopal Church in Beverly Hills, California, and the Our
      Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral in Los Angeles, California. Both churches
      are located in California.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between Beverly Hills and Los Angeles. Beverly Hills is a city
      located within Los Angeles County, California. This means that Beverly Hills
      is generally located within the same general area as Los Angeles.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations within
      Beverly Hills and Los Angeles. The All Saints'' Episcopal Church is located
      in Beverly Hills, and the Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral is located
      in Los Angeles. Given that Beverly Hills is located within Los Angeles County,
      we can infer that any location in Beverly Hills is generally within the same
      geographic area as Los Angeles, assuming we''re comparing locations that are
      relatively close within these areas.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic relationship between Beverly
      Hills and Los Angeles, and without needing the exact coordinates or a detailed
      map, we can conclude that the All Saints'' Episcopal Church in Beverly Hills
      is indeed located within the same general area as the Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St.
      Peter Cathedral in Los Angeles. However, the specific question asks if the All
      Saints'' Episcopal Church is located **south** of the Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St.
      Peter Cathedral. This requires a more precise determination of their relative
      north-south positions within the Los Angeles metropolitan area.


      5. **Refining the Answer**: To determine if the All Saints'' Episcopal Church
      is specifically south of the Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral, we
      would need more precise information about their locations within Los Angeles.
      If they are both within the central part of Los Angeles or in relatively close
      proximity, the answer would likely be $\boxed{NO}$, as they would be within
      the same general area. However, if the churches are in different parts of Los
      Angeles, such as one being in the northern part and the other in the southern
      part, the answer could be $\boxed{YES}$, depending on their exact positions.


      Therefore, without more specific information about their locations within Los
      Angeles, the answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations within
      these states. Dworshak Dam is in Idaho, and Riffe Lake is in Washington. Given
      that Idaho is east of Washington, we can infer that any location in Idaho is
      generally east of any location in Washington, assuming we''re comparing locations
      that are relatively close to the state borders or not significantly displaced
      eastward or westward within their respective states.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic relationship between Idaho

      the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of San Diego
      Civic Theatre, CA, and Mountain Creek Lake, TX. San Diego Civic Theatre is located
      in California, and Mountain Creek Lake is located in Texas.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between California and Texas. California is located west of Texas.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations within
      these states. San Diego Civic Theatre is in California, and Mountain Creek Lake
      is in Texas. Given that California is west of Texas, we can infer that any location
      in California is generally west of any location in Texas, assuming we''re comparing
      locations that are relatively close to the state borders or not significantly
      displaced northward or southward within their respective states.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic relationship between California
      and Texas, and without needing the exact coordinates or a detailed map, we can
      conclude that San Diego Civic Theatre, CA, is indeed located west of Mountain
      Creek Lake, TX, given the state-level geographic relationship.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'

      Wright Patman Lake and Jim Chapman Lake. Both lakes are located in Texas, USA.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic

      located south of Toronto Lake, KS, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: Both Cheney Reservoir and Toronto Lake are located
      in Kansas. This means they are in the same state and relatively close to each
      other.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Kansas is a state in the central United
      States. It''s generally positioned north-south, with its southern border being
      the 37th parallel north.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Now, let''s consider the specific locations of Cheney
      Reservoir and Toronto Lake within Kansas. Without needing exact coordinates,
      we can assume that since they are both in the same state, they are likely not
      too far apart, and any significant north-south difference would be noticeable.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that both locations are in Kansas, and assuming they
      are relatively close to each other, there''s no significant north-south difference
      between them. Therefore, Cheney Reservoir, KS, is not located south of Toronto
      Lake, KS.


      The answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      2. **Determine General Positions**: New York City is laid out in a grid pattern,
      making it easier to determine relative positions. Both locations are in the
      same city, so we can focus on their specific locations within Manhattan.


      3. **Compare Specific Locations**: Times Square Church is located at 1657 Broadway,
      New York, NY 10019. Ziegfeld Theatre is located at 141 West 54th Street, New
      York, NY 10019.


      4. **Analyze Street Numbers**: In Manhattan, higher street numbers generally
      correspond to locations further north. Lower street numbers indicate locations
      further south.


      5. **Conclusion**: Comparing the street numbers, Times Square Church has a higher
      street number (1657 Broadway) than Ziegfeld Theatre (141 West 54th Street).
      This indicates that Times Square Church is located north of Ziegfeld Theatre,
      not south.


      The final answer is: **NO**'

      1. **Identify Locations**: Guist Creek Lake is in Kentucky, and Camanche Reservoir
      is in California.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Kentucky is located in the eastern
      part of the United States, while California is in the western part. This means
      that Kentucky is generally east of California.


      3. **Consider North-South Alignment**: The question asks if Guist Creek Lake,

      south of Hawke Castle, CA, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Stockton Lake, MO, and Hawke Castle, CA. Stockton Lake is located in Missouri,
      and Hawke Castle is located in California.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between Missouri and California. Missouri is located in the central
      United States, while California is located on the west coast.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations within
      these states. Stockton Lake is in Missouri, and Hawke Castle is in California.
      Given that Missouri is located significantly east of California, we can infer
      that any location in Missouri is generally east of any location in California,
      assuming we''re comparing locations that are not significantly displaced northward
      or southward within their respective states.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic relationship between Missouri
      and California, and without needing the exact coordinates or a detailed map,
      we can conclude that Stockton Lake, MO, is not located south of Hawke Castle,

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      structures. The Basilica of Saints Cyril and Methodius is located in Danville,
      Pennsylvania, and Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is also located in Pennsylvania.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic

      Both are within the state of Pennsylvania.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations within
      Pennsylvania. The Basilica of Saints Cyril and Methodius is located in Danville,
      which is in the northeastern part of the state. Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir
      is located in the central part of Pennsylvania.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Given that both locations are within the same state,
      we can compare their relative positions. Danville, where the Basilica is located,
      is in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania. The central part of Pennsylvania,

      the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Boulder
      City Hospital, NV, and Durham Performing Arts Center, NC. Boulder City Hospital
      is located in Boulder City, Nevada, and Durham Performing Arts Center is located
      in Durham, North Carolina.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between Nevada and North Carolina. Nevada is located in the western
      part of the United States, and North Carolina is located in the southeastern
      part of the United States.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations within
      these states. Boulder City, Nevada, is located in the southeastern part of the
      state, while Durham, North Carolina, is located in the central part of the state.
      Given that Nevada is to the west of North Carolina, we can infer that any location
      in Nevada is generally west of any location in North Carolina.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic relationship between Nevada
      and North Carolina, and without needing the exact coordinates or a detailed
      map, we can conclude that Boulder City Hospital, NV, is not located south of
      Durham Performing Arts Center, NC. Instead, Boulder City Hospital, NV, is located
      to the west of Durham Performing Arts Center, NC.

    116559e8-7f1b-4498-a1fa-1fadb5d19022: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Town
      Hall Seattle, WA, and Banks Lake, WA. Town Hall Seattle is located in Seattle,
      Washington, which is in the western part of the state. Banks Lake is located
      in eastern Washington, near the town of Coulee City.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between Seattle and eastern Washington. Seattle is located in the
      western part of Washington, while Banks Lake is located in the eastern part
      of the state.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations within
      these regions. Town Hall Seattle is in Seattle, which is in the western part
      of Washington. Banks Lake is in eastern Washington, which is to the east of
      Seattle.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic relationship between the
      western and eastern parts of Washington, and without needing the exact coordinates
      or a detailed map, we can conclude that Town Hall Seattle, WA, is not located
      south of Banks Lake, WA, given the state-level geographic relationship.

      Flagstaff Lake is located in Maine.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between Minnesota and Maine. Minnesota is located in the Midwestern
      United States, and Maine is located in the northeastern part of the country.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations within
      these states. Lac qui Parle is in Minnesota, and Flagstaff Lake is in Maine.
      Given that Minnesota is generally west and south of Maine, we can infer that
      any location in Minnesota is generally south of any location in Maine, assuming
      we''re comparing locations that are relatively close to the state borders or

      Church in Nashville, TN is located south of the Tennessee Performing Arts Center,

      1. **Identify Locations**: Both the Downtown Presbyterian Church and the Tennessee
      Performing Arts Center are in Nashville, Tennessee. This means they are in the
      same city and state, making the comparison simpler.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Nashville is laid out in a grid pattern
      with streets running north-south and avenues running east-west. This helps in
      understanding the relative positions of locations within the city.


      3. **Compare Positions**: To determine if the church is south of the performing
      arts center, we need to establish if the church is on a street or avenue that
      is south of the street or avenue where the performing arts center is located.
      This can be done by looking at a map of Nashville or by checking the addresses
      of both locations.


      4. **Conclusion**: Without needing the exact coordinates or a detailed map,
      we can infer from the general layout of Nashville and the relative positions
      of locations within the city that the Downtown Presbyterian Church is indeed
      located south of the Tennessee Performing Arts Center.

      while Carson Mansion is located in Eureka, California.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two locations. Trinity Dam is in Trinity County,
      which is in the north-central part of California. Eureka, where Carson Mansion
      is located, is in Humboldt County, which is in the northwestern part of the
      state.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations within
      these regions. Trinity Dam is in the northern part of Trinity County, and Carson
      Mansion is in Eureka, which is in the southern part of Humboldt County. Given
      the general layout of California, we can infer that any location in the north-central
      part of the state (like Trinity Dam) is generally north of any location in the
      northwestern part of the state (like Carson Mansion), assuming they are not
