      - Pat Mayse Lake is in Texas (TX)


      2) Let''s consider their geographic positions:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Texas is in the southern part of the United States

      - Pat Mayse Lake is in northeastern Texas

      - Southern California is in the southern part of California


      3) When comparing north-south positions:

      - Southern California is roughly at the same latitude as central/southern Texas

      - Pat Mayse Lake, being in northeastern Texas, is actually slightly further
      north than Southern California


      4) Therefore, Sarang Community Church of Southern California would be slightly
      NORTH of Pat Mayse Lake, not south of it.

      4) Therefore, a church in Michigan would be NORTH of a church in Massachusetts,
      not south of it.

      1) Times Square Church is located at 237 West 51st Street, New York, NY.


      2) The historic Ziegfeld Theatre (1927) was located at 1341 Sixth Avenue (between
      54th and 55th Streets), New York, NY.


      3) In Manhattan''s grid system, street numbers increase as you go north.


      4) Since Times Square Church is on 51st Street and the Ziegfeld Theatre was
      between 54th and 55th Streets...


      5) Therefore, Times Square Church is located south of where the Ziegfeld Theatre
      was.

      1) First, let me locate Times Square Church

      - Times Square Church is located at 237 West 51st Street, New York


      2) Next, let me locate the historic Ziegfeld Theatre (1927)

      - The original Ziegfeld Theatre (1927) was located at 1341 Sixth Avenue at 54th
      Street

      - Note: This is not to be confused with the later Ziegfeld Theatre that closed
      in 2016


      3) Now, let''s compare their locations:

      - Times Square Church is on 51st Street

      - Ziegfeld Theatre was on 54th Street

      - In Manhattan, street numbers increase as you go north

      - Therefore, 51st Street is south of 54th Street


      4) Conclusion:

      Since Times Square Church is on 51st Street, which is south of 54th Street where
      the Ziegfeld Theatre was located, Times Square Church is south of the Ziegfeld
      Theatre''s location.

    a9609137-dcbe-4b19-9e8c-c6a08b5d187d: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me locate Cutts-Madison House, DC

      - Cutts-Madison House is located at 1515 Madison Place NW, Washington, DC

      - This puts it near Lafayette Square, across from the White House


      2. Next, let me locate St. Aloysius Church in DC

      - St. Aloysius Church is located at 19 I Street NW, Washington, DC

      - This puts it near Gonzaga College High School in the NoMa neighborhood


      3. Now, let me compare their positions

      - Cutts-Madison House is near Lafayette Square in downtown DC

      - St. Aloysius Church is several blocks north of downtown

      - Therefore, Cutts-Madison House is SOUTH of St. Aloysius Church

      1. Let me find the location of Cutts-Madison House:

      - Cutts-Madison House is located at 721 Madison Place NW, Washington, DC

      - This puts it on Lafayette Square, across from the White House


      2. Let me find the location of St. Aloysius Church:

      - St. Aloysius Church is located at 19 I Street NW, Washington, DC

      - This puts it near North Capitol Street and I Street


      3. Comparing their positions:

      - Cutts-Madison House is near the White House (around H Street)

      - St. Aloysius Church is on I Street

      - On the lettered streets in DC, I Street is north of H Street

      - Therefore, Cutts-Madison House is south of St. Aloysius Church

      - St. Aloysius Church is near North Capitol Street and I Street


      3. Comparing their positions:

      - St. Aloysius Church is in the NoMa (North of Massachusetts Avenue) area

      - Cutts-Madison House is in the downtown area, south of NoMa


      Therefore: NO, Cutts-Madison House is not located south of St. Aloysius Church.
      It''s actually located southwest of it.

      2) Let me find their specific locations:

      - Sparks Shot Tower is located at Front and Carpenter Streets in South Philadelphia

      - Suzanne Roberts Theatre is located at 480 South Broad Street in Center City
      Philadelphia


      3) Comparing their positions:

      - Sparks Shot Tower is in the southern part of Philadelphia (South Philadelphia)

      - Suzanne Roberts Theatre is in Center City, which is north of South Philadelphia


      4) Therefore, Sparks Shot Tower is located further south than Suzanne Roberts
      Theatre

      - Addicks Reservoir is located in Harris County, near Houston in southeast Texas

      - Canyon Lake is located in Comal County, between Austin and San Antonio in
