      - It''s an island in eastern Greenland

      - Its main settlement is Tasiilaq

      - Tasiilaq has around 2,000 inhabitants, and it''s the main population center
      on the island

      - The island has a few other small settlements


      3. Comparing:

      - Garfield County has approximately 2,000 people

      - Ammassalik Island, with Tasiilaq and other settlements combined, has over
      2,000 people


      4. Therefore, Ammassalik Island has a larger population than Garfield County


      Answer: YES (Garfield County is less populous than Ammassalik Island)'
