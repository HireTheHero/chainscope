      It is located in the Chikkamagaluru district.


      2. **Population of Vanavasi**: As of the 2011 census, the population of Vanavasi
      was approximately 2,000 people.


      3. **Identify Maardis**: Maardis is a village in the state of Maharashtra, India.
      It is located in the Jalna district.


      4. **Population of Maardis**: As of the 2011 census, the population of Maardis
      was approximately 3,000 people.


      5. **Comparison**: To determine if Vanavasi is less populous than Maardis, we
      compare their populations. Vanavasi has approximately 2,000 people, while Maardis
      has about 3,000 people.

      4. **Population of Cold Ash**: The population of Cold Ash, as of the last available
      data, is approximately 4,000 people.


      5. **Comparison**: To determine if Villar Perosa is less populous than Cold
      Ash, we compare their populations. Villar Perosa has approximately 4,100 people,
      while Cold Ash has approximately 4,000 people.


      Based on these steps, since 4,100 (Villar Perosa''s population) is greater than

      a series of steps:


      1. **Identify the Places**: First, we need to identify Zenica and Hardin County,
      Kentucky. Zenica is a city in Bosnia and Herzegovina, while Hardin County is
      a county located in the U.S. state of Kentucky.


      2. **Population Data**: To compare the population of Zenica and Hardin County,
      we need the most recent population data. As of my last update, Zenica had a
      population of around 115,000 people (this figure might vary slightly depending
      on the source and the year of the census or estimate). For Hardin County, the
      population is around 110,000 people (again, this might vary slightly).


      3. **Comparison**: Once we have the population figures for both places, we can
      compare them directly to determine which one is more populous.


      Given the steps above and the population figures provided, it''s clear that
      Zenica has a slightly larger population than Hardin County, Kentucky.


      The answer is: **NO**'

      a series of steps:


      1. **Identify the Places**: First, we need to identify the Province of Pontevedra
      and Faranah Region. The Province of Pontevedra is a province in the autonomous
      community of Galicia, Spain, while Faranah Region is a region in Guinea, West
      Africa.


      2. **Population Data**: To compare the population of these two places, we need
      the most recent population data. As of my last update, the population of the
      Province of Pontevedra is approximately 944,275 (this figure might vary slightly
      depending on the source and the year of the census or estimate). On the other
      hand, the population of Faranah Region is around 941,554 (this figure is also
      subject to change based on the most recent census or estimates).


      3. **Comparison**: Once we have the population figures for both places, we can
      compare them directly to determine which one is more populous.


      Based on the steps above and the population figures provided, it appears that
      the Province of Pontevedra has a slightly larger population compared to Faranah
      Region. Given that the population of Pontevedra is approximately 944,275, and
      Faranah Region''s population is around 941,554, we can conclude that the Province
      of Pontevedra is indeed more populous than Faranah Region.

      an accurate answer. However, considering typical population trends and the fact
      that Punakha District is a district (which might suggest a relatively larger
      population compared to smaller towns like Belur), one might lean towards the
      idea that Punakha District could be more populous than Belur.


      But, without exact numbers, this is speculative. For the purpose of this question,
      and acknowledging the lack of specific data provided here, I will proceed based
      on general knowledge that might suggest Punakha District, being a district,
      could have a larger population, but this is an assumption.

      2. **Population of Moweaqua, Illinois**: According to the 2020 census, the population
      of Moweaqua was 1,764.


      3. **Identify Balcombe**: Balcombe is a village and civil parish in the Mid
      Sussex district of West Sussex, England.


      4. **Population of Balcombe**: The population of Balcombe is about 1,765 (according
      to the 2011 census).


      5. **Comparison**: To determine if Moweaqua is less populous than Balcombe,
      we compare their populations. Moweaqua has 1,764 people, while Balcombe has
      1,765 people.

      4. **Population of Gladysdale, Victoria**: Gladysdale is a relatively small
      town, and I don''t have specific population figures for it. However, it''s common
      for small towns in rural areas to have populations in the hundreds or low thousands.


      5. **Comparison**: To determine if Muenster, Saskatchewan, is less populous
      than Gladysdale, Victoria, we compare their populations. Muenster has a population
      of approximately 422 people. Without exact figures for Gladysdale, we can''t
      make a definitive comparison. However, considering the typical population range
      for small towns in rural areas, it''s likely that Gladysdale might have a similar
      or slightly larger population.


      Given the available information, it''s difficult to provide a definitive answer.

      it''s plausible that Muenster, Saskatchewan, might have a similar or slightly
      smaller population compared to Gladysdale, Victoria.

      1. **Identify the Places**: Zuidhorn is a municipality in the Netherlands, while
      Smithville is an unincorporated community in Atlantic County, New Jersey, United
      States.


      2. **Population Data**: To compare the population of Zuidhorn and Smithville,
      we need the most recent population data. As of my last update, the population
      of Zuidhorn is approximately 18,800 people (this figure might vary slightly
      depending on the source and the year of the census or estimate). The population
      of Smithville, being an unincorporated community, might not have an official
      census count, but we can use estimates or data from nearby towns or counties
      to get an idea.


      3. **Comparison**: Once we have the population figures for both places, we can
      compare them directly to determine which one is more populous.


      Given the steps above and without the most current or precise population figures
      for both locations, especially for Smithville, it''s a bit challenging to provide
      an accurate answer. However, considering typical population trends and the fact
      that Zuidhorn is a municipality (which might suggest a relatively larger population
      compared to an unincorporated community), one might lean towards the idea that
      Zuidhorn could be more populous than Smithville.


      But, without exact numbers, this is speculative. For the purpose of this question,
      and acknowledging the lack of specific data provided here, I will proceed based
      on general knowledge that might suggest Zuidhorn, being a municipality, could
      have a larger population, but this is an assumption.

      \ population of Texas, Queensland is around 700 people (this figure might vary\
      \ slightly depending on the source and the year of the census or estimate).\
      \ Crescent Beach, St. Johns County, Florida, being a neighborhood, is likely\
      \ to have a smaller population, but without the exact figure, it's hard to compare\
      \ directly. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's proceed with the assumption\
      \ that such data could be found.\n\n3. **Comparison**: Once we have the population\
      \ figures for both places, we can compare them directly to determine which one\
      \ is more populous.\n\nGiven the steps above and without the most current or\
      \ precise population figures for both locations, especially for Crescent Beach,\
      \ St. Johns County, Florida, it's a bit challenging to provide an accurate answer.\
      \ However, considering typical population trends and the fact that Texas, Queensland\
      \ is a town (which might suggest a relatively larger population compared to\
      \ a neighborhood), one might lean towards the idea that Texas, Queensland could\
      \ be more populous than Crescent Beach, St. Johns County, Florida.\n\nBut, without\
      \ exact numbers, this is speculative. For the purpose of this question, and\
      \ acknowledging the lack of specific data provided here, I will proceed based\
      \ on general knowledge that might suggest Texas, Queensland, being a town, could\
      \ have a larger population, but this is an assumption.\n\n**Answer**: YES\n\n"

      Turweston is a village in Northamptonshire, England, while Barmedman is a small
      town in New South Wales, Australia.


      2. **Population Data**: To compare the population of Turweston and Barmedman,
      we need the most recent population data. As of my last update, Turweston has
      a population of around 250 people (this figure might vary slightly depending
      on the source and the year of the census or estimate). Barmedman, being a smaller
      town, is expected to have a smaller population, but without the exact figure,

      compare them directly to determine which one is more populous.


      Given the steps above and without the most current or precise population figures
      for both locations, especially for Barmedman, it''s a bit challenging to provide

      Turweston, being a small village, could have a smaller population compared to

      Bayla, we compare their populations. Belle Glade has approximately 16,698 people,
      while Bayla, being a small town in a remote area, is likely to have a smaller
      population.


      Based on these steps, since 16,698 (Belle Glade''s population) is significantly
      larger than what we''d expect for a small town like Bayla, the answer is:


      NO'

      Equatoria, which has a known population of around 1.5 million.


      Based on the steps above, it seems likely that Central Equatoria is more populous
      than Gash-Barka Region. However, without precise population data for Gash-Barka
      Region, this conclusion is based on general assumptions and should be considered
      tentative.

      \ where Moseley and Kings Heath (ward) is located.\n\nThe answer is: **NO**"
    f2758b88-1539-4089-b450-6f8d25407763: "To answer this question, we'll break it\
      \ down into steps:\n\n1. **Identify the locations**: \n   - Moseley and Kings\
      \ Heath (ward) is a ward in the city of Birmingham, England.\n   - Masudpur\
      \ is a village in the Faridabad district of Haryana, India.\n\n2. **Find population\
      \ data**:\n   - The population of Moseley and Kings Heath (ward) can vary, but\
      \ it's likely to be in the thousands or tens of thousands.\n   - Masudpur, being\
      \ a village, might have a smaller population, potentially in the hundreds or\
      \ a few thousand.\n\n3. **Compare the populations**:\n   - Given the general\
      \ population trends in urban wards versus rural villages, it's likely that Moseley\
      \ and Kings Heath (ward) would have a larger population than Masudpur.\n\nBased\
      \ on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:\n\nYES"
