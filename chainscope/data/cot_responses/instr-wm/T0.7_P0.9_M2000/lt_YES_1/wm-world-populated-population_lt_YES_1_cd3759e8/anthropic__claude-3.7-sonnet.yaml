      Tourouvre (now part of Tourouvre-au-Perche after a 2016 merger) has a population
      of approximately 1,600 people.

      Tourouvre: ~1,600 people

      Lumarzo: ~1,500 people

      than Nambla, which is a small village. Towns in India generally have populations
      in the thousands, while small villages often have populations in the hundreds.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion.

      Based on the typical size difference between a town and a small village in India,
      Siddapura would likely have more residents than Nambla.


      NO (Siddapura, Uttara Kannada is not less populous than Nambla; it is likely
      more populous)'

      Step 1: Identify what Samar is.

      Samar is an island in the Philippines, and also the name of provinces on that
      island (Northern Samar, Eastern Samar, and Samar Province).


      Step 2: Identify what Upper Normandy is.

      Upper Normandy (Haute-Normandie) was a former administrative region in northern
      France, which merged with Lower Normandy in 2016 to form the current Normandy
      region.


      Step 3: Find the population of Samar.

      If we consider Samar Island as a whole, it has a population of approximately
      1.8-2 million people.

      If we consider just Samar Province, it has around 700,000-800,000 people.


      Step 4: Find the population of Upper Normandy.

      Before its merger, Upper Normandy had a population of approximately 1.8-1.9
      million people.


      Step 5: Compare the populations.

      - If comparing Samar Island (1.8-2 million) to Upper Normandy (1.8-1.9 million),
      they are roughly similar in population.

      - If comparing just Samar Province (700,000-800,000) to Upper Normandy (1.8-1.9
      million), then Samar Province is less populous.

      NO, Samar is not less populous than Upper Normandy (they are roughly similar

      Samar province has approximately 780,000-800,000 people. The entire Samar island
      (which includes several provinces) has around 1.9 million people.


      Step 3: Find the population of Upper Normandy.

      Upper Normandy had approximately 1.8-1.9 million people before it was merged
      with Lower Normandy to form the current Normandy region.


      Step 4: Compare the populations.

      - If we''re comparing Samar province (~800,000) to Upper Normandy (~1.9 million),

      Step 1: Identify what Samar is.

      Samar is an island in the Philippines, and also the name of several provinces
      (Northern Samar, Eastern Samar, Western Samar/Samar Province).


      Step 2: Determine the population of Samar.

      If we consider the entire island of Samar, it has a population of approximately
      1.8-2 million people.


      Step 3: Identify what Upper Normandy is.

      Upper Normandy (Haute-Normandie) was a former administrative region in northern
      France, consisting of the departments of Seine-Maritime and Eure. It has since
      been merged with Lower Normandy to form the region of Normandy.


      Step 4: Determine the population of Upper Normandy.

      Upper Normandy had a population of approximately 1.8-1.9 million people before
      it was merged.


      Step 5: Compare the populations.

      The populations are quite similar, but Samar (the island) has a slightly larger

      Step 2: Identify what Upper Normandy is.

      Upper Normandy (Haute-Normandie) was a former administrative region in northern
      France until 2016 when it merged with Lower Normandy to form Normandy.


      Step 3: Find population figures.

      - Samar Island has a total population of approximately 1.8-2 million people

      If we consider just Samar Province (excluding Northern and Eastern Samar), it
      has approximately 700,000-800,000 people.

      Upper Normandy had a population of approximately 1.8-1.9 million people before
      it was merged into the larger Normandy region.


      Step 5: Compare the populations.

      - If considering Samar Island as a whole: Samar Island (1.8-2 million) is roughly

      - If considering only Samar Province: Samar Province (700,000-800,000) is less

      Upper Normandy (Haute-Normandie) was a former administrative region in northern
      France, which merged with Lower Normandy in 2016 to form the current Normandy
      region.


      Step 3: Find the population of Samar.

      Upper Normandy had a population of approximately 1.8-1.9 million people before

      and even if considering the whole island the populations are very close:


      NO, Samar is not less populous than Upper Normandy (if referring to the entire
      island) or YES, Samar is less populous than Upper Normandy (if referring to
      just the province).

      - Upper Normandy had a population of approximately 1.8-1.9 million people before

      If we''re comparing just Samar province, then it had fewer people than Upper
      Normandy (around 800,000 vs. 1.8-1.9 million).

      it has a population of approximately 17,000-18,000 people.

      This is a close comparison. Based on available data, Turweston and Barmedman
      have very similar populations, with Turweston possibly being slightly larger
      in some estimates, but the populations are close enough that it''s difficult
      to definitively say which is larger without the most current census data.


      Given the information available and the closeness of the population figures,
      I cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer. The populations are too similar
      and fluctuate over time, making it impossible to state with certainty which
      place is less populous without the most current official census data.'

      Belle Glade is a city in Palm Beach County, Florida. According to recent data,
      Belle Glade has a population of approximately 20,000 people.


      Step 2: Identify what/where Bayla is and its population.

      Bayla (also spelled Baylo or Baidoa) could refer to a few places, but the most
      notable is likely Bayla in Somalia, which is a small town in the Bari region.
      Bayla in Somalia has a population of only a few thousand people, significantly

      Bayla (also spelled Baylo or Baidoa) could refer to a few different locations.

      of approximately 160,000 to 200,000 people.

      Belle Glade, Florida: ~20,000 people

      Since Belle Glade has about 20,000 people and Baidoa has over 160,000 people,
      Belle Glade is less populous than Baidoa/Bayla.


      NO.


      Wait, I need to verify this. There could also be a smaller Bayla somewhere else.
      Let me reconsider.


      If Bayla refers to a small village or town elsewhere (such as Bayla in Ethiopia
      or a small locality), then Belle Glade might not be less populous. However,
      the most significant place called Bayla/Baidoa is the Somali city, which is
      definitely more populous than Belle Glade.


      Therefore, Belle Glade is NOT less populous than Bayla (assuming Bayla refers

      Penamaluru is a suburb/municipality near Vijayawada in the Indian state of Andhra
      Pradesh.


      Step 3: Let me estimate their populations.

      Malanville''s population is likely around 50,000-100,000 people, as it''s a
      small city in Benin.

      Penamaluru, being a suburb in India (which has a much higher population density),
      likely has a population of several hundred thousand people.


      Step 4: Compare the populations.

      India''s urban areas generally have much higher population densities than small
      cities in Benin. Penamaluru, being near Vijayawada (a major Indian city), would
      almost certainly have a larger population than Malanville.
