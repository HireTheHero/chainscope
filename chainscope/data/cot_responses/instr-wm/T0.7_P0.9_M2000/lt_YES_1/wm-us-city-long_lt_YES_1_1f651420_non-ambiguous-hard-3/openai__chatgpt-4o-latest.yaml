      (MS) is located west of Lula, Georgia (GA), we need to compare their longitudinal
      coordinates, since longitude measures east-west position.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Coffeeville, MS.

      - Coffeeville is a town in Yalobusha County, Mississippi.

      - Mississippi is a state in the southeastern region of the United States, but
      it is geographically west of Georgia.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lula, GA.

      - Lula is a city in Hall and Banks counties in the northeastern part of Georgia.

      - Georgia is located to the east of Mississippi.


      Step 3: Reasoning with longitude.

      - Longitude values increase as you move west in the United States (i.e., more
      negative in degrees west of the Prime Meridian).

      - Mississippi cities typically have longitudes around -89 to -91 degrees.

      - Georgia cities typically have longitudes around -83 to -85 degrees.


      Therefore, since Coffeeville, MS is in Mississippi (with a more westerly longitude)

      \ the relative positions of Ohio and Pennsylvania**: Ohio is located to the\
      \ west of Pennsylvania.\n\n4. **Compare the cities within those states**:\n\
      \   - Since Circleville is in central Ohio, and West Conshohocken is in southeastern\
      \ Pennsylvania, Circleville is significantly to the west of West Conshohocken.\n\
      \   - To be more precise, Circleville has a longitude of approximately 83 degrees\
      \ west, while West Conshohocken has a longitude of about 75 degrees west.\n\n\
