    a1001e66-b75c-4a45-9239-9f010b4bc25b: 'To determine the answer, let''s break down
      the steps:


      1. Identify the geographical location of Allouez, WI. Allouez is located in
      the state of Wisconsin, which is in the Midwestern region of the United States.


      2. Identify the geographical location of Heuvelton, NY. Heuvelton is located
      in the state of New York, which is in the Northeastern region of the United
