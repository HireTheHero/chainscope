      Pennsylvania, it''s possible for a town in easternmost OH to be east of a town
      in westernmost PA.  However, given North Madison is on the *northeastern* side
      of Ohio and Shenandoah Heights is on the *eastern* side of Pennsylvania, North
      Madison is extremely likely to be west.
