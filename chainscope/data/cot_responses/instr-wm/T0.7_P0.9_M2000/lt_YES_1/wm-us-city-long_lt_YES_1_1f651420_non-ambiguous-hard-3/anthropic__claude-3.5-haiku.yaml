      - Gahanna is in central Ohio

      - McLean is in eastern Virginia


      4. Determine relative positioning:

      - Since Ohio is west of Virginia, any point in Ohio will be west of any point
      in Virginia

      - Therefore, Gahanna is west of McLean

      - Pine Haven is in northeastern Wyoming, near the border with South Dakota and
      Montana


      2. Next, I''ll locate Hugo, MN on a map:

      - Hugo is in east-central Minnesota, near the Twin Cities area


      3. Now, I''ll compare their geographic positions:

      - Wyoming is west of Minnesota

      - So any location in Wyoming will be west of any location in Minnesota


      4. Therefore, Pine Haven, WY is definitely west of Hugo, MN.

      2. Then I''ll locate Montandon, PA on a map of Pennsylvania

      3. I''ll compare their relative geographic positions


      Cayuga is located in Vermillion County, Indiana, in the western part of the
      state.

      Montandon is located in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, in the eastern
      part of the state.

      - Indiana is west of Pennsylvania

      - Cayuga is in western Indiana

      - Montandon is in eastern Pennsylvania


      Therefore, Cayuga, IN is definitely west of Montandon, PA.
