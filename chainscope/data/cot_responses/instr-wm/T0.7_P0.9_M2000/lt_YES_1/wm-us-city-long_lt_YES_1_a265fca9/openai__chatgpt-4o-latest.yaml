      3. To determine relative locations, we note that Greene County is generally
      south of Albany, while Saratoga County is north of Albany.

      4. Looking at the east-west positions of these places, Sleepy Hollow Lake is
      located closer to the Hudson River in eastern New York.

      5. Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek is also in eastern New York, but farther north.

      6. Comparing their longitudes, Sleepy Hollow Lake is slightly west of Clifton
      Knolls-Mill Creek.


      **Final Answer: YES**'
    ccd5322e-744e-4a6c-8f46-ccfe5e8d5f99: '1. Sleepy Hollow Lake, NY is a community
      in Greene County, NY.

      2. Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek, NY is a community in Saratoga County, NY.

      3. Greene County is located to the southwest of Saratoga County.

      4. Since Sleepy Hollow Lake is in Greene County and Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek
      is in Saratoga County, Sleepy Hollow Lake is west of Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek.
