    3eb73514-1eaa-470f-a55f-486dad253975: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Metolius, OR on a map. It''s in central Oregon, specifically
      in Jefferson County.


      2. Next, I''ll locate Dallesport, WA. It''s in Klickitat County, Washington,

      River.

      Prosper, TX is located in the northeastern part of Texas, north of Dallas.


      Comparing their positions:

      - Nebraska is north of Texas

      - Beemer is in the eastern part of Nebraska

      - Prosper is in the eastern part of Texas


      When comparing their relative positions, Beemer is actually east of Prosper,
      not west.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      3. Then I''ll determine their relative positions to each other


      Step 1: Carlls Corner is in Hunterdon County, New Jersey

      Step 2: Raubsville is in Northampton County, Pennsylvania

      Step 3: These locations are relatively close to each other, near the Delaware
      River

      Step 4: Checking their precise coordinates, Carlls Corner is east of Raubsville


      Therefore, Carlls Corner is NOT west of Raubsville.


      The answer is: NO.'
