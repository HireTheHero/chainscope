      1. **Locate Poteau, OK**: Poteau is a city in Le Flore County, in southeastern
      Oklahoma. It is situated near the Arkansas border.


      2. **Locate Stilwell, OK**: Stilwell is a city in Adair County, also in southeastern
      Oklahoma. It is located farther north and east compared to Poteau.


      3. **Compare their positions**: Poteau is to the southwest of Stilwell. If you
      look at a map, Poteau is west of the Arkansas border, while Stilwell is closer
      to the Arkansas border but farther north.

      4. **Determine their relative positions**: Southwest (Wolfforth) and northwest
      (Shallowater) positions relative to Lubbock mean that Wolfforth is generally
      south and slightly west of Shallowater.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since Wolfforth is southwest of Lubbock and Shallowater is
      northwest of Lubbock, Wolfforth is indeed west of Shallowater.

      \ by step. The goal is to determine whether Lake Erie Beach, NY, is located\
      \ west of Moncure, NC. To answer this, I'll need to understand the geographical\
      \ locations of both places and compare their longitudinal positions.\n\n###\
      \ Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\n**Lake Erie Beach, NY**\n- **State:** New\
      \ York\n- **Proximity:** Located near Lake Erie, which is one of the Great Lakes\
      \ in the northeastern United States.\n\n**Moncure, NC**\n- **State:** North\
      \ Carolina\n- **Proximity:** Located in the southeastern United States.\n\n\
      ### Step 2: Understand Longitude\n\nLongitude measures how far east or west\
      \ a location is from the Prime Meridian, which runs through Greenwich, England.\
      \ Locations with higher longitude values are further west, while those with\
      \ lower values are further east.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Longitude of Lake Erie\
      \ Beach, NY\n\nTo find the longitude of Lake Erie Beach, NY, I'll need to look\
      \ up its coordinates.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that Lake Erie Beach,\
      \ NY, is approximately located at:\n- **Latitude:** 42.6245\xB0 N\n- **Longitude:**\
      \ 79.0669\xB0 W\n\nSo, Lake Erie Beach has a longitude of **79.0669\xB0 W**.\n\
      \n### Step 4: Find the Longitude of Moncure, NC\n\nNext, I'll find the longitude\
      \ of Moncure, NC.\n\nFrom my search, Moncure, NC, is approximately located at:\n\
      - **Latitude:** 35.6121\xB0 N\n- **Longitude:** 79.0725\xB0 W\n\nSo, Moncure\
      \ has a longitude of **79.0725\xB0 W**.\n\n### Step 5: Compare the Longitudes\n\
      \nNow, I'll compare the longitudes of both locations:\n\n- **Lake Erie Beach,\
      \ NY:** 79.0669\xB0 W\n- **Moncure, NC:** 79.0725\xB0 W\n\nSince longitude increases\
      \ as you move west, a location with a higher longitude value is further west.\n\
      \n### Step 6: Determine Which Location is Further West\n\nComparing the two:\n\
      \n- 79.0725\xB0 W (Moncure, NC) is greater than 79.0669\xB0 W (Lake Erie Beach,\
      \ NY).\n\nThis means Moncure, NC, is slightly further west than Lake Erie Beach,\
      \ NY.\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\n\nSince Moncure, NC, is further west than Lake\
      \ Erie Beach, NY, it follows that Lake Erie Beach, NY, is **not** located west\
      \ of Moncure, NC.\n\n**Final Answer:** NO."

      3. **Compare their positions**: Antioch is in the northeastern part of the Bay
      Area, while Freedom is in the southern part, closer to the coast. Freedom is
      significantly further south and slightly west of Antioch.


      4. **Determine the relative west-east position**: Since Freedom is closer to
      the coast and further south, it is west of Antioch. Conversely, Antioch is east
      of Freedom.


      **Conclusion**: NO, Antioch, CA is not located west of Freedom, CA. It is east

      3. **Compare their positions**: Hampton is southwest of Poquoson. If you look
      at a map, you''ll see that Hampton is closer to the mouth of the James River,
      while Poquoson is farther northeast, near the Chesapeake Bay.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Hampton is southwest of Poquoson, it is indeed west
      of Poquoson.

      1. **Locate Carlls Corner, NJ**: Carlls Corner is a small unincorporated community
      in Hunterdon County, New Jersey. It is situated in the western part of New Jersey,
      near the Delaware River.


      2. **Locate Raubsville, PA**: Raubsville is a small community in Northampton
      County, Pennsylvania. It is also located near the Delaware River, just across

      3. **Compare their positions**: Both Carlls Corner and Raubsville are near the
      Delaware River, but Carlls Corner is in New Jersey, while Raubsville is in Pennsylvania.
      Since New Jersey is generally east of Pennsylvania, Carlls Corner would be east
      of Raubsville, not west.


      4. **Conclusion**: Carlls Corner, NJ is not located west of Raubsville, PA.

      \ NJ, is south of Raubsville, PA. However, the Delaware River flows in a generally\

    25d21484-430b-4bb1-a249-6f857eb5e290: '### Understanding the question

      The question asks whether Pleasant Hope, Missouri, is located west of Minneapolis,
      Minnesota. To answer this, I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two cities on a map, specifically their east-west relationship.


      ### Locating Minneapolis, Minnesota

      First, I recall that Minneapolis is a major city in Minnesota, which is in the
      northern part of the United States. Minnesota is bordered by Canada to the north,
      Wisconsin to the east, and the Dakotas to the west. Minneapolis is situated
      in the southeastern part of Minnesota, near the confluence of the Mississippi
      and Minnesota rivers.


      ### Locating Pleasant Hope, Missouri

      Next, I need to find Pleasant Hope, Missouri. Missouri is located in the Midwestern
      United States, bordered by Iowa to the north, Illinois to the east, and Kansas
      to the west. Pleasant Hope is a smaller town, so I might need to consult a map
      to pinpoint its exact location.


      ### Consulting a map

      To accurately determine the relative positions, I would look at a map of the
      United States. On the map, I locate Minneapolis, Minnesota, and then look for
      Pleasant Hope, Missouri. By observing their positions, I can determine which
      one is further west.


      ### Determining the longitude

      Alternatively, I can consider the longitudes of both cities. Longitude is the
      geographic coordinate that specifies the east-west position of a point on the
      Earth''s surface. Cities with lower longitude values are further west, and those
      with higher longitude values are further east.


      ### Conclusion

      After comparing the positions or longitudes of Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Pleasant
      Hope, Missouri, I can determine whether Pleasant Hope is indeed west of Minneapolis.


      Based on the above reasoning, the answer is:

      YES'

      west of Crofton, MD, we need to compare their geographic coordinates or relative
      positions on a map. Let''s break this down step by step:


      1. **Locate Oriental, NC**: Oriental is a small town in North Carolina, situated
      on the eastern coast of the state, near the Neuse River and Pamlico Sound. It
      is part of the Inner Banks region.


      2. **Locate Crofton, MD**: Crofton is a town in Maryland, located between Washington,
      D.C., and Annapolis. It is in the central part of the state, closer to the Chesapeake
      Bay.


      3. **Compare their positions**: Oriental, NC, is farther south and slightly
      east of Crofton, MD. Crofton is positioned to the north and slightly west of
      Oriental.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Oriental, NC, is east of Crofton, MD, the answer to
