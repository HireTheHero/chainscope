      Both Allison Park and Pleasant Hills are suburbs of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.


      2. **Determine general Pittsburgh geography:** Pittsburgh is situated where
      three rivers meet.  Generally, areas north of the rivers are considered "North
      Hills" and areas south of the rivers are "South Hills."


      3. **Place Allison Park and Pleasant Hills within this framework:** Allison
      Park is in the North Hills, and Pleasant Hills is in the South Hills.


      4. **Relate "North" and "South" to directional terms "West" and "East":**  North
      is directly above South. Therefore, Allison Park cannot be west of Pleasant
      Hills.

      and Willow Oak is in Florida, Solana Beach is significantly west of Willow Oak.  Even
      if there is a "Solana, FL," it would almost certainly still be further west
      than Willow Oak given Florida''s geography.


      **Answer:**  Assuming the question meant Solana Beach, CA, then YES. If there
      is a Solana, FL, it''s highly likely the answer is still yes, but precise coordinates
      would be needed to be absolutely certain.

      4. **Westward positioning:**  Since Greene County is southwest of Saratoga County,
      Sleepy Hollow Lake is both south *and* west of Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.

      2. **Determine the relative east-west positions:** Since Sunset Hills is immediately
      southwest of St. Louis, and Festus is considerably south of St. Louis, Festus

      being south isn''t enough.
