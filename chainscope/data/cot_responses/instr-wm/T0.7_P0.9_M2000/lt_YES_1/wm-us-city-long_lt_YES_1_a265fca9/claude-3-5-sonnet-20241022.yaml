      - Minnesota is north of Iowa

      - But for this question, we need to compare east/west positioning


      3) Checking approximate coordinates:

      - Lindstrom, MN is near the Minnesota-Wisconsin border, making it relatively
      far east in Minnesota

      - Sully, IA is in central Iowa, roughly in the middle of the state from east
      to west


      4) Final comparison:

      - Being near the Wisconsin border puts Lindstrom quite far east

      - Sully''s central Iowa location means it''s more westward than Lindstrom

      - The Homesteads, TX is in Texas

      - Wynnewood, OK is in Oklahoma


      2. Oklahoma is directly north of Texas


      3. When comparing cities in Texas and Oklahoma:

      - If the Texas city is west of the Oklahoma city, it must be significantly to
      the west since it''s also further south

      - The Homesteads is in east Texas

      - Wynnewood is in south-central Oklahoma


      4. Looking at their relative positions:

      - The Homesteads is in the eastern part of Texas

      - Wynnewood is more centrally located in Oklahoma

      - The Homesteads is actually east of Wynnewood''s longitude

      on the Atlantic coast, it must be east of Croydon, PA.


      4. Therefore, Croydon must be west of Erma.
