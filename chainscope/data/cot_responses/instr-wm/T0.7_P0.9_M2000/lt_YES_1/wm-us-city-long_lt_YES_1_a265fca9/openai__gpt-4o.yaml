      and 88 degrees west longitude.


      2. **Identify the location of Ixonia, WI**: Ixonia is a town in southeastern

      Generally:


      - If Hancock is slightly west of 88 degrees while Ixonia is exactly or slightly

      locations:


      1. **Identify the location of Orangeburg, SC**: Orangeburg is a city in central
      South Carolina.


      2. **Identify the location of Daufuskie Island, SC**: Daufuskie Island is located
      in the southern part of South Carolina, near the border with Georgia, and is
      situated along the coast.


      3. **Determine the relative position**: Orangeburg, being inland and north of
      Daufuskie Island, is geographically west of Daufuskie Island, which is on the
      coast.
