      make an educated guess based on their relative positions within the state.


      4. **Consider the general layout of Florida**: Florida is a peninsula that extends
      from the southeastern United States into the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic
      Ocean. The cities of North Bay Village and Oakland Park are both located in
      the southern part of Florida.


      5. **Use relative positions**: North Bay Village is located just north of Miami,
      while Oakland Park is located further north, near Fort Lauderdale. This implies
      that North Bay Village is more to the south, which generally corresponds to
      a lower latitude and potentially a lower longitude.

      \ 81.45\xB0 W), but this difference is very minimal and essentially makes them\
      \ at the same longitude for practical purposes, the question essentially becomes\
      \ about the precise definition of \"west of.\" However, considering standard\
      \ geographical interpretations, if a place is at the same longitude or very\
      \ slightly to its east, it's generally not considered \"west of\" in a significant\
      \ geographical sense, especially given the context of a question that seems\
      \ to imply a noticeable difference in longitude.\n\nGiven these steps, the answer\
      \ to whether Kissimmee, FL, is located west of Meyers Lake, OH, would be **NO**"

      \ and 122.37\xB0W longitude.\n   - North Richmond, CA is at approximately 37.96\xB0\
      N latitude and 122.36\xB0W longitude.\n\n4. **Compare the longitudes**: Since\
      \ both locations are on the west coast, we primarily focus on their longitudes.\
      \ Boring, OR has a longitude of 122.37\xB0W, and North Richmond, CA has a longitude\
      \ of 122.36\xB0W. Since 122.37\xB0W (Boring) is not less than 122.36\xB0W (North\
      \ Richmond), Boring is not west of North Richmond in terms of longitude. However,\
      \ this is a very small difference in longitude (about 0.01 degree, which is\
      \ about 0.7 miles at this latitude), so we need to consider other factors.\n\
      \n5. **Consider the latitudes**: Since the longitudes are so close, we can also\
      \ consider the latitudes. Boring, OR has a latitude of 45.43\xB0N, and North\
      \ Richmond, CA has a latitude of 37.96\xB0N. Since 45.43\xB0N (Boring) is greater\
      \ than 37.96\xB0N (North Richmond), Boring is indeed north of North Richmond.\
      \ However, the question asked about \"west of,\" not \"north of.\"\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\
      \ Given that Boring, OR, and North Richmond, CA, have almost the same longitude,\
      \ and Boring is slightly north of North Richmond, the question of whether Boring\
      \ is \"west of\" North Richmond becomes a matter of interpretation. Technically,\
      \ Boring is not west of North Richmond because its longitude is not less than\
      \ that of North Richmond, but it is very close in longitude and is north of\
      \ North Richmond. Therefore, in a strict sense, the answer is $\\boxed{NO}$,\
      \ Boring, OR is not west of North Richmond, CA.\n\n"

      1. **Identify the states**: Boring is in Oregon (OR), and North Richmond is\

      \ if a place is at the same longitude or very slightly to its east, it's generally\
      \ not considered \"west of\" in a significant geographical sense, especially\

      of Port Wentworth, GA, we''ll need to follow a series of steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Edmund, SC, is a town in South Carolina, and
      Port Wentworth, GA, is a city in Georgia. Both are in the southeastern region
      of the United States.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: To be west of something, a location
      must be to the left of it when facing north. We need to determine if Edmund
      is to the left of Port Wentworth when facing north.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Since both cities are in the southeastern
      region, we need to look at their specific locations within their respective
      states.


      4. **Compare the locations geographically**: Edmund, SC, is located in the central
      part of South Carolina. Port Wentworth, GA, is located in the southeastern part
      of Georgia, near the coast.


      5. **Use maps or geographical knowledge**: We can use a map of the southeastern
      United States to visualize the positions of both cities. A simple way to check
      this without a specific map is to consider that South Carolina is generally
      to the north of Georgia, and since Edmund is in central South Carolina, it''s
      likely to be north of Port Wentworth, which is in southeastern Georgia.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given the relative positions of Edmund, SC, and Port Wentworth,
      GA, Edmund is likely north of Port Wentworth. Since it''s not west of it when

      general knowledge of the region. The Upper Peninsula of Michigan is north of
      Wisconsin, and Hancock is in the western part of the Upper Peninsula.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given that Hancock is in the western part of the Upper Peninsula
      of Michigan and Ixonia is in southeastern Wisconsin, Hancock is indeed located
      west of Ixonia.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Conestee, SC is in South Carolina, and Pebble
      Creek, FL is in Florida. Both are states in the southeastern United States.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: To be west of a location means to
      be on the left side of it when facing north. This is important to know as we
      consider the relative positions of Conestee and Pebble Creek.


      3. **Consider the general geographical positions**: South Carolina is located
      north of Florida. This means that if we were to draw a line from Conestee to
      Pebble Creek, it would likely be a south-to-north line.


      4. **Use maps or geographical knowledge**: Without a specific map but knowing
      the general layout of the southeastern United States, we can consider the positions
      of these towns relative to each other. Conestee is in the northwestern part
      of South Carolina, and Pebble Creek is in the central part of Florida.


      5. **Determine the relative positions**: Given that Conestee is in the northwestern

      in Alabama (AL), a state in the United States.


      2. **Understand the geographical context**: Alabama is located in the southeastern
      United States. The cities in question are relatively close to each other within
      the state.


      3. **Use maps or geographical knowledge**: Without a specific map but knowing
      the general layout of Alabama, we can consider the positions of these cities
      relative to each other. Center Point is in the central part of the state, while
      Brook Highland is also in the central part but slightly to the east.


      4. **Determine the relative positions**: Based on the above, we can conclude
      that Center Point is not west of Brook Highland, as Brook Highland is more to
      the east of Center Point.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical context and the relative positions
      of the cities, we can confidently say that Center Point, AL is NOT located west
      of Brook Highland, AL.

      border is roughly along the 109th meridian west.


      3. **Consider the locations'' longitudes**: To determine if one location is
      west of another, we look at their longitudes. The western part of Arizona is
      generally west of the eastern part.


      4. **Winslow''s location**: Winslow, AZ is located in the eastern part of Arizona,
      near the state''s center.


      5. **Vail''s location**: Vail, AZ is also in the eastern part of Arizona, southeast
      of Tucson.


      6. **Compare the longitudes**: Since both cities are in the eastern part of
      Arizona, they are both east of the state''s western border. To be west of another

      part of the state, while Letha is a smaller community in the same region.


      5. **Determine the relative positions**: Given that both cities are in the southwestern

      \ the Greater Los Angeles area.\n   - El Monte, CA, is also located in Los Angeles\
      \ County, California, and is part of the San Gabriel Valley.\n\n4. **Use maps\
      \ or geographical knowledge**: Without a specific map but knowing the general\
      \ layout of Los Angeles County, we can consider the positions of these cities\
      \ relative to each other. South Whittier is located east of El Monte.\n\n5.\
      \ **Determine the relative positions**:\n   - Since South Whittier is east of\
      \ El Monte, it implies that South Whittier is not west of El Monte.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\
      \ Given that South Whittier is east of El Monte, it is not located west of El\
      \ Monte.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{NO}$\n\n"
