      1. First, I''ll locate Lake Onega on a map. Lake Onega is a large lake in northwestern
      Russia, specifically in the Republic of Karelia.


      2. Next, I''ll search for the Dartry Mountains. After careful research, I find
      that the Dartry Mountains are actually located in Ireland, specifically in County
      Sligo in the northwestern part of the country.


      3. Ireland and Russia are on different continents, with a significant geographical
      distance between them.


      4. Given their locations, the Dartry Mountains are definitely NOT west of Lake
      Onega.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      - Ghodaghodi Tal is a lake located in Nepal, specifically in the Kailali District
      in the western part of the country.


      2. Next, I''ll locate Kanlaon:

      - Kanlaon (or Mount Kanlaon) is a volcano located in the Philippines, specifically

      - Kanlaon is in the Philippines, which is in Southeast Asia


      4. Comparing their positions:

      - These locations are in completely different parts of Asia

      1. First, I need to identify the locations of the Penibaetic System and Vembanad.


      2. The Penibaetic System is a mountain range located in southern Spain, in the
      region of Andalusia.


      3. Vembanad is a large lake located in Kerala, India.

      1. First, let''s locate Anaimalai Hills:

      - Anaimalai Hills are located in southern India, specifically in the states
      of Kerala and Tamil Nadu

      - They are part of the Western Ghats mountain range


      2. Next, let''s locate Zambales Mountains:

      - Zambales Mountains are located in the Philippines, specifically on the island
      of Luzon

      - They are in a completely different continent from the Anaimalai Hills


      3. Geographical reasoning:

      - Anaimalai Hills are in southern India

      - Zambales Mountains are in the Philippines

      - These locations are thousands of miles apart in different parts of Asia

      - They are not in any geographical proximity to each other


      4. Determining west/east relationship:

      - Since these mountain ranges are in entirely different regions, the concept
      of being "west" or "east" of each other doesn''t make sense in this context


      5. Conclusion:

      The question cannot be answered with a simple west/east relationship because
      the locations are too far apart.


      However, the question demands a YES or NO answer.

      \ America\n   - S\xF8rfjorden is in Europe (Norway)\n\n4. To determine their\
      \ relative west-east positioning, I'll consider their global coordinates:\n\
      \   - Laguna Colorada is at approximately 22\xB0S, 68\xB0W\n   - S\xF8rfjorden\
      \ is at approximately 60\xB0N, 6\xB0E\n\n5. These locations are very far apart,\
      \ on opposite sides of the globe.\n\n6. However, the question specifically asks\
      \ about west positioning.\n\n7. Comparing their longitudes:\n   - Laguna Colorada:\
      \ 68\xB0W\n   - S\xF8rfjorden: 6\xB0E\n   \n8. 68\xB0W is indeed west of 6\xB0\
      E.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: YES."
