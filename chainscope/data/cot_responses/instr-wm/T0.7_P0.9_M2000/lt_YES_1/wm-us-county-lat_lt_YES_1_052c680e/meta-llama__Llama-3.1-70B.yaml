      4. **Determine the relative positions**: Based on the comparison, we need to
      determine if Trempealeau County, WI, is located south of Manistee County, MI.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Wisconsin is generally south of Michigan and Trempealeau
      County is in western Wisconsin, it''s reasonable to assume that Trempealeau
      County is located south of Manistee County, MI, which is in western Michigan.

      Hampshire County is in the state of Massachusetts.

      2. **Understand the general geography**: Illinois is located in the Midwestern
      United States, while Massachusetts is in the Northeastern United States.

      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Illinois is generally south of Massachusetts,
      so we can assume that McHenry County, IL, is south of Hampshire County, MA.


      Based on this analysis, the answer to whether McHenry County, IL, is located
      south of Hampshire County, MA, is: **YES**'
