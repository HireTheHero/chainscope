    3fb03980-7e9b-4949-bad4-02fd938f1c8a: '1. **Locate Chelan County, WA:** Chelan
      County is in Washington state, on the west coast of the US.

      2. **Locate Red Lake County, MN:** Red Lake County is in Minnesota, in the northern

      3. **Compare latitudes:** Washington is generally further south than Minnesota.
      However, given the curvature of the Earth, we need to be cautious.  Chelan County
      is in central Washington, while Red Lake County is in northern Minnesota.

      4. **Consider relative positions:** Chelan County is significantly west of Red
      Lake County.  Latitude is the primary determinant of north/south positioning.


      Since Minnesota is north of Washington and Red Lake County is in northern Minnesota,
      Chelan County, WA is likely south of it.
