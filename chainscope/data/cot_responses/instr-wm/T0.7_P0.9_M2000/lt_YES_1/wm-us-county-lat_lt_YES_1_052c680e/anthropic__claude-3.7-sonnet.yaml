      Step 1: Let me recall the geography of Washington state counties.

      - Pacific County is located on the southwestern coast of Washington state, bordering
      the Pacific Ocean.

      - Lewis County is located in the southwestern part of Washington state, but
      more inland.


      Step 2: Let me consider their relative positions.

      - Pacific County is on the coast, at the southwestern corner of Washington.

      - Lewis County is directly east of Pacific County and extends further north.

      - Pacific County''s northern border partially connects with Grays Harbor County.

      - Lewis County''s southern border connects with Cowlitz County and Skamania
      County.


      Step 3: Comparing their north-south positioning:

      - Pacific County is positioned along the coast in the southwest.

      - Lewis County is positioned more inland but extends both north and south of
      parts of Pacific County.

      - Critically, Lewis County''s northern portions extend further north than Pacific
      County''s northern border.


      Based on this analysis, Pacific County is not entirely south of Lewis County.
      While Pacific County is in the southwest corner, Lewis County extends both east
      and north of it.

      - Pacific County''s northern border connects partially with Grays Harbor County,
      while Lewis County is east and slightly north of Pacific County.


      Step 3: Checking their specific positions on the map:

      - Pacific County is in the southwest corner of Washington.

      - Lewis County is positioned more inland and extends further north than Pacific
      County.

      - Pacific County is generally positioned to the southwest of Lewis County, not

      - Pacific County is located on the southwestern coast of Washington state.

      - Lewis County is located in the southwestern part of Washington state, but
      more inland.


      Step 2: Determine their relative north-south positioning.

      - Pacific County borders the Pacific Ocean on the west and extends inland.

      - Lewis County is positioned east of Pacific County.

      - Looking at their north-south relationship, Pacific County is positioned to

      - Lewis County''s southern border partially forms Pacific County''s northern
      border.


      Step 3: Make the final determination.

      - Since Pacific County is positioned below (south of) at least part of Lewis
      County, Pacific County is indeed south of Lewis County, though they share a
      border and Pacific County is also somewhat west of Lewis County.


      NO. Pacific County, WA is not located south of Lewis County, WA. While Pacific
      County is to the southwest, it''s more accurate to say it''s west of Lewis County

      Step 5: Lewis County is positioned north of Pacific County, extending from roughly
      the middle of the state toward the west, but not reaching the coast.


      Step 6: Looking at their relative positions, Pacific County is south and west

      Wait, I need to correct myself after reviewing the geography more carefully.
      Pacific County is indeed located to the southwest of Lewis County, WA. Pacific
      County borders the Pacific Ocean and extends south to the Columbia River (Oregon
      border), while Lewis County is more inland and positioned to the northeast of

      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - Tolland County is in Connecticut (CT)

      - Providence County is in Rhode Island (RI)


      Step 2: Recall the general geography of these states.

      - Connecticut is south of Rhode Island

      - Rhode Island is north of Connecticut

      - Tolland County is in the northeastern part of Connecticut

      - Providence County is in the northern part of Rhode Island


      Step 4: Determine their relative positions.

      - Since Connecticut is south of Rhode Island, and Tolland County is in northeastern
      Connecticut, while Providence County is in northern Rhode Island, Tolland County
      would be south of Providence County.


      NO


      Wait, I need to verify this more carefully. Let me reconsider:


      - Providence County occupies the northern and central parts of Rhode Island

      - Tolland County is in northeastern Connecticut

      - Connecticut borders Rhode Island to the west and south

      - Tolland County specifically borders Massachusetts to the north, not Rhode
      Island


      Looking at their relative positions more precisely, Tolland County is actually
      southeast of Providence County, not directly south. However, since it is partially
      south of Providence County, the answer would be:


      YES'

      - Miami-Dade County is located in the southeastern part of Florida, containing
      the city of Miami.

      - Collier County is located on the southwestern coast of Florida, containing
      Naples.


      Step 2: Consider their positions on a map.

      3) Brown County is also located in northeast Wisconsin, directly adjacent to
      Outagamie County.


      4) Looking at their relative positions, Brown County is located to the northeast
      of Outagamie County.


      5) This means Outagamie County is positioned southwest of Brown County.

      determine the relative positions of these Wisconsin counties.


      Step 1: Let me consider the locations of Outagamie County and Brown County in
      Wisconsin.

      - Outagamie County is located in northeastern Wisconsin.

      - Brown County is also located in northeastern Wisconsin.


      Step 2: Looking at their specific relative positions:

      - Brown County contains the city of Green Bay and is situated along the bay
      of Green Bay (part of Lake Michigan).

      - Outagamie County is positioned directly west/southwest of Brown County.

      - Outagamie County contains Appleton, while Brown County contains Green Bay.


      Step 3: Determining north/south positioning:

      - While Outagamie County is primarily to the west of Brown County, it does extend
      slightly to the south of parts of Brown County.

      - However, the majority of Outagamie County is not south of Brown County but
      rather west of it.

      - The counties are roughly at similar latitudes, with Outagamie extending both
      slightly north and slightly south of different parts of Brown County.


      Based on the geographic arrangement, Outagamie County is primarily positioned
      to the west of Brown County, not south of it. While there may be some small
      southern extension, it would be inaccurate to characterize Outagamie as being
      "south of" Brown County.


      NO'

      Step 1: I need to determine the relative positions of Outagamie County and Brown
      County in Wisconsin.


      Step 2: Outagamie County is located in northeastern Wisconsin. Its county seat
      is Appleton.


      Step 3: Brown County is also located in northeastern Wisconsin. Its county seat
      is Green Bay.


      Step 4: Looking at their geographic positions, Brown County is located to the
      northeast of Outagamie County. Specifically, Brown County borders Outagamie
      County on its northeastern side.


      Step 5: Since Brown County is to the northeast of Outagamie County, this means
      Outagamie County is to the southwest of Brown County.


      Step 6: If Outagamie County is southwest of Brown County, then Outagamie County
      is partially south of Brown County (as well as partially west).


      NO.


      Actually, I need to be more precise about the cardinal directions. Outagamie
      County is primarily to the west and slightly south of Brown County, but it''s
      not directly or entirely south of Brown County. The majority of Outagamie County
      is westward rather than southward of Brown County.


      So the answer is NO, Outagamie County is not located south of Brown County -
      it''s primarily located west of Brown County.'

      5) Outagamie County is positioned directly west and slightly south of Brown
      County. Outagamie contains Appleton and shares its eastern border with Brown
      County.


      6) While Outagamie does extend slightly more south than parts of Brown County,
      it''s primarily positioned to the west of Brown County rather than south of
      it.


      7) For a county to be "south of" another county, it should be predominantly
      positioned below the other county on a map.


      NO. Outagamie County, WI is not located south of Brown County, WI. It''s primarily
      located west of Brown County.'

      Step 1: Identify the states these counties are in.

      - Sevier County is in Tennessee (TN)

      - Wake County is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Tennessee and North
      Carolina.

      - Tennessee is directly west of North Carolina

      - Tennessee''s eastern border connects with North Carolina''s western border

      - The border between these states runs roughly east-west, with some irregularities


      Step 3: Locate these specific counties within their states.

      - Sevier County is in eastern Tennessee, in the Great Smoky Mountains area

      - Wake County is in the central part of North Carolina (contains Raleigh, the
      state capital)


      Step 4: Compare latitudes.

      - Sevier County is located in the mountainous region of eastern Tennessee, near
      the NC border

      - Wake County is more centrally located in North Carolina, not along the TN
      border

      - Sevier County is slightly south of the Tennessee-North Carolina border in

      of Herkimer County, NY and Sanilac County, MI.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Herkimer County, NY is located.

      Herkimer County is in central New York state.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Sanilac County, MI is located.

      Sanilac County is in eastern Michigan, specifically in the "Thumb" region of
      Michigan''s Lower Peninsula.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      New York state is generally east of Michigan, but the question asks about north/south
      positioning (latitude).

      Michigan''s Lower Peninsula, particularly the Thumb region where Sanilac County
      is located, extends fairly far north.

      Central New York, where Herkimer County is located, is at a more southern latitude
      compared to Michigan''s Thumb region.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Herkimer County, NY is at a more southern latitude than Sanilac County,
      MI, Herkimer County would be south of Sanilac County.


      YES'

      - Herkimer County is in New York (NY)

      - Sanilac County is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - Michigan is in the north-central/Great Lakes region


      Step 3: More specifically, let me think about their positions.

      - New York extends from the Atlantic coast westward to the Great Lakes

      - Michigan consists of two peninsulas between several Great Lakes


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      - Herkimer County, NY is in central/eastern New York

      - Sanilac County, MI is in the eastern part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula,
      along Lake Huron


      Step 5: Analyzing their relative positions:

      - Michigan''s Lower Peninsula extends further south than most of New York

      - However, Sanilac County is in the "thumb" area of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula,
      which is in the northern part of the state

      - Herkimer County is in central New York, which is generally south of the northern
      parts of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula


      Based on this analysis, Herkimer County, NY is indeed south of Sanilac County,
      MI.

      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Montana is directly west of North Dakota (they share a border)

      - The border between Montana and North Dakota runs north-south

      - Counties along this border would be east-west of each other, not north-south


      Step 3: Check the specific locations of these counties.

      - Golden Valley County is not on the western edge of North Dakota

      - Wibaux County is on the eastern edge of Montana

      - Even if these counties were at the border, they would be east-west of each
      other, not north-south


      Step 4: Consider latitude (north-south positioning).

      - Montana and North Dakota are at roughly the same latitude

      - Counties within these states maintain similar north-south positions relative
      to each other


      NO. Golden Valley County, ND is not located south of Wibaux County, MT. They
      are positioned more east-west of each other, with Golden Valley County being
      east of Wibaux County, not south of it.'

      Step 2: Golden Valley County is in North Dakota (ND), which is east of Montana
      (MT).


      Step 3: North Dakota and Montana share a border that runs east-west, with Montana
      to the west and North Dakota to the east.


      Step 4: Along this border, counties in North Dakota would be directly east of
      counties in Montana, not north or south.


      Step 5: Looking at the geography more specifically, Golden Valley County, ND
      is located in western North Dakota, while Wibaux County, MT is in eastern Montana.


      Step 6: The Montana-North Dakota border runs north-south, so counties along
      this border would be east-west of each other, not north-south.


      Step 7: Therefore, Golden Valley County, ND would be east of Wibaux County,
      MT, not north or south.


      NO, Golden Valley County, ND is not located south of Wibaux County, MT. It is

      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - Golden Valley County is in North Dakota (ND)

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Montana is directly west of North Dakota

      - The border between these states runs north-south


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions of the counties.

      - Since Montana is west of North Dakota, counties along their border would be
      east-west neighbors

      - For one county to be north or south of the other, they would need to be at
      different latitudes


      Step 4: Check the specific locations of these counties.

      - Golden Valley County, ND is in western North Dakota

      - Wibaux County, MT is in eastern Montana

      - These counties are actually adjacent to each other along the MT-ND border

      - Wibaux County is directly west of Golden Valley County

      - They are at approximately the same latitude


      Step 5: Make the final determination.

      - Since these counties are at roughly the same latitude, with one directly west
      of the other, Golden Valley County is neither north nor south of Wibaux County.

      the relative positions of these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Dunklin County is in Missouri (MO)

      - Grainger County is in Tennessee (TN)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Missouri is generally north of Tennessee in the US

      - However, Missouri''s southern border has a distinctive "boot heel" that extends
      further south


      Step 3: Locate Dunklin County within Missouri.

      - Dunklin County is located in the southeastern corner of Missouri, specifically
      in the "boot heel" region

      - This is the southernmost part of Missouri


      Step 4: Locate Grainger County within Tennessee.

      - Grainger County is in northeastern Tennessee


      Step 5: Compare latitudes.

      - Despite Missouri being generally north of Tennessee, Dunklin County''s position
      in Missouri''s boot heel puts it very far south

      - Grainger County''s position in northeastern Tennessee puts it relatively far
      north within Tennessee

      - The boot heel of Missouri extends south enough that Dunklin County is actually
      south of the northernmost counties of Tennessee


      Step 6: Make the comparison.

      - Dunklin County, MO is in the extreme southern part of Missouri

      - Grainger County, TN is in the northeastern part of Tennessee

      - This means Dunklin County is likely south of Grainger County

      the relative positions of these counties.


      Step 1: Let me identify the states and their general locations.

      - Dunklin County is in Missouri (MO), which is in the central United States.

      - Grainger County is in Tennessee (TN), which is in the southeastern United
      States.


      Step 2: Let me determine the specific locations of these counties within their
      states.

      - Dunklin County is in the southeastern "bootheel" of Missouri, at the very
      southern edge of the state.

      - Grainger County is in northeastern Tennessee.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Missouri is generally north of Tennessee.

      - However, the Missouri "bootheel" (where Dunklin County is located) extends
      southward.

      - Tennessee''s northeastern region (where Grainger County is located) is in
      the northern part of Tennessee.


      Step 4: Making the final comparison.

      - Even though Dunklin County is in Missouri''s southernmost region, Missouri
      is still north of Tennessee overall.

      - Grainger County being in northeastern Tennessee places it in the northern
      part of a state that is already south of most of Missouri.

      - Therefore, Dunklin County would be north of Grainger County.


      NO, Dunklin County, MO is not located south of Grainger County, TN. It is located

      determine the relative positions of these South Carolina counties.


      Step 1: Let me consider the geographic layout of Greenwood County and Abbeville
      County in South Carolina.


      Step 2: Abbeville County is located in the northwestern part of South Carolina,
      along the Georgia border.


      Step 3: Greenwood County is adjacent to Abbeville County in South Carolina.


      Step 4: Looking at their relative positions, Greenwood County is positioned
      to the southeast of Abbeville County. Abbeville County forms part of the northern
      and western borders of Greenwood County.


      Step 5: Since Greenwood County is southeast of Abbeville County, it is indeed
      south (though also somewhat east) of Abbeville County.


      NO


      Wait, I need to correct myself. After reviewing the geographic positions more
      carefully:


      YES


      Greenwood County is indeed located south of Abbeville County, SC (though it
      extends somewhat to the east as well).'

      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of both Greenwood County and Abbeville
      County in South Carolina.


      Step 2: Greenwood County is located in the western part of South Carolina, in
      what''s known as the Upstate region or Piedmont plateau.


      Step 3: Abbeville County is also located in the western part of South Carolina,
      also in the Upstate region.


      Step 4: Looking at their relative positions, Abbeville County is positioned
      directly to the west of Greenwood County, sharing a border.


      Step 5: In terms of north-south positioning, Abbeville County is actually at
      approximately the same latitude as Greenwood County, with both counties side
      by side rather than one being clearly north or south of the other.


      Step 6: If anything, Abbeville County extends slightly more southward than Greenwood
      County, meaning Greenwood is not south of Abbeville.


      NO'

      of Greenwood County and Abbeville County in South Carolina.


      Step 1: Let me recall the geographic layout of counties in South Carolina.

      Greenwood County and Abbeville County are both located in the western part of
      South Carolina.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      Abbeville County is located on the western border of South Carolina, touching
      Georgia.

      Greenwood County is positioned to the east of Abbeville County.


      Step 3: Consider north-south positioning.

      While Greenwood County is east of Abbeville County, in terms of north-south
      positioning, Greenwood County is actually slightly south and east of Abbeville
      County. The northern part of Greenwood County is adjacent to the southeastern
      part of Abbeville County.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Looking at their overall positions, Greenwood County extends further south than
      Abbeville County, meaning at least part of Greenwood County is south of Abbeville
      County.


      NO


      Wait, I need to be more precise. While Greenwood County is primarily east of
      Abbeville County, it does extend further south than Abbeville County. The correct
      answer is:


      YES'

      Step 1: Let me recall the geographic layout of counties in South Carolina.

      - Abbeville County is located in the western part of South Carolina, along the
      Georgia border.

      - Greenwood County is also in the western part of South Carolina.


      Step 2: Let me consider their relative positions.

      - Abbeville County is positioned in the northwest part of South Carolina.

      - Greenwood County is adjacent to Abbeville County.

      - Specifically, Greenwood County is positioned to the southeast of Abbeville
      County.


      Step 3: Determine the north-south relationship.

      - Since Greenwood County is to the southeast of Abbeville County, this means
      Greenwood is south of Abbeville (as well as east).


      Therefore, based on this analysis of their geographic positions in South Carolina:


      YES'

      Step 4: Greenwood County is located to the east and slightly south of Abbeville
      County.


      Step 5: While Greenwood County does extend somewhat south of Abbeville County''s
      southern border, it''s more accurate to say that Greenwood is positioned to
      the east/southeast of Abbeville rather than directly south.


      Based on this analysis, the answer is: YES


      Greenwood County is indeed located south (specifically southeast) of Abbeville

      Step 2: Abbeville County is located in the western part of South Carolina, along
      the Georgia border.

      Step 3: Greenwood County is adjacent to Abbeville County in South Carolina.

      Step 4: Specifically, Greenwood County is positioned to the east and slightly
      south of Abbeville County.

      Step 5: While there is some southern extension of Greenwood County relative
      to Abbeville County, Greenwood is primarily positioned to the east rather than
      directly south.

      Step 6: Looking at the county map, Greenwood County shares its western border
      with Abbeville County''s eastern border, with Greenwood extending somewhat further
      south than Abbeville.


      Based on this analysis, since Greenwood County is positioned primarily to the
      east of Abbeville County (not directly south) but does extend somewhat further

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - LaPorte County is in Indiana (IN)

      - Newport County is in Rhode Island (RI)


      Step 2: Determine their approximate latitudes.

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region of the US

      - Rhode Island is in the Northeast region of the US


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Rhode Island is one of the northernmost states in the US, located in New England

      - Indiana is located south of the Great Lakes region

      - Generally, Rhode Island (including Newport County) is farther north than Indiana
      (including LaPorte County)


      Step 4: Verify specific county positions.

      - LaPorte County, IN is in the northern part of Indiana, but Indiana as a whole
      is south of Rhode Island

      - Newport County, RI is in the southern part of Rhode Island, but Rhode Island
      as a whole is north of Indiana

      - Even with these considerations, Newport County, RI is still north of LaPorte
      County, IN


      Therefore, LaPorte County, IN is located south of Newport County, RI.

      Step 2: Consider the geography of Indiana and Kentucky.

      - Indiana is directly north of Kentucky (Kentucky''s northern border meets Indiana''s

      - For a county in Indiana to be south of a county in Kentucky, it would need
      to be in a part of Indiana that extends further south than the Kentucky county


      Step 3: Analyze the specific locations.

      - Dubois County is in southern Indiana, near the Kentucky border

      - Fleming County is in northeastern Kentucky, not along the Indiana border

      - Counties in northeastern Kentucky would be east and north of the Indiana-Kentucky

      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since Fleming County is in northeastern Kentucky, it would be positioned east
      and likely north of Dubois County

      - Dubois County, being in southern Indiana, would be west and likely south of
      Fleming County

      - Since Dubois County is in southern Indiana (near the Kentucky border), and
      Fleming County is in northeastern Kentucky (not near the Indiana border), Dubois
      County is likely north of Fleming County or possibly at a similar latitude.

      - Kentucky extends further east than Indiana, and the northeastern part of Kentucky
