    17e02127-43ec-4ef3-bacc-9c043525ba68: '1. Cascade County is located in the state
      of Montana.

      2. Mahnomen County is located in the state of Minnesota.

      3. Montana is generally west of Minnesota.

      4. To determine relative north-south positioning, we compare latitudes.

      5. Mahnomen County is in northwestern Minnesota.

      6. Cascade County is in central Montana.

      7. Montana extends farther north than Minnesota in general, but we need to compare
      specific counties.

      8. Mahnomen County is at a relatively high latitude in Minnesota.

      9. Cascade County, including Great Falls, is at a lower latitude compared to
      northern Minnesota.

      10. Therefore, Cascade County is located **south** of Mahnomen County.
