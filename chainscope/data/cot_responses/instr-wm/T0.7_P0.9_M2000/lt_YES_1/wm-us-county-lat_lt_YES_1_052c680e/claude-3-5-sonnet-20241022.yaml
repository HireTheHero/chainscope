    026ec460-c868-4e6e-aa0c-ab4502f63f01: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me visualize the location of both counties in Washington state:

      - Pacific County is on the Pacific coast of Washington

      - Lewis County is in the southwestern part of Washington


      2. Looking at their relative positions:

      - Pacific County borders the Pacific Ocean to the west

      - Lewis County is inland, east of Pacific County

      - Pacific County is directly west of Lewis County

      - Both counties are in a similar horizontal (latitudinal) position


      3. Comparing their north-south positions:

      - Pacific County''s northern border aligns roughly with Lewis County''s northern
      sections

      - Pacific County extends slightly less south than Lewis County

      - Lewis County actually extends further south than Pacific County


      Therefore, NO - Pacific County is not located south of Lewis County. They are
      roughly parallel to each other east-to-west, with Lewis County extending slightly
      further south.


      The answer is NO.'

      - Pacific County borders the Pacific Ocean to the west

      - Lewis County is inland, in the middle of southwest Washington

      - Pacific County extends along the coast up to Grays Harbor County

      - Lewis County is located east of Pacific County


      3. For north/south positioning:

      - Pacific County shares part of its northern border with Grays Harbor County

      - Lewis County also borders Grays Harbor County

      - Pacific County is actually positioned to the west and slightly south of Lewis
      County

      - The majority of Pacific County lies south of Lewis County''s southern border

      - Pacific County is slightly south of parts of Lewis County, but also slightly
      north of other parts

      - They are more side-by-side than one being clearly north or south of the other

      1. First, I''ll locate both counties:

      - Tolland County is in northeastern Connecticut

      - Providence County is in northern Rhode Island


      2. Connecticut and Rhode Island share a border, with Rhode Island being north

      - Muscogee County, GA is on the GA-AL border, where Columbus, GA is located

      3. Making the comparison:

      - Muscogee County is approximately at the same latitude as Columbus, GA

      - Autauga County is slightly north of Montgomery, AL

      - Columbus, GA is noticeably south of Montgomery, AL


      4. Therefore, since Muscogee County is south of Montgomery, and Autauga County

    a2cfc11e-9d38-4554-863c-166cd66ca4f3: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let me consider the states:

      - Deer Lodge County is in Montana (MT)

      - Todd County is in Minnesota (MN)


      2) Montana and Minnesota are at roughly similar longitudes, but very different
      latitudes:

      - Montana is along the Canadian border

      - Minnesota is also northern, but not quite as far north as Montana


      3) Within these states:

      - Todd County is in central Minnesota

      - Deer Lodge County is in western Montana


      4) Comparing latitudes:

      - Minnesota is generally south of Montana

      - Therefore, any county in Montana (including Deer Lodge) will be north of most
      Minnesota counties (including Todd)


      Since Deer Lodge County, MT is north of Todd County, MN, it cannot be south
      of it.
