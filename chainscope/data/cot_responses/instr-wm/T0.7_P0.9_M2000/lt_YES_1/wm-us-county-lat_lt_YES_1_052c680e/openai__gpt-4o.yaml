      1. **Culberson County, TX**: This county is located in the western part of Texas.
      It is known for containing the Guadalupe Mountains, which include the highest
      point in Texas, Guadalupe Peak.


      2. **Concordia Parish, LA**: This parish is located in the eastern part of Louisiana,

      - **Latitude of Culberson County, TX**: The county is roughly around 31 to 32
      degrees North latitude.

      - **Latitude of Concordia Parish, LA**: This parish is approximately at 31.5
      degrees North latitude.


      Comparing their latitudinal positions:


      - Since Concordia Parish is at approximately 31.5 degrees North and Culberson
