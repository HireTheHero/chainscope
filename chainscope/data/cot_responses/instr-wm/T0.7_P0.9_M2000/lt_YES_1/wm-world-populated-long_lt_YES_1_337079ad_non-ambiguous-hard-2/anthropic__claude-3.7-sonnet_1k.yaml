      Step 1: Identify where Santo Domingo Oeste is located.

      Santo Domingo Oeste is a municipality in the Dominican Republic. It''s the western
      part of the greater Santo Domingo area. The Dominican Republic is located in
      the Caribbean, in the western hemisphere.


      Step 2: Identify where Mira, Veneto is located.

      Mira is a town in the Veneto region of northeastern Italy. Italy is located
      in southern Europe, in the eastern hemisphere.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      When we look at a world map, the Dominican Republic (where Santo Domingo Oeste
      is) lies far to the west of Italy (where Mira, Veneto is). The Americas are
      west of Europe in terms of longitude.


      Therefore, YES, Santo Domingo Oeste is located west of Mira, Veneto.'

      New Jersey.</think>To determine if Lockeford, California is located west of
      Bernardsville, New Jersey, I''ll compare their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Consider the states these cities are in.

      - Lockeford is in California

      - Bernardsville is in New Jersey


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - New Jersey is on the east coast of the United States

      - California is significantly west of New Jersey


      Step 3: Since both cities are in their respective states, their relative positions
      follow the same pattern.

      about the relative positions of two places in the United States: Lockeford,
      California and Bernardsville, New Jersey.


      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1. Lockeford is in California, which is on the west coast of the United States.

      2. Bernardsville is in New Jersey, which is on the east coast of the United
      States.

      3. In the United States, states on the west coast (like California) are west
      of states on the east coast (like New Jersey).


      Therefore, Lockeford, California would be west of Bernardsville, New Jersey.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Let''s identify the locations of these two places.

      - Lockeford is in California, which is on the west coast of the United States.

      - Bernardsville is in New Jersey, which is on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geography of the United States.

      - California is located on the far western side of the continental United States.

      - New Jersey is located on the far eastern side of the continental United States.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Moving from east to west across the United States, you would start at the
      Atlantic coast (where New Jersey is), cross the country, and reach the Pacific
      coast (where California is).

      - Therefore, California is west of New Jersey.


      Step 4: Since Lockeford is in California and Bernardsville is in New Jersey,
      Lockeford must be west of Bernardsville.


      YES'

      if Lockeford, California is located west of Bernardsville, New Jersey.


      To solve this, I need to consider the relative positions of California and New
      Jersey within the United States:


      1. California is a state on the west coast of the United States.

      2. New Jersey is a state on the east coast of the United States.


      Since California is on the west coast and New Jersey is on the east coast, any
      city in California (including Lockeford) would be west of any city in New Jersey
      (including Bernardsville).


      The United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic Ocean
      (east), with California bordering the Pacific and New Jersey near the Atlantic.
      Given the continental arrangement of the US, California cities are definitely
      west of New Jersey cities.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:

      - Is Barsoi located west of Beaufort, Victoria?


      First, I need to identify where these two places are:


      1. Barsoi - I believe Barsoi is a town in India, specifically in the Bihar state.

      2. Beaufort, Victoria - Beaufort is a town in Victoria, Australia.


      Now I need to determine their relative positions:

      - Barsoi, India is in South Asia

      - Beaufort, Victoria is in southeastern Australia


      Looking at global geography, India is west of Australia in general. Since Barsoi
      is in India and Beaufort is in Australia, Barsoi would be west of Beaufort,
      Victoria.


      Let me double-check the direction: Going from Australia to India, you would
      travel northwest/west. So indeed, Barsoi (India) is west of Beaufort, Victoria
      (Australia).</think># Is Barsoi located west of Beaufort, Victoria?


      I need to identify the locations of both places and determine their relative
      positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Barsoi is a town located in the Bihar state of India, in South Asia.

      - Beaufort is a town in Victoria, which is a state in southeastern Australia.


      ## Step 2: Determine their relative positions

      - India is located to the northwest of Australia on a world map.

      - When comparing locations across continents, I need to consider global east-west
      positioning.

      - India (where Barsoi is located) is in the Eastern Hemisphere but sits significantly
      west of Australia (where Beaufort, Victoria is located).


      ## Step 3: Reach a conclusion

      Since Barsoi (in India) is positioned to the west of Beaufort, Victoria (in
      Australia) on a global map, the answer is:


      YES'

      Let me start with Beaufort, Victoria. I know that Victoria is a state in Australia,
      located in the southeastern part of the country. Beaufort is a town in Victoria,
      Australia.


      Now for Barsoi - I need to determine where this is. Barsoi could be:

      - A town in Russia (I believe there is a place called Barsoi in Russia)

      - It might also be a place in India

      - Or it could be somewhere else


      If Barsoi is in Russia or India, it would be in the northern hemisphere and
      likely to the west of Australia (as Australia is in the southern hemisphere

      Let me think about what I know about these places:


      1. Bhiwapur: I believe Bhiwapur is a town in India, likely in central or eastern
      India.


      2. Nusa Kambangan: Nusa Kambangan is an island in Indonesia, south of Java.


      Now, I need to determine their relative positions. India is located to the west

      Asia.


      Since Bhiwapur is in India and Nusa Kambangan is in Indonesia, Bhiwapur would
      be located to the west of Nusa Kambangan.


      Let me double-check my reasoning:

      - India is west of Indonesia on a world map

      - Bhiwapur is in India

      - Nusa Kambangan is in Indonesia

      - Therefore, Bhiwapur is west of Nusa Kambangan</think>I need to determine the
      locations of both places and compare their positions east-west.


      Step 1: Identify where Bhiwapur is located.

      Bhiwapur is a town in Maharashtra state in India.


      Step 2: Identify where Nusa Kambangan is located.

      Nusa Kambangan is an island in Indonesia, located off the southern coast of
      Java.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      India is located in South Asia, while Indonesia is in Southeast Asia. On a world
      map, India lies to the west of Indonesia.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Bhiwapur is in India and Nusa Kambangan is in Indonesia, and India is
      west of Indonesia, Bhiwapur is indeed west of Nusa Kambangan.

      \ mentioned:\n\n1) **Stoke Bardolph** is a village located in Nottinghamshire,\
      \ England, in the United Kingdom.\n\n2) **Mpumalanga** is a province in northeastern\
      \ South Africa.\n\n3) **KwaZulu-Natal** is another province in eastern South\
      \ Africa.\n\nThe question refers to \"Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal\" which seems\
      \ to suggest a place called Mpumalanga within KwaZulu-Natal, though these are\
      \ typically separate provinces. Regardless of whether it's referring to the\
      \ province Mpumalanga or a place in KwaZulu-Natal, both would be in South Africa.\n\
      \nTo determine east-west positioning, I need to compare longitudes:\n- The United\
      \ Kingdom (including Stoke Bardolph) is roughly between 10\xB0W and 2\xB0E longitude\n\
      - South Africa (including both Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal) is roughly between\
      \ 16\xB0E and 33\xB0E longitude\n\nSince South Africa is significantly further\
      \ east in terms of longitude than the UK, Stoke Bardolph is indeed west of any\
      \ location in South Africa.\n\n# Answer: YES"

      \nNow, regarding \"Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal\" - there's something potentially\

      Europe.


      2. Amethi district: Amethi is a district in the state of Uttar Pradesh in northern
      India.


      Now I need to determine their relative positions. Lithuania is in Europe, while

      Pechorsky District is likely in Russia, specifically I believe it''s in Pskov
      Oblast in the western part of Russia, near the border with Estonia and Latvia.


      Kondagaon district is in India, specifically in the state of Chhattisgarh in

      Given their locations:

      - Pechorsky District is in western Russia

      - Kondagaon district is in central India


      When comparing east-west positions globally, locations in Russia would generally
      be west of locations in India. Russia is primarily in Europe and northern Asia,
      while India is in South Asia. Moving from west to east globally, the order is

      Step 4: Make the determination.

      When comparing longitudinal positions, Pechorsky District (in western Russia)
      has a smaller longitude value than Kondagaon district (in central India), which
      means it is further west.

      district, I need to identify where both of these places are located.


      Step 1: Identify Pechorsky District''s location.

      Pechorsky District is located in Pskov Oblast in western Russia, near the border
      with Estonia. This places it in Eastern Europe.


      Step 2: Identify Kondagaon district''s location.

      Kondagaon district is located in the state of Chhattisgarh in central India.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on a global east-west axis.

      When we look at the global map, Russia is positioned west and north of India.
      Specifically, western Russia (where Pechorsky District is) is significantly
      west of central India (where Kondagaon district is).


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Given their respective locations, Pechorsky District is indeed west of Kondagaon
      district (as well as being north of it).

      Step 2: Identify Arakawa, Tokyo.

      Arakawa is a special ward (district) of Tokyo, Japan. Tokyo is located on the
      eastern side of Japan, which itself is in East Asia.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions globally.

      - Japan is positioned in East Asia

      - Tajikistan is in Central Asia

      - Central Asia is west of East Asia

      - Therefore, Tajikistan (where Tursunzoda is) is west of Japan (where Arakawa,
      Tokyo is)

    156286bd-446b-49a5-9483-5508dffaab38: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine:


      1. Where is Co-op City, Bronx located?

      2. Where is Rivercess County located?

      3. Is Co-op City, Bronx west of Rivercess County?


      Let me start with Co-op City, Bronx:

      Co-op City is a residential development located in the northeast part of the
      Bronx, which is a borough of New York City in the United States. The Bronx is
      located on the east coast of the United States.


      Now for Rivercess County:

      Rivercess County is a county in Liberia, which is a country in West Africa.
      Liberia is on the west coast of Africa.


      Now I need to compare their positions globally:

      - Co-op City, Bronx is in North America, specifically in the eastern United
      States.

      - Rivercess County is in West Africa.


      When considering global east-west positioning, Africa is east of the Americas.
      The United States (including New York/Bronx) is west of Africa (including Liberia/Rivercess
      County).


      Therefore, Co-op City, Bronx would be located west of Rivercess County.</think>I
      need to determine the geographical locations of both places and compare their
      east-west positioning.


      Step 1: Identify where Co-op City, Bronx is located.

      Co-op City is in the Bronx, which is a borough of New York City in the United
      States. The United States is located in North America.


      Step 2: Identify where Rivercess County is located.

      Rivercess County is a county in Liberia, which is a country on the west coast
      of Africa.


      Step 3: Compare their global positions.

      When we look at a world map, North America (including the United States) is
      west of Africa (including Liberia) when considering global east-west positioning.
      The Atlantic Ocean separates these two continents.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since the United States is west of Africa on a global scale, Co-op City in the
      Bronx would be west of Rivercess County in Liberia.


      Answer: YES'

      \n2. Rivercess County is a county in Liberia, which is a country on the west\

      \ County.\n\nWait, actually let me double-check my understanding of longitude.\
      \ The more negative the longitude (or the higher the \xB0W), the further west\
      \ a location is. So:\n- Bronx at around 74\xB0W \n- Rivercess County at around\
      \ 9\xB0W\n\nThis means the Bronx is further west, because 74\xB0W is more westerly\
      \ than 9\xB0W.\n\nActually, I should verify this. West longitude increases as\
      \ you go west. So 74\xB0W is indeed further west than 9\xB0W. \n\nSo Co-op City,\
      \ Bronx is NOT west of Rivercess County. It's east of it.\n\nLet me triple-check\
      \ this. The prime meridian (0\xB0) runs through Greenwich, London. Locations\
      \ west of this have W longitudes, locations east have E longitudes. Within the\
      \ Western hemisphere, the further west you go, the higher the W longitude number.\n\
      \nNew York is around 74\xB0W\nLiberia is around 9\xB0W\n\nSo New York (including\
      \ the Bronx and Co-op City) is further west than Liberia (including Rivercess\

      \ a country on the west coast of Africa.\n\nStep 2: Determine their approximate\
      \ longitudes.\n- The Bronx (including Co-op City) is located at approximately\
      \ 73-74\xB0 West longitude.\n- Rivercess County in Liberia is located at approximately\
      \ 9\xB0 West longitude.\n\nStep 3: Compare the longitudes.\n- The higher the\

    6cf0d6f0-fbf8-488b-b44b-c01bf53a9060: '<think>This question asks about the relative
      location of two places: Co-op City in the Bronx, and Rivercess County.


      Let''s identify these places:

      1. Co-op City is a large housing development in the Bronx, which is a borough
      of New York City, USA. The Bronx is located in the northeastern United States.


      2. Rivercess County is a county in Liberia, which is a country in West Africa.

      Given the information I have, if Vinger refers to the location in Norway, then
      yes, it is west of Zirakpur.</think>I need to determine the locations of both
      places to answer this question.


      Step 1: Identify Zirakpur.

      Zirakpur is a city located in Punjab, India, near Chandigarh in northern India.


      Step 2: Identify Vinger.

      Vinger appears to refer to a location in Norway (associated with Kongsvinger
      municipality).


      Step 3: Compare their global positions.

      Norway is in Northern Europe, while India is in South Asia.

      Europe is located west of Asia on the world map.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Norway (where Vinger is located) is west of India (where Zirakpur is located),
      Vinger is west of Zirakpur.

      First, let me identify where Gopalpur, Odisha is:

      - Gopalpur is a town in the state of Odisha (formerly Orissa) in India

      - Odisha is on the eastern coast of India, along the Bay of Bengal

      - So Gopalpur is in eastern India


      Now I need to identify where Koltur is:

      - Koltur is a small island in the Faroe Islands

      - The Faroe Islands are an archipelago located in the North Atlantic Ocean,
      between Norway, Scotland, and Iceland

      - The Faroe Islands are far west of India


      Given these locations:

      - Gopalpur, Odisha is in eastern India

      - Koltur is in the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic


      Comparing their longitudes, Koltur (in the North Atlantic) is clearly west of

      Step 1: Identify Gopalpur, Odisha.

      Gopalpur is a town located in the state of Odisha (formerly Orissa) on the eastern
      coast of India, along the Bay of Bengal.


      Step 2: Identify Koltur.

      Koltur is a small island in the Faroe Islands, which is an archipelago located
      in the North Atlantic Ocean between Norway, Iceland, and Scotland.


      Step 3: Compare their geographical positions.

      The Faroe Islands are located in the North Atlantic, west of Europe, while Gopalpur
      is on the eastern coast of India in Asia. Looking at a world map, the Faroe
      Islands (including Koltur) are significantly west of India.


      Step 4: Determine the answer based on longitude.

      Since Koltur (in the North Atlantic) is west of all of India, it must be west

      Frisco, North Carolina is a small town on the Outer Banks of North Carolina,
      on the east coast of the United States.


      Now I need to determine where Belhar is. Belhar could refer to a few places:

      1. Belhar, South Africa - a suburb of Cape Town

      2. Possibly other locations named Belhar that I''m not immediately familiar
      with


      If Belhar refers to Belhar, South Africa:

      - South Africa is on the eastern side of the Atlantic Ocean

      - North Carolina, USA is on the western side of the Atlantic Ocean

      - Places in the USA are generally west of places in South Africa when considering
      global position


      Let me check if there''s a Belhar in the United States that would make more
      sense for this comparison...


      I don''t recall a notable Belhar in the United States. So assuming this refers
      to Belhar, South Africa:


      Frisco, North Carolina would be west of Belhar, South Africa, because North
      America is west of Africa when looking at a world map.</think>To answer this
      question, I need to determine the locations of both places and compare their
      positions.


      First, let me identify Frisco, North Carolina:

      - Frisco is a small town located on Hatteras Island in the Outer Banks of North
      Carolina, USA

      - It''s on the eastern coast of the United States


      Next, I need to identify Belhar:

      - Belhar is most likely referring to Belhar, South Africa, which is a suburb
      of Cape Town

      - It''s located on the western coast of South Africa


      Comparing their global positions:

      - North America is west of Africa in terms of global longitude

      - The United States (including North Carolina) is on the western side of the
      Atlantic Ocean

      - South Africa is on the eastern side of the Atlantic Ocean


      Therefore, Frisco, North Carolina is located WEST of Belhar, South Africa.

      1. I need to determine the locations of Franzensfeste and Bhagalpur division.

      2. Then I need to compare their relative positions to determine if Franzensfeste

      Franzensfeste:

      Franzensfeste (also known as Fortezza) is a municipality in South Tyrol, northern
      Italy. It''s in the Alps, in central Europe.


      Bhagalpur division:

      Bhagalpur is an administrative division in the state of Bihar, India.

      - Italy is in Europe

      - India is in Asia

      - Europe is west of Asia

      1. Crofton, British Columbia, Canada - British Columbia is the westernmost province
      of Canada, located on the Pacific coast.


      2. Huntington County, Indiana, USA - Indiana is a state in the Midwestern United

      side of North America.


      Indiana is in the Midwest of the United States, which is much more eastern than
      British Columbia.


      So, if we consider longitude (east-west positioning), British Columbia is west
      of Indiana. Since Crofton is in British Columbia, and Huntington County is in
      Indiana, it follows that Crofton, British Columbia is west of Huntington County,
      Indiana.</think># Is Crofton, British Columbia located west of Huntington County,

      - Indiana is a state in the Midwestern United States.

      - Huntington County is in the northeastern part of Indiana.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes (east-west positions).

      - Locations on the Pacific coast of North America are significantly west of

      - Mirchaiya is a location I need to identify

      - Putuo District is in Zhoushan (which is in China)


      First, let me recall where Putuo District, Zhoushan is:

      Zhoushan is a city in Zhejiang Province in eastern China. It''s a coastal city
      located east of Shanghai and Hangzhou. Putuo District is one of the districts
      of Zhoushan. So Putuo District is in eastern China.


      Now, where is Mirchaiya?

      Mirchaiya is a town in Nepal, a landlocked country in South Asia. Nepal is located

      Putuo District is located in Zhoushan city, which is in Zhejiang Province in
      eastern China. As part of the Zhoushan archipelago, it sits on the eastern coast
      of China in the East China Sea.


      Step 2: Identify Mirchaiya.

      Mirchaiya is a town located in southeastern Nepal, in Siraha District.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Nepal is a landlocked country in South Asia, situated west of China. Since Mirchaiya

      to determine the locations of two places:

      1. Knott County, Kentucky (in the USA)

      2. ''s-Graveland (I need to identify which country this is in)


      Then I need to compare their longitudes to determine if Knott County is west
      of ''s-Graveland.


      First, let''s locate Knott County, Kentucky:

      - Kentucky is a state in the eastern United States

      - Knott County is in eastern Kentucky

      - Eastern United States would be roughly around 80-85 degrees West longitude


      Now for ''s-Graveland:

      - Based on the name with "''s-" prefix, this appears to be a Dutch location

      - The Netherlands is in Western Europe

      - Western Europe is roughly around 0-10 degrees East longitude


      Since Knott County, Kentucky is at approximately 80-85 degrees West longitude,
      and ''s-Graveland in the Netherlands would be at approximately 4-5 degrees East
      longitude, Knott County is clearly west of ''s-Graveland.

      of places in the Eastern Hemisphere (positive longitude/degrees East).</think>#
      Is Knott County, Kentucky located west of ''s-Graveland?


      I need to determine the relative locations of these two places.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Knott County is in Kentucky, which is a state in the eastern United States.

      - ''s-Graveland appears to be a Dutch place (based on the distinctive "''s-"
      prefix common in Dutch place names).


      ## Step 2: Determine their approximate longitudes

      - Knott County, Kentucky is in North America, specifically in the eastern United
      States, which would have a longitude of roughly 80-85 degrees West.

      - ''s-Graveland in the Netherlands is in Western Europe, which would have a
      longitude of approximately 4-5 degrees East.


      ## Step 3: Compare the longitudes

      - Knott County is in the Western Hemisphere (negative longitude)

      - ''s-Graveland is in the Eastern Hemisphere (positive longitude)

      - Any location in the Western Hemisphere is west of any location in the Eastern
      Hemisphere


      Therefore, YES, Knott County, Kentucky is located west of ''s-Graveland.'

      Jubb al-Safa: This appears to be a place in the Middle East, possibly in Syria

      1. I need to determine the locations of both Patcham and Charodinsky District.


      2. Patcham: I believe Patcham is an area located in or near Brighton, on the
      south coast of England, UK. Brighton is in West Sussex, in the south of England.


      3. Charodinsky District: I''m not completely certain about this location, but

      - Patcham is a suburb located in Brighton, in the southeast of England, United
      Kingdom.

      - Charodinsky District (also known as Charodinsky raion) is located in Dagestan,
      which is in the North Caucasus region of Russia.

      - The United Kingdom is in Western Europe

      - Russia (including Dagestan) is much further east, extending from Eastern Europe
      into Northern Asia

      - On a global map, the UK is significantly west of Russia


      ## Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship

      located to the west of Charodinsky District.

      3. Determine their relative positions (east-west relationship)


      Let me start with Patcham:

      Patcham is a suburban area located in the northern part of Brighton and Hove,
      a city on the south coast of England, United Kingdom.


      Now, let''s find Charodinsky District:

      I believe Charodinsky District (or Charodinsky Raion) is likely in Russia or

      - Patcham is in the UK, in Western Europe

      - Charodinsky District is likely in Russia or Eastern Europe


      Given the general geography, the UK is located west of Russia and Eastern Europe.
      Therefore, Patcham would be west of Charodinsky District.


      However, I should note that there''s some uncertainty here as I don''t have

      Patcham is a suburb in the northern part of Brighton and Hove, which is a city
      on the south coast of England in the United Kingdom. So Patcham is in Western
      Europe.


      Step 2: Identify where Charodinsky District is located.

      Charodinsky District (or Charodinsky Raion) is in the Republic of Dagestan,
      which is part of the Russian Federation. It''s located in the North Caucasus
      region, in the southernmost part of European Russia.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      The United Kingdom is located in Western Europe, while Russia (including Dagestan)
      is much further east. On a world map, the UK clearly lies to the west of Russia.

      I need to determine if Bui (a department in Cameroon) is located west of Birur.


      First, I need to identify where these places are:


      1. Bui is a department in Cameroon, which is a country in Central Africa.

      2. I need to determine where Birur is. I believe Birur is a town in Karnataka
      state, India.


      Now I need to compare their longitudes to determine if Bui is west of Birur:

      - Cameroon is in Africa, which is west of India

      - Therefore, Bui (in Cameroon) would be west of Birur (in India)


      Let me double-check this reasoning. Africa is definitely west of India when
      looking at a world map. Cameroon is in Central/West Africa, while India is in
      South Asia. So a location in Cameroon would be west of a location in India.</think>To
      answer this question, I''ll need to determine the locations of both places and
      compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Bui is a department in Cameroon, which is a country in Central/West Africa.

      - Birur is a town in Karnataka state, India, which is in South Asia.


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      - Cameroon is located in Africa, which is west of India on the world map.

      - Africa and India are separated by the Arabian Sea and parts of the Middle
      East.

      - Any location in Cameroon would be west of any location in India.


      Step 3: Reach a conclusion.

      Since Bui is in Cameroon (Africa) and Birur is in India (Asia), and Africa is
      west of India, Bui is indeed west of Birur.

      in East Africa.


      Step 2: Identify where Borivali is located.

      Borivali is a suburb located in the western part of Mumbai, India. India is
      in South Asia.

      is in East Africa, while Mumbai (containing Borivali) is in western India.


      Step 4: Determine their east-west relationship.

      Even though Rwanda is in "East" Africa, the entire African continent is still
      west of India on a global scale. Therefore, Gicumbi District in Rwanda is located
      west of Borivali in India.

      Bessbrook is a village in County Armagh, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom. It''s
      located in western Europe.


      Bungeni - I need to identify where this is. Based on the name, it sounds like
      it might be in Africa or Asia, but I need to be certain.


      After searching my knowledge, Bungeni appears to be a place in South Africa,
      in the eastern part of the country.


      If Bessbrook is in Northern Ireland (western Europe) and Bungeni is in South
      Africa (eastern part of Africa), then we need to compare their longitudes:


      Northern Ireland is roughly around 5-8 degrees West longitude.

      South Africa''s eastern areas would be around 30 degrees East longitude.


      So Bessbrook (in Western Europe) would be west of Bungeni (in Eastern Africa).
      When comparing places on a global east-west basis, we look at their position
      relative to the Prime Meridian (0 degrees longitude). Places in Western Europe
      typically have western longitudes while places in Eastern/Southern Africa typically
      have eastern longitudes.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the location of Bessbrook.

      Bessbrook is a village in County Armagh, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom. It''s
      located in the British Isles in Western Europe.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Bungeni.

      Bungeni is a small settlement located in the Limpopo province of South Africa,
      in the eastern part of Southern Africa.


      Step 3: Compare their geographical positions.

      Northern Ireland (where Bessbrook is) is approximately between 5-8 degrees west
      longitude.

      Eastern South Africa (where Bungeni is) is approximately around 30 degrees east
      longitude.


      Step 4: Determine relative east-west positioning.

      When we compare these longitudes, Bessbrook (with western longitude) is clearly
      west of Bungeni (with eastern longitude).


      YES, Bessbrook is located west of Bungeni.'

      Bessbrook is a village in County Armagh, Northern Ireland, which is part of
      the United Kingdom. It''s located in western Europe.


      Bungeni might refer to a place in South Africa or possibly Kenya or another
      African country. Let me think about this.


      If Bungeni is in Africa, then it would generally be south and east of Europe.
      Africa is situated to the south and east of Europe.


      So if Bessbrook is in Northern Ireland (western Europe) and Bungeni is in Africa
      (which is southeast of Europe), then Bessbrook would be west of Bungeni.


      Actually, let me double-check the location of Bungeni. I believe there''s a
      Bungeni in South Africa, in the Eastern Cape province. South Africa is definitely

      Bungeni is a settlement in South Africa, located in the Limpopo province in
      the eastern part of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      determine if Inishvickillane is located west of Arba Minch. To do this, I need
      to know where both places are located.


      Inishvickillane is one of the Blasket Islands, which are off the western coast
      of Ireland. Ireland is in Western Europe.


      Arba Minch is a city in southern Ethiopia, which is in East Africa.

      1. Rowan County, North Carolina is in the United States, specifically in the
      state of North Carolina which is on the east coast of the United States.


      2. Now I need to identify where Ballyronan is. Ballyronan is a village in Northern
      Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, located on the western side of
      Europe.


      3. Now I need to compare their positions globally. The United States is located
      to the west of Europe across the Atlantic Ocean. This means that locations in
      the United States are generally west of locations in Europe.


      4. Specifically, North Carolina is on the east coast of the US, but it''s still
      considerably west of any location in Europe/UK.


      5. Therefore, Rowan County, North Carolina would be west of Ballyronan, Northern

      1) First, I need to identify where Rowan County, North Carolina is located.
      Rowan County is in the state of North Carolina, USA, which is on the eastern

      2) Next, I need to determine where Ballyronan is located. Ballyronan is a village
      in Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, located in western
      Europe.


      3) When comparing global positions, I need to consider longitude (east-west
      positioning). The United States is west of Europe across the Atlantic Ocean.


      4) Even though North Carolina is on the eastern coast of the United States,
      all of North America is still significantly west of the United Kingdom and Ireland
      on a global map.


      5) Therefore, Rowan County, North Carolina (in North America) is definitely
      west of Ballyronan (in Northern Ireland/UK).

      First, Smith County, Tennessee:

      - Smith County is a county in the state of Tennessee in the United States.

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States.


      Next, Crumpsall:

      - Crumpsall is an area in Manchester, England, in the United Kingdom.

      Let me think about these places:


      1. Rutigliano: I believe Rutigliano is a town in Italy, specifically in the
      Apulia region in southern Italy.


      2. Luxettipet: Luxettipet appears to be a town in India, likely in Telangana
      state.


      Now I need to determine their relative east-west positions. Italy is in Europe,
      while India is in Asia. Geographically, Europe is west of Asia. Therefore, a
      town in Italy would be west of a town in India.


      So Rutigliano (in Italy) would be west of Luxettipet (in India).</think># Is
      Rutigliano located west of Luxettipet?


      I''ll find the locations of both places and compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify Rutigliano''s location.

      Rutigliano is a town in southern Italy, in the Apulia (Puglia) region.


      Step 2: Identify Luxettipet''s location.

      Luxettipet is a town in Telangana state in central-southern India.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      Italy is in Europe, and India is in Asia. On a world map, Europe is positioned
      to the west of Asia.


      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison.

      Since Rutigliano is in Italy (Europe) and Luxettipet is in India (Asia), and
      Europe is west of Asia, Rutigliano is located west of Luxettipet.

      Rutigliano is likely in Italy, particularly in southern Italy in the Puglia

      Luxettipet sounds like it might be in India, possibly in the southern or central
      part.


      If Rutigliano is in Italy and Luxettipet is in India, then we need to determine

      Italy is in Europe, which is west of Asia, where India is located.

      Luxettipet is a town in the state of Telangana in India.

      Italy is in Europe, while India is in South Asia. On a world map, Europe is

      of Timor.


      Now, for "Ghasm" - I''m not immediately familiar with a major place called Ghasm.
      Let me consider possibilities:

      1. There might be a place called Ghasm that I''m not familiar with

      2. This could be a misspelling or alternative spelling of another place

      3. "Ghasm" might not be a real location


      Since I can''t confirm the existence or location of a place called "Ghasm" with
      confidence, I can''t determine its position relative to Viqueque.


      However, if we assume there is a place called Ghasm, I would need to know its
      coordinates or general location to determine if it''s west of Viqueque.


      Given the information available to me, I don''t have enough data to determine
      if Ghasm is west of Viqueque.</think>I need to determine the locations of both
      places to answer this question.


      First, I can identify that Viqueque is a municipality and town in East Timor
      (Timor-Leste), located in the southeastern part of the country.


      For Ghasm, I need to determine its location. Based on my knowledge, I don''t
      recognize "Ghasm" as a widely known geographic location or settlement. I don''t
      have information about a place with this specific name in my database.


      Since I cannot confirm the existence or location of a place called "Ghasm" with
      certainty, I cannot determine its position relative to Viqueque.


      Without being able to establish where Ghasm is located, I cannot provide a definitive
      YES or NO answer to whether it is west of Viqueque.'

      of Ghasm and Viqueque to determine their relative positions.


      First, let me identify where Viqueque is. Viqueque is a town in East Timor (Timor-Leste),
      which is located on the eastern half of the island of Timor in Southeast Asia.


      Now I need to identify where Ghasm is. I''m not immediately familiar with a
      place called "Ghasm". Let me think if this could be:

      1. A town or city in East Timor or nearby countries

      2. A region in another part of the world

      3. Possibly a place in the Middle East (based on the spelling)


      I believe "Ghasm" might refer to a place in the Arabian Peninsula, possibly
      in Saudi Arabia, Yemen, or Oman, based on the spelling pattern that resembles
      Arabic transliteration. If that''s the case, the Middle East is significantly
      west of East Timor (where Viqueque is located).


      However, I should be cautious as I don''t have definitive information about
      a place called "Ghasm". If it''s indeed in the Middle East, then it would be
      west of Viqueque. If it''s a small local place in East Timor or nearby that
      I''m not familiar with, I would need more specific information.


      Based on my geographical knowledge and the likely location of Ghasm in the Middle
      East, I believe Ghasm is west of Viqueque.</think>To answer whether Ghasm is
      located west of Viqueque, I need to determine the locations of both places.


      Viqueque is a town and municipality located in East Timor (Timor-Leste), which
      is in Southeast Asia on the eastern half of Timor island.


      For Ghasm, I need to identify its location. Based on my geographical knowledge,
      there isn''t a well-known major city or region called "Ghasm" that appears on
      standard world maps. If Ghasm refers to a location in the Middle East (which
      seems plausible based on the name''s spelling pattern that resembles Arabic
      transliteration), then it would be located west of East Timor, as the Middle
      East is significantly west of Southeast Asia.


      However, without being able to confirm the precise location of Ghasm, I cannot
      give a definitive answer.


      NO (I cannot confirm this with certainty due to insufficient information about

      of India.


      Step 2: Identify where Smithfield, Queensland is located.

      Smithfield is in Queensland, which is in the northeastern part of Australia.

      and India is in Asia. Geographically, India is east of Europe. Therefore, Bulgaria
      (where Veliki Preslav is) is west of India (where Mopidevi is).


      So the answer would be YES, Veliki Preslav (in Bulgaria) is located west of
      Mopidevi (in India).</think>To answer this question, I need to identify the
      locations of both places and determine their east-west relationship.


      Step 1: Identify where Veliki Preslav is located.

      Veliki Preslav is a town in northeastern Bulgaria, which is in southeastern
      Europe.


      Step 2: Identify where Mopidevi is located.

      Mopidevi is a town in Andhra Pradesh state in southeastern India.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      Bulgaria is in Europe while India is in Asia. Looking at a world map, India
      is significantly east of Bulgaria. Europe is west of India on the Eurasian continent.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Veliki Preslav is in Bulgaria (Europe) and Mopidevi is in India (Asia),
      and Europe is west of India, Veliki Preslav must be west of Mopidevi.

      1. I need to determine the locations of Veliki Preslav and Mopidevi.

      2. Then I need to compare their positions to see if Veliki Preslav is west of
      Mopidevi.


      Veliki Preslav is a town in northeastern Bulgaria. Bulgaria is in Eastern Europe.


      Mopidevi is a village located in the Krishna district of the Indian state of
      Andhra Pradesh. India is in South Asia.


      Now, if we look at a world map, Europe is west of Asia. Bulgaria (where Veliki
      Preslav is) is in Eastern Europe, while India (where Mopidevi is) is in South
      Asia.


      Since Bulgaria is west of India on the globe, Veliki Preslav is west of Mopidevi.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to identify the locations of both places and determine
      their relative positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Veliki Preslav is a town in northeastern Bulgaria, which is in Eastern Europe.

      - Mopidevi is a village in the Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh state in India,
      which is in South Asia.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on a global east-west axis.

      - Bulgaria is located in Eastern Europe.

      - India is located in South Asia.

      - When looking at a world map, Europe is positioned west of India/South Asia.


      Step 3: Make the final determination.

      Since Bulgaria (where Veliki Preslav is) is west of India (where Mopidevi is)
      on a global scale, Veliki Preslav is indeed west of Mopidevi.

      1. I need to identify where Lika is located.

      2. I need to identify where Bargal is located.

      3. Then I need to determine if Lika is west of Bargal.


      Lika: Lika is a region in Croatia, located in the western part of the country,
      between the Adriatic Sea and the mountains of central Croatia.


      Bargal: Bargal (also spelled Bargaal) is a coastal town in northeastern Somalia,
      located on the Horn of Africa facing the Gulf of Aden.


      Now to determine their relative positions:

      - Croatia is in southeastern Europe

      - Somalia is in eastern Africa, specifically the Horn of Africa

      - Europe is generally west of Africa, and Croatia is in the western part of
      the Balkans

      - Somalia is on the easternmost projection of Africa (the Horn)


      So Lika (in Croatia) would be northwest of Bargal (in Somalia). Since northwest
      includes west, Lika is indeed west of Bargal.</think>To answer whether Lika
      is located west of Bargal, I need to identify the locations of both places and
      compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify Lika.

      Lika is a region in Croatia, located in southeastern Europe, specifically in
      the western part of Croatia between the Adriatic Sea and the mountains of central
      Croatia.


      Step 2: Identify Bargal.

      Bargal (also spelled Bargaal) is a coastal town located in northeastern Somalia,
      on the Horn of Africa, facing the Gulf of Aden.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Croatia is in Europe, which is west of Africa.

      Somalia is on the easternmost projection of Africa (the Horn of Africa).

      Therefore, Lika (in Croatia) is significantly west of Bargal (in Somalia) on
      a global map.

      1. I need to determine if Mascouche is located west of Shipley, West Sussex.

      2. First, I need to identify where these places are located.


      Mascouche is a city in Quebec, Canada, in North America.

      Shipley, West Sussex is a town in West Sussex, England, United Kingdom, in Europe.


      Now I need to compare their longitudes to determine which is further west.


      Canada is located in North America, which is west of Europe. The entire North
      American continent is west of Europe when looking at a world map.

      Step 2: Identify where Shipley, West Sussex is located.

      Shipley, West Sussex is a town in southern England, United Kingdom, located
      in Europe.


      Step 3: Compare their positions globally.

      1. Identify where Montebello, Quebec is located

      2. Identify where Cividale del Friuli is located

      3. Compare their longitudes


      Montebello, Quebec is in Canada, specifically in the province of Quebec. Canada
      is in North America, which is generally west of Europe in terms of longitude.


      Cividale del Friuli sounds like an Italian place, given the "del Friuli" designation.
      Friuli is a region in northeastern Italy, near the border with Slovenia.


      So:

      - Montebello, Quebec is in North America (Canada)

      - Cividale del Friuli is in Europe (Italy)


      Since North America is west of Europe across the Atlantic Ocean, Montebello
      would be west of Cividale del Friuli. Places in North America have western longitudes
      (negative numbers) while places in Europe have eastern longitudes (positive

      To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic locations of both

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Montebello, Quebec is located in eastern Canada, in North America.

      - Cividale del Friuli is located in northeastern Italy (in the Friuli region),
      in Europe.


      Step 2: Consider their positions globally.

      - North America is west of Europe when looking at a standard world map.

      - Quebec, while in eastern Canada, is still in North America and therefore west
      of any European location.

      - Italy is in southern Europe, with longitudes that are east (positive degrees)
      of the Prime Meridian.

      - Canada has longitudes that are west (negative degrees) of the Prime Meridian.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Since Montebello is in North America and Cividale del Friuli is in Europe, Montebello
      is located west of Cividale del Friuli.
