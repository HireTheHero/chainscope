      - There seems to be an error in the question as Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal

    ec4a22b7-b164-42c6-baeb-3f39e7515341: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. Pechorsky District is located in western Russia, specifically in Pskov Oblast
      near the Estonian border.


      2. Kondagaon district is located in central India, in the state of Chhattisgarh.


      3. When comparing locations on a world map:

      - Russia is significantly north and west of India

      - Pskov Oblast (containing Pechorsky) is in the western part of Russia

      - Chhattisgarh (containing Kondagaon) is in central India


      4. Therefore, Pechorsky District is west of Kondagaon district on a world map.

      1. First, I need to locate both places:

      - White County, Indiana is a county in the U.S. state of Indiana

      - La Vera (or La Vera Valley) is a region in Spain


      2. Now I can determine their relative positions:

      - White County, Indiana is in the United States, in North America

      - La Vera is in western Spain, in Europe


      3. When comparing locations across continents:

      - The United States is west of Europe

      - Therefore, any location in the United States is west of any location in Spain


      4. Since White County, Indiana is in the United States, it must be west of La
      Vera, Spain.

      1. First, I need to identify where Smith County, Tennessee is located

      - Smith County is a county in the U.S. state of Tennessee

      - Tennessee is in the southeastern United States


      2. Next, I need to identify where Crumpsall is located

      - Crumpsall is an area of Manchester, England

      - Manchester is in the United Kingdom


      3. Now I need to compare their locations globally

      - The United States is located west of the United Kingdom

      - Since Smith County is in the US, and Crumpsall is in the UK

      - Therefore Smith County must be west of Crumpsall
