      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to establish where Motobu is located.
      Motobu is a town situated on the northern part of Okinawa Island in Japan.


      2. **Locate Basti District**: Next, we need to find where Basti district is
      situated. Basti district is located in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India.


      3. **Compare Positions**: We should compare the geographical positions of both
      locations. Motobu is in Japan, while Basti district is in India. Since they
      are in different countries and continents, we need to assess their relative
      positions on a map.


      4. **Determine Direction**: To see if Basti district is west of Motobu, we look
      at the longitudinal coordinates. Japan (where Motobu is) is located to the east
      of India (where Basti is). Therefore, any location in India, including Basti
      district, is situated west of Motobu.

      Archipelago, located in the eastern part of China, specifically in Zhejiang
      Province. It is situated in the East China Sea.


      2. **Mirchaiya**: Mirchaiya is a municipality located in the southeastern part

      geographically.


      1. **Identify Patcham**: Patcham is a suburb of Brighton, located in East Sussex,
      England. It is situated to the north of Brighton city center.


      2. **Identify Charodinsky District**: Charodinsky District is located in the
      Republic of Buryatia, Russia. It is in the eastern part of the country, near
      Lake Baikal.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Now that we have identified the locations, we can
      analyze their positions relative to each other. Patcham (in the UK) is in the
      western part of the world, while Charodinsky District (in Russia) is in the
      eastern part of the world.


      4. **Determine Direction**: Since Patcham is in the UK and Charodinsky District
      is in Russia, Patcham is not located west of Charodinsky District, as they are
      in different countries and on different longitudes.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is:

      District is in Rwanda, we need to establish their relative positions. Borivali
      is situated to the east of Gicumbi District, as Rwanda is located to the southeast
      of India.


      Based on this reasoning, Gicumbi District is not west of Borivali.
