      \n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\n**Brandywine, Maryland:**\n- Brandywine\
      \ is a census-designated place (CDP) in Prince George's County, Maryland, USA.\n\
      - It's located in the eastern part of the United States, near the eastern seaboard.\n\

      \ (Ynys M\xF4n) in northwest Wales, United Kingdom.\n- It's situated in the\
      \ western part of the UK, facing the Irish Sea.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the\
      \ Geographical Coordinates\n\nTo compare the east-west positions of Brandywine\

      - Latitude: Approximately 53.31\xB0 N\n- Longitude: Approximately -4.14\xB0\
      \ W\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Longitudes\n\nNow, let's compare the longitudes\
      \ of Brandywine and Llanddona.\n\n- Brandywine: -76.85\xB0 W\n- Llanddona: -4.14\xB0\
      \ W\n\nSince both locations are west of the Prime Meridian (indicated by the\
      \ negative sign), we can compare their absolute values to determine which is\

      \ longitude of Llanddona: 4.14\xB0\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Results\n\nA location\
      \ with a higher absolute longitude value is farther west than a location with\
      \ a lower absolute longitude value.\n\n- Brandywine's longitude: 76.85\xB0\n\
      - Llanddona's longitude: 4.14\xB0\n\nSince 76.85\xB0 is greater than 4.14\xB0\

      Russia. It is situated in the northeastern part of European Russia, near the
      Ural Mountains.


      2. **Kondagaon District**: This district is located in the state of Chhattisgarh,
      India. It is situated in the central part of India.


      3. **Geographical Comparison**: Russia is located to the north of India. Pechorsky
      District is in the northeastern part of European Russia, while Kondagaon District
      is in central India. Given this, Pechorsky District is located north of Kondagaon
      District, not west.

    3c415d9b-ba55-4d8e-8d33-d9bb56088ac3: "Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether\
      \ U\xEDge is located west of Ko Kret. At first glance, these places don't sound\
      \ familiar to me, so I need to break this down step by step.\n\n### Step 1:\
      \ Identify the Locations\n\n**U\xEDge:** I recall hearing about U\xEDge in the\
      \ context of African geography. Let me think\u2014U\xEDge is a province in Angola.\
      \ Yes, that's correct. U\xEDge is indeed a province located in the northwestern\
      \ part of Angola.\n\n**Ko Kret:** This name sounds Thai to me. I remember hearing\
      \ about Ko Kret in relation to Thailand. Specifically, Ko Kret is an island\
      \ located in the Chao Phraya River near Bangkok.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the\
      \ Geographic Coordinates\n\nTo find out if U\xEDge is west of Ko Kret, I need\
      \ to know the approximate longitudes of both locations.\n\n**U\xEDge, Angola:**\n\
      - U\xEDge is in northwestern Angola. Looking at a map, Angola is on the western\
      \ side of Africa.\n- The approximate longitude of U\xEDge is around 15\xB0 East.\n\
      \n**Ko Kret, Thailand:**\n- Ko Kret is near Bangkok in central Thailand.\n-\
      \ The approximate longitude of Bangkok is around 100\xB0 East.\n\n### Step 3:\
      \ Compare the Longitudes\n\nLongitude measures how far east or west a location\
      \ is from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0 longitude). Here's how the longitudes compare:\n\
      \n- U\xEDge: ~15\xB0 East\n- Ko Kret: ~100\xB0 East\n\nSince 15\xB0 East is\
      \ less than 100\xB0 East, U\xEDge is further west than Ko Kret.\n\n### Step\
      \ 4: Consider the Earth's Curvature\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the\
      \ Earth is a sphere, and longitudes wrap around. However, since we're dealing\
      \ with locations that are both east of the Prime Meridian, the direct comparison\
      \ holds.\n\n### Step 5: Final Verification\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I'll refer\
      \ to a map or reliable geographic sources.\n\n- **U\xEDge, Angola:** Located\
      \ at approximately 15\xB0 East longitude.\n- **Ko Kret, Thailand:** Located\
      \ at approximately 100\xB0 East longitude.\n\nConfirming this, U\xEDge is indeed\
      \ west of Ko Kret.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter breaking down the locations, identifying\
      \ their longitudes, and comparing them, it's clear that U\xEDge is located west\
      \ of Ko Kret.\n\n**Final Answer: YES, U\xEDge is located west of Ko Kret.**"

    cb07f822-95de-4487-b252-c9d1d28626b3: "Alright, let's tackle this question step\
      \ by step. The goal is to determine whether Nadvirna is located west of Thisayanvilai.\
      \ To do this, we'll need to identify the locations of both places and understand\
      \ their geographical positions relative to each other.\n\n### Step 1: Identify\
      \ the Locations\n\nFirst, I need to know where Nadvirna and Thisayanvilai are\
      \ located. A quick search reveals:\n\n- **Nadvirna**: This is a city in western\
      \ Ukraine, specifically in the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast.\n  \n- **Thisayanvilai**:\
      \ This appears to be a village located in the Tirunelveli district of the Indian\
      \ state of Tamil Nadu.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Geographical Coordinates\n\
      \nNext, to determine the relative positions, it's helpful to look at their geographical\
      \ coordinates:\n\n- **Nadvirna**: Approximately 48.9827\xB0 N latitude and 24.5769\xB0\
      \ E longitude.\n  \n- **Thisayanvilai**: Approximately 8.6700\xB0 N latitude\
      \ and 77.5300\xB0 E longitude.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Longitudes\n\nThe\
      \ key to determining if one place is west of another is to compare their longitudes.\
      \ Longitude measures how far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian\
      \ (0\xB0 longitude), which runs through Greenwich, England.\n\n- **Nadvirna**:\
      \ 24.5769\xB0 E\n- **Thisayanvilai**: 77.5300\xB0 E\n\nSince lower longitude\
      \ values are further west, and higher values are further east, we can see that\
      \ Nadvirna has a lower longitude than Thisayanvilai.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze\
      \ the Findings\n\nGiven that Nadvirna has a longitude of 24.5769\xB0 E and Thisayanvilai\
      \ has a longitude of 77.5300\xB0 E, Nadvirna is indeed located west of Thisayanvilai.\n\
      \n### Step 5: Consider Time Zones and Distances\n\nTo further confirm, I can\
      \ consider the time zones:\n\n- **Nadvirna**: Eastern European Time (EET), UTC\
      \ +2.\n- **Thisayanvilai**: Indian Standard Time (IST), UTC +5:30.\n\nThe difference\
      \ in time zones also indicates that Thisayanvilai is further east than Nadvirna,\
      \ as it has a higher UTC offset.\n\n### Step 6: Cross-Verification with Maps\n\
      \nLooking at a world map, Ukraine is positioned to the west of India. Specifically,\
      \ Nadvirna in western Ukraine is significantly west of Thisayanvilai in southern\
      \ India.\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\n\nAfter examining the geographical coordinates,\
      \ longitudes, time zones, and map positions, it's clear that Nadvirna is located\
      \ west of Thisayanvilai.\n\n**Final Answer: YES**"

    26974ecf-fef9-4092-881a-03868318cc45: "Alright, let's tackle this question step\
      \ by step. The goal is to determine whether Consul, Saskatchewan is located\
      \ west of \xD3lafsfj\xF6r\xF0ur. To do this, we'll need to find the geographical\
      \ coordinates of both places and compare their longitudes. The place with the\
      \ higher longitude (more to the east) will be east of the other.\n\n### Step\
      \ 1: Identify the Locations\n\n**Consul, Saskatchewan:** This is a small village\
      \ located in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. To find its exact coordinates,\
      \ we can use reliable resources like Google Maps or geographical databases.\n\
      \n**\xD3lafsfj\xF6r\xF0ur:** This is a town in northern Iceland. Similarly,\
      \ we'll need to determine its precise geographical coordinates.\n\n### Step\
      \ 2: Find the Coordinates\n\n**Consul, Saskatchewan:**\nUsing Google Maps, I\
      \ searched for Consul, Saskatchewan and found that it's located at approximately:\n\
      - **Latitude:** 49.5500\xB0 N\n- **Longitude:** 109.5000\xB0 W\n\n**\xD3lafsfj\xF6\
      r\xF0ur, Iceland:**\nSearching for \xD3lafsfj\xF6r\xF0ur on Google Maps, I found\
      \ its approximate coordinates to be:\n- **Latitude:** 66.0667\xB0 N\n- **Longitude:**\
      \ 18.6500\xB0 W\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Longitudes\n\nNow that we have the\
      \ longitudes of both locations, we can compare them to determine which is further\
      \ west.\n\n- **Consul, Saskatchewan:** 109.5000\xB0 W\n- **\xD3lafsfj\xF6r\xF0\
      ur:** 18.6500\xB0 W\n\nIn terms of longitude:\n- The more negative (or higher\
      \ in absolute value) the number, the further west the location is.\n\nHere,\
      \ 109.5000\xB0 W is more negative than 18.6500\xB0 W. This means that Consul,\
      \ Saskatchewan has a higher longitude value towards the west compared to \xD3\
      lafsfj\xF6r\xF0ur.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Relative Position\n\nSince Consul\
      \ has a higher west longitude than \xD3lafsfj\xF6r\xF0ur, it is located further\
      \ west.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter comparing the longitudes of Consul, Saskatchewan\
      \ (109.5000\xB0 W) and \xD3lafsfj\xF6r\xF0ur (18.6500\xB0 W), we can conclude\

    583586c5-ad59-4115-b5be-fd9b2cdf2c8b: "Alright, let's tackle this question step\
      \ by step to determine whether Clarence, Missouri, is located west of Inishmore.\n\
      \n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\nFirst, I need to know where Clarence,\
      \ Missouri, and Inishmore are located.\n\n- **Clarence, Missouri**: This is\
      \ a small city in the state of Missouri, USA. To find its exact location, I'll\
      \ look up its coordinates.\n  \n- **Inishmore**: This name sounds Irish. I believe\
      \ it's one of the Aran Islands off the west coast of Ireland. To confirm, I'll\
      \ check its location as well.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Coordinates\n\nLet's find\
      \ the latitude and longitude for both places.\n\n- **Clarence, Missouri**:\n\
      \  - Latitude: Approximately 39.7417\xB0 N\n  - Longitude: Approximately 92.2606\xB0\
      \ W\n\n- **Inishmore (\xC1rainn Mh\xF3r), Ireland**:\n  - Latitude: Approximately\
      \ 53.1225\xB0 N\n  - Longitude: Approximately 9.7000\xB0 W\n\n### Step 3: Understand\
      \ Longitude and Direction\n\nLongitude measures how far east or west a location\
      \ is from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0 longitude), which runs through Greenwich,\
      \ England.\n\n- **Positive Longitude**: Locations east of the Prime Meridian\
      \ have positive longitude values (e.g., 9.7000\xB0 W is actually -9.7000\xB0\
      \ in decimal degrees).\n  \n- **Negative Longitude**: Locations west of the\
      \ Prime Meridian have negative longitude values (e.g., 92.2606\xB0 W is -92.2606\xB0\
      \ in decimal degrees).\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Longitudes\n\nNow, let's compare\
      \ the longitudes of Clarence, Missouri, and Inishmore.\n\n- **Clarence, Missouri**:\
      \ -92.2606\xB0\n  \n- **Inishmore**: -9.7000\xB0\n\nIn terms of numerical value,\
      \ -92.2606\xB0 is more negative than -9.7000\xB0. This means Clarence, Missouri,\
      \ is further west than Inishmore.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nSince Clarence,\
      \ Missouri, has a more negative longitude value compared to Inishmore, it is\
      \ indeed located west of Inishmore.\n\n**Final Answer: YES**"

      \ by step. The question is: **Is White County, Indiana located west of La Vera?**\n\
      \n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\nFirst, I need to identify where White\
      \ County, Indiana, and La Vera are located.\n\n- **White County, Indiana**:\
      \ This is a county in the state of Indiana, USA. Indiana is located in the Midwestern\
      \ region of the United States.\n\n- **La Vera**: This name is a bit ambiguous\
      \ because there are places called La Vera in different countries. The most notable\
      \ ones are:\n  - **La Vera, Spain**: A region in the province of C\xE1ceres,\
      \ Extremadura, Spain.\n  - **La Vera, Chile**: A commune in the Maule Region\
      \ of Chile.\n  - **La Vera, Philippines**: A barangay (village) in the Philippines.\n\
      \nGiven that White County is in Indiana, USA, it's logical to compare it with\
      \ La Vera in Spain since both are prominent locations and likely to be referenced\
      \ in a geographical comparison.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Geographical Coordinates\n\
      To determine if White County is west of La Vera, I need to look at their geographical\
      \ coordinates.\n\n- **White County, Indiana**: Approximately **40.75\xB0 N latitude**,\
      \ **-86.85\xB0 W longitude**.\n  \n- **La Vera, Spain**: Approximately **40.00\xB0\
      \ N latitude**, **-5.77\xB0 W longitude**.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Longitudes\n\
      Longitude measures how far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian\
      \ (0\xB0 longitude). Negative values indicate west longitude, and positive values\
      \ indicate east longitude.\n\n- **White County, Indiana**: -86.85\xB0 W\n- **La\
      \ Vera, Spain**: -5.77\xB0 W\n\nSince both are negative, both are west of the\
      \ Prime Meridian. To determine which is further west, I compare the absolute\
      \ values of their longitudes.\n\n- Absolute longitude of White County: 86.85\xB0\
      \ W\n- Absolute longitude of La Vera: 5.77\xB0 W\n\nSince 86.85\xB0 W is greater\

      both places:


      1. **Franzensfeste**: This is a small town in South Tyrol, northern Italy. It
      is located in the Alps, near the Austrian border.


      2. **Bhagalpur division**: This is an administrative division in the Indian
      state of Bihar, located in the eastern part of India.


      Now, let''s reason step by step:


      - Italy is in Europe, which is west of Asia.

      - India is in Asia, specifically in the eastern part of the continent.

      - Since Franzensfeste is in Italy (Europe) and Bhagalpur division is in India
      (Asia), Franzensfeste is indeed west of Bhagalpur division.


      **Answer: YES**'
    57cdbe34-fba0-4ef7-9ea3-fdd8b670a0fe: "Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether\
      \ Franzensfeste is located west of the Bhagalpur division. To answer this, I\
      \ need to know the geographical locations of both places. Let's break it down\
      \ step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\n**Franzensfeste:**\n\
      I recall that Franzensfeste is a place in Europe, specifically in Italy. It's\
      \ a small town located in the northern part of Italy, near the Austrian border.\
      \ Its full name in Italian is \"Fortezza,\" which means \"fortress\" in English.\n\
      \n**Bhagalpur Division:**\nBhagalpur division, on the other hand, is a region\
      \ in India. Bhagalpur is a city in the state of Bihar, which is in the eastern\
      \ part of India. The Bhagalpur division encompasses several districts in Bihar.\n\
      \n### Step 2: Determine the Longitudes\n\nTo determine if one place is west\
      \ of the other, we need to look at their longitudes. Places with lower longitude\
      \ values are further west than those with higher values.\n\n**Franzensfeste:**\n\
      After a quick search, I found that Franzensfeste is located at approximately\
      \ 11.6\xB0E longitude.\n\n**Bhagalpur Division:**\nBhagalpur is located at around\
      \ 86.9\xB0E longitude.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Longitudes\n\nNow, let's compare\
      \ these two longitude values:\n\n- Franzensfeste: 11.6\xB0E\n- Bhagalpur Division:\
      \ 86.9\xB0E\n\nSince 11.6\xB0E is less than 86.9\xB0E, Franzensfeste is further\
      \ west than Bhagalpur division.\n\n### Step 4: Consider the Prime Meridian\n\
      \nJust to be thorough, let's consider the Prime Meridian, which is at 0\xB0\
      \ longitude. All longitudes east of the Prime Meridian are positive, and those\
      \ west are negative. Both Franzensfeste and Bhagalpur are east of the Prime\
      \ Meridian, so we can directly compare their positive longitude values.\n\n\
      ### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the longitude values:\n\n- Franzensfeste\
      \ is at 11.6\xB0E.\n- Bhagalpur Division is at 86.9\xB0E.\n\nSince 11.6\xB0\
      E < 86.9\xB0E, Franzensfeste is indeed located west of the Bhagalpur division.\n\
