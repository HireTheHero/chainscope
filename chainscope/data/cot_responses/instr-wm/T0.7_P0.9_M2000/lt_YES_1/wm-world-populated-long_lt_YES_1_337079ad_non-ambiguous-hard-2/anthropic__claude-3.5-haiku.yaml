      4. Without being certain of their exact positions, I cannot definitively state
      whether Salgar is west of Bitterley.


      5. When I''m not 100% sure, I should not guess.


      Therefore, my answer is: I DO NOT KNOW

      specific about these locations that I''m missing, I apologize. But based on

      - Uruzgan Province is located in central Afghanistan

      - It is situated in the southern part of the country


      2. Next, let''s locate the City of Hume:

      - There are multiple places named Hume, but the most likely reference is in
      Australia

      - The City of Hume is located in Victoria, Australia


      3. Consider the geographical relationship:

      - Uruzgan Province is in Afghanistan (Central Asia)

      - The City of Hume is in Australia

      - These locations are on completely different continents, separated by thousands
      of miles

    8c13a1c1-9372-4c26-ab0d-22eefd4f92b1: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Bandar Baharu District:

      - This is a district located in Kedah, Malaysia

      - It is in the northwestern part of Peninsular Malaysia


      2. Next, I''ll locate Southend, South Australia:

      - Southend is a small coastal town in South Australia

      - It is located on the Limestone Coast region of South Australia


      3. Comparing their geographical locations:

      - Bandar Baharu District is in Malaysia, which is in Southeast Asia

      - Southend is in South Australia, which is in the southern part of Australia

      - These locations are on completely different continents, separated by the Indian
      Ocean


      4. Determining west/east orientation:

      - Malaysia is east of Australia

      - Therefore, Bandar Baharu District is NOT west of Southend, South Australia


      5. Conclusion:

      Based on the geographical locations, Bandar Baharu District is not west of Southend,
      South Australia.

      United States.

      determine the relative position of Smith County.
