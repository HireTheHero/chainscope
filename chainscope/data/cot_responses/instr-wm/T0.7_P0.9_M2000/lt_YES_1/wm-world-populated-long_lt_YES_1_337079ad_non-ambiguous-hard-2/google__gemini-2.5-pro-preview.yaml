      1.  **Identify Phalut:** Phalut (or Falut) is a well-known peak in the Singalila
      Ridge, located on the border of West Bengal, India, and Nepal. It''s part of
      the Eastern Himalayas.


      2.  **Identify Verd:** "Verd" is not a recognized or commonly known geographical
      place, especially in the context of the Himalayas or anywhere near Phalut. A
      quick search for "Verd geographical location" or "Verd near Phalut" yields no
      significant results for a distinct place called Verd. It might be a misspelling,
      a very small local unmapped area, or a fictional name.


      3.  **Determine relative location:** Since "Verd" as a geographical entity that
      can be located relative to Phalut is not identifiable, we cannot determine if
      it is west of Phalut. For the statement "Is Verd located west of Phalut?" to
      be true, "Verd" must exist and be located to the west of Phalut. Since we cannot
      establish the existence and location of "Verd" in this context, the statement
      cannot be affirmed.
