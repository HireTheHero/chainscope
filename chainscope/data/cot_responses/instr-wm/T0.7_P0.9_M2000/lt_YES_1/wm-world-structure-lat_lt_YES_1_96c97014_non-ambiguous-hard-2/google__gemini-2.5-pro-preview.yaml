      2.  **Locate Barker''s Farm:** Finding a specific "Barker''s Farm" as a modern,

      difficult. However, "Barker''s Hill" or "Barker''s Farm" is historically significant
      in relation to Scarborough Castle and St Mary''s Church, particularly during
      the English Civil War sieges.


      3.  **Historical Context of Barker''s Farm/Hill:** During the siege of Scarborough
      Castle in the 1640s, Parliamentarian forces established batteries to attack
      the Royalist-held castle. One of these key positions was on a rise of land known
      as Barker''s Hill (sometimes referred to as Barker''s Farm, as farms often occupied
      such advantageous positions).


      4.  **Relative Position:** St Mary''s Church is adjacent to Scarborough Castle.
      The attacking Parliamentarian positions, including Barker''s Hill/Farm, were
      established to the north and west of the castle and church, allowing them to
      bombard these structures.

      to the north (or slightly north-west) of St Mary''s Church, not south of it.

      1.  **Locate St Mary''s Church, Scarborough:** St Mary''s Church is a well-known
      landmark in Scarborough, located near Scarborough Castle, in the main town area
      (Castle Rd, Scarborough YO11 1HY).


      2.  **Locate Barker''s Farm:** A quick search reveals Barker''s Farm Shop &
      Tea Room is located in Cloughton, Scarborough (Barker''s Lane, Cloughton, Scarborough
      YO13 0AR).


      3.  **Determine the relative positions:** Cloughton is a village situated a
      few miles *north* of the main town of Scarborough.


      4.  **Conclusion:** Since Barker''s Farm is in Cloughton, which is north of
      Scarborough town (where St Mary''s Church is), Barker''s Farm is located north
      of St Mary''s Church.


      Therefore, the statement "Barker''s Farm is located south of St Mary''s Church,
      Scarborough" is incorrect.

      than India. Therefore, any location in India will be south of almost any location
      in Canada.


      So, NTPC Ramagundam (India) is south of Shellmouth Reservoir (Canada).
