      1. **Locate East Brixton railway station:** East Brixton was a railway station
      in Brixton, London. However, it closed in 1976. Its historical location was
      in the Brixton area, which is in the southern part of London.


      2. **Locate O''Reilly Theater:** The O''Reilly Theater is located in Dublin,

      Ireland, while London is in the southeast of England. Geographically, Dublin
      is located to the west of London.


      Now, considering their relative positions:


      - Dublin (where the O''Reilly Theater is located) is west of London.

      - The latitude of Dublin is slightly north of London''s latitude, meaning Dublin
      is not south of London.

      Now, let''s determine the relative positions:


      - Mirani Dam is located in the southern part of Asia.

      - Turnham Green tube station is located in Western Europe.


      Given that Pakistan is generally southeast of the United Kingdom, Mirani Dam
