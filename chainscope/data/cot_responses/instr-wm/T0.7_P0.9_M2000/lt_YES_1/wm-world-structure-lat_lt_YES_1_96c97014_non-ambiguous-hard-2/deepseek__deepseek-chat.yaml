      United Kingdom. Wales is in the northern hemisphere, and its geographic coordinates
      place it further north than North Korea.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Since North Korea (where Ryanggang Hotel is located)
      is further south than the United Kingdom (where Trawsfynydd nuclear power station
      is located), it follows that the Ryanggang Hotel is indeed south of the Trawsfynydd

      \ Brick Presbyterian Church in New York City is located south of the Dublin\
      \ Waste-to-Energy Facility. At first glance, this seems like a straightforward\
      \ geographical question, but since the two locations are in different countries\u2014\
      New York City in the United States and Dublin in Ireland\u2014I need to consider\
      \ their respective latitudes to determine which one is further south.\n\n###\
      \ Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\nFirst, let's pinpoint where these two places\
      \ are:\n\n1. **Brick Presbyterian Church**: This is a historic church located\
      \ in New York City, specifically on Park Avenue at 91st Street in Manhattan.\n\
      2. **Dublin Waste-to-Energy Facility**: This facility is situated in Dublin,\
      \ Ireland. It's a modern waste management plant that converts waste into energy.\n\
      \n### Step 2: Determine the Latitude of Each Location\n\nTo compare their positions\
      \ relative to each other (north or south), I need to find their latitudes.\n\
      \n- **Brick Presbyterian Church, New York City**:\n  - Latitude: Approximately\
      \ 40.7831\xB0 N\n  - Longitude: Approximately -73.9583\xB0 W\n\n- **Dublin Waste-to-Energy\

      \  - Longitude: Approximately -6.2603\xB0 W\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Latitudes\n\
      \nLatitude measures how far north or south a location is from the equator. The\
      \ higher the latitude, the further north the location is.\n\n- Brick Presbyterian\
      \ Church: 40.7831\xB0 N\n- Dublin Waste-to-Energy Facility: 53.3498\xB0 N\n\n\
      Since 40.7831\xB0 N is less than 53.3498\xB0 N, Brick Presbyterian Church is\

      \ their respective positions in terms of latitude and longitude.**\n3. **Compare\
      \ these positions to ascertain if Lem\xF3niz is indeed south of T\xE4by Church.**\n\
      \n### Step 1: Identifying the Locations\n\n**Lem\xF3niz Nuclear Power Plant:**\n\
      Lem\xF3niz is a former nuclear power plant located in the Basque Country, Spain.\
      \ Its construction began in the 1970s but was never completed due to various\
      \ reasons, including political and social opposition.\n\n**T\xE4by Church:**\n\
      T\xE4by Church is an ancient church situated in T\xE4by, a municipality in Stockholm\
      \ County, Sweden. It's known for its historical significance and medieval architecture.\n\
      \n### Step 2: Determining the Geographical Coordinates\n\nTo compare the positions\
      \ accurately, we'll look up the approximate latitudes and longitudes of both\
      \ locations.\n\n**Lem\xF3niz Nuclear Power Plant:**\n- Latitude: Approximately\
      \ 43.3000\xB0 N\n- Longitude: Approximately -2.9833\xB0 W\n\n**T\xE4by Church:**\n\
      - Latitude: Approximately 59.4400\xB0 N\n- Longitude: Approximately 18.0700\xB0\
      \ E\n\n### Step 3: Comparing the Latitudes\n\nLatitude lines run east-west and\
      \ indicate how far north or south a location is from the equator. The higher\
      \ the latitude, the further north the location.\n\n- **Lem\xF3niz:** 43.3000\xB0\
      \ N\n- **T\xE4by Church:** 59.4400\xB0 N\n\nSince 43.3000\xB0 N is less than\
      \ 59.4400\xB0 N, Lem\xF3niz is located further south than T\xE4by Church.\n\n\
      ### Conclusion\n\nBased on the geographical coordinates:\n\n- **Lem\xF3niz Nuclear\
      \ Power Plant** is at a lower latitude (43.3000\xB0 N) compared to **T\xE4by\
      \ Church** (59.4400\xB0 N).\n- Therefore, **Lem\xF3niz Nuclear Power Plant is\

      \ by step. The goal is to determine whether Halse Hall is located south of Clerkenwell\
      \ tube station. To do this, we'll need to gather some geographical information\
      \ about both locations.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\nFirst, we need\
      \ to understand where exactly Halse Hall and Clerkenwell tube station are situated.\n\
      \n- **Halse Hall**: A quick search reveals that Halse Hall is a historic building\
      \ located in Jamaica. More specifically, it's in the parish of St. Catherine,\
      \ which is in the southern part of the island.\n\n- **Clerkenwell Tube Station**:\
      \ This is a London Underground station located in the Clerkenwell district of\
      \ central London, England.\n\n### Step 2: Understand Their Geographic Positions\n\
      \nNow that we've identified the locations, we need to compare their geographic\
      \ positions to determine if Halse Hall is south of Clerkenwell tube station.\n\
      \n- **Jamaica's Location**: Jamaica is an island country in the Caribbean Sea,\
      \ situated to the south of the United States and east of Central America. Its\
      \ coordinates are approximately 18.1096\xB0 N, 77.2975\xB0 W.\n\n- **London's\
      \ Location**: London is the capital city of England and the United Kingdom,\
      \ located in the southeastern part of the country. Its coordinates are approximately\
      \ 51.5074\xB0 N, 0.1278\xB0 W.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Latitude\n\nThe key\
      \ to determining if Halse Hall is south of Clerkenwell tube station lies in\
      \ comparing their latitudes. Latitude measures how far north or south a location\
      \ is from the equator.\n\n- **Halse Hall, Jamaica**: Approximately 18.1096\xB0\
      \ N\n- **Clerkenwell Tube Station, London**: Approximately 51.5074\xB0 N\n\n\
      Since the equator is at 0\xB0 latitude, both locations are in the northern hemisphere.\
      \ However, the lower the latitude number, the closer a location is to the equator,\
      \ meaning it's further south.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Relative Position\n\
      \nGiven that Halse Hall is at approximately 18.1096\xB0 N and Clerkenwell tube\
      \ station is at approximately 51.5074\xB0 N, we can see that Halse Hall has\
      \ a lower latitude than Clerkenwell.\n\nThis means that Halse Hall is indeed\
      \ located south of Clerkenwell tube station.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter analyzing\
      \ the geographic coordinates of both Halse Hall in Jamaica and Clerkenwell tube\
      \ station in London, it's clear that Halse Hall is situated at a lower latitude,\
      \ placing it to the south of Clerkenwell.\n\n**Answer: YES**"

      1. **Locate Calatagan Solar Farm**:  \n   Calatagan Solar Farm is located in\
      \ Calatagan, Batangas, Philippines. Batangas is in the southern part of Luzon,\
      \ the largest island in the Philippines.\n\n2. **Locate Carrapatelo Dam**: \
      \ \n   Carrapatelo Dam is located on the Douro River in northern Portugal.\n\
      \n3. **Compare their locations**:  \n   The Philippines and Portugal are in\
      \ entirely different regions of the world. The Philippines is in Southeast Asia,\
      \ while Portugal is in southwestern Europe.\n\n4. **Determine their relative\
      \ positions**:  \n   Since the Philippines is in the eastern hemisphere and\
      \ Portugal is in the western hemisphere, it doesn\u2019t make sense to compare\
