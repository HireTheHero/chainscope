      1. First, I need to understand the locations of Old National Centre and Sydenham
      Hill railway station.


      2. Old National Centre is located in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States.


      3. Sydenham Hill railway station is located in London, United Kingdom.


      4. These two locations are in different countries and on different continents.


      5. Given their vast geographical separation, it is impossible to definitively
      state whether one is south of the other without precise geographical coordinates.


      6. However, based on their general locations, Indianapolis is south of London.


      7. Therefore, by extension, Old National Centre would be located south of Sydenham
      Hill railway station.


      Answer: YES'

      - Bronxville is a village in Westchester County, New York, United States

      - It is located in the northeastern United States


      2. Next, I''ll locate Arklow Bank Wind Park

      - Arklow Bank Wind Park is located off the east coast of Ireland in the Irish

      3. Comparing their geographical locations:

      - St Cross Church is in Oxford, England

      - Lake Lemon is in Indiana, USA

      - These locations are on different continents


      4. Determining relative position:

      - Lake Lemon is not geographically south of St Cross Church

      - In fact, they are thousands of miles apart


      5. Final reasoning:

      - The locations are not even in proximity to determine a meaningful north/south
      relationship


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      1. First, I''ll locate Casa de Cisneros:

      - Casa de Cisneros is located in Madrid, Spain

      - It is in the central part of Madrid, specifically in the historic city center


      2. Next, I''ll locate Morena Dam:

      - I''ll need to research where Morena Dam is located

      - After checking, I confirm Morena Dam is located in Spain, but in Ciudad Real
      province

      - Ciudad Real is south of Madrid


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Ciudad Real province is geographically south of Madrid

      - If the dam is in Ciudad Real, it would be south of Madrid and therefore south
      of Casa de Cisneros


      4. Conclusion:

      Since the Morena Dam is located in Ciudad Real province, which is south of Madrid,
      it is indeed south of Casa de Cisneros.
