      - Texas, where Lake Waco is located, is also in the Northern Hemisphere, but
      it lies significantly farther north than Uganda.

      2. Identify the location of St. Martha Catholic Church.

      3. Compare their relative positions on a map to determine whether Cuartel de
      Santa Lucia is south of the church.


      Step 1: Cuartel de Santa Lucia is located in Intramuros, Manila, Philippines.
      It is a historic military barracks.


      Step 2: St. Martha Catholic Church is a common name and could refer to multiple
      churches around the world. However, if we assume the question is referring to
      a St. Martha Catholic Church near or related to Intramuros, we must check if
      such a church exists in or around that area.

      Church within the immediate vicinity of Intramuros, Manila. The most well-known
      churches in Intramuros are Manila Cathedral and San Agustin Church.


      If the St. Martha Catholic Church referred to is the one in Valenzuela, for
      example (north of Manila), then Cuartel de Santa Lucia would indeed be located
      to the south of it.

      Intramuros but rather in a northern part of Metro Manila:

      2. Determine their relative positions on a map, specifically in terms of latitude

      Step 2: St. Martha Catholic Church is a name shared by multiple churches, but

      1. Identify the locations and relative positions of both landmarks.

      2. Determine the directional relationship between them.


      Step 1: Cuartel de Santa Lucia is a historic military barracks located in Intramuros,

      we need to be more precise.


      Assuming the question refers to a St. Martha Catholic Church that is indeed
      close to the Cuartel de Santa Lucia, then we should look at their specific geographic
      coordinates or map locations.


      However, based on available information and common references, the Cuartel de
      Santa Lucia is located in Intramuros, Manila.


      If we assume that the St. Martha Catholic Church being referred to is the one
      in Pasig (which seems likely given the lack of another known church by that
      name in Intramuros), then:


      - Cuartel de Santa Lucia (Intramuros) is located southwest of the St. Martha
