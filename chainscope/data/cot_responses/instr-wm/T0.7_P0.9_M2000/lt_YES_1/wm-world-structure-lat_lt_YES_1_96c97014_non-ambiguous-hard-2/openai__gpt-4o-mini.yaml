    21d8de89-185e-4bd7-911c-b060102b0e26: 'To answer the question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the Location of Lake Waco**: Lake Waco is located in Texas, USA.


      2. **Determine the Location of Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station**: Achwa
      2 Hydroelectric Power Station is located in Uganda.


      3. **Compare the Two Locations**: Lake Waco is in the northern hemisphere (Texas),
      while Achwa 2 is in the southern hemisphere (Uganda).


      4. **Direction Relative to Lake Waco**: Since Achwa 2 is located in Uganda,
      which is south of the equator, it cannot be described as being "south" of Lake
      Waco, which is also in the northern hemisphere.

      Plant is located in France, on the Cotentin Peninsula in Normandy.


      3. **Determine their relative positions**: Since Pine Flat Lake is in California
      and Flamanville is in France, they are situated on different continents (North
      America and Europe, respectively).


      4. **Assess the directional relationship**: Given that Pine Flat Lake is in
      the western part of the United States and Flamanville is in northwestern France,
      it is impossible for Pine Flat Lake to be located south of Flamanville.

      consider the geographical positions of both places.


      1. Identify the location of East Brixton railway station. It is located in Brixton,
      a district in South London, UK.

      2. Next, we need to determine the location of O''Reilly Theater. The O''Reilly
      Theater is located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.


      3. Now, we compare the two locations. Since East Brixton railway station is
      in London and O''Reilly Theater is in Pittsburgh, these two places are in completely
      different countries and continents.


      Given that O''Reilly Theater is in the USA and East Brixton railway station
      is in the UK, we can conclude that O''Reilly Theater cannot be located south
      of East Brixton railway station.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is NO.'

      2. **Geographical Orientation**: Next, we need to understand the geographical
      positioning of these two places in relation to one another. This involves looking
      at maps or geographical data to see where each location is situated.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Once we have the coordinates or map data, we can determine
      if O''Reilly Theater is indeed south of East Brixton railway station.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the findings from the previous steps, we would then
      conclude whether the statement is true or false.


      However, I do not have real-time access to maps or specific geographical databases
      to verify the locations as of now. Based on the general knowledge that O''Reilly

      locations of both. Baldock is in the UK, while the Enguri Dam is in Georgia,
      which is significantly to the southeast of Baldock.


      Given that Georgia is located to the southeast of England, it would be impossible
