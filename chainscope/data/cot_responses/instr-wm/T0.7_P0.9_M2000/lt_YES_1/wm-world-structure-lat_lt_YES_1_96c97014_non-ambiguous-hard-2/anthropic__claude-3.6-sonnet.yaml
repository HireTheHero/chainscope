      1. First, let me identify Windy Hill Wind Farm''s location

      - Windy Hill Wind Farm is located in Ngong Hills, Kenya

      - Ngong Hills is near Nairobi, in southern Kenya


      2. Next, let me identify Kindaruma Hydroelectric Power Station''s location

      - Kindaruma Hydroelectric Power Station is on the Tana River

      - It''s located in central Kenya, north of Nairobi


      3. Comparing their positions

      - Since Windy Hill Wind Farm is near Nairobi in southern Kenya

      - And Kindaruma is north of Nairobi

      - Therefore Windy Hill Wind Farm must be south of Kindaruma

      - Windy Hill is in Australia

      - Australia is entirely south of Kenya on the globe


      4. Therefore, since Windy Hill Wind Farm is in Australia, and Australia is south

    7ad00ca2-628a-4c27-99d4-da1288456f6c: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me identify the locations:

      - Windy Hill Wind Farm is located in Australia, in New South Wales

      - Kindaruma Hydroelectric Power Station is located in Kenya, along the Tana
      River


      2. Since these structures are in different hemispheres:

      - Australia is in the Southern Hemisphere

      - Kenya is in the Northern Hemisphere


      3. Therefore, any location in Australia would be south of any location in Kenya,
      since Australia is south of the equator and Kenya is north of it.


      4. Since Windy Hill Wind Farm is in Australia, it must be south of Kindaruma

      2. Now, let me locate Windy Hill Wind Farm

      - Windy Hill Wind Farm is in Australia

      3. Comparing their locations

      - Kenya is in East Africa

      - Australia is a continent southeast of Africa

      - Australia is entirely south of the equator

      - Kenya straddles the equator

      - However, since these locations are on different continents, traditional cardinal
      directions (north/south) become more complex across such vast distances


      4. Final reasoning

      - When dealing with locations on different continents separated by oceans, we
      typically use latitude to determine north/south relationships

      - Australia lies entirely south of Kenya

      - Therefore, Windy Hill Wind Farm must be south of Kindaruma Hydroelectric Power
