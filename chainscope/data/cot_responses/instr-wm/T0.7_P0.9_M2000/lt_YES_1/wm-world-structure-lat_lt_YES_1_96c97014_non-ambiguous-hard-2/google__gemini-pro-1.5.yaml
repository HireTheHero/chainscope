      3. **Determine relative positions:** Uganda is in East Africa, while Texas is
      in North America.  Africa is generally north of the equator, with Uganda being
      on and just north of it.  Texas is well north of the equator.  However, the
      question is about North/South, not distance from the equator.  A globe would
      show that Uganda is far east and slightly north, while Texas is far west and
      clearly north. Considering only North vs. South Texas is much further north
      than Uganda.

      separated by such a large distance and a change in continents.  "South" implies

      London, the question implies a more local context.  Since they are on opposite
      sides of the world, simply being in the southern hemisphere doesn''t make it
      directly south in the way the question likely intends.

      (also known as Sta Lucia St). St. Martha Catholic Church is officially named
      "Saint Martha Parish Church" and is located on General Luna Street.


      3. **Determine relative positions:**  Looking at a map of Intramuros, General
      Luna Street runs roughly East-West, and Muralla/Sta Lucia Street runs North-South
      along the eastern edge of the walled city. St. Martha''s is on General Luna
      Street, closer to the western side.

      Martha Catholic Church (formally known as the Church of Santa Lucia) was located
      within the walls of Intramuros. Sadly, the church was destroyed in WWII.  However,
      historical maps place the Church of Santa Lucia near the Real Gate, which is
      on the western side of Intramuros.

      4. **Conclusion:** Since Cuartel de Santa Lucia is on the East side of Intramuros
      and St. Martha''s Church was on the West side, the Cuartel cannot be south of

      is at 333 North while Skyll House is at 1140 North. Higher numbers on North
