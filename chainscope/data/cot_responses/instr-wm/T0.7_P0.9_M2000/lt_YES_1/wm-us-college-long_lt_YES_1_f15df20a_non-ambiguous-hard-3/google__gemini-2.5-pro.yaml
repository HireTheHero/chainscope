      analyzed them. California''s position on the Pacific coast versus Utah''s inland
      location immediately suggests the answer. However, I have confirmed the precise
      locations in San Francisco and Utah for complete due diligence.



      **Concluding Geographical Analysis**


      I''ve determined Bay Area Medical Academy, historically in San Francisco, California,
      is west of George Wythe University, historically in Salt Lake City, Utah. The
      geographical context confirms California''s westward position relative to Utah.
      Initial state-level analysis was sufficient, but I verified specific locations
      for complete certainty. The higher longitude confirms the geographical conclusion.



      **Refining the Geographical Conclusion**


      I have methodically confirmed the location of the Bay Area Medical Academy,
      historically located in the San Francisco Bay Area in California, and George
      Wythe University, historically in Salt Lake City, Utah. Analyzing their relative
      longitudes, I''ve conclusively verified that the Bay Area Medical Academy is
      indeed situated west of George Wythe University. The Pacific coast location
      in California versus Utah''s inland position solidifies this geographical relationship.

      \ due to multiple campuses. I'm currently researching to identify the most appropriate\
      \ campus or headquarter location for a reliable comparison. I have narrowed\
      \ it down to a couple of possible locations.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Comparison**\n\
      \nI've analyzed the data and determined the key longitudes. Bellarmine in Louisville\
      \ sits around 85.7\xB0 W. The Strayer University campuses are all around 77\xB0\
      \ W.  The difference is clear: Bellarmine is indeed further west. Now, I'm structuring\
      \ a concise and complete response, highlighting the key steps for clarity.\n\

      \ Virginia. For this comparison, we can use a representative location like their\
      \ Arlington, VA campus.\n3.  **Compare their longitudes:**\n    *   Louisville,\
      \ Kentucky, is at approximately 85.7\xB0 W longitude.\n    *   Arlington, Virginia,\
      \ is at approximately 77.1\xB0 W longitude.\n4.  **Conclusion:** A higher West\
      \ longitude value means a location is farther west. Since 85.7\xB0 is a higher\
      \ value than 77.1\xB0, Louisville, KY is west of Arlington, VA.\n\nYES"

      I''ve narrowed down the central query: the geographical relationship. It''s
      essentially a "west of" comparison between two locations. I''m breaking down
      the components, starting with identifying the specific institutions involved:
      Syracuse University''s School of Education, and then Middlesex University.



      **Refining the Query**


      I''m refining the approach. First, I''ve pinpointed the user''s core question:
      a "west of" geographical comparison. Next, I''m breaking down the locations,
      starting with Syracuse University''s School of Education in New York. I need
      to verify the specifics of the second location. It seems the user likely meant
      Middlesex Community College in Massachusetts and not a "Middlesex University."

      The spatial relationship is now clear: Syracuse, NY, versus Middlesex County,
      MA. My next step is to articulate the step-by-step reasoning to ensure the logic
      flows. I''m documenting the locations, and I''m emphasizing the geographical
      contrast for clarity. Then I''ll use the identified locations and their relationship
      to answer the question.



      **Formulating the Solution**


      I''ve finalized the plan. Step one: Clarify the locations; Syracuse, NY, and
      Middlesex County, MA. Step two: Use geographical knowledge: NY west of MA. Step
      three: State the answer, a clear "YES." The user''s original wording introduces
      a little ambiguity, but it is resolved by the step-by-step logic. I think it
      is now ready.

      I''ve determined Huntington University in Indiana is indeed west of Widener
      University in Delaware. By comparing their approximate longitudes, I confirmed
      the westerly position of Huntington. Now, I will concisely summarize my reasoning
      to provide a clear and definitive answer.



      **Summarizing Geographical Data**


      I''m now fully confident in my answer. I''ve pinpointed the universities'' locations
      and confirmed Huntington, Indiana, lies west of Wilmington, Delaware. Using
      longitudes clarified the geographical positioning. The final answer is yes,
      Huntington University is west of Widener University.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of Huntington University, IN:** Huntington University
      is located in the city of Huntington, in the state of Indiana.

      2.  **Identify the location of Widener University, DE:** Widener University
      has a campus in Wilmington, in the state of Delaware.

      3.  **Compare the geographical locations of the states:** The state of Indiana
      is in the Midwestern United States. The state of Delaware is on the Atlantic
      coast, in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.

      4.  **Determine the directional relationship:** On a map of the United States,
      Indiana is located entirely to the west of Delaware. Therefore, any location
      in Indiana is west of any location in Delaware.

      I''ve successfully identified the core question: comparing the geographical
      locations of Drake University in Iowa and Aurora University. I now know that
      Drake is in Iowa. Next, I''ll determine the location of Aurora University to
      facilitate the comparison.



      **Defining the Inquiry Precisely**


      I''ve refined the core question and can now confirm the user''s query is about
      Drake University''s Pharmacy and Health Sciences college location, which is,
      of course, in Iowa, relative to Aurora University. My next step is to find the
      location of Aurora University, IL.



      **Comparing Geographical Coordinates**


      I''ve confirmed both universities'' locations: Drake''s College of Pharmacy
      is in Des Moines, Iowa, and Aurora University is in Aurora, Illinois. I''m now
      comparing their longitudes. The analysis confirms that Iowa is west of Illinois,
      resulting in a final ''YES'' answer to the core question, which is: Is Drake
      University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences west of Aurora University?
      I''m proceeding to outline a step-by-step answer.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to identify the city and state for each university.

      2.  Drake University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences is part of Drake
      University, which is located in Des Moines, Iowa (IA).

      3.  Aurora University is located in Aurora, Illinois (IL).

      4.  Next, we need to compare the geographical locations of Des Moines, Iowa,
      and Aurora, Illinois.

      5.  On a map of the United States, the state of Iowa is located to the west
      of the state of Illinois. Therefore, Des Moines, IA, is geographically west
      of Aurora, IL.
