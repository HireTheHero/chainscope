      Bakersfield (CSUB), located in Bakersfield, California, is west of Roseman University
      of Health Sciences, located in Nevada, we need to compare their longitudinal
      coordinates.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.


      - California State University, Bakersfield is located in Bakersfield, California.

      - Roseman University of Health Sciences has a campus in Henderson, Nevada (a
      suburb of Las Vegas).


      Step 2: Understand geography.


      - Longitude is the key factor in determining east-west positioning.

      - Locations with smaller (more negative) longitude values in the Western Hemisphere
      are further west.


      Step 3: Check approximate longitudes.


      - Bakersfield, California is approximately at longitude -119.0187.

      - Henderson, Nevada is approximately at longitude -114.9817.


      Step 4: Compare longitudes.


      - -119.0187 (Bakersfield) is a smaller (more negative) number than -114.9817
      (Henderson).

      - Therefore, Bakersfield is further west than Henderson.

    e12139ea-3c93-473e-a860-4af6f157e9c7: 'To determine whether the University of
      Findlay in Ohio is located west of the Fordham Graduate School of Arts and Sciences
      in New York, we need to compare their longitudinal positions (east-west coordinates).


      Step 1: Identify the location of the University of Findlay.

      - The University of Findlay is located in Findlay, Ohio.

      - Approximate coordinates: 41.038 latitude, -83.650 longitude.


      Step 2: Identify the location of the Fordham Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

      - It is part of Fordham University, located in New York City, New York.

      - Approximate coordinates: 40.862 latitude, -73.885 longitude.


      Step 3: Compare longitudes.

      - Longitude of Findlay, OH: -83.650

      - Longitude of New York, NY: -73.885


      Step 4: Interpret the values.

      - In the Western Hemisphere, more negative longitude values are further west.

      - Since -83.650 is more negative than -73.885, Findlay, OH is indeed west of
      New York, NY.


      Final Answer: YES.'

      1. **Naropa University** is located in Boulder, Colorado.

      2. **Concordia University, Nebraska** is located in Seward, Nebraska.


      Next, we consider the relative positions of Colorado and Nebraska in the United
      States:


      - Colorado is directly west of Nebraska.

      - Boulder, CO is in the northern part of Colorado.

      - Seward, NE is in the eastern part of Nebraska.


      Given that Colorado is west of Nebraska, and both Boulder and Seward are near
      the center or eastern parts of their respective states, it follows that Boulder,
      CO is west of Seward, NE.


      Therefore, Naropa University is located west of Concordia University, Nebraska.
