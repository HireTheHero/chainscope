      university:** Alcorn State University is in Mississippi, and Georgia Southern
      University is in Georgia.


      2. **Determine the relative position of the states:** Mississippi is west of
      Georgia.


      3. **Consider the specific locations within the states:** Even if the universities
      were on the opposite sides of their respective states, Mississippi being entirely
      west of Georgia means Alcorn State must be west of Georgia Southern.

    119fb5c0-ae69-4217-89fe-44042c768afd: '1. **Locate Alcorn State University, MS:**
      Alcorn State is in southwestern Mississippi.


      2. **Locate Georgia Southern University, GA:** Georgia Southern has multiple
      campuses, but its main campus is in Statesboro, which is in southeastern Georgia.


      3. **Determine relative positions:** Mississippi is west of Georgia. Therefore,
      anything in Mississippi is generally west of anything in Georgia.


      4. **Consider edge cases:** While some parts of Mississippi might be very slightly
      east of *some* parts of Georgia, the general locations of these two universities
      make it highly likely Alcorn State is west of Georgia Southern.

      3. **Consider potential exceptions:** While Alabama is generally west of South
      Carolina, it''s possible a city in eastern Alabama could be further east than
      a city in western South Carolina.  However, Charleston is a coastal city and
      likely the furthest east part of South Carolina. Birmingham is east of the center
      of Alabama and Samford is close to Birmingham.


      4. **Conclusion:** Given the locations of the states and the positions of Birmingham,
      AL and Charleston, SC, it is highly likely Samford is west of College of Charleston.

      Bellarmine University is in Louisville, Kentucky. Strayer University has multiple
      campuses, but the question specifies Virginia, so we''ll consider its Virginia
      locations.


      2. **Determine general longitude:** Kentucky is generally west of Virginia.


      3. **Consider possible exceptions:** While Kentucky is generally west of Virginia,
      it''s possible a specific location in eastern Kentucky could be east of a location
      in western Virginia.  However, Louisville is in the central/northern part of
      Kentucky.  Strayer has campuses in northern Virginia.  Therefore, the general
      east/west positioning of the states holds.


      4. **Conclusion:** Louisville, KY is west of any location in Virginia.
