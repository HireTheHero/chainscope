      2. **Find the location of Troy University**: Troy University is located in Troy,
      Alabama, which is in the southeastern part of Alabama.


      3. **Compare the longitudes**: The easternmost point of Texas (where UT Tyler
      is located) is generally further west compared to Alabama, where Troy University
      is situated. Texas is known to stretch westward significantly, while Alabama
      is more eastward.

      1. **Locate Wheaton College, MA**: Wheaton College is located in Norton, Massachusetts,
      which is in the southeastern part of the state, near the city of Taunton and
      not far from Providence, Rhode Island.


      2. **Locate Indiana University Fort Wayne, IN**: Indiana University Fort Wayne
      is located in Fort Wayne, Indiana, which is in the northeastern part of the
      state of Indiana.


      3. **Compare the locations**: To see if one is west of the other, we consider
      their longitudinal positions. Massachusetts is located on the east coast of
      the United States, while Indiana is further west.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Fort Wayne, IN is located to the west of Norton, MA
      (where Wheaton College is situated), we can conclude that Indiana University
      Fort Wayne is indeed west of Wheaton College.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is **YES**.'
