      1.  **Locate Syracuse University School of Education, NY:** This is in Syracuse,
      New York.

      2.  **Locate Middlesex University, MA:** This is a trick. There is no "Middlesex
      University" in Massachusetts. There is a **Middlesex Community College** in
      Massachusetts (with campuses in Bedford and Lowell). There is also a **Middlesex
      University** in **London, UK**.


      Since the question specifies "Middlesex University, MA," and such an institution
      doesn''t exist, the premise for comparison is flawed. However, if we assume
      the question *intended* to refer to Middlesex Community College in Massachusetts
      as the most likely interpretation given the "MA" abbreviation, we can proceed
      with that assumption for the sake of answering.


      *   **Location of Syracuse, NY:** Central New York.

      *   **Location of Middlesex Community College, MA (Bedford/Lowell):** Eastern
      Massachusetts.


      If you look at a map, Eastern Massachusetts is **east** of Central New York.


      Therefore, Syracuse University School of Education, NY is **not** located west
      of Middlesex Community College, MA. It is located west of it.


      However, since the question precisely states "Middlesex University, MA" and
      no such university exists, the question itself is based on a false premise.
      If a comparison cannot be made because one of the entities does not exist as
      specified, then the premise for answering "yes" or "no" about their relative
      locations is invalid.


      But if we are forced to interpret the spirit of the question with the most likely
      *intended* referent:


      Syracuse, NY is geographically west of Boston/Eastern Massachusetts.


      Therefore, Syracuse University School of Education, NY *is* located west of
      Middlesex Community College, MA.


      Let''s re-evaluate.

      1. Syracuse, NY (approx. 76.1W longitude)

      2. Middlesex Community College, MA (Lowell, MA approx. 71.3W longitude; Bedford,
      MA approx. 71.2W longitude)


      A location with a higher (less negative) West longitude is further East.

      A location with a lower (more negative) West longitude is further West.


      76.1W is a lower (more negative) number than 71.3W or 71.2W.

      This means Syracuse is indeed further west than Middlesex Community College,
      MA.

      UIUC stands for the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Urbana-Champaign,

      **Step 2: Locate Miami University Middletown, OH.**

      Middletown, Ohio, is located in southwest Ohio.

      *   Middletown, OH: Approximately 84.4 W longitude.
