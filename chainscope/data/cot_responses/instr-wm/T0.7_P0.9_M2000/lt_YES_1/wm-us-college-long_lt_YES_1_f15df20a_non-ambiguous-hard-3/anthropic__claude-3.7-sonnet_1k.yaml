      Highlands University in New Mexico is located west of Oklahoma Wesleyan University
      in Oklahoma, I need to consider the geographic locations of these two states.


      New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States. It borders Arizona
      to the west, Colorado to the north, Texas to the east and southeast, and Mexico
      to the south.


      Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States. It borders Kansas to
      the north, Missouri and Arkansas to the east, Texas to the south, and New Mexico
      to the west.


      Since New Mexico is west of Oklahoma (they share a border, with New Mexico being
      to the west of Oklahoma), any location in New Mexico would be west of any location
      in Oklahoma.


      Therefore, New Mexico Highlands University in New Mexico would be located west
      of Oklahoma Wesleyan University in Oklahoma.</think>I need to determine the
      relative locations of these two universities by examining which states they''re
      in and how those states are positioned.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these universities are located.

      - New Mexico Highlands University is in New Mexico (NM)

      - Oklahoma Wesleyan University is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these two states.

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States

      - New Mexico and Oklahoma share a border, with New Mexico positioned to the
      west of Oklahoma


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      - Since New Mexico is entirely west of Oklahoma on the map of the United States,
      any location in New Mexico (including New Mexico Highlands University) would
      be west of any location in Oklahoma (including Oklahoma Wesleyan University).

      University, NM is located west of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, OK, I need to
      consider the relative locations of New Mexico and Oklahoma.


      First, let''s think about the general geographic locations of these states:

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States


      Generally speaking, New Mexico is to the west of Oklahoma. These states actually
      share a border, with New Mexico being directly west of Oklahoma.


      Now, let''s consider the specific universities:

      - New Mexico Highlands University is in New Mexico

      - Oklahoma Wesleyan University is in Oklahoma


      Given that New Mexico is west of Oklahoma, it follows that any location in New
      Mexico would be west of any location in Oklahoma. The exact locations of the
      universities within their states don''t change this east-west relationship.</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities
      by looking at their state locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these universities are located.

      - New Mexico Highlands University is in New Mexico (NM)

      - Oklahoma Wesleyan University is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States

      - New Mexico borders Oklahoma on Oklahoma''s western side


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the universities.

      - Since New Mexico is entirely west of Oklahoma, any location in New Mexico
      (including New Mexico Highlands University) would be west of any location in
      Oklahoma (including Oklahoma Wesleyan University).

      Step 1: Identify the states where these universities are located.

      - New Mexico Highlands University is in New Mexico (NM)

      - Oklahoma Wesleyan University is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of these states.

      In the United States, New Mexico is located to the west of Oklahoma. The states
      border arrangement from east to west in this region is roughly: Arkansas, Oklahoma,
      New Mexico, Arizona.


      Step 3: Consider if the specific locations within the states could change the
      answer.

      Even accounting for specific locations within each state, New Mexico as a whole
      is west of Oklahoma. The easternmost point of New Mexico would still be west
      of the westernmost point of Oklahoma.


      Step 4: Conclude based on the state locations.

      Since New Mexico is west of Oklahoma, and the universities are in their respective
      states, New Mexico Highlands University must be west of Oklahoma Wesleyan University.</think>To

      Step 1: Identify the states where these universities are located.

      - New Mexico Highlands University is in New Mexico (NM)

      - Oklahoma Wesleyan University is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Looking at a US map, New Mexico is located directly west of Oklahoma. The states
      are arranged with Oklahoma to the east and New Mexico to the west.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within the states.

      Even if the universities are positioned at opposite ends of their respective
      states (eastern NM vs. western OK), New Mexico''s eastern border is still west
      of Oklahoma''s western border.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on geography.

      Since New Mexico is entirely west of Oklahoma, any location in New Mexico (including
      New Mexico Highlands University) must be west of any location in Oklahoma (including
      Oklahoma Wesleyan University).

      To determine which one is further west, I need to think about the geographical
      positions of the states of New Mexico and Oklahoma.


      New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States. It borders Texas to
      the east, Oklahoma to the northeast, Colorado to the north, and Arizona to the

      to the north, and Missouri and Arkansas to the east.


      Based on this understanding of US geography, New Mexico is located west of Oklahoma.
      Therefore, a university in New Mexico would generally be west of a university
      in Oklahoma.


      So New Mexico Highlands University in NM should be located west of Oklahoma

    5ae9e55d-9f27-4f9c-9c60-c611f228aaec: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative locations of two universities:

      1. Governors State University in Illinois (IL)

      2. Franciscan University of Steubenville in Ohio (OH)


      Specifically, I need to determine if Governors State University is west of Franciscan
      University of Steubenville.


      Let me reason about the general locations:

      - Illinois (IL) is generally west of Ohio (OH) in the United States

      - But I need to check the specific locations of these universities within their
      respective states


      Governors State University is in University Park, Illinois, which is in the
      northeastern part of Illinois, near Chicago.


      Franciscan University of Steubenville is in Steubenville, Ohio, which is in
      the eastern part of Ohio, near the border with Pennsylvania.


      Given that:

      - Illinois is west of Ohio

      - Governors State is in northeastern Illinois

      - Franciscan University is in eastern Ohio


      Even though Governors State is in the eastern part of Illinois, Illinois itself
      is entirely west of Ohio. And since Franciscan is in the eastern part of Ohio,
      the west-east difference is even more pronounced.</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Governors State University is located in University Park, Illinois (IL)

      - Franciscan University of Steubenville is located in Steubenville, Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of Illinois and Ohio.

      - Illinois is located west of Ohio in the United States

      - Illinois and Ohio don''t overlap longitudinally - Illinois is entirely west
      of Ohio


      Step 3: Check if there are any unusual geographic considerations.

      - Governors State University is in the northeastern part of Illinois (Chicago
      area)

      - Franciscan University is in the eastern part of Ohio (near the Pennsylvania
      border)

      - Even though Governors State is in eastern Illinois, the entire state of Illinois
      is still west of Ohio


      Therefore, Governors State University in Illinois is indeed located west of
      Franciscan University of Steubenville in Ohio.

      1. Governors State University (GSU) is in Illinois (IL). Let me think about
      where in Illinois it is. Illinois is in the Midwest US, and borders Indiana
      to the east and Iowa and Missouri to the west. I believe GSU is in University
      Park, which is in the northeastern part of Illinois, near Chicago.


      2. Franciscan University of Steubenville is in Ohio (OH). Ohio is also in the
      Midwest US, but it''s east of Illinois. Steubenville specifically is in eastern
      Ohio, near the border with Pennsylvania and West Virginia.


      3. Now, since Illinois is west of Ohio, and Governors State University is in
      Illinois, while Franciscan University of Steubenville is in Ohio, I can conclude
      that Governors State University is west of Franciscan University of Steubenville.


      So the answer should be YES, Governors State University is located west of Franciscan
      University of Steubenville.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Governors State University is in University Park, Illinois (IL)

      - Franciscan University of Steubenville is in Steubenville, Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of these states.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Ohio is also in the Midwest, but is positioned east of Illinois


      Step 3: Check the specific locations within these states.

      - University Park is in the northeastern part of Illinois

      - Steubenville is in the eastern portion of Ohio, near the Pennsylvania border


      Step 4: Compare the longitudes.

      - Even though University Park is in eastern Illinois, the entire state of Illinois
      lies west of Ohio

      - Steubenville''s location in eastern Ohio places it even further east


      YES, Governors State University in Illinois is located west of Franciscan University
      of Steubenville in Ohio.'

      1) First, I need to determine the locations of these two universities.


      California State University, Bakersfield (CSU Bakersfield) is located in Bakersfield,
      California.


      Roseman University of Health Sciences is located in Nevada (NV).


      2) To determine which is more westerly, I need to think about the geography
      of the western United States.


      California is located on the west coast of the United States, bordering the
      Pacific Ocean.


      Nevada is located east of California, inland from the coast.


      3) Specifically, Bakersfield is in central/southern California, while Roseman
      University has campuses in Henderson and Summerlin (near Las Vegas) in Nevada.


      4) Since all of California is west of Nevada (California''s eastern border meets
      Nevada''s western border), any location in California would be west of any location
      in Nevada.


      Therefore, CSU Bakersfield (in California) is west of Roseman University (in
      Nevada).</think>I''ll solve this step by step to determine which university
      is further west.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - California State University, Bakersfield is located in Bakersfield, California
      (CA).

      - Roseman University of Health Sciences is located in Nevada (NV).


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between California and Nevada.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States.

      - Nevada is directly east of California (California and Nevada share a border,
      with California being to the west).


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific universities.

      - Since Bakersfield, CA is within California, and any point in California is
      west of any point in Nevada, CSU Bakersfield must be west of Roseman University
      in Nevada.


      YES, California State University, Bakersfield is located west of Roseman University

      First, let me think about where these universities are located:


      California State University, Bakersfield (CSUB) is in Bakersfield, California.

      Roseman University of Health Sciences is in Nevada (NV).


      California is on the west coast of the United States, while Nevada is directly

      Roseman University has campuses in Henderson and Summerlin, Nevada, both of

      - National Louis University is in Chicago, in the northeastern part of Illinois

      - Walsh University is in North Canton, in the northeastern part of Ohio


      Step 4: Compare their relative positions.

      Even though both universities are in the northeastern portions of their respective
      states, since Illinois as a whole is west of Ohio, National Louis University
      would be west of Walsh University.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Wayne State University School of Social Work is in Michigan (MI)

      - Marywood University is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographical positions of Michigan and Pennsylvania

      In the United States, states that are more western have lower longitudes (more
      negative numbers if using degrees west, or smaller numbers if using degrees
      east from Greenwich).


      Michigan is generally west of Pennsylvania on a map of the United States. Michigan
      is further inland from the Atlantic coast compared to Pennsylvania.


      Therefore, Wayne State University in Michigan would be west of Marywood University
      in Pennsylvania.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic

      1. I need to determine the locations of these two universities.


      2. University of Louisiana at Monroe is in Monroe, Louisiana (LA). Louisiana
      is in the southern United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico.


      3. Clayton State University is in Georgia (GA). Georgia is also in the southern
      United States, on the Atlantic coast.


      4. In terms of east-west geography in the US, states that are further west have
      longer longitude numbers (when expressed as negative numbers, they have smaller
      absolute values).


      5. Louisiana is west of Georgia in the United States. If you look at a map of
      the US, Louisiana is to the left (west) of Georgia.


      6. Since Monroe, LA is in Louisiana and Clayton State University is in Georgia,
      and Louisiana is west of Georgia, then University of Louisiana at Monroe is
      west of Clayton State University.</think>To answer this question, I need to
      determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of Louisiana at Monroe is located in Monroe, Louisiana

      - Clayton State University is located in Morrow, Georgia


      Step 2: Determine the east-west relationship between Louisiana and Georgia.

      - On a US map, Louisiana is positioned to the west of Georgia

      - Louisiana is closer to Texas and the central part of the country

      - Georgia is on the eastern side of the US, bordering the Atlantic Ocean


      Step 3: Since the universities are in their respective states, their east-west
      relationship follows the same pattern as their states.

      - Monroe, LA is west of Morrow, GA

      - Therefore, University of Louisiana at Monroe is west of Clayton State University

      I need to determine if University of Louisiana at Monroe is located west of
      Clayton State University.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - University of Louisiana at Monroe is in Monroe, Louisiana (LA)

      - Clayton State University is in Georgia (GA)


      Now, I need to think about the geography of the United States. Louisiana is
      in the southern part of the US, and is west of Georgia. Georgia is on the east
      coast, while Louisiana is further inland toward the central part of the southern
      US.


      Since Louisiana is west of Georgia, and the universities are in their respective
      states, the University of Louisiana at Monroe must be west of Clayton State
      University.</think>I need to determine if University of Louisiana at Monroe
      (in Louisiana) is west of Clayton State University (in Georgia).


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of Louisiana at Monroe is in Monroe, Louisiana (LA)

      - Clayton State University is in Morrow, Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Louisiana is located in the south-central United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Louisiana sits to the west of Georgia on the US map

      - Monroe, LA would be west of any location in Georgia


      Since Louisiana is west of Georgia on the map, and these universities are located
      within their respective states, the University of Louisiana at Monroe is indeed
      west of Clayton State University.

      University of Louisiana at Monroe is located in Monroe, Louisiana (LA).

      Clayton State University is located in Morrow, Georgia (GA).


      To determine which is further west, I need to compare their longitudes. In the
      US, states further west have higher longitude values (more negative, since US
      longitudes are in the western hemisphere).


      Generally, Louisiana is west of Georgia in the United States. Louisiana is in
      the southern central part of the US, while Georgia is in the southeastern part
      of the US.


      More specifically:

      - Monroe, LA is in the northeastern part of Louisiana

      - Morrow, GA is in the north-central part of Georgia (near Atlanta)


      Based on my knowledge of US geography, Louisiana is definitely west of Georgia,

      - Louisiana is located in the south-central United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - On a US map, Louisiana is positioned to the west of Georgia

      - Monroe, LA is in the northeastern part of Louisiana, but still significantly
      west of any part of Georgia

      - Morrow, GA (near Atlanta) is in the north-central part of Georgia


      Step 4: Make the conclusion based on geographical positions.

      Since Louisiana is west of Georgia on the US map, University of Louisiana at
      Monroe is located west of Clayton State University.

      - Texas (TX) is generally west of Louisiana (LA)

      - Louisiana borders Texas on Texas''s eastern border


      Now for the specific colleges:

      - Lee College is in Texas (TX)

      - New Orleans University is in Louisiana (LA), specifically in New Orleans which
      is in the southeastern part of Louisiana


      Since Texas is west of Louisiana, and Lee College is in Texas while New Orleans
      University is in Louisiana, it would generally follow that Lee College is west
      of New Orleans University.


      However, I should consider the specific locations within their states. Lee College
      is located in Baytown, Texas, which is in the eastern part of Texas, near the
      Gulf Coast. New Orleans is in the southeastern part of Louisiana, also near
      the Gulf Coast.


      Even though Lee College is in eastern Texas, it should still be west of New
      Orleans, since the entire state of Texas is west of Louisiana.</think>I need
      to determine the relative east-west positions of these two colleges.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both colleges.

      - Lee College is located in Baytown, Texas (TX)

      - New Orleans University is in New Orleans, Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and Louisiana.

      - Texas is located west of Louisiana

      - Louisiana borders Texas on Texas''s eastern border


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Baytown, TX is in the eastern part of Texas, near Houston

      - New Orleans is in the southeastern part of Louisiana


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      - Even though Baytown is in eastern Texas, all of Texas (including its easternmost
      parts) is still west of New Orleans, Louisiana

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - Mount Mercy University is in Cedar Rapids, Iowa (IA)

      - Eastern Michigan University is in Ypsilanti, Michigan (MI)


      Now I need to compare their relative east-west positions. In the US, states

      Iowa is in the Midwest and is generally west of Michigan. Michigan is in the
      Great Lakes region and is further east than Iowa.


      Since Mount Mercy University is in Iowa and Eastern Michigan University is in

      Iowa is in the Midwest region of the United States, while Michigan is in the
      Great Lakes region further east. Looking at a US map, Iowa is clearly west of
      Michigan.


      ## Step 3: Verify the specific locations

      Cedar Rapids, IA is positioned in eastern Iowa, but even the easternmost part
      of Iowa is still west of Ypsilanti, MI, which is in southeastern Michigan.


      Therefore: YES, Mount Mercy University is located west of Eastern Michigan University

      - Regent University is located in Virginia Beach, Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Kentucky and Virginia.

      - Kentucky is located in the eastern portion of the United States, but is inland

      - Virginia is located on the Atlantic coast of the eastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Virginia is further east, bordering the Atlantic Ocean

      - Kentucky is positioned to the west of Virginia

      - Any location in Kentucky would be west of any location in Virginia


      Therefore, Owensboro Community and Technical College in Kentucky is indeed located
      west of Regent University in Virginia.

      2. Lon Morris College is in Texas (TX). Texas is in the western part of the
      United States.


      3. Air University is in Alabama (AL). Alabama is in the southeastern part of
      the United States.


      4. Generally speaking, Texas is west of Alabama in the United States.


      5. To be more specific, I should consider where in Texas Lon Morris College
      is located and where in Alabama Air University is located.


      6. Lon Morris College is located in Jacksonville, Texas, which is in East Texas.


      7. Air University is located at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama,
      which is in central Alabama.


      8. Even though Lon Morris College is in East Texas, Texas is still west of Alabama
      on the map of the United States.

      - Air University is in Alabama (AL)

      - On a U.S. map, Texas is located west of Alabama


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within each state.

      - Lon Morris College was located in Jacksonville, Texas, in the eastern part
      of Texas

      - Air University is located at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama,
      in the central part of Alabama


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions.

      - Even though Lon Morris College is in East Texas, the easternmost parts of
      Texas are still west of the westernmost parts of Alabama

      - Texas and Alabama are not adjacent states, with Mississippi and Louisiana
      between them


      Step 4: Make the final determination based on geography.

      - Any location in Texas, including Jacksonville where Lon Morris College is
      located, is west of any location in Alabama, including Montgomery where Air
      University is located


      YES, Lon Morris College, TX is located west of Air University, AL.'

      To solve this, I need to think about the relative geographic positions of New
      Mexico and Arkansas within the United States.


      The United States, from west to east, roughly has states in this order:

      - West Coast (CA, OR, WA)

      - Mountain West (NV, ID, MT, WY, UT, CO, AZ, NM)

      - Central Plains/Midwest (ND, SD, NE, KS, OK, TX)

      - South/Southeast (AR, LA, MS, AL, etc.)

      - And then further east


      New Mexico (NM) is in the Mountain West region, while Arkansas (AR) is in the
      South/Southeast region.


      New Mexico is significantly west of Arkansas on the map of the United States.
      Any location in New Mexico would be west of any location in Arkansas.


      Since Eastern New Mexico University is in New Mexico, and Henderson State University
      is in Arkansas, the former must be west of the latter.</think>I need to determine
      the geographic relationship between these two universities by examining which

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Eastern New Mexico University is in New Mexico (NM)

      - Henderson State University is in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states on the US map.

      - New Mexico is in the southwestern United States, bordering Arizona to the
      west and Texas to the east

      - Arkansas is in the southeastern United States, well east of New Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - New Mexico is significantly west of Arkansas on the US map

      - Even the eastern part of New Mexico is still west of the westernmost part
      of Arkansas


      Therefore, Eastern New Mexico University (despite having "Eastern" in its name)
      is located west of Henderson State University in Arkansas.

      get more western as you move from right to left on the map.


      New Mexico (NM) is located in the southwestern United States, bordering Arizona

      - Even though it has "Eastern" in its name (referring to its position within
      New Mexico), Eastern New Mexico University is still located in a state that

      This is a geography question that requires understanding the relative positions

      borders Texas to its southwest.


      Since Eastern New Mexico University is in New Mexico, and Henderson State University

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states within the US.

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - New Mexico lies significantly west of Arkansas on the US map

      - Even the eastern part of New Mexico (where Eastern New Mexico University would
      be) is still west of all of Arkansas


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since New Mexico is entirely west of Arkansas, Eastern New Mexico University
      must be west of Henderson State University.

      2. Oklahoma Panhandle State University is located in Goodwell, Oklahoma, in

      Mexico/Colorado area.


      The Oklahoma Panhandle is the narrow strip of Oklahoma that extends westward,

      Even though the Oklahoma Panhandle extends westward, Colorado as a whole is
      still further west than the Oklahoma Panhandle. Alamosa, where Adams State University

      First, I need to determine the locations of these two universities:

      1. Kentucky Christian University is in Kentucky (KY)

      2. Stevenson University is in Maryland (MD)


      Now, I need to think about the relative geographical locations of these two
      states in the US.


      Kentucky is a state in the east-central United States, bordered by Illinois,
      Indiana, and Ohio to the north, West Virginia and Virginia to the east, Tennessee
      to the south, and Missouri to the west.


      Maryland is a state on the East Coast of the United States, bordered by Pennsylvania
      to the north, Delaware and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, Virginia and West
      Virginia to the west, and Washington, D.C. to the south.


      When considering the geography of the United States, states generally get more
      western as you move from the East Coast toward the West Coast. Maryland is an
      East Coast state, while Kentucky is more inland.


      Looking at their relative positions on a US map, Kentucky is indeed west of
      Maryland. So a university in Kentucky would be west of a university in Maryland.</think>To

      - Stevenson University is in Maryland (MD)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Maryland is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Kentucky is located in the east-central United States, inland from the coast


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Maryland is further east, bordering the Atlantic Ocean

      - Kentucky is positioned to the west of Maryland in the US map


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Since Kentucky is west of Maryland geographically, Kentucky Christian University
      would be west of Stevenson University.

      First, let me recall the general geographical positions:

      - Iowa (IA) is a state in the Midwest, located west of Indiana

      - Indiana (IN) is also in the Midwest, but east of Iowa


      Specifically:

      - Graceland University is in Iowa (IA)

      - Purdue University Fort Wayne is in Indiana (IN)


      Since Iowa is west of Indiana, and Graceland University is in Iowa while Purdue
      University Fort Wayne is in Indiana, Graceland University must be west of Purdue
      University Fort Wayne.</think>I''ll solve this step by step by comparing the
      locations of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these universities are located.

      - Graceland University is in Iowa (IA)

      - Purdue University Fort Wayne is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographical positions of these states.

      - Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Indiana is also in the Midwest region

      - Importantly, Iowa is positioned to the west of Indiana on the US map


      Step 3: Make the comparison based on state locations.

      Since Graceland University is in Iowa, and Purdue University Fort Wayne is in
      Indiana, and Iowa is west of Indiana, Graceland University must be west of Purdue
      University Fort Wayne.

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - Graceland University is in Iowa (IA)

      - Purdue University Fort Wayne is in Indiana (IN)


      Now, I need to determine their relative positions on the east-west axis. In
      the United States, states generally follow this pattern from west to east:

      - Western states (e.g., California, Oregon, Washington)

      - Mountain states (e.g., Colorado, Utah, Montana)

      - Central/Midwestern states (e.g., Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska)

      - Midwestern/Great Lakes states (e.g., Illinois, Indiana, Ohio)

      - Eastern states (e.g., Pennsylvania, New York, etc.)


      Iowa is in the Midwest/Central region, while Indiana is further east in the
      Great Lakes region. Generally speaking, Iowa is west of Indiana.

      ## Step 2: Compare the geographical positions

      Looking at a US map, Iowa is located to the west of Indiana in the United States.
      Iowa borders Illinois on its eastern side, and Indiana is located east of Illinois.


      ## Step 3: Confirm relative positions

      Since Iowa is west of Indiana, and Graceland University is in Iowa while Purdue
      University Fort Wayne is in Indiana, Graceland University must be west of Purdue
      University Fort Wayne.

      - Des Moines is the capital of Iowa, located in the central part of the state

      - I''m not certain of the exact location of Ohio Northern University, but being

      Professional & Continuing Studies, VA.


      First, let''s locate each institution geographically:


      1. Western Kentucky University-Owensboro is in Owensboro, Kentucky

      2. University of Richmond School of Professional & Continuing Studies is in
      Richmond, Virginia


      Now I need to determine which is further west. In the US, states further west
      have lower longitude values.


      Kentucky is generally west of Virginia in the United States. Kentucky is in
      the east-central part of the US, while Virginia is on the east coast.


      Specifically:

      - Owensboro, KY is in western Kentucky

      - Richmond, VA is in eastern Virginia


      So Western Kentucky University-Owensboro is definitely west of the University
      of Richmond.</think>To determine if Western Kentucky University-Owensboro, KY

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - Western Kentucky University-Owensboro is in Kentucky (KY)

      - University of Richmond is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Compare the general geographic positions of these states

      - Kentucky is located in the east-central United States

      - Virginia is located on the east coast of the United States

      - Generally, Kentucky is west of Virginia


      Step 3: Check the specific cities

      - Owensboro is in the western part of Kentucky

      - Richmond is in the eastern part of Virginia

      - This further increases the east-west distance between them


      Step 4: Conclude based on relative positions

      Since Owensboro, Kentucky is in a state that''s already west of Virginia, and
      Owensboro is in the western portion of Kentucky while Richmond is in the eastern
      portion of Virginia, Western Kentucky University-Owensboro is definitely west
      of the University of Richmond.

      Generally speaking:

      - Kentucky is west of Virginia in the United States

      - Owensboro is a city in western Kentucky

      - Richmond is a city in eastern Virginia


      Let me think about the geography:

      - Virginia is an east coast state

      - Kentucky is more inland and west of Virginia

      - Any location in Kentucky would be west of any location in Virginia


      So Western Kentucky University in Owensboro, KY would definitely be west of
      University of Richmond in Virginia.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.</think>I need to determine the east-west relationship

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Kentucky is located to the west of Virginia in the United States

      - Virginia is an east coast state, while Kentucky is more inland


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      - Owensboro is in western Kentucky

      - Richmond is in eastern Virginia


      Since Kentucky is entirely west of Virginia, and Owensboro is in the western
      part of Kentucky while Richmond is in the eastern part of Virginia, Western
      Kentucky University-Owensboro is definitely west of the University of Richmond.

      2. Florida State University School of Library & Information Studies is in Florida
      (FL)


      In the United States, Texas is located west of Florida. On a map of the US,
      Florida is on the southeastern corner of the country, while Texas is in the
      south-central part of the country.


      Since Texas A&M is in Texas, and Florida State University is in Florida, and

      determine if Texas A&M College of Geosciences is west of Florida State University''s
      School of Library & Information Studies, I need to compare their geographical
      locations.

      - Texas A&M College of Geosciences is in Texas (TX)

      - Florida State University School of Library & Information Studies is in Florida
      (FL)


      Step 2: Compare the geographical positions of these states.

      - Texas is located in the south-central region of the United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern corner of the United States


      Step 3: Determine their relative east-west positioning.

      - On a U.S. map, Texas is positioned to the west of Florida

      - Moving from Florida to Texas requires traveling westward


      Since Texas is west of Florida, and these colleges are in their respective states,
      Texas A&M College of Geosciences (in Texas) is indeed west of Florida State
      University''s School of Library & Information Studies (in Florida).

      To be more precise, I would need the exact coordinates of both institutions,
      but the state-level information is sufficient for this question since Illinois
      is entirely west of Ohio.


      Therefore, Lincoln College in Illinois would be located west of Urbana University
      in Ohio.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these
      two colleges based on their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each college is located.

      - Lincoln College is in Illinois (IL)

      - Urbana University is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between Illinois and Ohio.

      Illinois is located west of Ohio in the United States. The states are not adjacent
      - Indiana sits between them. But the entire state of Illinois is west of the
      entire state of Ohio.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level geographic relationship to the colleges.

      Since Lincoln College is in Illinois, and Urbana University is in Ohio, and
      Illinois is west of Ohio, Lincoln College must be west of Urbana University.

      Dakota Public Universities and Research Center, SD is located west of University
      Center Rochester, MN.


      To determine this, I need to compare the longitudes of both institutions. In
      the United States, locations that are more western have higher longitude values
      (with west being negative numbers).


      Let me break this down:


      1. First, I need to identify where South Dakota Public Universities and Research
      Center is located in South Dakota.

      2. Second, I need to identify where University Center Rochester is located in
      Minnesota.

      3. Then I need to compare their east-west positions.


      South Dakota is a state that''s west of Minnesota. The entire state of South
      Dakota is west of Minnesota. Minnesota borders South Dakota on South Dakota''s
      eastern border.


      Given this geographic reality, any location in South Dakota would be west of
      any location in Minnesota.


      So South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center in SD must be west of
      University Center Rochester in MN.</think>I need to determine if South Dakota
      Public Universities and Research Center in SD is located west of University
      Center Rochester in MN.


      Step 1: Consider the geographic locations of South Dakota and Minnesota.

      South Dakota is positioned directly west of Minnesota in the United States.


      Step 2: Analyze the state border relationship.

      Minnesota shares its western border with South Dakota''s eastern border.


      Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the specific institutions.

      Since South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center is in South Dakota,
      and University Center Rochester is in Minnesota, the South Dakota institution
      must be west of the Minnesota institution.


      YES, South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center, SD is located west

      1. University of Michigan-Dearborn is located in Dearborn, Michigan (MI)

      2. Framingham State University is located in Framingham, Massachusetts (MA)


      Now I need to determine which one is farther east or west. In the United States:

      - Massachusetts is roughly around 70-73 degrees West longitude


      Since Massachusetts has a higher longitude value (less negative, or farther

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Massachusetts is located on the East Coast of the United States


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      - Massachusetts is significantly farther east in the country

      - Michigan is more centrally located and is west of Massachusetts

      - On a map of the United States, Michigan is clearly to the west of Massachusetts

      find the relative locations of these two universities.


      1. Reinhardt University is in Georgia (GA)

      2. Wingate University is in North Carolina (NC)


      Let me think about the geographic positions of these states:

      - Georgia is south of North Carolina

      - But the question is about east-west positioning, not north-south

      - Georgia is generally to the west of North Carolina when looking at a US map

      - North Carolina is on the Atlantic coast, while Georgia is slightly more inland
      (though GA also has some Atlantic coastline)


      To be more specific:

      - Reinhardt University is in Waleska, Georgia

      - Wingate University is in Wingate, North Carolina


      Looking at their relative positions on a mental map:

      - Waleska, GA is in northern Georgia, likely in the northwestern part of the
      state

      - Wingate, NC is likely in the southern part of North Carolina


      Given that Georgia is generally west of North Carolina, and specifically the
      locations of these towns, Reinhardt University (in Waleska, GA) should be west
      of Wingate University (in Wingate, NC).</think>I''ll solve this by determining
      the relative east-west positions of these universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Reinhardt University is in Waleska, Georgia (GA)

      - Wingate University is in Wingate, North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Georgia and North Carolina.

      - North Carolina is on the Atlantic coast

      - Georgia is southwest of North Carolina

      - When comparing east-west positioning, Georgia is generally west of North Carolina


      Step 3: Look more specifically at these university locations.

      - Waleska, GA (where Reinhardt is located) is in northern Georgia

      - Wingate, NC is in southern North Carolina

      - Even though these are in different parts of their respective states, the overall
      east-west relationship holds


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on their coordinates.

      - Reinhardt University in Georgia is indeed west of Wingate University in North
      Carolina

      relative locations of Reinhardt University in Georgia and Wingate University
      in North Carolina, I need to determine their east-west positioning relative
      to each other.


      Step 1: Recall the general geographic positioning of Georgia (GA) and North
      Carolina (NC).

      Georgia is located south of North Carolina, but that doesn''t directly tell
      us the east-west positioning. However, in general, Georgia extends further west
      than North Carolina.


      Step 2: Try to recall the specific locations of these universities.

      Reinhardt University is in Georgia, but I need to know where in Georgia.

      Wingate University is in North Carolina, but I need to know where in North Carolina.


      Let me think about this more specifically:

      - Reinhardt University is located in Waleska, Georgia, which is in the northern
      part of Georgia.

      - Wingate University is located in Wingate, North Carolina, which is in the
      south-central part of North Carolina.


      Step 3: Consider the east-west positioning.

      Georgia is generally west of North Carolina when looking at the eastern portions
      of both states. However, North Carolina''s western region extends westward alongside
      the northern part of Georgia.


      Given that Reinhardt is in northern Georgia (Waleska) and Wingate is in south-central

      I need to determine the east-west relationship between these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Identify their locations

      - Reinhardt University is located in Waleska, Georgia

      - Wingate University is located in Wingate, North Carolina


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positioning of Georgia and North Carolina

      Georgia is generally positioned southwest of North Carolina on the US map.


      ## Step 3: Look at specific locations within their states

      - Waleska, GA is in the northern part of Georgia

      - Wingate, NC is in the south-central region of North Carolina

      Step 1: Let''s identify where Reinhardt University in Georgia is located.

      Reinhardt University is located in Waleska, Georgia.


      Step 2: Let''s identify where Wingate University in North Carolina is located.

      Wingate University is located in Wingate, North Carolina.


      Step 3: Let''s determine their relative positions.

      - Georgia is generally west of North Carolina, as Georgia is located in the
      southeastern US, while North Carolina is on the eastern seaboard.

      - Specifically, Waleska, GA (where Reinhardt University is) is in the northern
      part of Georgia.

      - Wingate, NC (where Wingate University is) is in the southern part of North
      Carolina.

      - Reinhardt University is located in Waleska, Georgia

      - Wingate University is located in Wingate, North Carolina


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Georgia and North Carolina.

      Georgia is located west of North Carolina. Georgia borders the western part
      of North Carolina, with Georgia being more toward the interior of the country
      and North Carolina extending to the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      Waleska, GA (home to Reinhardt) is in the northern part of Georgia, while Wingate,
      NC is in the southern part of North Carolina. Even though these specific cities
      might have different north-south positions, their east-west relationship follows
      their states'' positioning.


      YES, Reinhardt University in Georgia is located west of Wingate University in

      - Georgia is generally west of North Carolina (GA is to the left of NC on a
      US map)

      - Georgia shares its eastern border with parts of North Carolina''s western
      region


      Now, let''s consider the specific locations of these universities:

      - Reinhardt University is in Georgia

      - Wingate University is in North Carolina


      Without knowing the exact cities, I would assume that a university in Georgia
      is likely west of one in North Carolina. But let me think about where these
      might be located specifically:


      Reinhardt University is in Waleska, Georgia, which is in the northern part of
      Georgia.

      Wingate University is in Wingate, North Carolina, which is in the southern part
      of North Carolina.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Reinhardt University is located in Waleska, Georgia

      - Wingate University is located in Wingate, North Carolina


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Georgia and North Carolina.

      - Georgia is positioned to the west of North Carolina on the US map

      - Georgia shares its northeastern border with western North Carolina


      Step 3: Look at the specific locations within their states.

      - Waleska, GA is in the northern part of Georgia

      - Wingate, NC is in the southern part of North Carolina, near Charlotte

      - This positioning doesn''t change the general west-east relationship between
      the states


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since Georgia is west of North Carolina, and the specific locations of these
      universities maintain this directional relationship, Reinhardt University is

      west coast of the United States.

      - Williston State College is in North Dakota (ND), which is in the northern
      Great Plains region, much further east than Washington state.


      Step 2: Let me consider the general locations of these states.

      - Washington state borders the Pacific Ocean on the west and Idaho on the east.

      - North Dakota is in the upper Midwest, bordering Minnesota to the east, South
      Dakota to the south, Montana to the west, and Canada to the north.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      Washington state is entirely west of North Dakota. Looking at a US map, Washington
      is on the west coast while North Dakota is several states to the east.


      Step 4: Consider the specific locations of the universities within their states.

      - Eastern Washington University is in Cheney, Washington, which is in the eastern
      part of Washington state (as the university name suggests).

      - Williston State College is in Williston, North Dakota, which is in the northwestern
      part of North Dakota.

      in Ohio is located west of Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two institutions.


      The question is about their geographical positions on the east-west axis (longitude).
      In the United States, locations further west have higher longitude values.


      Otterbein University is in Ohio (OH). Ohio is generally west of Pennsylvania
      (PA) in the United States.


      Lincoln University is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is east of Ohio.


      Since Ohio is west of Pennsylvania, and Otterbein University is in Ohio while
      Lincoln University is in Pennsylvania, Otterbein University would be west of
      Lincoln University.


      So the answer should be YES.


      Actually, I made an error in my reasoning. In the United States, locations further
      west have LOWER longitude values, not higher. The east coast has higher longitude
      values (around 70-80 degrees West) and the west coast has lower longitude values
      (around 120-125 degrees West).


      Let me reason again correctly:

      - Ohio is located to the west of Pennsylvania on the US map

      - Pennsylvania borders Ohio on its western side


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the universities.

      - Since Otterbein University is in Ohio and Lincoln University is in Pennsylvania,

      the United States:

      - Kentucky is located in the east-central part of the US

      - Virginia is located on the east coast of the US


      Kentucky is west of Virginia on the map. States generally become more western
      as you move from the east coast (where Virginia is) toward the central part
      of the country (where Kentucky is).


      Therefore, Bellarmine University in Kentucky would be west of Strayer University
      in Virginia.</think>I need to determine if Bellarmine University in Kentucky
      is located west of Strayer University in Virginia by comparing their geographic
      positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Bellarmine University is located in Louisville, Kentucky (KY)

      - Strayer University is located in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Compare the geographic positions of Kentucky and Virginia.

      - Kentucky is in the east-central region of the United States

      - Virginia is on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - On a map of the US, Kentucky is positioned to the west of Virginia


      Step 3: Make a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Kentucky is west of Virginia geographically, Bellarmine University in
      Kentucky would be located west of Strayer University in Virginia.


      YES'
    16bed286-8a8b-4ad4-890b-62157d405281: '<think>To determine whether Bellarmine
      University in Kentucky is located west of Strayer University in Virginia, I
      need to consider the geographic locations of these states and universities.


      1. First, let''s identify the states: Bellarmine University is in Kentucky (KY)
      and Strayer University is in Virginia (VA).


      2. Geographically in the United States, Kentucky is located to the west of Virginia.
      Kentucky is in the east-central part of the US, while Virginia is on the east
      coast.


      3. To be more precise, I should consider the specific locations of these universities
      within their states. However, even if Bellarmine is in the eastern part of Kentucky
      and Strayer is in the western part of Virginia, Kentucky as a whole is still
      west of Virginia.


      Therefore, Bellarmine University in Kentucky would be located west of Strayer
      University in Virginia.</think>I need to determine the relative locations of
      these two universities by looking at their states first.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Bellarmine University is in Kentucky (KY)

      - Strayer University is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Kentucky is located to the west of Virginia in the United States

      - Kentucky is in the east-central region of the US

      - Virginia is on the eastern seaboard


      Step 3: Even if Bellarmine were in eastern Kentucky and Strayer in western Virginia,
      the overall geographic relationship would still hold true because Kentucky as
      a whole state is west of Virginia.


      YES'
    372fc714-f71c-4048-b08a-647b5c640f2c: '<think>To determine if Bellarmine University
      in Kentucky is located west of Strayer University in Virginia, I need to figure
      out the relative geographic locations of these two places.


      First, let''s identify where these states are located:

      - Kentucky (KY) is located in the east-central United States

      - Virginia (VA) is located on the east coast of the United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Kentucky is generally west of Virginia

      - States that are closer to the Atlantic coast (like Virginia) are further east
      than inland states like Kentucky


      So in general, a university in Kentucky would likely be west of a university
      in Virginia. But let me think more specifically about these universities.


      Bellarmine University is in Louisville, Kentucky, which is in the northern part
      of Kentucky.

      Strayer University has multiple campuses in Virginia, but regardless of which
      specific campus, Virginia as a whole is east of Kentucky.


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Kentucky is definitely west of Virginia.
      The eastern border of Kentucky is still west of the western border of Virginia.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the geographic locations of these
      two universities based on their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      - Bellarmine University is in Kentucky (KY)

      - Strayer University is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Determine the east-west relationship between these states.

      Kentucky is located in the east-central United States, while Virginia is on
      the eastern seaboard (Atlantic coast).


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east axis.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Kentucky is positioned to the west of
      Virginia. The entire state of Kentucky lies west of Virginia''s western border.


      Step 4: Apply this to the universities.

      Since Bellarmine University is in Kentucky and Strayer University is in Virginia,
      Bellarmine must be west of Strayer.


      YES'

      1. I need to determine if Bellarmine University in Kentucky is located west
      of Strayer University in Virginia.


      2. First, I need to understand the relative locations of Kentucky (KY) and Virginia
      (VA) in the United States.


      3. Kentucky is located in the east-central part of the United States, while
      Virginia is on the east coast.


      4. States that are more toward the east coast of the US have a more eastern
      longitude than states that are further inland.


      5. Kentucky is west of Virginia in terms of US geography. Kentucky borders Virginia''s
      western side.


      6. Since Bellarmine University is in Kentucky and Strayer University is in Virginia,
      and Kentucky is west of Virginia, it follows that Bellarmine University is west
      of Strayer University.


      So the answer is YES, Bellarmine University, KY is located west of Strayer University,
      VA.</think>I need to determine the geographical relationship between these two
      universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Bellarmine University is in Kentucky (KY)

      - Strayer University is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - Kentucky is located in the east-central United States

      - Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Kentucky is positioned to the west of Virginia


      Step 3: Since the universities are in their respective states, the same geographical
      relationship applies to them.

      - Bellarmine University (in Kentucky) would be west of Strayer University (in
      Virginia)


      YES, Bellarmine University, KY is located west of Strayer University, VA.'
    5054ef1c-be08-4348-acd8-417ae29205b9: '<think>I need to determine the locations
      of Bellarmine University in Kentucky and Strayer University in Virginia, and

      Bellarmine University is in Kentucky (KY). Kentucky is in the eastern part of
      the United States, but more specifically, it''s located to the west of Virginia.


      Strayer University is in Virginia (VA). Virginia is on the eastern coast of
      the United States.


      Given the general geography of the United States, Kentucky is west of Virginia.
      Therefore, Bellarmine University in KY should be west of Strayer University
      in VA.


      Let me double check this by recalling the relative positions of these states.
      Virginia is on the Atlantic coast, while Kentucky is inland, bordering Virginia
      on its western side. So my reasoning is correct - Kentucky is indeed west of
      Virginia.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the locations
      of both universities and compare their east-west positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Bellarmine University is in Kentucky (KY)

      - Strayer University is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Kentucky is located to the west of Virginia. Virginia is on the eastern seaboard
      of the United States, while Kentucky is further inland.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the universities.

      Since Bellarmine University is in Kentucky and Strayer University is in Virginia,
      and Kentucky is west of Virginia, it follows that Bellarmine University is west
      of Strayer University.


      YES'

      University, KY is located west of Strayer University, VA, I need to know the
      relative geographic positions of Kentucky (KY) and Virginia (VA), as well as

      First, let me consider the general geographic relationship between Kentucky
      and Virginia:

      - Kentucky is located to the west of Virginia in the United States.

      - Kentucky borders Virginia on Virginia''s western side.


      Now, let me think about the specific universities:

      - Bellarmine University is in Kentucky (KY), specifically in Louisville, which
      is in the northern part of Kentucky.

      - Strayer University is in Virginia (VA). Strayer actually has multiple campuses,
      but since the question specifies VA, I''ll consider their Virginia locations,
      which include places like Alexandria, Arlington, and other cities in Virginia.


      Since Kentucky is entirely west of Virginia, and Bellarmine University is in
      Kentucky while Strayer University (VA campuses) is in Virginia, it follows that
      Bellarmine University is west of Strayer University.</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Bellarmine University is in Kentucky (KY)

      - Strayer University is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Kentucky is located to the west of Virginia

      - The two states don''t directly border each other (West Virginia is between
      them), but Kentucky is definitely west of Virginia on a map of the United States


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations of the universities within their states.

      - Even if Bellarmine is in eastern Kentucky and Strayer is in western Virginia,
      Kentucky as a whole is still west of Virginia

      - The east-west positioning of the states determines the answer here


      Therefore, Bellarmine University in Kentucky is indeed located west of Strayer
      University in Virginia.

      relative locations of two colleges:

      1. Western College for Women in Ohio (OH)

      2. Haverford College in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Specifically, it''s asking if Western College for Women is located west of Haverford
      College.


      To answer this, I need to know the geographic positions of these two states
      and potentially the specific locations of these colleges within their states.


      Generally speaking:

      - Ohio (OH) is west of Pennsylvania (PA) in the United States

      - Ohio borders Pennsylvania on Pennsylvania''s western side


      Since Western College for Women is in Ohio, and Haverford College is in Pennsylvania,
      and Ohio is west of Pennsylvania, it''s highly likely that Western College for
      Women is indeed west of Haverford College.


      Let me verify this reasoning:

      - Western College for Women would be somewhere in Ohio

      - Haverford College would be somewhere in Pennsylvania

      - Even if Western College were on the eastern edge of Ohio and Haverford College
      were on the western edge of Pennsylvania, Western College would still likely
      be west of Haverford because of the general geographical arrangement of these
      states.


      So the answer seems to be YES.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positioning of these two colleges.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these colleges are located.

      - Western College for Women is in Ohio (OH)

      - Haverford College is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between Ohio and Pennsylvania.

      - Ohio is located west of Pennsylvania in the United States

      - Pennsylvania shares its western border with Ohio


      Step 3: Consider if there could be exceptions based on specific locations within
      each state.

      - Even if Western College for Women were on the eastern edge of Ohio and Haverford
      College on the western edge of Pennsylvania, the general east-west arrangement
      of the states would still place the Ohio college west of the Pennsylvania college.


      Therefore, Western College for Women in Ohio is located west of Haverford College
      in Pennsylvania.

      First, I need to know which state is further west. The United States generally

      Ohio is west of Pennsylvania. On a map of the US, Pennsylvania borders the Atlantic
      Ocean (on its eastern edge), while Ohio is inland, west of Pennsylvania. They
      actually share a small border, with Ohio directly to the west of Pennsylvania.

      - Pennsylvania is on the eastern side of the United States, bordering the mid-Atlantic
      region

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region, directly west of Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Consider the locations within their respective states.

      - Even without knowing the exact locations within each state, the entirety of
      Ohio is west of Pennsylvania geographically


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on state positions.

      - Since Western College for Women is in Ohio, and Ohio is entirely west of Pennsylvania
      where Haverford College is located, Western College for Women must be west of
      Haverford College.


      YES, Western College for Women, OH is located west of Haverford College, PA.'

      Next, I need to think about the relative geography of these states:

      - Kentucky is generally west of Virginia on the US map

      - Kentucky borders Virginia on Virginia''s western side


      To be more specific about the universities:

      - Western Kentucky University is in Bowling Green, Kentucky, which is in the
      southern part of Kentucky

      - Radford University is in Radford, Virginia, which is in the western part of
      Virginia


      Even though Radford is in western Virginia, Kentucky as a whole state is west
      of Virginia. Western Kentucky University, being in Kentucky, should be west
      of Radford University.

      Step 1: Identify the states where these universities are located.

      - Western Kentucky University is in Kentucky (KY)

      - Radford University is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states on the US map.

      - Kentucky is positioned to the west of Virginia

      - Kentucky and Virginia are not adjacent states (West Virginia lies between
      them)


      Step 3: Be more specific about the university locations.

      - Western Kentucky University is in Bowling Green, KY, in the southern part
      of the state

      - Radford University is in Radford, VA, in the western part of Virginia


      Step 4: Compare the longitudes.

      - Even though Radford is in western Virginia, the entirety of Kentucky lies
      west of Virginia on the US map

      - Kentucky (KY) is generally west of Virginia (VA) in the United States.

      - Kentucky borders Virginia along Virginia''s western side.


      Now, let''s think about the specific locations of these universities within
      their states:

      1) First, I need to locate Syracuse University School of Education in New York.

      Syracuse University is located in Syracuse, NY, which is in central New York
      state.


      2) Next, I need to locate Middlesex University in Massachusetts.

      Here I''m a bit confused because Middlesex University is primarily known as
      a university in London, UK. There might be a Middlesex Community College in
      Massachusetts, but I don''t believe there''s a "Middlesex University, MA" in
      the traditional sense. Let me assume the question is referring to an institution
      in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.


      Middlesex County is in eastern Massachusetts, containing cities like Cambridge,
      Lowell, etc.


      3) Now I need to compare the east-west positions:

      - Syracuse, NY is in central New York state

      - Middlesex County, MA is in eastern Massachusetts


      Looking at a map of the northeastern United States, New York state is west of
      Massachusetts. Syracuse being in central NY would be significantly west of any
      location in Middlesex County, MA.


      So Syracuse University School of Education in NY would be located west of any
      institution in Middlesex County, MA.</think>I need to determine the relative
      east-west positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Syracuse University School of Education is located in Syracuse, New York.

      - Middlesex University in Massachusetts (though I should note that Middlesex
      is typically a county name in Massachusetts, not a well-known university name
      - there''s Middlesex Community College, but the main Middlesex University is
      actually in London, UK).


      Step 2: Determine their positions on a map.

      - Syracuse, NY is in central New York state.

      - Middlesex County, MA is in eastern Massachusetts.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - New York state is west of Massachusetts.

      - Syracuse, being in central New York, is definitely west of any location in
      Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

      First, let me identify where Syracuse University is located:

      - Syracuse University is in Syracuse, New York

      - Syracuse is located in central New York state


      Next, let me identify where Middlesex University in Massachusetts is located:

      Wait, I need to be careful here. I believe there might be confusion. Middlesex
      University is actually a university in London, UK. In Massachusetts, there is
      Middlesex Community College, but not "Middlesex University" as far as I know.


      Let me consider Middlesex Community College in Massachusetts instead:

      - Middlesex Community College has campuses in Bedford and Lowell, Massachusetts

      - Both Bedford and Lowell are in eastern Massachusetts, near Boston


      Now, comparing their locations:

      - Syracuse, NY is in central New York state, which is west of Massachusetts

      - Bedford and Lowell, MA are in eastern Massachusetts


      So Syracuse University would be west of Middlesex Community College in Massachusetts.


      But I need to be precise about the question. It asked about "Middlesex University,
      MA" which might not exist as I described. Let me think if there''s another interpretation...</think>To
      determine if Syracuse University School of Education, NY is located west of
      Middlesex University, MA, I need to identify the locations of both institutions

      Step 1: Locate Syracuse University School of Education.

      Syracuse University is located in Syracuse, New York, in the central part of
      New York state.


      Step 2: Locate Middlesex University, MA.

      There''s actually a potential issue here - Middlesex University is primarily
      known as a university in London, UK. In Massachusetts, there is Middlesex Community
      College (with campuses in Bedford and Lowell), but not technically a "Middlesex
      University."


      Step 3: Compare the geographical positions.

      Assuming the question refers to Middlesex Community College in Massachusetts:

      - Syracuse, NY is in central New York state

      - Bedford and Lowell, MA (Middlesex Community College locations) are in eastern
      Massachusetts

      - New York state is west of Massachusetts


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      On a map of the United States, Syracuse, NY is indeed positioned west of any
      location in Massachusetts.

      determine the relative positions of Mississippi Valley State University (in
      Mississippi) and Columbia International University (in South Carolina) on a
      map of the United States.


      First, let me identify the states:

      - Mississippi Valley State University is in Mississippi (MS)

      - Columbia International University is in South Carolina (SC)


      Now I need to determine their relative east-west positions. In the United States,
      states that are more west have lower longitude values, and states that are more
      east have higher longitude values.


      Mississippi (MS) is located in the southeastern United States, along the Gulf
      of Mexico. South Carolina (SC) is also in the southeastern United States, but
      along the Atlantic coast.


      If I visualize a map of the United States, Mississippi is west of South Carolina.
      Mississippi borders Alabama to its east, while South Carolina is several states
      further east (Alabama, Georgia, and then South Carolina).


      So geographically, Mississippi is west of South Carolina. Therefore, Mississippi
      Valley State University (in MS) would be west of Columbia International University
      (in SC).</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these
      two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Mississippi Valley State University is in Mississippi (MS)

      - Columbia International University is in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between Mississippi and South
      Carolina.

      Looking at a US map, Mississippi is in the southeastern United States along
      the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico. South Carolina is also in the southeastern
      US but is located along the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Mississippi is west of Alabama, which is west of Georgia, which is west of South
      Carolina. Mississippi is clearly west of South Carolina on the map.


      Step 4: Since the universities are in their respective states, Mississippi Valley
      State University must be west of Columbia International University.

      Mississippi Valley State University is in Mississippi (MS), as indicated in
      the question.

      Columbia International University is in South Carolina (SC), as indicated in
      the question.


      Now I need to determine their relative east-west positions. In the United States:

      - Mississippi is west of South Carolina

      - Mississippi is in the southeastern US, but further west than South Carolina

      - South Carolina is on the east coast, while Mississippi is closer to the middle
      of the country


      Since Mississippi is west of South Carolina, and the universities are in their

      International University.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Mississippi Valley State University is in Mississippi (MS)

      - Columbia International University is in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Determine the relative east-west positions of these states.

      - Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States, bordering the Gulf
      of Mexico

      - South Carolina is located on the Atlantic coast of the southeastern United
      States


      Step 3: Compare their geographic positions.

      - Mississippi is positioned west of South Carolina on the US map

      - All locations in Mississippi would be west of all locations in South Carolina


      Since Mississippi Valley State University is in Mississippi, and Columbia International
      University is in South Carolina, and Mississippi is west of South Carolina,
      the answer is:

      Now I need to determine which one is further west. Looking at a map of the United
      States:

      - Mississippi is west of South Carolina

      - Mississippi is roughly in the south-central part of the US

      - South Carolina is on the east coast of the US


      Since Mississippi is west of South Carolina, a university in Mississippi would

      - South Carolina is located on the Atlantic coast in the southeastern United
      States


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions.

      - Mississippi is positioned to the west of South Carolina

      - Moving from east to west across the southeastern US, you would encounter South
      Carolina before Mississippi


      Since Mississippi is west of South Carolina, and the universities are in their
      respective states, Mississippi Valley State University is indeed west of Columbia
      International University.

      If we look at their relative positions, Mississippi is to the west of South
      Carolina. Mississippi is closer to the Mississippi River and Louisiana, while
      South Carolina is on the east coast.

      - South Carolina is also in the southeastern US, but is positioned along the
      Atlantic coast

      - Mississippi is positioned to the west of South Carolina


      Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the universities.

      - Since Mississippi Valley State University is in Mississippi, and Mississippi
      is west of South Carolina, then Mississippi Valley State University must be
      west of Columbia International University in South Carolina.

      positions of Nebraska Medicine in Bellevue, NE and Ohio State University''s
      Lima Campus in OH.


      First, let''s think about the states:

      - NE stands for Nebraska

      - OH stands for Ohio


      In terms of US geography, Nebraska is located in the Midwest/Great Plains region
      and is definitely west of Ohio, which is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region.


      So in general, any location in Nebraska would be west of any location in Ohio.
      This is true regardless of the specific cities (Bellevue, NE and Lima, OH).


      Since Nebraska Medicine in Bellevue, NE is in Nebraska, and Ohio State University''s
      Lima Campus is in Ohio, the Nebraska location must be west of the Ohio location.</think>#
      Is Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue, NE located west of Ohio State University, Lima
      Campus, OH?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - Nebraska Medicine is in Bellevue, Nebraska (NE)

      - Ohio State University Lima Campus is in Lima, Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Nebraska is located in the Great Plains region of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region

      - On a U.S. map, Nebraska is positioned to the west of Ohio


      Step 3: Since both locations are in their respective states, the east-west relationship
      between the states determines the relationship between the specific locations.

      - Any location in Nebraska would be west of any location in Ohio


      Therefore, Nebraska Medicine in Bellevue, NE is indeed located west of Ohio
      State University''s Lima Campus in OH.


      YES'

      To determine if one location is west of another in the US, I need to compare
      their longitudes. Locations further west have higher negative longitude values
      (or lower positive values if using eastern hemisphere notation).


      First, let''s identify the states:

      - NE = Nebraska, which is in the central part of the US

      - OH = Ohio, which is in the eastern part of the US


      Just from knowing US geography, Nebraska is considerably west of Ohio. All of
      Nebraska is west of all of Ohio.


      So Nebraska Medicine in Bellevue, NE would be west of Ohio State University''s
      Lima Campus in Lima, OH.</think>To determine if Nebraska Medicine in Bellevue,
      NE is located west of Ohio State University''s Lima Campus in OH, I need to

      - Nebraska Medicine is in Bellevue, Nebraska (NE)

      - Ohio State University Lima Campus is in Lima, Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      Nebraska is located in the central United States, while Ohio is in the eastern
      part of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      Looking at a US map, Nebraska is entirely west of Ohio. All locations in Nebraska
      (including Bellevue) would be west of all locations in Ohio (including Lima).


      YES, Nebraska Medicine in Bellevue, NE is located west of Ohio State University
      Lima Campus, OH.'

      I need to think about the geographic locations of these two places:


      1. Nebraska Medicine is in Bellevue, Nebraska (NE)

      2. Ohio State University, Lima Campus is in Lima, Ohio (OH)


      Geographically in the United States:

      - Nebraska is a state in the Midwest/Great Plains region

      - Ohio is a state in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      When considering east-west positioning in the US, states further west have higher
      longitude numbers. But wait, that''s incorrect - states further west have lower
      (more negative) longitude numbers. States to the east have higher (less negative
      or positive) longitude numbers.


      More directly, I can just think about the map of the United States. Nebraska
      is significantly west of Ohio. Nebraska borders Colorado to its west and Iowa
      to its east. Ohio is much further east, bordering Pennsylvania to its east and
      Indiana to its west.


      Since Nebraska is west of Ohio, any location in Nebraska (including Bellevue)
      would be west of any location in Ohio (including Lima).</think>To answer this

      - Nebraska Medicine is in Bellevue, Nebraska (NE)

      - Ohio State University, Lima Campus is in Lima, Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Nebraska and Ohio within the United
      States.

      - Nebraska is located in the Great Plains region of the Midwest

      - Ohio is located in the eastern part of the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - On a U.S. map, Nebraska is significantly west of Ohio

      - Nebraska borders states like Colorado and Wyoming to its west and Iowa to
      its east

      - Ohio borders Pennsylvania to its east and Indiana to its west


      Since any location in Nebraska (including Bellevue) would be west of any location
      in Ohio (including Lima), the answer is:

      the relative positions of Nebraska and Ohio.


      Nebraska is a state in the Midwest region of the United States, and it''s located
      to the west of Ohio. Ohio is also in the Midwest but is further east.


      Specifically:

      1. Nebraska is located in the central part of the United States

      2. Ohio is located in the eastern part of the Midwest, bordering Pennsylvania

      3. When looking at a US map, Nebraska is clearly west of Ohio


      Since Bellevue, NE (in Nebraska) is in a state that is entirely west of the

      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      Looking at a US map, Nebraska is clearly west of Ohio. All of Nebraska is west

      2. University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center is in Gainesville, Florida
      (FL)


      In the US, Louisiana is west of Florida. Louisiana is in the Gulf Coast region,
      while Florida is the southeastern-most state that forms a peninsula.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Louisiana is approximately between Texas (to its west) and Mississippi (to
      its east)

      - Florida is east of Alabama, which is east of Mississippi


      So Louisiana is definitely west of Florida. Since McNeese State is in Louisiana

      and Nebraska in the United States, and then the specific locations of these
      universities within their states.


      First, let''s think about the states:

      - Colorado is located directly west of Nebraska in the United States. Colorado
      is in the Mountain West region, while Nebraska is in the Great Plains/Midwest.


      Now for the specific universities:

      - Naropa University is in Boulder, Colorado

      - Concordia University Nebraska is in Seward, Nebraska


      Since Colorado as a state is entirely west of Nebraska, and Naropa University
      is in Colorado while Concordia University is in Nebraska, Naropa University
      must be west of Concordia University Nebraska.


      So the answer should be YES.</think>To determine if Naropa University (Colorado)
      is west of Concordia University Nebraska (Nebraska), I need to compare their

      state of Colorado is west of Nebraska.


      Step 2: Identify the specific locations of these universities.

      - Naropa University is located in Boulder, Colorado

      - Concordia University Nebraska is located in Seward, Nebraska


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Since Colorado as a whole state is west of Nebraska, and Naropa University is
      in Colorado while Concordia University is in Nebraska, Naropa University must
      be west of Concordia University Nebraska.

      The United States has Vermont (VT) and Maine (ME) both in the northeastern part
      of the country. Let me think about their relative positions:


      - Vermont is located west of Maine. Vermont borders New Hampshire on its east,
      and New Hampshire borders Maine on its west.

      - So Vermont is west of Maine.


      Since Community College of Vermont is in Vermont, and University of Maine at
      Machias is in Maine, and Vermont is west of Maine, I can conclude that Community
      College of Vermont is located west of University of Maine at Machias.</think>#

      I need to think about the geographic locations of Vermont and Maine to answer
      this question.


      Step 1: Determine the relative positions of the states.

      Vermont (VT) and Maine (ME) are both in the northeastern United States. Vermont
      is located to the west of New Hampshire, while Maine is located to the east
      of New Hampshire. This means Vermont is west of Maine.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      Community College of Vermont is in Vermont, and University of Maine at Machias
      is in Maine. Since we''ve established that Vermont as a whole is west of Maine,
      any location in Vermont would be west of any location in Maine.


      Therefore: YES, Community College of Vermont, VT is located west of University
      of Maine at Machias, ME.'

      - Maine is also in the northeastern United States

      - Looking at a map of the US, Vermont is positioned to the west of Maine

      - Maine is the easternmost state in the continental US, while Vermont is positioned
      between New York and New Hampshire


      Step 3: Draw conclusion about the colleges based on their states'' positions.

      - Since Community College of Vermont is in Vermont, and Vermont is west of Maine,
      where University of Maine at Machias is located, Community College of Vermont
      must be west of University of Maine at Machias.

    f401a617-f7c4-466c-bea9-866d737ae6ea: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative locations of two colleges:

      1. UIUC College of Education in Illinois

      2. Miami University Middletown in Ohio


      UIUC is the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which is in east-central
      Illinois.

      Miami University Middletown is in Middletown, Ohio, which would be in the southwestern
      part of Ohio.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Illinois is west of Ohio

      - Urbana-Champaign (where UIUC is) is in the eastern part of Illinois

      - Middletown, Ohio would be in the western/southwestern part of Ohio


      So even though Urbana-Champaign is in the eastern part of Illinois, and Middletown
      is in the western part of Ohio, Illinois as a whole is west of Ohio. This means
      that UIUC would be west of Miami University Middletown.


      Let me double check: Illinois borders Ohio on Ohio''s western border. So any
      location in Illinois would be west of any location in Ohio.</think>I need to
      determine the relative east-west positions of these two colleges.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - UIUC College of Education is in Urbana-Champaign, Illinois

      - Miami University Middletown is in Middletown, Ohio


      Step 2: Consider the states'' positions.

      - Illinois is directly west of Indiana, which is west of Ohio

      - Ohio is east of both Indiana and Illinois


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Urbana-Champaign is in east-central Illinois

      - Middletown is in southwest Ohio

      - Even though Urbana-Champaign is in eastern Illinois and Middletown is in western
      Ohio, the entire state of Illinois is still west of Ohio


      Therefore, UIUC College of Education in Illinois is west of Miami University
      Middletown in Ohio.

    0f40ac48-0a30-4306-ab7b-0d44c1e7dcbb: '<think>To solve this question, I need to
      determine the relative geographic positions of two universities:


      1. Robert Morris University Illinois, IL

      2. East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania, PA


      I''ll need to determine whether Robert Morris University Illinois is located
      west of East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania.


      First, let me consider the states:

      - Illinois (IL) is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is in the Northeast region of the United States


      Generally, Illinois is west of Pennsylvania on a map of the United States. The
      entire state of Illinois is west of the entire state of Pennsylvania.


      Now, let''s consider the specific locations:

      - Robert Morris University Illinois would be in Illinois (likely in or near
      Chicago)

      - East Stroudsburg University is in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, which is
      in the eastern part of Pennsylvania


      Since Illinois is entirely west of Pennsylvania, and Robert Morris University
      Illinois is in Illinois, while East Stroudsburg University is in Pennsylvania
      (and specifically in the eastern part of PA), Robert Morris University Illinois
      must be west of East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania.</think>I need to
      determine the relative positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Robert Morris University Illinois is in Illinois (IL)

      - East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States, while Pennsylvania is
      in the Northeast region. On a map of the United States, Illinois is entirely
      west of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      Robert Morris University Illinois was likely in or near Chicago (note: this
      institution has actually merged with Roosevelt University, but I''m considering
      its historical location).

      East Stroudsburg University is in East Stroudsburg, PA, which is in the eastern
      part of Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these locations.

      Since Illinois is west of Pennsylvania, and Robert Morris University Illinois
      was in Illinois, it must be west of East Stroudsburg University which is in
      the eastern part of Pennsylvania.


      YES'

      Morris University Illinois, IL is located west of East Stroudsburg University
      of Pennsylvania, PA.


      First, I need to identify the locations of these universities:


      1. Robert Morris University Illinois is in Illinois (IL), which is in the Midwest
      of the United States. Specifically, this university is likely in or near Chicago,
      Illinois.


      2. East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania is in Pennsylvania (PA), which
      is in the northeastern United States.


      Now, I need to determine their relative positions east-west:

      - Illinois is generally west of Pennsylvania on a US map

      - Chicago, Illinois (where Robert Morris University Illinois is likely located)
      is west of East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania


      Since states and cities in the US are arranged such that Illinois is west of
      Pennsylvania, Robert Morris University Illinois would be west of East Stroudsburg
      University of Pennsylvania.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the geographic positions of both universities and compare them.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Robert Morris University Illinois is located in Illinois (IL), specifically
      in Chicago.

      - East Stroudsburg University is located in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania (PA).


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States.

      - Pennsylvania is in the Northeast region of the United States.

      - On a map of the United States, Illinois is positioned to the west of Pennsylvania.

      - Chicago, IL is west of East Stroudsburg, PA.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      Since Chicago, Illinois is west of East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania on a map,
      Robert Morris University Illinois is located west of East Stroudsburg University
      of Pennsylvania.


      YES'

      locations of two universities:

      1. Robert Morris University Illinois, located in IL (Illinois)

      2. East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania, located in PA (Pennsylvania)


      To determine which is more westerly, I need to think about the geographic positions
      of these states in the US.


      Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States. Its major city Chicago
      is located in the northeastern part of the state, along Lake Michigan.


      Pennsylvania is in the northeastern United States, part of the Mid-Atlantic
      region.


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Illinois is definitely west of Pennsylvania.
      All of Illinois is west of all of Pennsylvania.


      Since Robert Morris University Illinois is in Illinois, and East Stroudsburg
      University is in Pennsylvania, Robert Morris University Illinois must be west
      of East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania.


      So the answer would be YES - Robert Morris University Illinois is located west

      - East Stroudsburg University is located in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Illinois is entirely west of Pennsylvania on the US map

      - Even the easternmost part of Illinois is west of the westernmost part of Pennsylvania


      Step 4: Apply this to the universities.

      - Since Robert Morris University is in Illinois, and East Stroudsburg University
      is in Pennsylvania, the same east-west relationship applies to these institutions.


      YES - Robert Morris University Illinois is located west of East Stroudsburg
      University of Pennsylvania.'
