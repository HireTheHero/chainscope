      - Colorado State University Pueblo is in Pueblo, Colorado

      - Ottawa University is in Ottawa, Kansas


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Colorado and Kansas.

      - Colorado is in the western United States

      - Kansas is in the central United States

      - Generally, Colorado is west of Kansas


      Step 3: Verify the specific cities.

      - Pueblo is in southern Colorado

      - Ottawa is in eastern Kansas

      - This maintains the west-east relationship between the two locations


      Since Colorado is west of Kansas, and the specific cities (Pueblo in Colorado
      and Ottawa in Kansas) maintain this directional relationship, Colorado State
      University Pueblo is indeed west of Ottawa University.

      in New Orleans, such as Tulane University, University of New Orleans, Loyola
      University New Orleans, etc., but no institution specifically named "New Orleans
      University."

      - Baytown, Texas (where Lee College is located) is west of New Orleans, Louisiana.

      - Since any university in New Orleans would be in New Orleans, Louisiana, Lee
      College would be west of any university in New Orleans.


      Step 3: Make a conclusion based on the geographical relationship.

      - Even though "New Orleans University" doesn''t exist by that specific name,
      Lee College in Texas would be west of any university located in New Orleans,
      Louisiana.


      NO - I cannot definitively answer this question because "New Orleans University"

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both universities.

      - Indiana University - Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW) is located in Fort
      Wayne, Indiana (IN).

      - Westfield State University is located in Westfield, Massachusetts (MA).


      Step 2: Determine the relative east-west positions of these states.

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United States.

      - Massachusetts is in the Northeast region of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their geographical positions.

      - States in the Midwest (like Indiana) are generally west of states in the Northeast
      (like Massachusetts).

      - On a map of the United States, Indiana is indeed west of Massachusetts.


      Step 4: Since Fort Wayne, IN is in Indiana, and Westfield, MA is in Massachusetts,
      the same east-west relationship applies to these specific cities and their universities.


      NO.

      Step 3: Check if there might be any confusion about Middlesex University.

      Actually, I should note that there isn''t a "Middlesex University" in Massachusetts.
      There is Middlesex Community College in Massachusetts, and there''s a Middlesex
      County in Massachusetts that contains several colleges. There is a Middlesex
      University in London, UK, but that wouldn''t be relevant for a US college comparison.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of these universities.

      - Huntington University is in Huntington, Indiana (IN)

      - Widener University is in Chester, Delaware (DE) [Note: While Widener has a
      campus in Delaware, its main campus is actually in Chester, Pennsylvania, but
      I''ll use the location as specified in the question]


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of Indiana and Delaware.

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Delaware is on the East Coast


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - States in the Midwest (like Indiana) are located west of states on the East
      Coast (like Delaware)

      - Indiana is significantly west of Delaware on a map of the United States


      Therefore, Huntington University in Indiana is indeed located west of Widener

      - Vermont is located in the northeastern United States, bordering New York to
      the west, Massachusetts to the south, New Hampshire to the east, and Canada
      to the north.

      - Maine is the easternmost state in the continental United States, bordering
      only New Hampshire to the west and Canada to the north and east.


      Step 3: Compare the relative east-west positioning.

      - Vermont is west of Maine in the United States.

      - Therefore, any location in Vermont would be west of any location in Maine.


      Step 4: Specifically for these colleges:

      - Community College of Vermont is in Vermont, which is west of Maine

      - University of Maine at Machias is in Maine, which is east of Vermont


      Therefore, Community College of Vermont is located west of University of Maine
      at Machias.

      - Maine is located in the northeastern United States, east of New Hampshire.

      - Generally, Maine is east of Vermont.


      Step 2: Let me consider the specific locations.

      - Community College of Vermont (CCV) has multiple locations throughout Vermont,
      but regardless of which campus, they would all be within Vermont''s borders.

      - University of Maine at Machias is located in Machias, Maine, which is in eastern
      Maine, relatively close to the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes.

      - Any location in Vermont would be west of most locations in Maine.

      - Machias is particularly far east in Maine, being close to the coast.


      Given that Vermont is entirely west of Maine, and Machias is in the eastern
      part of Maine, Community College of Vermont must be located west of University
      of Maine at Machias.
