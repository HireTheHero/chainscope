      and Heinrich von Besmedin.** This will require research.  A quick search reveals
      Werner Schaler was a German speed skater born in 1923 and who likely died in
      2011 as that is the last record of him competing.  Heinrich von Besmedin is
      a character from the video game Valkyria Chronicles.  He is fictional and therefore
      does not have a real death date.


      2. **Compare the death dates.** Since one is a fictional character, a direct
      comparison is impossible.


      3. **Consider the implications of a fictional character.** A fictional character
      does not age and die in the same way a real person does. Their "death," if any,
      is determined by the narrative.
