      \ Sacchi died at the age of 66.\n- Patriarch Michael II of Antioch likely died\

      1. **Gandolfo Sacchi**: He was an Italian Roman Catholic cardinal who was born
      in 1809 and died in 1893. Therefore, he lived to be 84 years old.


      2. **Patriarch Michael II of Antioch**: He was a patriarch of the Syriac Orthodox
      Church of Antioch, who died in 1312. His birth year is not clearly documented,
      but historical records often estimate that he was born around 1245. If we take
      this estimated birth year, he would have lived to be approximately 67 years
      old.


      Based on these estimates, Gandolfo Sacchi lived to be 84 years old, while Patriarch
      Michael II of Antioch lived to be approximately 67 years old.

      Given the lack of specific birth information for Patriarch Michael II, it is

      the ages at which William II, Count of Chalon, and Anastasia of Sirmium died.


      1. **William II, Count of Chalon**: William II was born around 1225 and died
      in 1304. This would make his age at death approximately 79 years.


      2. **Anastasia of Sirmium**: Anastasia is a Christian martyr and saint who lived
      in the late 3rd and early 4th centuries. It is traditionally believed that she
      died around the year 304. However, her exact birth year is not clearly documented.
      Despite this, it is often assumed that she was a relatively young woman at the
      time of her martyrdom, possibly in her 20s or 30s.


      Based on these estimates, William II, Count of Chalon, died at an older age
      than Anastasia of Sirmium.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: NO.'

      1. **William II, Count of Chalon**: William II was born in 1200 and died in
      1239. Therefore, he lived for 39 years.


      2. **Anastasia of Sirmium**: Anastasia is believed to have died around the year
      304 AD. However, there is no precise birth date available in historical records,
      as she is a saint from the early Christian period. Saints from this period often
      have uncertain dates of birth, but they typically lived relatively short lives
      due to the persecution of Christians during that era.


      Considering the available data, it''s challenging to make a definitive comparison
      as we lack the precise age of Anastasia of Sirmium at the time of her death.
      Typically, early Christian martyrs like Anastasia of Sirmium did not live long
      due to the persecution of their time, which suggests she may have died young.


      Based on common historical patterns for early Christian martyrs and lacking
      exact birth details for Anastasia, it is reasonable to hypothesize that she
      likely died younger than William II, Count of Chalon. However, without specific
      birth data, this remains a reasoned assumption rather than a definitive conclusion.

      younger than Blanche de France, we need to establish the birth and death years
      of both historical figures.


      1. **Princess Yangguo**: Princess Yangguo was a Chinese princess during the
      Tang Dynasty. She was the daughter of Emperor Xuanzong and Consort Wu. She lived
      during the 8th century, but specific birth and death dates are not well-documented.
      However, it is generally believed that she died young, around the age of 33.


      2. **Blanche de France**: Blanche de France was a French princess, the daughter
      of King Louis IX of France (Saint Louis) and Margaret of Provence. She was born
      in 1253 and died in 1320, which means she lived to be 67 years old.


      Comparing the approximate ages:


      - Princess Yangguo is believed to have died at around 33 years old.

      - Blanche de France died at 67 years old.


      Based on this information, the answer to the question of whether Princess Yangguo
      died younger than Blanche de France is:


      **YES**.'

      1. **Princess Yangguo**: Princess Yangguo, also known as Yang Guifei, was born

      she died at the age of 66 or 67.


      Now, comparing the ages at which both figures died:

      - Princess Yangguo died at 37.

      - Blanche de France died at 66 or 67.

      means he lived approximately 54 years.


      Now, comparing the ages at death:

      - Rupen of Montfort lived approximately 45 years.

      - Nicholas III of Saint Omer lived approximately 54 years.


      Based on these ages, Rupen of Montfort died younger than Nicholas III of Saint
      Omer.

      the ages at which Richard Turstin and Jean Flandrin died.


      1. **Identify Richard Turstin**: Richard Turstin, also known as Richard le Goz,
      was a Norman nobleman who lived during the 11th century. He is often associated
      with the period around the Norman Conquest of England (1066). The exact date
      of his death is not well-documented, but it is generally placed around 1082.


      2. **Identify Jean Flandrin**: Jean Flandrin, also known as Giovanni Flandrin,
      was a 14th-century Italian painter. He was active during the early to mid-1300s
      and is believed to have died around 1355.


      3. **Estimate the lifespan of Richard Turstin**: If Turstin was involved with
      the Norman Conquest in 1066 and died around 1082, his lifespan would likely
      be around 50-60 years, assuming he was an adult at the time of the conquest.


      4. **Estimate the lifespan of Jean Flandrin**: Historical records are sparse,
      but if he was active and producing art in the early 1300s and died in 1355,
      he would likely have had a lifespan of around 50-70 years, depending on when
      he began his work and assuming he lived into his later years.


      Based on these considerations, it is likely that both individuals lived to a
      similar age, but there is no definitive evidence to suggest that Richard Turstin
      died significantly younger than Jean Flandrin. However, given the typical lifespans

      than Jean Flandrin.

      a historical figure compared to Richard Turstin. However, if you are referring

      3. **Determine the ages**: Without specific birth and death years for both individuals,

      If Jean Flandrin lived well beyond the 11th century, it is reasonable to conclude

      is that he lived beyond 1090, thus potentially living longer than Turstin.

      \ Common historical sources suggest she died around the mid-11th century.\n\n\
      3. **Estimate their ages at death:**\n   - The birth year of \u856D\u9059\u660C\
      \ is not well-documented, but he was likely born in the late 5th century, making\
      \ him approximately 30-40 years old at his death in 530 AD.\n   - Agatha van\
      \ Normandi\xEB's birth and death years are not precisely known, but she was\
      \ likely born in the early 11th century and died in the mid-11th century, suggesting\
      \ she was possibly around 40-50 years old at her death.\n\nBased on the estimated\
      \ ages:\n\n- \u856D\u9059\u660C: Approximately 30-40 years old at death.\n-\
      \ Agatha van Normandi\xEB: Approximately 40-50 years old at death.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ \u856D\u9059\u660C likely died younger than Agatha van Normandi\xEB.\n\n**Answer:\
      \ YES**"
    d04f3d5a-b1b4-44ae-95c9-4eff935dd19e: "To answer this question, we need to determine\
      \ the ages at which both \u856D\u9059\u660C (Xiao Yaochang) and Agatha van Normandi\xEB\
      \ died.\n\n1. **Xiao Yaochang**: He was a historical figure from the Southern\
      \ and Northern Dynasties period in China. Xiao Yaochang was born in 473 AD and\
      \ died in 494 AD. To calculate his age at death: \n   - 494 - 473 = 21 years\
      \ old.\n\n2. **Agatha van Normandi\xEB**: Agatha is a more obscure historical\
      \ figure, often associated with the 11th century. Historical records suggest\
      \ she was born around 1025 AD and died sometime after 1070 AD. Since the exact\
      \ year of her death is not clearly documented, we can only estimate:\n   - If\
      \ she died in 1070, she would have been approximately 1070 - 1025 = 45 years\
      \ old.\n\nBased on these calculations, Xiao Yaochang died at 21 years old, while\
      \ Agatha van Normandi\xEB lived to be at least 45 years old. \n\nTherefore,\
      \ the answer to the question is: **YES**, \u856D\u9059\u660C (Xiao Yaochang)\
      \ died younger than Agatha van Normandi\xEB."
