      these steps:


      1. Identify the historical figures: Zita of Bourbon-Parma and Al-Tabarani.

      2. Determine the lifespans or ages at death for both individuals.

      3. Compare their ages at death to determine if Zita of Bourbon-Parma died younger
      than Al-Tabarani.


      Step 1: Identification

      - Zita of Bourbon-Parma was the last Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary,
      born in 1892 and died in 1989.

      - Al-Tabarani, on the other hand, was a Muslim scholar known for his collections
      of hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad). He lived during the
      10th century AD, but specific birth and death dates are not widely known.


      Step 2: Lifespans

      - Zita of Bourbon-Parma lived from 1892 to 1989, which gives her a lifespan
      of 97 years.

      - Al-Tabarani''s birth and death dates are not precisely known, but he is generally
      associated with the 10th century AD, which spans from 901 AD to 1000 AD. Without
      specific dates, it''s challenging to determine his exact age at death.


      Step 3: Comparison

      Given that Zita of Bourbon-Parma died at the age of 97, and we don''t have specific
      dates for Al-Tabarani, we can''t directly compare their ages at death. However,
      it''s important to note that lifespans have varied significantly throughout
      history due to factors like healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions. It''s
      difficult to make a direct comparison without more specific information about
      Al-Tabarani''s lifespan.

      Step 2: Lifespans

      - William II, Count of Chalon: William II was born around 1020 AD and died in
      1080 AD. His lifespan was approximately 60 years.

      - Anastasia of Sirmium: The exact birth and death dates of Anastasia of Sirmium
      are not well-documented. However, she is believed to have lived during the 3rd
      or 4th century AD, and her death is traditionally associated with the persecution
      of Christians under Emperor Diocletian.


      Step 3: Comparison

      Given that William II, Count of Chalon lived approximately 60 years, and considering
      the time period and circumstances of Anastasia of Sirmium''s life, it''s reasonable
      to assume that she likely lived to be at least 20-30 years old. This assumption
      is based on the fact that she was a Christian martyr during a time when life
      expectancy was generally lower than in later centuries.


      Based on this comparison, it''s reasonable to conclude that William II, Count
      of Chalon did not die younger than Anastasia of Sirmium, as she likely lived
      to be around 20-30 years old, while William II lived to be approximately 60
      years old.


      The final answer is: NO

      \ the historical figures, determine their lifespans, and compare their ages\

      \ Thomas H\xE9lye was a French poet and theologian from the 13th century. He\
      \ is known for his contributions to medieval literature and theology.\n\n2.\
      \ **Identify Nikolaus von \xDAjezd**: Nikolaus von \xDAjezd was a Czech nobleman\

      \ Thomas H\xE9lye and Nikolaus von \xDAjezd were.\n   - **Thomas H\xE9lye**:\
      \ Thomas H\xE9lye was a 13th-century French theologian and author known for\
      \ his writings on the Bible and theology. He lived in the 13th century and was\
      \ a prominent figure in medieval theological scholarship.\n   - **Nikolaus von\
      \ \xDAjezd**: Nikolaus von \xDAjezd (or Nikolaus of \xDAjezd) was a Bohemian\
      \ nobleman who lived in the 14th century. He was a member of the noble \xDA\

      \ he lived during that period.\n   - **Nikolaus von \xDAjezd**: Nikolaus von\
      \ \xDAjezd was born in the 14th century and died in 1365. Therefore, we know\
      \ that he lived for approximately 65 years.\n\n3. **Comparison Challenge**:\
      \ Given the limited information about Thomas H\xE9lye's exact lifespan, it's\
      \ challenging to make a direct comparison. However, we can consider the historical\

      \ the provided dates are correct for both individuals, the answer would be **YES**"
    29d560b8-41d6-45b8-a1f4-bdbcae6c4a8d: 'To answer this question, we need to follow
      these steps:


      1. Identify the historical figures: Richard Turstin and Jean Flandrin.

      2. Determine the lifespans or ages at death for both individuals.

      3. Compare their ages at death to determine if Richard Turstin died younger
      than Jean Flandrin.


      **Step 1: Identification**

      - Richard Turstin (also known as Richard Tustin or Richard de Turstin) was a
      Norman knight and landholder in England during the 11th century.

      - Jean Flandrin was a French artist and painter known for his work in the 20th
      century.


      **Step 2: Lifespans**

      - Richard Turstin lived during the 11th century, but specific birth and death
      dates are not widely recorded. Given the historical context and the lack of
      precise records, estimating his lifespan is challenging. However, it''s reasonable
      to assume that he lived into adulthood and had a lifespan typical of his time
      period, which could range from around 40 to 70 years.

      - Jean Flandrin was born on August 12, 1931, and died on March 23, 2001. This
      gives him a lifespan of approximately 70 years.


      **Step 3: Comparison**

      Given that Jean Flandrin''s lifespan is well-documented at approximately 70
      years, we can compare it to the estimated lifespan of Richard Turstin. Richard
      Turstin''s lifespan could have been within the range of 40 to 70 years, depending
      on various factors such as health, wars, and social conditions of the time.
      It''s possible that Richard Turstin''s lifespan could have been shorter than
      Jean Flandrin''s, but without specific dates for Richard Turstin, it''s challenging
      to make a definitive comparison.


      **Conclusion**

      Based on the available information, it''s not possible to definitively say whether
      Richard Turstin died younger than Jean Flandrin. However, considering the estimated
      lifespan of Richard Turstin and the documented lifespan of Jean Flandrin, it''s
      plausible that Richard Turstin could have died at a younger age than Jean Flandrin.


      Given the lack of precise information about Richard Turstin''s lifespan, and
      considering the nature of the question which requires a definitive YES or NO,
      the most accurate approach is to acknowledge that without specific dates for
      Richard Turstin, we cannot definitively say. However, since I must provide a
      YES or NO answer based on the steps taken:


      The final answer is: YES

      \ are.\n   - Grimoald III of Benevento was a Lombard Duke of Benevento, a region\
      \ in southern Italy, during the early Middle Ages. He ruled from 788 to 806.\n\
      \   - John IV, Count of Oldenburg was a German nobleman who ruled the County\
      \ of Oldenburg, a region in northern Germany, during the late 14th and early\
      \ 15th centuries. He was count from 1386 to 1420.\n\n2. **Find Their Lifespans**:\
      \ Next, we need to find out when each of these figures lived to compare their\
      \ ages at death.\n   - Grimoald III of Benevento was born around 760 and died\

      1. Identify who Xiao Daxin and Abdullah ibn Hasan were.

      2. Determine the lifespans or ages at death for both individuals.

      3. Compare their ages at death to determine if Xiao Daxin died younger than
      Abdullah ibn Hasan.


      Step 1: Identification

      - Xiao Daxin was a Chinese politician and military leader who lived during the
      Ming dynasty in China. He was born in 1590 and died in 1633.

      - Abdullah ibn Hasan was a member of the Banu Hashim clan, which was a prominent

      in the 7th century AD. The exact dates of his birth and death are not well-documented.


      Step 2: Lifespans

      - Xiao Daxin was born in 1590 and died in 1633, which means he lived for about
      43 years.

      - Abdullah ibn Hasan''s exact lifespan is not well-documented, but he was known
      to have been alive during the 7th century AD. Without specific dates, it''s
      difficult to determine his exact age at death.

      have specific dates for Abdullah ibn Hasan, it''s challenging to make a direct
      comparison. However, considering the historical context and the fact that Abdullah
      ibn Hasan was born in the 7th century AD, it''s possible that he lived for a
      longer time, potentially surpassing Xiao Daxin''s lifespan.

      Zhang.

      2. Determine their lifespans or ages at death.

      3. Compare their ages at death to determine if Patriarch Michael II of Antioch
      died younger than Empress Zhang.


      Step 1: Identification

      - Patriarch Michael II of Antioch (also known as Michael Bourtzes or Michael
      I Bourtzes) was a Patriarch of Antioch in the 10th century. He served as the
      Patriarch of Antioch from 1059 to 1084.

      - Empress Zhang (also known as Empress Zhangsun or Empress Zhangsun-wu) was
      a Chinese Empress during the Tang dynasty. She was the wife of Emperor Taizong
      of Tang.


      Step 2: Lifespans

      - Patriarch Michael II of Antioch: Unfortunately, there is limited information
      available about his exact birth and death dates. However, given his service
      as Patriarch of Antioch from 1059 to 1084, it''s reasonable to estimate that
      he lived into his 60s or 70s.

      - Empress Zhang: She was born in 601 AD and died in 636 AD, at the age of 35.


      Step 3: Comparison

      Given the information available, it''s clear that Empress Zhang died at a much
      younger age (35 years old) compared to Patriarch Michael II of Antioch, who
      likely lived into his 60s or 70s. Therefore, Patriarch Michael II of Antioch
      did not die younger than Empress Zhang.

      \ these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Historical Figures**: \n   - \u856D\u9059\
      \u660C (Xiao Yaochang) was a member of the Chinese imperial family during the\
      \ Southern Qi dynasty (479-502 CE). He was a prince and a general during the\
      \ dynasty's tumultuous period.\n   - Agatha van Normandi\xEB (Agatha of Normandy)\
      \ was a French noblewoman and a member of the House of Normandy. She was the\
      \ daughter of Richard I, Duke of Normandy, and Gunnor. She lived during the\
      \ late 10th and early 11th centuries.\n\n2. **Find the Lifespans**: \n   - \u856D\
      \u9059\u660C (Xiao Yaochang) lived from 486 CE to 498 CE, dying at the age of\
      \ 12.\n   - Agatha van Normandi\xEB (Agatha of Normandy) lived from around 980\
      \ CE to around 1020 CE. Her exact lifespan is not precisely known, but she likely\
      \ lived into her 30s or 40s.\n\n3. **Compare Their Ages at Death**: \n   - \u856D\
      \u9059\u660C (Xiao Yaochang) died at the age of 12.\n   - Agatha van Normandi\xEB\
      \ (Agatha of Normandy) likely lived into her 30s or 40s.\n\nGiven these steps\
      \ and the information provided, we can conclude that \u856D\u9059\u660C (Xiao\
      \ Yaochang) died significantly younger than Agatha van Normandi\xEB (Agatha\
      \ of Normandy). The age difference is substantial, with Xiao Yaochang dying\
      \ in his early teens and Agatha living into adulthood.\n\nThe final answer is:\
      \ YES\n\n"

      \ these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the historical figures**: The question mentions\
      \ two historical figures, \u856D\u9059\u660C (Xiao Yaochang, which doesn't directly\
      \ correspond to a widely recognized historical figure in English literature)\
      \ and Agatha van Normandi\xEB. Agatha van Normandi\xEB is a Dutch historical\
      \ figure known for her contributions to the development of the city of Leiden\
      \ in the Netherlands during the 17th century.\n\n2. **Find the correct identity\
      \ for \u856D\u9059\u660C**: Given that \u856D\u9059\u660C doesn't directly translate\
      \ or correspond to a well-known historical figure, there might be a misunderstanding\
      \ or misrepresentation of the name. Without a clear or direct historical figure\
      \ to associate with this name, it's challenging to proceed with accuracy.\n\n\
      3. **Determine the lifespan of each figure**: \n   - Agatha van Normandi\xEB\
      \ (1590-1636) was a known figure, and her birth and death years are available.\n\
      \   - For \u856D\u9059\u660C, without a clear historical figure to match, determining\
      \ the lifespan is not feasible.\n\n4. **Compare their ages at death**:\n   -\
      \ Since the identity and thus the lifespan of \u856D\u9059\u660C are unclear,\
      \ a direct comparison with Agatha van Normandi\xEB's age at death (46 years)\
      \ cannot be made.\n\nGiven these steps and the lack of clear information about\
      \ \u856D\u9059\u660C, it's not possible to accurately answer the question as\
      \ it relies on identifying and comparing the lifespans of two historical figures,\
      \ one of which is not clearly defined in available historical records. \n\n\
      However, based on the requirement for a YES or NO answer and the inability to\
      \ verify the age of \u856D\u9059\u660C due to unclear identification, the most\

      \ their ages due to a lack of information. But since that's not an option provided:\n\
