      - He was born around 760

      - He died in 806

      - This means he lived to approximately age 46


      3) Comparing their ages at death:

      - Theodora: ~66 years

      - Grimoald III: ~46 years

      - 66 is greater than 46


      4) Therefore, Theodora lived longer than Grimoald III, not younger.

      While we don''t have exact ages for both, based on the available information

      1) Let me find when Yury of Smolensk died and at what age:

      - Yury of Smolensk died in 1407

      - However, I''m not certain of his birth year or age at death


      2) Let me find when Elizabeth le Despenser lived and died:

      - Elizabeth le Despenser lived from 1325 to 1389

      - Based on these dates, she was 64 when she died


      3) Comparing:

      - Elizabeth le Despenser''s death age is known (64)

      - Yury of Smolensk''s exact age at death is not known with certainty

      - Without knowing Yury''s age at death, I cannot definitively compare who died
      younger


      4) Therefore, I cannot make a reliable comparison between their ages at death.

      - Elizabeth le Despenser was born in 1327


      4. Let me calculate their ages at death:

      - Yury: 1407 - 1353 = approximately 54 years old

      - Elizabeth: 1408 - 1327 = 81 years old


      5. Comparing their ages at death:

      - Yury died at around 54

      3. Now, I need to check their ages at death:

      - For William III de Cantilupe, I cannot find a reliable birth date

      - For Antonio Arcioni, I cannot find a reliable birth date


      4. Since I don''t have their birth dates, I cannot determine who died at a younger
      age. Even though I know their death dates, this information alone is not sufficient
      to compare their ages at death.


      Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer to this question with

      they were born, is not enough to determine who died younger.
