      - She was a Byzantine empress, wife of Emperor Alexios III Angelos

      - Historical records suggest she lived from around 1170 to sometime after 1210

      - So she lived into her 40s or early 50s


      2. Next, I''ll consider Grimoald III of Benevento:

      - He was a Lombard prince who ruled Benevento

      - Historical records indicate he lived from around 1122 to 1177

      - So he died in his mid-50s


      3. Comparing their lifespans:

      - Theodora lived from around 1170 to after 1210

      - Grimoald lived from around 1122 to 1177

      - Grimoald died in 1177, which is before Theodora''s known death


      4. Therefore, Grimoald died younger than Theodora.


      The answer is: NO, Theodora Komnene Angelina did NOT die younger than Grimoald
      III of Benevento.'

      1. First, I''ll find out when William II, Count of Chalon lived:

      - William II of Chalon was a medieval French nobleman who lived in the 11th
      century

      - He likely died around the late 11th century (circa 1080-1100)


      2. Next, I''ll research Anastasia of Sirmium:

      - Anastasia of Sirmium was an early Christian martyr

      - She was executed during the Roman persecution of Christians

      - This would place her death much earlier, around the early 4th century (circa
      304 AD)


      3. Comparing their lifespans:

      - Anastasia of Sirmium died around 304 AD

      - William II of Chalon died around 1090 AD

      - This means Anastasia died much earlier than William II


      4. The question asks: Did William II die younger than Anastasia?

      - No, he did not. In fact, he lived several centuries after her.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'
