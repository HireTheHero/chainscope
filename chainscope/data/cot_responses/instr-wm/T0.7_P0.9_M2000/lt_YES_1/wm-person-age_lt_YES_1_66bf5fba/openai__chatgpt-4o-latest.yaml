      5. His birth year is unclear, but historical records suggest he lived into at
      least middle age.

      6. If he was, for example, 50 or older, he would have outlived William III de
      Cantilupe in terms of age.


      Since William III de Cantilupe likely died younger than Antonio Arcioni, the
      answer is:


      **YES.**'
