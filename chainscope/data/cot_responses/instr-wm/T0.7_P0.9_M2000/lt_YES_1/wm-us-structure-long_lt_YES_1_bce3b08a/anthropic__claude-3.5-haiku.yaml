      1. First, I''ll locate Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station:

      - It is located in Oak Harbor, Ottawa County, Ohio

      - This is in northern Ohio, near Toledo


      2. Next, I''ll locate Orchestra Hall in Detroit:

      - Orchestra Hall is in Detroit, Michigan

      - Detroit is in southeastern Michigan


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Davis-Besse is west of Detroit

      - Orchestra Hall is in Detroit

      - Therefore, Davis-Besse is west of Orchestra Hall


      4. Double-checking the reasoning:

      - Davis-Besse is in northern Ohio

      - Orchestra Hall is in southeastern Michigan

      - This confirms Davis-Besse is indeed west of Orchestra Hall

      - It''s located in central Missouri

      - It''s an artificial lake created by the Bagnell Dam on the Osage River


      2. Next, let''s locate Bull Shoals Dam in Arkansas:

      - It''s located in northern Arkansas

      - It creates Bull Shoals Lake on the White River


      3. Now, let''s consider their relative geographic positions:

      - Lake of the Ozarks is in central Missouri

      - Bull Shoals Dam is in northern Arkansas

      - Looking at a map, Bull Shoals Dam is east of Lake of the Ozarks


      4. The question asks: Is Lake of the Ozarks west of Bull Shoals Dam?

      - Since Bull Shoals Dam is east of Lake of the Ozarks, Lake of the Ozarks is

      1. First, I''ll locate Hobe Sound, FL:

      - Hobe Sound is located in Martin County, on Florida''s east coast

      - It is north of West Palm Beach and south of Melbourne

      - Specifically, it''s in the eastern part of Florida


      2. Next, I''ll locate the Raleigh Hotel in Miami Beach, FL:

      - Miami Beach is located on the southeastern coast of Florida

      - It''s in Miami-Dade County

      - This is further south than Hobe Sound


      3. Comparing their east-west positions:

      - Both locations are on the eastern side of Florida

      - Hobe Sound is further north, but still on the eastern coast

      - The Raleigh Hotel is in Miami Beach, which is on the southeastern coast


      4. Determining west/east relationship:

      - Since both are on the eastern side of Florida, neither is west of the other

      - In fact, Hobe Sound is slightly more north/northeast compared to Miami Beach


      5. Conclusion:

      Bubble Houses in Hobe Sound is NOT west of the Raleigh Hotel in Miami Beach.

      2. Next, I''ll locate the coordinates of Basilica of Regina Pacis

      - This basilica is located in Brooklyn, at 1646 68th Street, Brooklyn, NY


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Manhattan is west of Brooklyn

      - So 145 6th Avenue (Manhattan) is west of 1646 68th Street (Brooklyn)


      4. Therefore, HERE Arts Center is located west of Basilica of Regina Pacis.

      - "West" would mean the power plant is to the left of the theatre on a map


      4. Checking the relative positions

      - Since the power plant is actually southwest of the theatre, it is NOT west
      of the theatre

      - Southwest is different from west

      1. First, I''ll need to determine the locations of both structures in Newark,
      NJ.


      2. New Hope Baptist Church is located at 145 Shepard Avenue in Newark.


      3. Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart is located at 89 Ridge Street in Newark.


      4. To determine which is west of the other, I''ll need to compare their coordinates
      or addresses.


      5. Using online mapping tools, I can confirm that New Hope Baptist Church is
      located east of Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart.


      6. Since the question asks if New Hope Baptist Church is west of the Cathedral
      Basilica, and it is actually east, the answer is:


      NO'
