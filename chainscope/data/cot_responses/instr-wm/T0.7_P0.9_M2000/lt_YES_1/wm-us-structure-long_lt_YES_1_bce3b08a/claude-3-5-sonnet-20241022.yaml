      at 1723 Race Street


      2. Looking at their locations in Philadelphia:

      - Forrest Theatre is in the heart of downtown/Center City

      - Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception is a bit north and slightly west of
      Center City


      3. When comparing their east-west positioning:

      - Forrest Theatre is actually slightly EAST of the Cathedral


      Therefore: NO'

      3. Looking at the building numbers:

      - Playwrights Horizons is at 416

      - VIA 57 West is at 625 (further west)


      4. In Manhattan, the higher the building number, the further west you go.

      Since 625 is a higher number than 416, VIA 57 West is further west than Playwrights
      Horizons.


      NO (Playwrights Horizons is EAST of VIA 57 West)'

      1. First, let me recall the locations:

      - Playwrights Horizons is located at 416 West 42nd Street

      - VIA 57 West is located at 625 West 57th Street


      2. Looking at the street numbers:

      - Playwrights Horizons is at West 42nd Street

      - VIA 57 West is at West 57th Street

      - So Playwrights Horizons is south of VIA 57 West


      3. Looking at the building numbers:

      - Playwrights Horizons is at 416

      - VIA 57 West is at 625

      - In Manhattan, building numbers generally increase as you go west

      - 416 is less than 625, meaning Playwrights Horizons is east of VIA 57 West


      NO (Playwrights Horizons is east of VIA 57 West)'

      5. Since both plants are on the Lake Michigan shoreline, and Kewaunee is north
      of Point Beach, Point Beach must be south of Kewaunee.


      6. When looking at two points along Lake Michigan''s western shore, the more
      southern location is east of the more northern location due to the shoreline''s
      slight southeast curve.

      1. First, let me locate both lakes:

      - Oologah Lake is in northeastern Oklahoma

      - Pat Mayse Lake is in northeast Texas

      - Oklahoma is directly north of Texas

      - These lakes are both in the eastern portions of their respective states


      3. Since Pat Mayse Lake is in northeast Texas, and Oologah Lake is in northeast
      Oklahoma:

      - Oologah Lake would be to the EAST of Pat Mayse Lake, not to the west

      - New Jersey is south of New York State

      - St. Padre Pio Shrine is in southern New Jersey

      - Cranberry Lake is in northern New York

      - Looking at a map, New Jersey is slightly east of this part of New York State


      3) When comparing their longitudes:
