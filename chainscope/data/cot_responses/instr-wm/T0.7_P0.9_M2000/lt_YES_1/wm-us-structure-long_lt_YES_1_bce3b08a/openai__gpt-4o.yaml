      Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Maryland is located west
      of the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre, we need to consider their geographic locations
      within Baltimore, Maryland.


      1. **Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin
      Mary**: This basilica is located at 409 Cathedral Street in Baltimore, Maryland.


      2. **Morris A. Mechanic Theatre**: This theatre was located at 1 North Charles
      Street in Baltimore, Maryland. It is important to note that the theatre has
      been demolished, but for the purposes of this question, we will consider its
      historical location.


      3. **Geographic Orientation**: In the context of Baltimore, the Basilica is
      located north of the intersection of Cathedral Street and Mulberry Street, while
      the Mechanic Theatre was located near the intersection of Charles Street and
      Baltimore Street.

      3. **Relative Positioning**: Oregon is north of California. Therefore, most
      locations in Oregon, including the Charles E. Nelson House, are generally north
      of locations in California, such as the Camanche Reservoir.


      4. **East-West Consideration**: For this question, we need to determine if the
      Nelson House is located west of the Camanche Reservoir. Since Oregon lies to
      the northwest of California, most locations in Oregon would be west of most
      locations in California, unless they are far east in Oregon or far west in California.


      Based on these steps, the Charles E. Nelson House in Oregon is indeed located
      to the west of Camanche Reservoir, California.

      2. Second Presbyterian Church is located at 7700 N Meridian St, which is in
      the northern part of Indianapolis.


      Now, considering the general layout of Indianapolis:


      - Monument Circle is centrally located in the downtown area.

      - N Meridian St runs north-south and is one of the main thoroughfares in Indianapolis.


      Since Second Presbyterian Church is on N Meridian St and is north of downtown,
      we need to determine if it is to the west or east relative to Christ Church
      Cathedral.


      - N Meridian St is directly north of Monument Circle, meaning it is neither
      east nor west but directly north.


      Thus, Second Presbyterian Church is north of Christ Church Cathedral, not west.


      The answer is NO. Second Presbyterian Church is not located west of Christ Church
      Cathedral.'

      1. **Locate Muskingum River Power Plant, OH**: The Muskingum River Power Plant
      was a coal-fired power plant located near Beverly, Ohio. Beverly is in southeastern
      Ohio.


      2. **Locate Allen Theatre, OH**: The Allen Theatre is part of Playhouse Square

      is located west of the Ziegfeld Theatre (1927), we need to consider their respective
      addresses and geographical locations in Manhattan, New York City.


      1. **Location of New York City Center**: New York City Center is located at
      131 West 55th Street, between 6th and 7th Avenues.


      2. **Location of Ziegfeld Theatre (1927)**: The original Ziegfeld Theatre (1927)
      was located at 141 West 54th Street, between 6th and 7th Avenues. It was demolished
      in 1966.


      Now, let''s analyze their relative positions:


      - Both locations are on the west side of Manhattan, and they are on consecutive
      streets (54th and 55th).

      - Since New York City Center is located on 55th Street and the Ziegfeld Theatre
      was on 54th Street, New York City Center is north of the Ziegfeld Theatre.

      - As for the east-west position, both locations are very close to each other
      and situated between the same avenues, so they have nearly the same east-west
      alignment.


      Therefore, in terms of strict west-to-east comparison, New York City Center
      is not significantly west or east of the original Ziegfeld Theatre location.
      However, given the addresses, they both are essentially aligned in terms of
      east-west positioning, with no clear "west" position of one over the other.


      Thus, a direct YES or NO answer to whether New York City Center is located west
      of the Ziegfeld Theatre (1927) would be: **NO**.'

      1. **Lake Steilacoom, WA**: This is a lake located in the state of Washington.
      Washington is in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.


      2. **Terrapin Crossroads, CA**: This is a music venue located in San Rafael,

      east-west positioning of Lake Steilacoom and San Rafael.

      - Lake Steilacoom is situated in the western part of Washington state.

      - San Rafael is located in the western part of California.


      Considering the longitudinal positioning:


      - San Rafael, CA (Terrapin Crossroads) is closer to the Pacific Ocean and is
      quite westward in California.

      - Lake Steilacoom, WA is also close to the Pacific Ocean but is further north.


      Because both locations are on the west coast of their respective states, but
      California is further south, San Rafael is actually positioned slightly more
      westward than Lake Steilacoom when considering the general curvature and layout

      2. **Location of Kewaunee Power Station**: This plant is located near Kewaunee,
      Wisconsin, which is also along the western shore of Lake Michigan, but to the
      south of Two Rivers.


      Next, we need to compare their longitudinal coordinates to determine which one
      is further west:


      - Two Rivers (Point Beach) is generally located slightly to the east compared
      to Kewaunee.

      - Kewaunee is situated further to the west compared to Two Rivers.

      3. **Compare their positions**: Since both plants are along the shore of Lake
      Michigan, the key is to determine their relative positions along this eastern
      shore. Kewaunee is located south of Two Rivers, making it further down the shoreline.


      Thus, Point Beach, being near Two Rivers which is north of Kewaunee, is positioned
      to the north and slightly east of the Kewaunee Power Station when considering
      the curvature of the Lake Michigan shoreline.

      positions.


      St. James Cathedral is located at 65 East Huron Street, Chicago, IL. The Seventeenth
      Church of Christ, Scientist is located at 55 East Wacker Drive, Chicago, IL.


      Comparing these addresses, both are in close proximity in downtown Chicago.
      However, East Huron Street is situated north of East Wacker Drive, with St.
      James Cathedral located slightly west of the Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist.

      part of Brooklyn.


      2. **Church of St. Vincent Ferrer**: This church is located in Manhattan, New

      Valley Lake in Pennsylvania, we should consider the geographical positions of
      both locations:


      1. **Identify the location of Rose Valley Lake, PA:** Rose Valley Lake is located
      in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. It is situated in the northern part of the
      state.


      2. **Identify the location of the Ukrainian Catholic National Shrine of the
