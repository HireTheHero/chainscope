      to find the locations of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption
      of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre.  Both are in
      Maryland, which helps narrow things down.


      2. **More specific locations:** The Basilica is in Baltimore. The Morris A.
      Mechanic Theatre was also in Baltimore.


      3. **Relative position:**  A quick search reveals the Basilica is at Cathedral
      and Mulberry Streets in Baltimore, and the (now demolished) Mechanic Theatre
      was at Charles and Baltimore Streets.  Baltimore Street runs East-West, and
      Charles Street runs North-South.  Cathedral Street is west of Charles Street.


      4. **West or East?:**  Since Cathedral Street is west of Charles Street, the
      Basilica is west of where the Mechanic Theatre stood.

      to find the locations of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption
      of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre.  Both are in
      Maryland, but we need more specific locations.

      2. **Determine longitude/latitude or relative position:**  We need to figure
      out their longitude and latitude coordinates, or at least their relative positions
      (east/west of each other).

      3. **Compare longitude:** The location further west will have a lower longitude
      value.


      The Basilica is in Baltimore. The Mechanic Theatre was also in Baltimore.


      A quick search shows the Basilica is at roughly -76.61 longitude. The Mechanic
      Theatre (now demolished) was at roughly -76.60 longitude.


      Since -76.61 is less than -76.60, the Basilica is west of where the Mechanic
      Theatre stood.

      3. **Compare:** If St. Athanasius Church has a lower longitude than Christian
      Cultural Center, it is west.


      Using a map service:


      St. Athanasius Church is at approximately -73.88303


      Christian Cultural Center is at approximately -73.90828


      Since -73.88303 is greater than -73.90828, St. Athanasius is *east* of the Christian
      Cultural Center.

      * VIA 57 West is located at 625 West 57th Street.


      Since 42nd Street is south of 57th Street, and both addresses are on West streets,
      we need to look at the avenue numbers. Playwrights Horizons is on 42nd street
      while VIA 57 West is on 57th street. Lower avenue numbers are further east.
      Therefore, Playwrights Horizons is further east than VIA 57 West.

    5108491b-9f72-467c-979c-f722945e562f: '1. **Locate Baker Lake, WA:** Baker Lake
      is in Washington state.

      2. **Locate Anderson Lake, CA:** Anderson Lake is in California.

      3. **Relative position of Washington and California:** Washington is north of
      California and mostly west of California.  While California''s northern border
      does extend slightly west of Washington''s southern border, the bulk of Washington
      is west of the bulk of California.

      4. **Consider the general locations within their states:**  While specific coordinates
      would be more precise, general knowledge places Baker Lake in the western portion
      of Washington and Anderson Lake further inland in California.


      Therefore, Baker Lake, WA is very likely west of Anderson Lake, CA.

      4. **Consider west/east specifically:**  While Washington is mostly west of
      California, we need to determine if Baker Lake is specifically west of Anderson
      Lake.  Given California''s westward curving coastline, it''s possible Anderson
      Lake is further west.

      5. **Precise location check (helpful, but not strictly required for a confident
      answer):** A quick map check reveals Anderson Lake is considerably further west
      than Baker Lake.

      to find the locations of New York City Center and the (former) Ziegfeld Theatre
      in New York City.

      2. **Determine general East/West positioning:**  Manhattan''s street grid makes
      it easy to determine relative east and west locations.  Lower numbered avenues

      Theatre (demolished in 2016) was located at 141 West 54th Street, between 6th
      and 7th Avenues.


      Since both are between 6th and 7th Avenues, we need to look at the street address
      numbers. City Center is basically on 7th Avenue so would have a higher address
      number. Ziegfeld was on West 54th, closer to 6th avenue.  Lower address numbers
      are further east.

      Center and the (former) Ziegfeld Theatre.


      2. **Determine Longitude:** Once we have the locations, we need to focus on
      the longitude coordinates.  Longitude measures east/west position.  A location
      further west will have a *lower* longitude value.


      3. **Compare Longitude Values:**  Compare the longitude of New York City Center
      to the longitude of the Ziegfeld Theatre.


      4. **Answer the question:** If New York City Center has a lower longitude value,
      it is west of the Ziegfeld Theatre, and the answer is YES. If it has a higher
      longitude value, it is east, and the answer is NO.


      Now, having established the process, let''s find the locations.


      * **New York City Center:** 131 West 55th Street (between 6th and 7th Avenues)

      * **Ziegfeld Theatre (1927, demolished):** 141 West 54th Street (between 6th
      and 7th Avenues).


      Since both are on West numbered streets, lower street numbers are further west.  55th
      street is further west than 54th street. Thus, City Center is west of the Ziegfeld
      Theatre''s former location.

      The Gaiety Theatre was located at 1547 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets.  The

      higher street numbers are north of those with lower numbers. Since the Gaiety
      is on Broadway in the 40s and the Comedy Theatre is on 41st Street west of Broadway,
      the Gaiety Theatre is likely west of the Comedy Theatre.  A quick check of a

      After searching online, I found that the Gaiety Theatre was located at 1547

      North-South, and 41st street runs East-West.  1547 Broadway would be further

      and the Comedy Theatre in New York City.

      2. **Compare their East-West positions:** Once I have the addresses, I can compare
      which one is further west.  Street numbers in Manhattan generally increase as
      you go East.  Avenues also progress eastward (except for a small section of
      lower Manhattan).

      3. **Determine West/East:** Based on the address comparison, I can determine
      if the Gaiety Theatre is west of the Comedy Theatre.



      After research, the Gaiety Theatre was located at 46th Street and Broadway,
      while the Comedy Theatre was located at 41st Street and Broadway.  Since 46th
      Street is further north than 41st Street,  "west" or "east" isn''t directly
      relevant as they are both on the same avenue (Broadway).  However, taking "west"
      to mean further uptown in this context, the answer would be YES.


      However, if we are using a strict geographical definition of West, the answer
      is effectively NO, as they are on the same North-South running avenue.


      Given the ambiguity caused by both theaters being on Broadway, I''ll defer to
      the more geographically accurate answer.

    120a98b3-53b7-4c95-9be2-9a3f877241d8: '1. **Identify the need for precise location
      data:** To determine if one building is west of another, we need their exact
      locations (latitude and longitude).  Just knowing they are in the same city
      isn''t enough.


      2. **Recognize a potential trick:** The question mentions two buildings with
      similar names in Fort Worth.  This could be a distraction.  Are there actually
      *two* Blackstone Hotels and *two* Flatiron Buildings in Fort Worth?  This is
      highly unlikely.


      3. **Assume a single building of each name:** It''s more probable that the question
      is referring to a single "Blackstone Hotel" and a single "Flatiron Building"
      in Fort Worth.  The repetition of "(Fort Worth, Texas), TX" is likely redundant
      phrasing.


      4. **Search for the locations:**  A quick search shows only one Blackstone Hotel
      and one Flatiron Building in Fort Worth.


      5. **Compare locations:** The Blackstone Hotel is located east of the Flatiron
      Building.

      intersect.


      3. **Visualize Fort Worth street grid (or use a map):**  Main Street runs roughly
      North-South. Houston Street runs roughly East-West.  The numbers increase going
      south on Main and increase going west on Houston.  Since 817 is west of where
      Main St. crosses Houston, and the Blackstone is on Main Street, the Flatiron
      building is west of the Blackstone.

      the Blackstone Hotel and the Flatiron Building are in Fort Worth, Texas. This
      simplifies the problem as we don''t need to consider different cities or states.


      2. **Determine relative east/west positions:**  To determine if one is west
      of the other, we need to know their street addresses or general locations within
      Fort Worth.  A quick search shows the Blackstone Hotel is at 601 Main Street,
      and the Flatiron Building is at 800 Main Street.


      3. **Interpret street numbering:**  In most cities, street numbers increase
      as you go east or west from a central point.  Since both are on Main Street,
      the higher number (800) indicates the Flatiron Building is further east along
      Main Street than the Blackstone Hotel (601).


      4. **Conclusion:**  Because the Flatiron Building has a higher address number
      on the same street, it is east of the Blackstone Hotel.  Therefore, the Blackstone
      Hotel is *west* of the Flatiron Building.

      The Drake Hotel (now demolished) was located at 440 Park Avenue.  Since 440
      is numerically higher than 425, and both are on the same avenue, the Drake Hotel
      was further north on Park Avenue than 425 Park Avenue.  Streets in Manhattan

      2. **Compare address numbers:** Both buildings are on Park Avenue. Higher address
      numbers on Park Avenue generally correspond to locations further north.  Since
      440 is greater than 425, the Drake Hotel was further north than 425 Park Avenue.


      3. **North vs. West:**  The question asks about West. While the Drake was north
      of 425 Park Avenue, that doesn''t tell us whether it was west. In Manhattan,
      avenues run generally north-south, and streets run generally east-west.  Buildings
      on the same avenue will likely have minimal east-west displacement relative
      to each other.

    3225870c-2c8f-45e0-a92e-697ad930c97c: '1. **Find the locations of the two churches:**  I
      need to determine the addresses or geographic coordinates of All Saints Church
      and Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church in Manhattan.


      2. **Compare their longitudinal coordinates:**  Manhattan uses a grid system,
      and locations further west will have lower longitude values.  I will compare
      the longitude of All Saints Church to the longitude of Our Lady of Mount Carmel
      Church.


      3. **Determine the answer:** If the longitude of All Saints Church is less than
      the longitude of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church, the answer is YES. Otherwise,
      the answer is NO.


      All Saints Church is located at 288 Henry St, New York, NY 10002.

      Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church is located at 448 East 116th St, New York, NY
      10029.


      All Saints is in Lower Manhattan, Our Lady of Mount Carmel is in East Harlem,
      much further north.  Lower Manhattan is west of East Harlem.

    4503977b-04f7-4d94-bb4b-3bf13c94fbe8: '1. **Find the locations of the two churches:**  I
      need to determine the addresses or geographic coordinates of both All Saints
      Church and the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.


      2. **Compare their longitudinal coordinates:**  Longitude determines east-west
      position.  A location further west will have a lower longitudinal value (in
      the Western Hemisphere).


      3. **Determine which church has the lower longitude:** If All Saints Church
      has a lower longitude than Our Lady of Mount Carmel, it is west of it.


      Using a mapping tool, I can find that All Saints Church is located at 288 Henry
      St, New York, NY 10002, and Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is located at
      448 E 116th St, New York, NY 10029.  All Saints is clearly downtown in Lower
      Manhattan and Our Lady of Mount Carmel is quite far north in East Harlem.  Lower
      Manhattan is west of East Harlem.

    55e2921e-07fd-4eab-9d1c-d51aa0a72727: '1. **Find the locations of the two churches:**  I
      need to find the addresses or coordinates of All Saints Church and Our Lady
      of Mount Carmel Church in Manhattan.


      2. **Compare their longitudinal coordinates:** Manhattan uses a grid system,
      so the further west a location is, the lower its longitudinal coordinate (or
      the more negative if using coordinates west of the Prime Meridian).  I need
      to compare the longitudinal coordinates of the two churches.


      3. **Determine if All Saints is west of Our Lady of Mount Carmel:** If All Saints''
      longitudinal coordinate is less than Our Lady of Mount Carmel''s, then All Saints
      is west of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.



      All Saints Church is located at 288 Henry Street, New York, NY 10002.

      Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church is located at 448 East 116th Street, New York,
      NY 10029.


      Henry Street is in Lower Manhattan, and East 116th Street is in East Harlem,
      much further north.  Streets in Lower Manhattan run roughly northwest/southeast.  Since
      Henry Street is far downtown and the East Side address is far uptown, it is
      *extremely likely* that All Saints is west of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.  A quick
      map check confirms this.

    6ca1aca2-718d-4232-b107-491c269a9651: '1. **Find the addresses:**  I need the
      addresses of both churches to determine their relative east-west positions.

      2. **Compare the addresses:** Specifically, I need the street numbers and street
      names.  Lower street numbers are generally further west in Manhattan.

      3. **Determine West/East:** Once I have the addresses, I can compare which one
      is further west.


      All Saints Church is at 288 Henry Street.

      Our Lady of Mount Carmel is at 448 East 116th Street.


      Henry Street is in lower Manhattan, and East 116th Street is further uptown/north.  Street
      numbers don''t directly correlate across different streets.  However, Henry
      Street is significantly west of East 116th Street.

    99e6ff14-caf8-4d72-9fa1-0e92e1d12ae9: '1. **Locate All Saints Church (Manhattan):**  All
      Saints Church is located at 230 East 60th Street, New York, NY.


      2. **Locate Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel (Manhattan):** The Church of
      Our Lady of Mount Carmel is located at 447 East 115th Street, New York, NY.


      3. **Compare Easting:** Both churches are on the East side.  This doesn''t help
      determine West/East relative positioning.


      4. **Compare Street Numbers:** All Saints is on 60th Street, while Our Lady
      of Mount Carmel is on 115th Street.  Higher street numbers in Manhattan generally
      correspond to locations further north.


      5. **West/East Determination:** Since both churches are on the East side, and
      All Saints is at a lower street number (further south) than Our Lady of Mount
      Carmel, All Saints is *not* west of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.

      need to determine the addresses or coordinates of All Saints Church and Our
      Lady of Mount Carmel Church in Manhattan.


      2. **Compare the east-west positions (longitude or avenues):** Manhattan uses
      a numbered street grid. Higher avenue numbers are further east.  I need to compare
      the avenue addresses or longitudes of the two churches.  Whichever church has
      the lower avenue number is further west.


      3. **Determine if All Saints is west of Our Lady of Mount Carmel:** Based on

      of Mount Carmel.


      All Saints Church is located at 288 Henry St, New York, NY 10002.  Henry Street
      is roughly equivalent to the area between Pike and Madison Streets.


      Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church is located at 447 East 115th Street, New York,
      NY 10029.


      Since Henry Street is much further south and west than East 115th Street, All
      Saints is west of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.


      **YES**

      longitude values are further west.


      3. **Determine if All Saints is west of Our Lady of Mount Carmel:** If All Saints
      Church has a lower longitude value than Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church, then

      * All Saints Church is located at 288 Henry Street in Lower Manhattan.

      * Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church is located at 448 East 116th Street in East
      Harlem.


      Henry Street is in Lower Manhattan and East 116th Street is further north and
      *east*.


      Therefore, All Saints is West of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.
