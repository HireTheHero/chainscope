      3. **Specific Locations**: Amarillo, Texas, is in the northern part of the state,
      and Keith County, Nebraska, is in the western part of the state.


      4. **Determine Direction**: Given that Amarillo is in northern Texas and Keith
      County is in western Nebraska, and considering the general south-north direction,
      the FirstBank Southwest Tower in Amarillo is south of Lake McConaughy in Keith
      County.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since the FirstBank Southwest Tower is south of Lake McConaughy,
      it cannot be west of it.

      County and most of New York state''s landmass is to the west, it is unlikely
      that Most Holy Trinity Church in Mamaroneck is located west of Glenwood Generating
      Station. However, without knowing the exact location of the generating station,
      it''s challenging to provide a definitive answer.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

    b20bfef9-8258-4d3e-b3c9-2413b6a21cc6: 'To answer this question, we need to consider
      the locations of both structures:


      1. **Identify Locations**: The Most Holy Trinity Church is located in Mamaroneck,
      New York. Mamaroneck is a village in Westchester County, New York. The Glenwood
      Generating Station is also located in New York, specifically in Yonkers, New
      York, which is also in Westchester County.


      2. **Determine Relative Positions**: Mamaroneck and Yonkers are both in Westchester
      County, New York. However, to determine if the Most Holy Trinity Church is located
      west of the Glenwood Generating Station, we need to consider their positions
      within the county.


      3. **Geographical Context**: Westchester County is situated just north of New
      York City. Yonkers is located on the western side of the county, closer to the
      Hudson River. Mamaroneck is located further east within the county.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Yonkers is west of Mamaroneck within Westchester
      County, the Glenwood Generating Station, located in Yonkers, is west of the
      Most Holy Trinity Church, which is located in Mamaroneck.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Most Holy Trinity Church is located in Mamaroneck,
      New York, while the Glenwood Generating Station is also located in New York.


      2. **Understand the geographical context**: Mamaroneck is a village in Westchester

      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Mamaroneck and Yonkers are both in
      the same county and relatively close to each other. However, Mamaroneck is further
      east and slightly north of Yonkers. The Glenwood Generating Station, being in
      Yonkers, is situated west of Mamaroneck.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the relative positions of Mamaroneck and Yonkers, and

      Center in SoHo, Manhattan, is west of the Basilica of Regina Pacis in Bensonhurst,
      Brooklyn. This is because Manhattan is west of Brooklyn, and the locations of
      the HERE Arts Center and the Basilica of Regina Pacis reflect this general east-west
      orientation within the city.

      New York is located west of VIA 57 West in New York, we need to consider their
      relative positions within the city. Here are the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: Playwrights Horizons is located in Midtown Manhattan,
      New York City, specifically on 42nd Street. VIA 57 West is a residential building
      also located in Manhattan, but it''s situated on the West Side, near the Hudson
      River.


      2. **Geographical Context**: Manhattan is an island in New York City, and it
      is generally divided into different areas based on their geographical positions.
      Midtown Manhattan, where Playwrights Horizons is located, is in the central
      part of the island. The West Side, where VIA 57 West is located, is on the western
      side of the island, closer to the Hudson River.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Since both locations are in Manhattan, we need to
      consider their positions within the island. Midtown Manhattan is generally considered
      to be east of the West Side. Therefore, Playwrights Horizons is likely east
      of VIA 57 West.


      4. **Specific Addresses**: For more precise locations, we can look up the addresses
      of both places. Playwrights Horizons is at 416 W 42nd St, New York, NY 10036.
      VIA 57 West is at 625 W 57th St, New York, NY 10019. These addresses confirm

      1. **Identify the locations**: The Owyhee Reservoir is located in eastern Oregon,
      while the Sandals Church is in California. We need to consider the overall geography
      of the western United States.


      2. **Understand the relative positions**: Oregon is generally north of California,
      and the Owyhee Reservoir is in eastern Oregon, which places it east of the Sandals
      Church in California.


      3. **Consider specific locations**: The Owyhee Reservoir is situated in the
      Owyhee Canyonlands, which is in the southeastern corner of Oregon, bordering
      Idaho and Nevada. This places it east of California.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that the Owyhee Reservoir is in eastern Oregon and
      the Sandals Church is in California, the reservoir is not located west of the
      church. Instead, it is located east of the church, considering their overall
      positions in the western United States.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Don Pedro
      Reservoir and Twitchell Reservoir in California.


      2. **Determine Relative Positions**: Both reservoirs are located in California,
      but we need to determine their relative positions. Don Pedro Reservoir is situated
      in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, specifically in Tuolumne
      County, California. Twitchell Reservoir is located in the Santa Barbara County,
      California, which is on the coast.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Star Lite Motel is in Minnesota, and Curtis Culwell
      Center is in Texas. Both states are in the United States, but they are not adjacent
      to each other.


      2. **Understand the general geography**: Minnesota is located in the northern-central
      part of the United States, while Texas is in the southern-central part. Minnesota
      is generally east of Texas.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Even though Minnesota is generally
      east of Texas, we need to consider their specific positions within their respective
      states. Without more detailed information about the exact locations of the Star
      Lite Motel and Curtis Culwell Center, we can''t definitively determine their
      relative east-west positions within their states.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the general geography and the lack of specific location
      information, we cannot confidently say whether the Star Lite Motel in Minnesota
      is west of the Curtis Culwell Center in Texas. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{NO}$.

      states. Chickamauga Lake is situated in the southeastern part of Tennessee,
      and Guist Creek Lake is in the northern part of Kentucky. This means that Chickamauga
      Lake is generally south of Guist Creek Lake.


      3. **Consider Cardinal Directions**: The term "west" implies a direction to
      the left when facing north. Since Chickamauga Lake is south of Guist Creek Lake,
      it is not to the left (west) but rather to the right (east) when facing north.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on their relative positions, Chickamauga Lake in Tennessee
      is not located west of Guist Creek Lake in Kentucky. Instead, it is located
      to the south or east of Guist Creek Lake, depending on the perspective.

      Wisconsin, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First Presbyterian Church is in Jackson, Mississippi,
      and the House on the Rock is in Spring Green, Wisconsin.


      2. **Understand the relative positions**: Mississippi is generally located in
      the southern United States, while Wisconsin is in the northern part of the country.
      This means that the First Presbyterian Church in Mississippi is generally south
      of the House on the Rock in Wisconsin.


      3. **Consider the longitudinal positions**: While Mississippi is south of Wisconsin,
      it''s also important to consider their positions on the longitudinal axis. Jackson,
      Mississippi, is located west of Spring Green, Wisconsin, when considering their
      positions on the longitudinal axis.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on their relative positions and considering the longitudinal
      axis, the First Presbyterian Church in Jackson, Mississippi, is located west
      of the House on the Rock in Spring Green, Wisconsin.

      to the left of that object when facing north.


      3. **Consider the geography of Orlando**: Orlando is a city in central Florida.
      It is known for its theme parks and attractions, but it also has a downtown
      area where government buildings and landmarks are located.


      4. **Determine the relative positions**: The Orange County Courthouse is located
      in downtown Orlando, and St. James Cathedral is also situated in downtown Orlando.
      Both are landmarks in the city''s central area.


      5. **Compare the locations**: To determine if the courthouse is west of the
      cathedral, we need to consider their relative positions within downtown Orlando.
      If the courthouse is to the left of the cathedral when facing north, then it
      is indeed located west of the cathedral.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given that both the Orange County Courthouse and St. James
      Cathedral are in downtown Orlando, and considering the layout of the city, it
      is likely that the courthouse is located west of the cathedral. However, without
      specific addresses or a detailed map, it''s difficult to provide a definitive
      answer.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{YES}$

      1. **Identify the locations**: The Orange County Courthouse is in Orlando, Florida,
      and the St. James Cathedral is also in Orlando, Florida.

      of the St. James Cathedral. This means it is not located west of the cathedral
      but rather north of it.

      the East River separating them. However, specific locations within these boroughs
      can vary significantly in their east-west positions.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Without exact addresses or coordinates,
      we can consider the general layout of the boroughs. The Church of St. Vincent
      Ferrer is located on Lexington Avenue and East 65th Street, placing it in the
      eastern part of Manhattan. The Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph is in the Prospect
      Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, which is generally west of the East River.


      4. **Compare locations**: Given the general locations, the Co-Cathedral of St.
      Joseph is not located west of the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer. Instead, it
      is east of the Church, considering the positions of these locations within their
      respective boroughs.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the relative positions within their boroughs, the
      Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph in Brooklyn is not located west of the Church of
      St. Vincent Ferrer in Manhattan.
