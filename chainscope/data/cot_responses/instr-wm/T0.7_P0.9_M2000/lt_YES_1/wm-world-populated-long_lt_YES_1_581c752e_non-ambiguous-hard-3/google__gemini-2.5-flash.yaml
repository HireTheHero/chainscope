      village, a typo, or a fictional place. Without a clear reference, its location
      cannot be determined.


      2.  **Identify Koraput district:** Koraput district is a well-known administrative
      division in the state of Odisha, India. Its location is precisely known.


      3.  **Determine relative position:** To answer "Is Agame located west of Koraput

      Agame cannot be identified, its position relative to Koraput district cannot
      be determined.


      Therefore, without knowing where Agame is, we cannot tell if it''s west of Koraput
      district.


      The question asks for a clear YES or NO answer. Since the premise (the existence
      and location of "Agame") is unclear, a definitive YES or NO cannot be given

      1.  **Identify Agame:** "Agame" is not a widely recognized place name in geographical
      databases. It''s possible it''s a misspelling, a very small local place, or
      even a fictional name for the purpose of the question.


      2.  **Identify Koraput District:** Koraput District is a well-known administrative
      division in the state of Odisha, India. Its location is firmly established in
      eastern India.


      3.  **Determine the Relative Location:** Since the location of "Agame" is unknown
      or highly ambiguous, it''s impossible to definitively place it west of Koraput
      District. To answer "yes" or "no," we would need to know the specific coordinates
      or relative position of Agame.


      Given the ambiguity of "Agame," a definitive "YES" or "NO" cannot be provided
      without further information. However, since the question *demands* a YES or
      NO answer, and based on the likelihood of "Agame" not being a real, significant,
      and widely known geographical location that could be definitively placed in
      relation to Koraput, the most accurate answer based on available common geographical
      knowledge is that we cannot confirm it.


      However, if we are forced to assume "Agame" is not a real place, or not one
      that would be commonly known, then the answer would lean towards "No" because
      we cannot verify it.


      Let''s re-evaluate based on the constraint of a clear YES or NO. If "Agame"
      is not a real place, then it cannot be west of Koraput district. If it *were*
      a real, but obscure, place and it happened to be west, then the answer would
      be yes. But without the information, we cannot confirm.


      The question asks for a clear YES or NO. If a location cannot be found, then
      its position relative to another cannot be confirmed. Therefore, we cannot say
      "Yes, it is west" or "No, it is not west" definitively.


      **However, if a "Yes/No" question cannot be answered definitively due to lack
      of information, the most direct answer is "No" because the premise cannot be

      relative locations of Idjwi and Bandar Baharu District.


      **Step 1: Locate Idjwi.**

      Idjwi is an island in Lake Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. Its approximate
      coordinates are 2.1 degrees South latitude, 29.1 degrees East longitude.


      **Step 2: Locate Bandar Baharu District.**

      Bandar Baharu District is a district in Kedah, Malaysia. Its approximate coordinates
      are 5.1 degrees North latitude, 100.5 degrees East longitude.


      **Step 3: Compare longitudes.**

      *   Idjwi: ~29.1 degrees East

      *   Bandar Baharu District: ~100.5 degrees East


      **Step 4: Determine relative west/east position.**

      A smaller East longitude value means a location is to the west of a larger East
      longitude value.

      Since 29.1 is less than 100.5, Idjwi is located to the west of Bandar Baharu
      District.

      YES'

    ee2d21da-5601-444a-b8ea-9805a0aa4284: 'Let''s break this down:


      1. **Identify "Hydra, Algeria":** Hydra is a commune in Algiers Province, Algeria.

      2. **Identify "Ghasm":** This name is not readily identifiable as a well-known
      place in Algeria. It''s possible it''s a very small, local settlement, a misspelling,
      or even a fictional place for the purpose of the question.


      **The core issue:** Without a clear, identifiable location for "Ghasm," it''s
      impossible to determine its relative position to Hydra.


      Therefore, I cannot definitively say YES or NO. However, if forced to choose
      based on the *implication of the question expecting a YES/NO answer*, it''s
      often a trick question or relies on a common misconception.


      Given the common knowledge that "Hydra" is an island in Greece, not a place
      in Algeria, the premise of the question itself is flawed. If we assume the question
      *intends* to refer to the actual Hydra (Greece) and *some place* in Algeria,
      the comparison becomes nonsensical.


      But if we stick strictly to the wording "Hydra, Algeria":


      *   **Hydra (Algeria)** is a real place.

      *   **Ghasm** is not a readily identifiable place in Algeria.


      Since I cannot locate "Ghasm" to compare its longitude with "Hydra, Algeria,"
      I cannot answer with a definitive YES or NO.


      However, if the question implies a common geographical knowledge test, the most
      likely "trick" is the misattribution of Hydra to Algeria. If we assume the question
      *intends* to ask about the *island of Hydra in Greece*, then the answer would
      be no, as Greece is generally east of Algeria.


      But sticking to the literal wording:


      **There is no readily identifiable place called "Ghasm" in Algeria with which
      to compare the location of Hydra, Algeria.**


      Therefore, based on the information provided and common geographical knowledge,
      I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer. The premise is flawed or incomplete.


      If I *had* to pick the most likely intended answer given the nature of such
      questions, it''s often designed to trip you up on the initial premise. The most
      famous "Hydra" is in Greece. If the question implicitly refers to that, the
      answer would be NO, as Hydra, Greece, is generally east of Algeria.


      However, since the question explicitly states "Hydra, Algeria", and "Ghasm"
      is not a known location, the answer is indeterminate.


      **Final Answer based on strict interpretation:** It''s impossible to answer
      YES or NO without knowing the location of "Ghasm."'

      a fictional name. Without a clear geographic location for "Sakrah," it''s impossible
      to place it on a map.


      2.  **Identify "Changbai Korean Autonomous County":** This is a real and well-known
      administrative division in Jilin Province, China, bordering North Korea. Its
      location is precisely known.


      3.  **Determine the relationship:** To answer "Is Sakrah located west of Changbai
      Korean Autonomous County?", we would need to know the location of Sakrah. Since
      "Sakrah" cannot be definitively located, a comparison cannot be made.


      Therefore, because one of the key geographical points is unidentifiable, the
      question cannot be answered with a definitive YES or NO.


      However, since the prompt *demands* a YES or NO answer, and the inability to
      locate "Sakrah" means we cannot affirm it is west, the most accurate answer,
      given the constraint, implies that the condition cannot be met.

      2.  **Locate Gladeview, Florida:** Florida is in the southeastern United States.

      3.  **Compare their longitudes:** The United States spans from the Atlantic
      Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean (west). States in the west of the country
      will have a more westerly longitude (further from the Prime Meridian) than states
      in the east.


      Since Arizona is a western state and Florida is an eastern state, any point
      in Arizona will be west of any point in Florida.

      1.  **Determine the approximate longitude of Clifton, Arizona:** Arizona is\
      \ in the southwestern US. Its longitude range is roughly between 109\xB0W and\
      \ 115\xB0W. Clifton is in eastern Arizona, so it's probably around 109-110\xB0\
      W.\n\n2.  **Determine the approximate longitude of Gladeview, Florida:** Florida\
      \ is in the southeastern US. Its longitude range is roughly between 80\xB0W\

      **The most appropriate answer is that the premise of the question is flawed.**
