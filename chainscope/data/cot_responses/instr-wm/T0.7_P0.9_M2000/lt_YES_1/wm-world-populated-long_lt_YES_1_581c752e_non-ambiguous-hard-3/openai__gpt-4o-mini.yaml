      2. **Lumle**: This is a village located in the Kaski District of Nepal, near

      1. **Identify Gascoyne**: Gascoyne is a region in Western Australia, known for
      its desert landscapes and coastal areas.


      2. **Identify Bungeni**: Bungeni is a locality in the eastern part of the country
      of Mozambique, situated near the coast.


      3. **Determine their relative positions**: Gascoyne is in Australia, while Bungeni
      is in Mozambique, which is on a different continent (Africa). When comparing

      in the Kaafu Atoll. The Maldives is located in the Indian Ocean, southwest of
      Sri Lanka and India.


      2. **Location of Batang Padang District**: Batang Padang District is located

      Maldives.


      3. **Relative Positioning**: To determine if Dhiffushi is west of Batang Padang

      Dhiffushi, is generally located to the southwest of the Indian subcontinent,
      while Batang Padang is located on the Malay Peninsula.


      4. **Comparing the Directions**: Since the Maldives is south-southwest of Malaysia,
      this means that Dhiffushi is not west of Batang Padang District; it is actually
      southeast of Batang Padang.

      Encs is in Hungary, which is further east in Europe.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Ballyronan is located in Northern Ireland (UK) and

      United States. It is situated in the northeastern part of North Carolina, bordering
      the Atlantic Ocean.


      2. **San Sebastiano al Vesuvio**: This municipality is located in Italy, near

      - **North Carolina** is located to the west of the Atlantic Ocean and to the
      east of places like Tennessee.

      - **San Sebastiano al Vesuvio** is located in southern Italy, which is east
