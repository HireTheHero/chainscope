    41425fd3-4db3-4371-9c5b-a5475d7672e5: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Loughor:

      - Loughor is a village in Wales, United Kingdom

      - It is located in the southwestern part of Wales, near Swansea


      2. Next, I''ll locate Silistra:

      - Silistra is a city in northeastern Bulgaria

      - It is situated on the southern bank of the Danube River, near the Romanian
      border


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Loughor is in western Europe (Wales)

      - Silistra is in eastern Europe (Bulgaria)

      - These locations are quite far apart, on different sides of Europe


      4. Determining west/east positioning:

      - Loughor is west of Silistra

      - The entire United Kingdom is west of Bulgaria


      5. Final reasoning:

      - Since Loughor is in western Europe and Silistra is in eastern Europe, Loughor
      is indeed west of Silistra


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

    438ef93f-b117-4118-9e8d-152ace4aadfd: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s identify the locations:

      - Dhiffushi is an island in the Kaafu Atoll of the Maldives

      - Batang Padang District is located in Indonesia (specifically in Perak state)


      2. Check their geographical positions:

      - Kaafu Atoll is in the Indian Ocean, in the central part of the Maldives

      - Batang Padang District is in the western part of Peninsular Malaysia


      3. Determine their relative positions:

      - Geographically, Dhiffushi (Maldives) is located east of Batang Padang District
      (Malaysia)


      4. The question asks if Dhiffushi is west of Batang Padang District

      - Since Dhiffushi is actually east of Batang Padang District, the answer is
      NOT west


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

    fa21a931-64a6-4a71-8e20-2f8eba3a095a: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s identify the locations:

      - Rukum District is a district in western Nepal

      - Hokota is a city in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan


      2. Consider their geographic positions:

      - Rukum District is in the western part of Nepal, in South Asia

      - Hokota is in eastern Japan, in the Asia-Pacific region


      3. Compare their relative positions:

      - These locations are in very different parts of Asia

      - Nepal is west of Japan

      - Rukum District is therefore west of Hokota, Ibaraki


      4. Conclusion:

      Since Rukum District is located in a region west of Hokota, Ibaraki, the answer
      is:


      YES'

      1. First, locate Rukum District:

      - Rukum District is located in western Nepal

      - It is in the Rapti Province, in the mid-western region of Nepal


      2. Next, locate Hokota, Ibaraki:

      - Hokota is a city in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan

      - Ibaraki Prefecture is located in the Kanto region of Japan, on the eastern
      side of Honshu island


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Rukum District is in Nepal, which is in South Asia

      - Hokota is in Japan, which is in East Asia

      - These locations are thousands of miles apart


      4. Determine their relative positioning:

      - Nepal is west of Japan

      - So Rukum District is west of Hokota, Ibaraki


      5. Final reasoning:

      - Since Rukum District is west of Hokota, the answer is YES
