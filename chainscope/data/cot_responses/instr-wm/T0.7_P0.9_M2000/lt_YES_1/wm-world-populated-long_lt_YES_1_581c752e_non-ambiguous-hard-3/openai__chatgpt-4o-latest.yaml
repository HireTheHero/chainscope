      - South Africa is located on the southern tip of Africa, also in the Southern
      Hemisphere, but more toward the Eastern Hemisphere.

      - Approximate coordinates of Loeriesfontein: Latitude: ~-30.95, Longitude: ~19.43.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      - Longitude of San Isidro: ~-58.5 (West)

      - Longitude of Loeriesfontein: ~19.43 (East)


      Note: Negative longitudes indicate locations west of the Prime Meridian, while
      positive longitudes are east of it.


      **Step 4: Compare their relative positions longitudinally.**

      - Since -58.5 is further west than 19.43, San Isidro is significantly west of
      Loeriesfontein.
