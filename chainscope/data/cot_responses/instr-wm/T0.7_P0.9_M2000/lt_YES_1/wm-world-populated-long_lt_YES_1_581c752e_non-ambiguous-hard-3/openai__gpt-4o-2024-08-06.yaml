      west of Nadvirna, we need to identify the geographical locations of both places.


      1. Llangollen is a town in Wales, which is part of the United Kingdom. It is
      situated in the northern part of Wales.


      2. Nadvirna (also spelled Nadvirna or Nadvirna) is a town in Ukraine, located
      in the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast in the western part of the country.


      Now, let''s consider the relative positions:


      - The United Kingdom, where Llangollen is located, is situated to the west of
      mainland Europe.

      - Ukraine, where Nadvirna is located, is further east in Europe.


      Based on the general geographical positions of the UK (specifically Wales) and
      Ukraine:


      Llangollen is indeed west of Nadvirna.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      of both places:


      1. **Location of Phalut**: Phalut is a mountain peak located in the Singalila
      Ridge in the Himalayas, in the Darjeeling district of West Bengal, India. It
      is near the border of Nepal and is part of the Singalila National Park.


      2. **Location of Putuo District, Zhoushan**: Putuo District is part of Zhoushan
      City in Zhejiang Province, China. It is located on Zhoushan Island, which is
      part of an archipelago off the eastern coast of China.
