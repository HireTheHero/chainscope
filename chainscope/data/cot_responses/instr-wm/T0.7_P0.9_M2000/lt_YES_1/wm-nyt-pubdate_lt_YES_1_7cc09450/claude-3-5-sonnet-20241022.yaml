      April 19, 2013

      - "Shrinking Europe Military Spending Stirs Concern" was published on April

      - "Italians Have a New Tool to Unearth Tax Cheats" was published on March 8,
      2008

      - "Dozens Die in Attack on Police in Iraqi City" was published on March 23,
      2008


      2. Now let me compare the dates:

      - March 8 comes before March 23 in the same year (2008)

      - Therefore, the Italian tax article was published earlier


      3. The question asks if the Italian tax article was published earlier, so since
      it was published on March 8 compared to March 23, that''s true.


      NO: The Italian tax article was published earlier (March 8) than the Iraqi police

    fd381c52-e2f7-4c11-b4d5-4a5d51a6ff50: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. Let me find the publication dates:

      - "Syrian Opposition Joins Meeting of Arab League" was published on March 26,
      2013

      - "Caroline Kennedy Is Seen as Likely Choice for Japan Envoy" was published
      on April 1, 2013


      2. Comparing the dates:

      - March 26, 2013 comes before April 1, 2013


      3. Since the Syrian Opposition article (March 26) was published before the Caroline
      Kennedy article (April 1), the answer is:


      YES'
