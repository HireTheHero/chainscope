      Syrian Opposition article was published earlier, and NO if the Caroline Kennedy
      article was published earlier.

      both articles to determine their publication dates.  Since they are NYT articles,
      searching the NYT archive is the best approach.


      2. **Identify Publication Dates:** Once located, I need to find the date each
      article was published.


      3. **Compare Dates:**  Finally, I''ll compare the dates to see which was published
      earlier.


      * "Syrian Opposition Joins Meeting of Arab League" was published November 12,
      2011.

      * "Caroline Kennedy Is Seen as Likely Choice for Japan Envoy" was published
      July 25, 2013.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.
