      \ Meeting of Arab League.\""
    48d038fd-af92-47ae-be54-fe5cc3375be5: 'Step-by-step reasoning:


      1. "Lawmaker Says Britons Agree to New Press Rules After Hacking Scandal" refers
      to the aftermath of the UK phone hacking scandal, which peaked around 2011-2012.
      The legislative responses and public debates occurred primarily around 2012-2013.


      2. "Syrian Opposition Joins Meeting of Arab League" involves events related
      to the Syrian civil war, specifically the Syrian opposition gaining international
      recognition. The Syrian opposition first attended an Arab League summit officially
      in March 2013.


      3. Since the Syrian opposition officially joined an Arab League meeting in March
      2013, we need to consider whether the UK press regulation article appeared before
      or after this time frame.


      4. The UK press regulation reforms after the hacking scandal were actively discussed
      and agreed upon around March 2013 as well. Specifically, the Royal Charter on
      press regulation in the UK was agreed upon in March 2013 (mid-March).


      5. Checking historical context carefully: the Arab League summit where the Syrian
      opposition took a seat was in late March 2013 (March 26, 2013). The UK''s decision
      and announcement regarding new press rules after the hacking scandal happened
      around mid-March 2013 (approximately March 18, 2013).


      6. Thus, "Lawmaker Says Britons Agree to New Press Rules After Hacking Scandal"
      is indeed published earlier than "Syrian Opposition Joins Meeting of Arab League."


      Final Answer: YES'
    5a330d44-76d4-4caa-b453-27b345e1d24e: 'Step 1: Identify the two articles clearly:

      - Article A: "Lawmaker Says Britons Agree to New Press Rules After Hacking Scandal."

      - Article B: "Syrian Opposition Joins Meeting of Arab League."


      Step 2: Consider the historical context:

      - The article about Britons agreeing to new press rules is likely related to
      the UK''s phone hacking scandal involving the News of the World, primarily in
      the early 2010s (around 2011-2013).

      - The article about the Syrian opposition joining an Arab League meeting would
      likely be linked to events during the Syrian civil war, which intensified around
      the same period (2011 onwards).


      Step 3: Establish chronological order based on historical events:

      - The UK''s phone hacking scandal and subsequent press regulation discussions
      peaked around 2011-2013.

      - The Syrian opposition''s recognition and involvement with the Arab League
      occurred around late 2012 or early 2013, when the Arab League recognized the
      Syrian opposition coalition as legitimate representatives.


      Step 4: Compare likely publication timelines:

      - The UK press regulation article ("Lawmaker Says Britons Agree to New Press
      Rules After Hacking Scandal") likely relates to the Leveson Inquiry aftermath,
      which concluded around late 2012.

      - The Syrian opposition joining the Arab League meeting ("Syrian Opposition
      Joins Meeting of Arab League") likely took place around March 2013, after the
      Arab League invited the Syrian opposition to take Syria''s seat.


      Step 5: Determine if Article A was published earlier than Article B:

      - Given the timeline, the press rules article (Article A) probably appeared
      around late 2012 or early 2013.

      - The Arab League meeting involving the Syrian opposition (Article B) occurred
      around March 2013.


      Therefore, it is logical to conclude that "Lawmaker Says Britons Agree to New

      - "Loss of Power in Georgia Can Bring Trial, or Worse." was published on April
      22, 2015.


      Step 2: Compare the publication dates clearly:

      April 20, 2015 (Drownings...) is earlier than April 22, 2015 (Loss of Power...).


      Step 3: Therefore, the answer to the question "Was ''Drownings Put Migration
      at Fore of European Meeting.'' published earlier than ''Loss of Power in Georgia
      Can Bring Trial, or Worse.''?" is clearly YES.

      \ to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), an event prominently covered around\
      \ early to mid-2013.\n   - \"Lawmaker Says Britons Agree to New Press Rules\
      \ After Hacking Scandal.\" refers to the aftermath of the UK phone-hacking scandal\
      \ involving News International, which culminated around 2011-2012, with press\
      \ regulation changes being widely discussed and implemented around early 2013.\n\
      \n4. Based on historical context and timing:\n   - The UK hacking scandal's\
      \ major developments and subsequent press regulations were primarily discussed\
      \ and finalized around early 2013 (March 2013).\n   - Japan's announcement of\
      \ intent to enter TPP talks also occurred around early 2013 (March 2013). The\
      \ exact timing is very close, but typically Japan's move into TPP negotiations\
      \ became internationally prominent in mid-March 2013.\n\n5. Considering the\
      \ timeline closely:\n   - \"Lawmaker Says Britons Agree to New Press Rules After\
      \ Hacking Scandal\" appeared on March 18, 2013.\n   - \"Japan Moves to Enter\
      \ Talks on Pacific Trade .\" appeared on March 15, 2013.\n\nThus, \"Japan Moves\

      1. The article titled "North Korean Leader Makes Overture to South." refers
      to North Korea reaching out diplomatically to South Korea. This event is likely
      related to a period of improved relations around 2018, when Kim Jong-un made
      overtures to South Korea ahead of their summit.


      2. The article titled "With U.S. Set to Leave Afghanistan, Echoes of 1989."
      clearly references the United States'' plans to withdraw from Afghanistan. The
      formal withdrawal and the related discussions occurred around 2021.
