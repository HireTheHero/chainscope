      1. First, I need to identify both places:

      - Tumacacori is a very small unincorporated community and historic site in Santa
      Cruz County, Arizona, USA

      - Cetara is a town in the province of Salerno, Campania region, Italy


      2. Looking at their characteristics:

      - Tumacacori is essentially just a historic site with a few buildings and structures
      around the Tumacacori National Historical Park

      - Cetara is a proper town on the Amalfi Coast with a defined municipal area
      of approximately 5 square kilometers


      3. Comparing them:

      - Tumacacori''s developed area is extremely small, consisting mainly of the

      - Puster Valley (Pustertal) is a valley in the Alps, located between Italy and
      Austria

      - County Kilkenny is a county in Ireland


      2. Let me find their approximate areas:

      - Puster Valley is approximately 100 km long and averages about 2-3 km wide

      - This would make Puster Valley roughly 200-300 square kilometers

      - County Kilkenny has an area of 2,073 square kilometers


      3. Comparing the areas:

      - Puster Valley: ~200-300 sq km

      - Puster Valley, being an alpine valley, is much narrower than that

      - Alpine valleys typically range from 1-5 km in width
