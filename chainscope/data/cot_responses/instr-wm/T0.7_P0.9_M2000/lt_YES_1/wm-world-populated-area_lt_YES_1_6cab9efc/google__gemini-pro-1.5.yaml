      Merah is a planning area and residential town within Bedok, Singapore.  Planning
      areas are subdivisions of Singapore, not independent entities with their own
      reported area.  Therefore, we need to look at Bedok.  While precise area figures
      for districts within Bedok are hard to come by, it''s clear Tanah Merah is a
      *part* of Bedok, and thus smaller.


      2. **Find the area of Jeff Davis County, Georgia.**  Jeff Davis County is a
      US county.  These have clearly defined areas.  A quick search shows its area
      is approximately 258 square miles.


      3. **Compare the areas.**  Since Tanah Merah is *part* of Bedok, and Bedok is
      part of a small island nation, it''s highly probable that even Bedok itself
      is smaller than a US county.  Therefore, Tanah Merah, a district *within* Bedok,
      will undoubtedly be smaller than Jeff Davis County.

    9f08d592-601f-4c84-b1ca-5e7bf6508417: '1. **Find the area of Madison Park, Baltimore:**
      This information is difficult to find precisely without more context (is it
      a neighborhood, a specific park?).  A general search suggests it''s a neighborhood.
      Neighborhoods don''t have officially defined areas.


      2. **Find the area of Bethune, Colorado:**  Bethune is a town.  Town areas are
      usually officially defined.  A search reveals Bethune, Colorado has an area
      of about 0.1 square miles.


      3. **Compare the areas:** Since we can''t definitively find the area of Madison
      Park, a direct comparison is impossible.  However, neighborhoods are generally
      larger than a town with an area of only 0.1 square miles.


      Therefore, the answer is likely **NO**.

    a27832fb-1319-47ca-b430-e468020ba375: '1. **Find the area of Madison Park, Baltimore:**  This
      requires an online search.  Madison Park appears to be a neighborhood, and neighborhoods
      don''t have officially defined areas. Therefore, determining a precise area
      is difficult.


      2. **Find the area of Bethune, Colorado:** This also requires an online search.
      Bethune is a small town, and towns *do* have officially defined areas.


      3. **Compare the areas:** Since Madison Park''s area is difficult to define
      precisely, and Bethune has a defined area (even if small), it''s highly probable
      that a specifically defined area (Bethune) is larger than a vaguely defined,
      or larger neighborhood area.


      **Answer:** YES

    f803e310-3ddf-4539-b113-194eccb823a3: '1. **Identify the locations:** We need
      to find information about Madison Park, Baltimore (Maryland) and Bethune, Colorado.

      2. **Determine the type of place:**  Both are likely neighborhoods or small
      communities.  We need to confirm this to be sure we are comparing like entities
      (e.g., not a park vs. a town).

      3. **Find area data:**  We need to look for official sources or reliable estimates
      of the area of each place.

      4. **Compare the areas:** Once we have numerical data for the areas, we can
      compare them to determine which is smaller.


      Since I don''t have access to real-time information, including geographic databases,
      I cannot perform steps 2-4. Therefore, I cannot definitively answer YES or NO.  I
      would need to research the size of both locations to provide an accurate answer.

      are used for population statistics, and their boundaries can be somewhat fluid.  However,
      it''s clear from descriptions and maps that Berry Creek covers a much smaller
      area than Achill Island.  We can infer this from its population (around 1,200)
      and its designation as a small, unincorporated community.

    0e0674b6-bf18-429b-8037-89e5744d0e6b: '1. **Find the area of Tugela Ferry:**  Tugela
      Ferry is a town in South Africa.  Towns generally don''t have formally defined
      areas in the same way a municipality or county might. We need to look for the
      area of a surrounding region or municipality if precise area is required.


      2. **Find the area of Bettles, Alaska:**  Bettles is a small city in Alaska.  Similarly,
      small cities often don''t have clearly defined incorporated areas readily available.
      We would need to look for the area of the Bettles Census Designated Place (CDP)
      or a surrounding borough if precise area is needed.


      3. **Comparing areas is difficult:** Since finding definitive areas for small
      towns and cities can be challenging, a direct comparison is difficult without
      more information.  We can''t rely on general assumptions about South African
      towns versus Alaskan cities.


      4. **Consider practical size:**  If we consider the general built-up area or
      population as a proxy for size, Bettles is a very small, remote Alaskan village.
      Tugela Ferry, while not a large town, likely has a larger population and built-up
      area than Bettles.



      Therefore, based on the reasoning that Tugela Ferry likely has a more extensive
      built-up area and larger population than the very small and remote Bettles,
      Alaska, the answer is likely NO.

      2. **Find the area of Bettles, Alaska:** Bettles is also a small town.  However,
      Alaskan towns, even small ones, often have larger incorporated areas due to
      lower population density and different land management practices.  Finding a
      precise area for Bettles is also challenging, but it''s likely larger than a
      typical small town elsewhere.


      3. **Compare the areas:** While precise figures are hard to come by, the general
      understanding of the nature of these towns suggests Bettles is likely larger
      in area than Tugela Ferry.

      we can compare them to answer the question.


      Unfortunately, finding reliable area data for small towns like these proves
      difficult.  Many online sources focus on population rather than land area.  Without

      centered around the airport. Tugela Ferry, while still small, appears to serve
      a larger surrounding area in South Africa.


      Based on available, albeit limited information, I would tentatively say **YES**,
      Tugela Ferry likely has a smaller *developed* area than the area encompassing
      Bettles, Alaska (which includes wilderness).  However, the area *served* by
      Tugela Ferry (i.e., its functional region) is likely larger. Because the question

      4. **Conclusion:** Based on the nature of a small town versus a small city,
      even without precise area measurements, it''s highly probable Tugela Ferry has
      a smaller area.

      precise boundaries for unincorporated communities can be fuzzy, we can reasonably
      assume we''re talking about the general area they occupy.


      4. **Reasoning**:  Even small census-designated places typically have a defined
      area for census purposes, which would likely be larger than a very small, unincorporated
      community.


      5. **Conclusion**: Verd likely has a smaller area than Steinhatchee.

    1811fa14-2b0d-41ef-9621-009ae421f081: '1. **Identify Ballenger Creek:** Ballenger
      Creek is an unincorporated community within Frederick County, Maryland, USA.  Unincorporated
      communities generally don''t have formally defined boundaries or official areas.

      2. **Identify Avarua:** Avarua is the capital of the Cook Islands, an island
      country in the South Pacific Ocean.  Capital cities typically have a defined
      area, though it might be within a larger metropolitan area.

      3. **Compare areas:**  Since Ballenger Creek doesn''t have an official area,
      it''s difficult to compare directly.  However, even a generous estimate of the
      area covered by the community of Ballenger Creek would likely be smaller than
      the area encompassed by the capital city of a country, even a small island nation.


      **Answer:** YES

    41e21174-8453-4685-acd0-5ba65ede4608: '1. **Ballenger Creek, Maryland:** This
      sounds like a small town or suburb in the US.  Therefore, its area is likely
      to be relatively small.

      2. **Avarua:** This is the capital of the Cook Islands, a nation of small islands
      in the South Pacific. While a capital city, the overall area of the islands
      is limited.

      3. **Comparison:**  While Avarua is a capital city, the Cook Islands themselves
      are small. Ballenger Creek, being part of a much larger landmass (North America),
      could be a similarly sized town or even larger.  It''s likely Avarua District
      (which includes the town of Avarua) is bigger than Ballenger Creek, Maryland,
      USA.

      Creek is a census-designated place (CDP) in Maryland, USA. Avarua is the main
      town and capital of the Cook Islands, located in the South Pacific.


      2. **Consider the nature of the locations:**  Ballenger Creek is a smaller,
      more localized area within a larger country. Avarua, while a town, serves as
      the capital of an island nation and likely encompasses a broader area.


      3. **Infer relative sizes:** Capital cities, even of small nations, generally
      encompass a larger area than a CDP within a state of a much larger country.


      4. **Conclusion:** Ballenger Creek likely has a smaller area than Avarua.

    4d80be90-b7b5-4843-8777-e8469a8221a1: '1. **Identify Ballenger Creek:** Ballenger
      Creek is a census-designated place (CDP) in Frederick County, Maryland, USA.  CDPs
      are unincorporated communities defined by the US Census Bureau for statistical
      purposes.

      2. **Identify Avarua:** Avarua is the capital of the Cook Islands, located on
      the island of Rarotonga. It''s a district, essentially a small town.

      3. **Concept of "area":**  We are comparing the physical size/area of these
      two places.

      4. **Finding area information:**  While precise area for CDPs like Ballenger
      Creek can be difficult to find quickly, it''s likely small, covering a few square
      miles at most. Avarua, as a district/town on a small island, is also likely
      to have a small area.  However, island districts often encompass more area than
      small, defined CDPs in the US.

      5. **Comparison:** Intuitively, a district encompassing a significant part of
      a small island is likely to be larger than a small, defined community within
      a US county.


      **NO.** (Ballenger Creek likely has a smaller area than Avarua)

      sounds like a small town or suburb within the United States.  Therefore, its
      area is likely relatively small.


      2. **Avarua:** This is the capital of the Cook Islands, a self-governing island
      country in the South Pacific Ocean in free association with New Zealand.  Capital
      cities often encompass a significant portion of a small country''s populated
      area.


      3. **Comparison:** Comparing a likely small town/suburb in the US to a capital
      city of an island nation suggests Avarua is probably larger in area.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

      2. **Determine what "area" refers to:**  This likely refers to land area or
      some measure of size related to the place.  We are looking for whether Ballenger
      Creek is *smaller* than Avarua.

      3. **Research the areas (if possible):**  Finding definitive area measurements
      for smaller places like Ballenger Creek can be difficult. Avarua is the capital
      of the Cook Islands, so information should be easier to find.

      4. **Compare the areas:**  Ballenger Creek is a census-designated place (CDP)
      which is a statistical area, not a legally incorporated area with official boundaries.
      Avarua is a district encompassing the capital of the Cook Islands, Rarotonga.  A
      district is a much larger designation than a CDP.


      Therefore, it''s highly probable Ballenger Creek has a smaller area than Avarua.

      Unfortunately, finding reliable area figures for both Quetta (city proper) and

      results.  Many results give the area of the Quetta *district*, which is much
      larger than the city itself. Severo-Kurilsky District also presents challenges
      due to its remote location and varying reports.


      However, based on the general principle that cities are smaller than districts
      encompassing larger regions (including rural areas), and given the remote, sparsely
      populated nature of the Severo-Kurilsky District, it''s highly *probable* that
      Quetta city has a smaller area.


      Therefore, my answer is **YES**.

      need to compare their areas.


      2. **Determine what "area" refers to:**  Area likely refers to the geographic
      size, either of a city/town/village or some administrative region.


      3. **Find area information:**  This requires looking up the area of both Versailles,
      Pennsylvania and Patratu, Jharkhand.  This information may be difficult to find
      precisely depending on how the "area" is defined (city limits, metropolitan
      area, etc.).  However, generally speaking, Indian cities and towns tend to encompass
      a larger area compared to similarly populated places in the United States, especially
      smaller towns.  Versailles, PA is a borough (a small incorporated municipality)
      while Patratu in India is a census town and also has a thermal power station
      associated with it, which likely covers a larger area.


      4. **Compare the areas:** Even without precise numbers, given the general size
      difference between similarly populated settlements in the US vs. India, and
      the fact that Patratu has an industrial presence associated with it, it''s highly
      likely Patratu has a larger area.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.
