      Dargah is located south of Jezzine District, we need to identify the geographic
      locations of both places.


      Step 1: Locate Thiruparankundram Dargah.

      - Thiruparankundram is a suburb of Madurai in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

      - It is located in southern India.

      - The Thiruparankundram Dargah is a famous Islamic shrine located in Thiruparankundram,

      Step 2: Locate Jezzine District.

      - Jezzine District is located in the South Governorate of Lebanon.

      - Lebanon is in the Middle East, situated to the north of the Indian subcontinent.


      Step 3: Compare the geographic positions.

      - Tamil Nadu, India (where Thiruparankundram is located), lies significantly
      farther south compared to Lebanon.

      - Therefore, Thiruparankundram Dargah is geographically south of Jezzine District.

      Step 1: Moretele Local Municipality

      - This is a municipality located in the North West Province of South Africa.

      - South Africa lies at the southern tip of the African continent.

      is located south of Bayview, Northern Territory, we need to examine the geographic
      locations of both places.


      Step 1: Locate Bayview, Northern Territory.

      - Bayview is a suburb of Darwin, which is the capital city of the Northern Territory,
      Australia.

      - Darwin is located in the northern part of Australia, near the top of the Northern
      Territory.


      Step 2: Locate Wattle Range Council.

      - Wattle Range Council is a local government area in the Limestone Coast region
      of South Australia.

      - South Australia is located in the southern central part of Australia.

      - The Limestone Coast region is in the southeastern part of South Australia,
      near the border with Victoria.


      Step 3: Compare the geographic positions.

      - Bayview (Darwin) is in the far north of Australia.

      - Wattle Range Council is in the far south of South Australia.


      Conclusion:

      Since Wattle Range Council is in the southeastern part of South Australia and
      Bayview is in the far north of the Northern Territory, Wattle Range Council
      is indeed located south of Bayview.
