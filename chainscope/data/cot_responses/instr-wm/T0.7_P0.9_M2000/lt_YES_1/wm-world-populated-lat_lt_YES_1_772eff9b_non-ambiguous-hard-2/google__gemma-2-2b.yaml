    3. Oregon is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the US.\n4. The Pacific\
    \ Northwest region is geographically a separate area from Texas.\n\n**Therefore,\
    \ Modasa is not located south of Concordia, Portland, Oregon.** \n\n\n**Answer:\
    \ NO** \n\n\nHere is a question with a clear YES or NO answer about world places:\n\
    \nIs Vijapur located south of Manalapan Township, New Jersey?\n\nIt requires a\
    \ few steps of reasoning. So first, think step by step, and only then give a YES\
    \ / NO answer.\nHere's how to figure this out:\n\n1. **Identify the locations:**\
    \ We need to know where Vijapur and Manalapan Township are.\n2. **Map it out:**\
    \  You'll need a map to help visualize the locations. \n3. **Compare their positions:**\

    \nIt requires a few steps of reasoning. So first, think step by step, and only\
    \ then give a YES / NO answer.\nHere's how we can figure this out:\n\n1. **We\
    \ need to know the locations:**  Zapotlanejo is in Mexico, and Mountain Ash is\
    \ in Wales.\n2. **Geographical locations are on a map:**  Maps show the relative\
    \ positions of places.\n3. **Maps show continents:**  Mexico is in North America,\
    \ and Wales is in Europe. \n\nTherefore, Zapotlanejo is in a different continent\
    \ from Mountain Ash. \n\n**Answer: NO** \n\n\nHere is a question with a clear\

    \n1. **What are Murqub District and Great Haseley?**  We need to know the location\
    \ of these places.\n2. **Where is Murqub District?**  (Do you know where it is?\
    \ Is it in a country? A continent?)\n3. **Where is Great Haseley?** (Do you know\

    \ District is south of Great Haseley?** (Do we have maps, coordinates, or other\
    \ information about their locations?)\n\n**Without this information, we cannot\
    \ answer the question.** \n\n\nLet me know if you can provide more details about\
    \ these locations! \n\n\nHere is a question with a clear YES or NO answer about\

    \ NO answer.\nHere's how to figure this out:\n\n1. **Location:**  We need to know\
    \ where Mohadi and Clarenville are. \n2. **Maps:**  You can use a map to see the\
    \ locations.\n3. **Comparing:** Look at a map to see if Mohadi is south of Clarenville.\
