      Step 1: Identify where Yongkang District is located.

      Yongkang District is in Tainan City, Taiwan, which is in East Asia.


      Step 2: Identify where Clarence, Missouri is located.

      Clarence is a city in Missouri, which is a state in the central United States.


      Step 3: Compare their global positions.

      Taiwan is located in the northern hemisphere, but is much closer to the equator
      than Missouri. Taiwan is approximately between 22-25 degrees north latitude.

      Missouri is also in the northern hemisphere, but much further north, approximately
      between 36-40 degrees north latitude.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Yongkang District (in Taiwan) is at a lower latitude (closer to the equator)
      than Clarence, Missouri, it is located south of Clarence, Missouri on a global
      scale.

      of Wattle Range Council and Bayview, Northern Territory in Australia.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Wattle Range Council.

      Wattle Range Council is a local government area in South Australia, located
      in the southeastern part of the state, near the border with Victoria.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Bayview, Northern Territory.

      Bayview is a suburb located in Darwin, which is in the far northern part of
      the Northern Territory.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      South Australia is located in the southern part of Australia, while the Northern
      Territory is in the northern part of Australia. Darwin (where Bayview is located)
      is at the northernmost part of the Northern Territory, near the coast facing
      the Timor Sea.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since South Australia is south of the Northern Territory, and Wattle Range Council
      is in South Australia while Bayview is in the Northern Territory, Wattle Range
      Council must be south of Bayview.


      YES, Wattle Range Council is located south of Bayview, Northern Territory.'

      Wattle Range Council is a local government area in South Australia, located
      in the southeastern part of the state, near the border with Victoria.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Bayview, Northern Territory.

      Bayview is a suburb located in the Northern Territory of Australia, near Darwin
      in the northern part of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Northern Territory is in the northern part of Australia, while South Australia
      is in the southern part of the country. Specifically, Darwin and surrounding
      areas (including Bayview) are in the tropical far north of Australia.


      South Australia, where Wattle Range Council is located, is much further south
      on the Australian continent.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion about their relative positions.

      Since Wattle Range Council is in South Australia (a southern state) and Bayview
      is in the Northern Territory (the northernmost major territory), Wattle Range
      Council is definitely located south of Bayview.


      YES'

      Step 1: Let me identify where Beaufort, Victoria is located.

      Beaufort is a town in Victoria, Australia. Victoria is the southernmost mainland
      state of Australia, located in the southern hemisphere.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Malabo is located.

      Malabo is the capital city of Equatorial Guinea, a country in Central Africa.
      Malabo is located on Bioko Island in the Gulf of Guinea, very close to the equator
      in the northern hemisphere.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Beaufort, Victoria is in the southern hemisphere (negative latitude)

      - Malabo is just north of the equator in the northern hemisphere (positive latitude)


      Step 4: Determine which is further south.

      Since Beaufort is in the southern hemisphere and Malabo is in the northern hemisphere,
      Beaufort must be south of Malabo. Any location in the southern hemisphere is
      south of any location in the northern hemisphere.


      NO


      Wait, I made an error in my final answer. The question asks if Beaufort is south
      of Malabo, which is true based on my reasoning. The correct answer is:


      YES'

      of Birur and ''s-Graveland to answer this question.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - ''s-Graveland is a village in the Netherlands, located in the province of
      North Holland.

      - Birur is a town in Karnataka state in southern India.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      - The Netherlands is located in Western Europe, roughly between 50-53 degrees
      North latitude.

      - Karnataka, India is located in South Asia, roughly between 12-18 degrees North
      latitude.


      Step 3: Determine which is further south.

      - Since Birur is in southern India (closer to the equator), it has a lower latitude
      (around 13-14 degrees North) than ''s-Graveland in the Netherlands (around 52
      degrees North).

      - Lower latitude in the Northern Hemisphere means further south.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion.

      - Birur is at a lower latitude than ''s-Graveland, meaning it is further south.


      NO, Birur is NOT located south of ''s-Graveland. Rather, Birur is located south
      OF ''s-Graveland.


      Wait, I made an error in my conclusion. Let me correct myself:


      YES, Birur is located south of ''s-Graveland.'

      The Netherlands is in Europe, while India is in Asia. Geographically, India
      is located southeast of Europe. Specifically, Madhya Pradesh in central India
      is significantly south of any location in the Netherlands.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Antri is in India (Madhya Pradesh) and Uden is in the Netherlands, and
      India is south of the Netherlands, Antri is indeed south of Uden.


      Answer: YES'

      - Jubb al-Safa (also spelled Jubb as-Safa) is a town in Syria, located in the
      Middle East.


      Step 3: Compare the global positions.

      - Syria is in the Middle East, which is southeast of the United Kingdom.

      - Specifically, Syria is south and east of England.


      Step 4: Make the directional determination.

      - Since Syria (where Jubb al-Safa is located) is south of England (where Crewe
      is located), Jubb al-Safa is indeed south of Crewe.


      NO.


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me correct myself:


      Since Syria (where Jubb al-Safa is located) is south and east of England (where
      Crewe is located), Jubb al-Safa is indeed south of Crewe.

      of Crumpsall.


      Step 1: Identify Crumpsall.

      Crumpsall is an area in north Manchester, England, UK.


      Step 2: Identify Zira''a.

      I need to search for a place called "Zira''a". Based on my knowledge, Zira''a
      (or Zir''a) appears to be a location in the Middle East, likely in countries
      such as Syria, Jordan, or Palestine. The term may also refer to agricultural
      areas, as "zira''a" relates to agriculture or farming in Arabic.


      Step 3: Compare their geographic positions.

      The Middle East (where Zira''a would be located) is south of England (where
      Crumpsall is located). England is in northern Europe, while the Middle East
      countries are located in southwest Asia/northern Africa.


      Step 4: Determine the north-south relationship.

      Since Crumpsall is in northern England, and Zira''a would be in the Middle East,
      Zira''a would be south of Crumpsall on a world map.


      NO


      Wait, I need to be more careful. I''m not completely certain about the exact
      location of "Zira''a" as there could be multiple places with this name or similar
      names. Without confirming the specific location of Zira''a, I cannot give a
      definitive answer.


      If Zira''a refers to a location in the Middle East as I initially thought, then
      YES, it would be south of Crumpsall. However, without confirming this specific
      location, I cannot provide a definitive yes or no answer.'

      might be:

      - Small localities with this name that aren''t widely documented

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Thousand Islands (Indonesia) is an archipelago in Indonesia, which is located
      in Southeast Asia.

      - Littlefield, Texas is a city in the United States, specifically in the northern
      part of Texas.


      Step 2: Determine their approximate latitudes.

      - Indonesia is located near the equator, with the Thousand Islands archipelago
      at approximately 5-6 degrees North latitude.

      - Littlefield, Texas is located at approximately 33.9 degrees North latitude.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      - Places with lower latitude numbers are closer to the equator.

      - Places south of the equator have negative latitude numbers.

      - Since Thousand Islands (Indonesia) is at around 5-6 degrees North and Littlefield,
      Texas is at around 33.9 degrees North, Thousand Islands is closer to the equator.

      - Since both are in the Northern Hemisphere but Thousand Islands is closer to
      the equator, Thousand Islands is south of Littlefield, Texas.


      YES, Thousand Islands (Indonesia) is located south of Littlefield, Texas.'
