      2. **Odintsovsky District** is located in Russia, specifically in the Moscow
      Oblast, which is to the west of Moscow.

      - India is generally located south of Russia.

      - Madhya Pradesh, being in central India, is certainly south of Moscow Oblast
      in Russia.


      Given this information, Bhedaghat, which is in Madhya Pradesh, India, is located
      south of Odintsovsky District, Russia.

      \ so there might be some ambiguity unless it's a local or less-known place.\n\
      \n2. **Determine the geographic coordinates or relative positions**:\n   - For\
      \ the purpose of this question, let's assume Koltur is in a specific region\
      \ known to you (since it's not a widely known place, this assumption is necessary).\n\
      \n3. **Compare the latitude**:\n   - Typically, to determine if one place is\
      \ south of another, you compare their latitudes. The place with a lower latitude\
      \ number (closer to the equator) is further south.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n \
      \  - Without specific latitude data for Koltur, it's challenging to make a definitive\
      \ determination. However, if Koltur is indeed a place known to be north of Uri\
      \ based on your context or assumption, then Uri would be south of Koltur.\n\n\
      Given the lack of specific information about Koltur, it's important to base\
      \ the answer on known data or assumptions about its location. If Koltur is indeed\
      \ north of Uri based on your knowledge or assumptions, then the answer would\
      \ be YES, Uri is south of Koltur. Otherwise, without specific coordinates, a\
      \ definitive YES or NO is not possible."

      part of England.

      - Zira''a is also in the northern hemisphere but is located further south than
      Crumpsall, as Jordan is in the Middle East.
