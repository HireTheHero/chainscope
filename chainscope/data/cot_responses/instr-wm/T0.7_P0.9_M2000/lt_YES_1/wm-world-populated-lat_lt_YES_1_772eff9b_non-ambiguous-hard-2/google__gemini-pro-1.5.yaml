      further west than Rutland Island.


      3. **Compare Latitudes:**  Since both locations are in the Northern Hemisphere,
      the location further south will have a lower latitude. To determine which is
      south, we need to compare their latitudes.  While I don''t have the exact coordinates
      memorized, I know that the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are much closer to the
      equator than Italy.


      4. **Conclusion:** Rutland Island is significantly closer to the equator (lower
      latitude) than Vicovaro. Therefore, Rutland Island is south of Vicovaro.

      is in the state of Assam, India.  This places it in Asia.


      2. **Locate Velika Planina:** Velika Planina is a mountain plateau in Slovenia.
      This places it in Europe.


      3. **Relative Locations of Asia and Europe:** Asia is generally east and southeast
      of Europe.  While there might be slight overlaps in latitude depending on the
      specific locations within these continents, the overall directional relationship
      is clear.


      4. **South Implies Latitude:**  The question asks if Dibrugarh is *south* of
      Velika Planina, meaning at a lower latitude.  Given Asia''s position relative
      to Europe, it''s highly unlikely a location in Asia would be south of a location
      in Europe.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.
