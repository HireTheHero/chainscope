      1. First, I''ll locate Monte Grande:

      - Monte Grande is a location in Argentina, located in the Buenos Aires province


      2. Next, I''ll locate Nuku Hiva:

      - Nuku Hiva is an island in French Polynesia, located in the Pacific Ocean,
      specifically in the Marquesas Islands


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Monte Grande is in the Southern Hemisphere (Argentina)

      - Nuku Hiva is also in the Southern Hemisphere (in the South Pacific)


      4. Determining their relative north-south position:

      - Nuku Hiva is located around 8-9 degrees south latitude

      - Monte Grande is located around 35 degrees south latitude

      - This means Monte Grande is further south than Nuku Hiva

    52a383c3-8364-4932-8084-9b2a792580bb: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I recognize Amethi as a district in Uttar Pradesh, India.


      2. Bitterley is a village in Shropshire, England.


      3. These are locations on different continents - India and the United Kingdom.


      4. To determine if one is south of the other, I need to check their geographical
      positions.


      5. India is located in the southern part of Asia, while the United Kingdom is
      in northern Europe.


      6. More specifically, Amethi is in north-central India, and Bitterley is in
      western England.


      7. From a global perspective, Amethi is actually located NORTH of Bitterley,
      not south.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'
