      ### Step 1: Identify location types

      - **76031 (Cleburne, TX)** is a rural/suburban area.

      - **24504 (Lynchburg, VA)** includes part of the city of Lynchburg, which is
      more urban.


      ### Step 2: Population and land area estimates

      - **76031 (Texas)** has a relatively small population spread over a large rural
      area.

      - **24504 (Virginia)** covers part of Lynchburg, which is more urbanized and
      compact.

      - Urban areas tend to have higher population densities than rural or suburban
      areas.

      - Given that 24504 is in a city and 76031 is in a more rural setting, it is

      \ 64129** is in Kansas City, Missouri.  \n- **ZIP code 03246** includes Laconia,\
      \ New Hampshire, and surrounding areas.\n\n### Step 2: Consider Population Density\
      \ Factors  \nPopulation density is the number of people per square mile. To\
      \ determine which ZIP code is less densely populated, we need to compare their\
      \ population densities.\n\n- **64129 (Kansas City, MO)**:  \n  - This ZIP code\
      \ includes parts of the eastern side of Kansas City, which has industrial areas,\
      \ sports stadiums, and some residential neighborhoods.  \n  - Kansas City is\
      \ a relatively large urban area, but 64129 itself is not among the most densely\
      \ populated ZIP codes in the city.  \n\n- **03246 (Laconia, NH)**:  \n  - Laconia\

      \ near Lake Winnipesaukee.  \n  - The region has a mix of urban and rural areas,\
      \ with some seasonal population fluctuations due to tourism.\n\n### Step 3:\
      \ Compare Population Densities  \n- **Kansas City (64129)**: Likely has a lower\
      \ population density than downtown Kansas City but still part of an urban area.\
      \  \n- **Laconia (03246)**: A small city, but likely more concentrated in certain\
      \ areas.\n\n### Step 4: Find Available Data  \n- Estimates suggest that **64129\

      \ includes large undeveloped or industrial spaces.  \n- **03246 has a higher\

      \  \n   - ZIP code 50013 is located in Iowa, a state known for lower population\
      \ density overall.  \n   - ZIP code 02746 is in Massachusetts, which is generally\
      \ more densely populated, especially in urban areas.\n\n2. **Specific ZIP Code\
      \ Characteristics**  \n   - ZIP code 50013 is associated with Ames, IA, which\
      \ is primarily home to Iowa State University. However, this ZIP code is not\
      \ commonly listed among major residential ZIP codes, suggesting it may serve\
      \ a more specialized purpose (e.g., a university PO box zone).  \n   - ZIP code\
      \ 02746 is in New Bedford, MA, a historically industrial and densely populated\
      \ urban area.\n\n3. **Comparing Density**  \n   - New Bedford is a city with\
      \ high population density, meaning 02746 is likely to have a high number of\
      \ residents per square mile.  \n   - Ames, while a college town, does not generally\
      \ have the same level of urban density as New Bedford. If 50013 is primarily\
      \ a university-associated ZIP, it likely has fewer residents and lower density.\n\
      \n### Conclusion:  \nSince New Bedford (02746) is an urban area with high population\

      Illinois is less densely populated than ZIP code 03842 in New Hampshire, we
      need to compare their population densities. Population density is typically
      measured as people per square mile.


      ### Step 1: Identify the locations

      - **ZIP code 60404** is in Illinois, covering parts of Shorewood and surrounding
      areas.

      - **ZIP code 03842** is in New Hampshire, primarily covering Hampton, a coastal
      town.


      ### Step 2: Consider population and area

      - **60404 (Shorewood, IL)**: This is a suburban area with a mix of residential
      neighborhoods and open spaces.

      - **03842 (Hampton, NH)**: This includes Hampton Beach, a popular tourist destination
      with a relatively dense residential area along the coast.


      ### Step 3: Check density trends

      - Coastal towns like Hampton (03842) tend to have higher population densities
      due to limited land area and higher residential concentration.

      - Shorewood (60404) is more suburban and spread out, suggesting a lower density.


      ### Step 4: Verify with approximate data

      - **03842 (Hampton, NH)** has a population of around **15,000 people** in an
      area of roughly **5-6 square miles**, yielding a density of around **2,500-3,000
      people per square mile**.

      - **60404 (Shorewood, IL)** has a population of around **20,000 people** in
      an area of roughly **16-17 square miles**, yielding a density of around **1,200-1,500
      people per square mile**.


      ### Conclusion:

      Since 03842 has a higher population density than 60404, the answer to the question
      is:


      **YES**, 60404 is less densely populated than 03842.'

      ### Step 1: Identify Relevant Locations

      - **88310** is associated with Alamogordo, New Mexico.

      - **40336** is associated with Irvine, Kentucky.


      ### Step 2: Consider Population and Area

      - **88310 (Alamogordo, NM)**: Alamogordo is located in Otero County, New Mexico.
      This region includes a mix of urban and rural areas, with significant open space.

      - **40336 (Irvine, KY)**: Irvine is in Estill County, Kentucky, which is a small
      town in a more densely populated state compared to New Mexico.


      ### Step 3: Compare Population Densities

      - New Mexico, in general, has large, sparsely populated areas, while Kentucky
      has a higher overall population density.

      - Alamogordo (88310) spans a larger area with a more spread-out population.

      - Irvine (40336) is a small town in Kentucky, a state with smaller land areas
      per ZIP code, leading to a higher density.

      their population densities. Population density is typically measured as the
      number of people per square mile.


      ### Step 1: Identify the locations

      - **36604, AL**: This ZIP code is in Mobile, Alabama.

      - **30033, GA**: This ZIP code is in the Atlanta metropolitan area, specifically
      in DeKalb County, Georgia.


      ### Step 2: Consider general population density trends

      - **Mobile, AL** (where 36604 is located) has some urban areas but is generally
      less dense than the Atlanta metro.

      - **DeKalb County, GA** (where 30033 is located) is part of the densely populated
      Atlanta metropolitan area.


      ### Step 3: Look up approximate population densities

      - **36604, AL**: Mobile is less dense, and this ZIP code has a mix of residential
      and commercial areas.

      - **30033, GA**: This area includes parts of Decatur and other suburban areas

      ### Step 1: Identify the locations

      - **91911** is in **Chula Vista, California**, which is part of the San Diego
      metropolitan area.

      - **55805** is in **Duluth, Minnesota**, a city in northeastern Minnesota.


      ### Step 2: Population and Area Data

      - **91911 (Chula Vista, CA)**: This ZIP code covers a relatively urban and suburban
      area in Southern California. Chula Vista is known for its high population density.

      - **55805 (Duluth, MN)**: This ZIP code covers part of Duluth, which is a smaller
      city compared to Chula Vista and generally has lower population density.


      ### Step 3: Compare Population Density

      - Chula Vista, being part of the greater San Diego area, has significantly higher
      population density compared to Duluth.

      - Duluth, while a city, is much less dense in general than urban Southern California
      areas.

      - **84043** corresponds to Lehi, Utah.

      - **37909** corresponds to Knoxville, Tennessee.


      ### Step 2: Consider population and area

      - **Lehi, UT (84043)** is a rapidly growing suburban area in Utah County, with
      a mix of residential and open spaces.

      - **Knoxville, TN (37909)** is an urban ZIP code in Knoxville, which is a moderately
      dense city.


      ### Step 3: Compare population density

      - **Population density** is calculated as **population divided by land area**.

      - Lehi (84043) has experienced significant suburban growth, but western states
      generally have lower population densities than urban areas in the eastern U.S.

      - Knoxville (37909) is part of a city with established urban infrastructure,
