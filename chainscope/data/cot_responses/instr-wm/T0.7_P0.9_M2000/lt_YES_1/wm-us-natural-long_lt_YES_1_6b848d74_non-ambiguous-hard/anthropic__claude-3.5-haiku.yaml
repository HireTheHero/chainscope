      which is in the northeastern part of New York


      Step 3: Comparing their positions:

      - Indiana is west of New York

      - So any location in Indiana would be west of a location in New York

      - Therefore, Barbee Lake, IN is west of Adirondack Lake, NY


      Answer: YES'

      - The Bighorn Mountains are located in north-central Wyoming

      - They are in the north-central part of the state, east of the Bighorn Basin


      2. Next, locate Cross Lake near Shreveport, Louisiana:

      - Cross Lake is located just northwest of Shreveport in northwestern Louisiana


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Bighorn Mountains are in Wyoming (western United States)

      - Cross Lake is in Louisiana (southeastern United States)


      4. Determine their relative positions:

      - Wyoming is west of Louisiana

      - Bighorn Mountains are even further west within Wyoming

      - Cross Lake is in eastern Louisiana


      5. Conclusion: Since Bighorn Mountains are in Wyoming, which is west of Louisiana,
      they are definitely west of Cross Lake.

      - Montana is much further west than Texas


      4. Relative positioning:

      - Quake Lake is west of Lake Lyndon B. Johnson because it is in a more western
      state (Montana is west of Texas)


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      1. First, I''ll locate Silver Lake in the Mojave region of California

      2. Then, I''ll locate Shadow Mountain Lake in Colorado

      3. I''ll determine their relative positions geographically


      Step 1: Silver Lake (Mojave) is located in California

      - Specifically, it''s in the eastern part of California, near the Mojave Desert


      Step 2: Shadow Mountain Lake is located in Colorado

      - It''s situated in Grand County, Colorado


      Step 3: Comparing their geographical positions

      - California is west of Colorado

      - Silver Lake (Mojave) is in eastern California

      - Shadow Mountain Lake is in eastern Colorado

      - Even though they''re both in the eastern parts of their states, California
      is still west of Colorado

      2. Next, let''s locate Great Salt Plains Lake in Oklahoma

      - Great Salt Plains Lake is located in northwestern Oklahoma


      3. Now, let''s consider their relative positions

      - Montana is west of Oklahoma

      - Southwestern Montana is even further west than Oklahoma


      4. So, the question is: Is Castle Mountains west of Great Salt Plains Lake?

      - Since Montana (where Castle Mountains is located) is entirely west of Oklahoma
      (where Great Salt Plains Lake is located), the answer is YES.


      Answer: YES'
