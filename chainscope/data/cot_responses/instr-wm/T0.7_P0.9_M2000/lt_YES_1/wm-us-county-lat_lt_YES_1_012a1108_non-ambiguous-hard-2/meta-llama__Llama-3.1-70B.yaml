      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Baca County is located in the state of Colorado
      (CO), and Boundary County is located in the state of Idaho (ID).


      2. **Understand geographic positions**: Colorado is generally in the southwestern
      part of the United States, while Idaho is in the northwestern part.


      3. **Compare latitudes**: Since we are comparing "south of," we need to consider
      the latitudes of these two counties. Generally, the farther south a location
      is, the lower its latitude. Without needing the exact latitudes, we know that
      Colorado, being in the southwest, is significantly south of Idaho, which is
      in the northwest.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic positions of Colorado and
      Idaho, Baca County, CO is indeed south of Boundary County, ID.

      part of Texas, while Charles Mix County, SD is in the southeastern part of South
      Dakota. This means that Coke County is even further south than the general position
      of Texas.

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Conecuh County is located in the state of Alabama
      (AL), and Bingham County is located in the state of Idaho (ID).


      2. **Understand geographic positions**: Alabama is generally in the southeastern
      part of the United States, while Idaho is in the northwestern part.


      3. **Compare latitudes**: Since we are comparing "south of," we need to consider
      the latitudes of these two counties. Generally, the farther south a location
      is, the lower its latitude. Without needing the exact latitudes, we know that
      Alabama, being in the southeast, is significantly south of Idaho, which is in
      the northwest.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic positions of Alabama and
      Idaho, Conecuh County, AL is indeed south of Bingham County, ID.
