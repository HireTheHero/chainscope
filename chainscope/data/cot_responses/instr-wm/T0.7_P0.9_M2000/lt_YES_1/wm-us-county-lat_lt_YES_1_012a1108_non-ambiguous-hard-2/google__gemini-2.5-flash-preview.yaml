      \ positions of two specific US counties: Baca County, CO, and Boundary County,\
      \ ID.\n\n2.  **Determine the location of Baca County, CO:** Recall or look up\
      \ the location of Baca County, Colorado. Colorado is a state in the Mountain\
      \ West region of the US. Baca County is known to be located in the southeastern\
      \ corner of Colorado, bordering Oklahoma and Kansas. Its latitude is relatively\
      \ low (closer to the equator) compared to states further north.\n\n3.  **Determine\
      \ the location of Boundary County, ID:** Recall or look up the location of Boundary\
      \ County, Idaho. Idaho is also in the Mountain West region, but it extends much\
      \ further north. Boundary County is specifically located in the *northernmost*\
      \ part of Idaho, bordering Canada. Its latitude is very high (further from the\

      \n    States like Colorado are significantly south of states like Idaho, especially\
      \ the northern part of Idaho. Therefore, Baca County, being in southern Colorado,\
      \ is at a much lower latitude than Boundary County, being in northern Idaho.\n\
      \n5.  **Translate latitude comparison to north/south position:** Lower latitude\
      \ means further south. Higher latitude means further north. Since Baca County\
      \ has a much lower latitude than Boundary County, Baca County is located *south*\
      \ of Boundary County.\n\n6.  **Formulate the final answer:** The question asks\

      1.  **Identify the locations:** We need the approximate latitude of San Jacinto
      County, TX and Ogemaw County, MI.

      2.  **Find the location of San Jacinto County, TX:** San Jacinto County is in
      southeastern Texas. Texas is in the southern part of the United States.

      lower latitudes (closer to the equator, which is 0 degrees latitude). Locations
      in the northern United States have higher latitudes (further from the equator,
      closer to the North Pole). Since Texas is south of Michigan, any county in Texas
      will generally be south of any county in Michigan.

      5.  **Determine the relative position:** San Jacinto County, TX is located at
      a significantly lower latitude than Ogemaw County, MI. Lower latitude means
      further south.

      \ is a northern state in the US.\n5.  **Compare the general locations:** Since\
      \ Texas is generally much further south than South Dakota, it is highly probable\
      \ that any county in Texas will be south of any county in South Dakota.\n6.\
      \  **Consider potential edge cases (and dismiss them quickly based on the large\
      \ distance):** Are these counties on the extreme northern edge of Texas or the\
      \ extreme southern edge of South Dakota? Even so, the overall north-south distance\
      \ between the states is significant. The southern border of South Dakota is\
      \ roughly at the 43rd parallel north. The northern border of Texas is roughly\
      \ at the 36th parallel north. The *southern* border of Texas is roughly at the\

      United States.

      3.  **Compare the latitudes of the states:** States in the southeastern US (like
      Georgia) are generally at lower latitudes (closer to the equator) than states
      in the western US (like Wyoming). Lower latitude means further south.

      4.  **Reason about the counties within the states:** Since Georgia is generally
      south of Wyoming, any county within Georgia will likely be south of any county
      within Wyoming.

      5.  **Confirm the relative positions:** Peach County, GA is located roughly
      around 32.5 degrees North latitude. Washakie County, WY is located roughly around
      43.5 degrees North latitude. A lower North latitude means further south.

      \n2.  **Identify the key entities:**\n    *   Bee County, Texas\n    *   Parke\
      \ County, Indiana\n\n3.  **Determine the location of the first entity (Bee County,\
      \ TX):**\n    *   I know Texas is a southern US state.\n    *   I need to get\
      \ a more precise idea of where Bee County is *within* Texas. I can look it up\
      \ or recall its general location. Bee County is located in the southern part\
      \ of Texas, near the Gulf Coast. Its approximate latitude is around 28 degrees\
      \ North.\n\n4.  **Determine the location of the second entity (Parke County,\
      \ IN):**\n    *   I know Indiana is a Midwestern US state.\n    *   I need to\
      \ get a more precise idea of where Parke County is *within* Indiana. I can look\
      \ it up or recall its general location. Parke County is located in the western\
      \ part of Indiana, roughly in the central-to-northern half of the state. Its\

      \    *   Bee County, TX is around 28 degrees North latitude.\n    *   Parke\
      \ County, IN is around 39.8 degrees North latitude.\n\n6.  **Interpret the comparison:**\
      \ A lower latitude means a location is farther *south*. A higher latitude means\
      \ a location is farther *north*.\n\n7.  **Apply to the question:** The question\
      \ asks if Bee County, TX is *south* of Parke County, IN. Since Bee County's\
      \ latitude (28\xB0N) is significantly lower than Parke County's latitude (39.8\xB0\
      N), Bee County is indeed farther south than Parke County.\n\n8.  **Formulate\
      \ the final answer:** The comparison of latitudes confirms that Bee County,\
      \ TX is located south of Parke County, IN. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n\n\

      \ final YES or NO answer.\n\n*   Step 1: Identify Bee County, TX.\n*   Step\
      \ 2: Determine the general location/latitude of Bee County, TX (southern TX,\

      \ the general location/latitude of Parke County, IN (western/central IN, ~39.8\xB0\
      N).\n*   Step 5: Compare the latitudes. A lower latitude is farther south. 28\xB0\
      N is lower than 39.8\xB0N.\n*   Step 6: Conclude that Bee County, TX is south\
      \ of Parke County, IN.\n\nThis leads directly to the YES answer.\n\nHere is\
      \ the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  Identify the first location: Bee County,\
      \ Texas.\n2.  Determine the general latitude of Bee County, TX. Texas is a southern\
      \ state, and Bee County is in the southern part of Texas. Its latitude is approximately\
      \ 28 degrees North.\n3.  Identify the second location: Parke County, Indiana.\n\
      4.  Determine the general latitude of Parke County, IN. Indiana is a Midwestern\
      \ state, and Parke County is in the western part, roughly in the central-northern\
      \ half. Its latitude is approximately 39.8 degrees North.\n5.  Compare the latitudes.\
      \ A location with a lower North latitude is located south of a location with\
      \ a higher North latitude.\n6.  Since 28 degrees North (Bee County) is lower\
      \ than 39.8 degrees North (Parke County), Bee County is located south of Parke\
      \ County.\n\nYES"

      \ (GA) and Cheboygan County, Michigan (MI).\n2.  **Determine the general location\
      \ of each state:**\n    *   Georgia (GA) is a state in the southeastern United\
      \ States. It's generally considered part of the South.\n    *   Michigan (MI)\
      \ is a state in the Great Lakes region of the Midwestern United States. It's\
      \ generally considered part of the Midwest, and its northern parts are quite\
      \ far north.\n3.  **Consider the North-South relationship:** The question asks\
      \ if one is *south* of the other. This is about latitude. States located further\
      \ south have lower latitudes. States located further north have higher latitudes.\n\
      4.  **Compare the general latitudes:** Georgia is clearly much further south\
      \ than Michigan. Michigan is located significantly further north in the US.\n\
      5.  **Apply this to counties within those states:** While specific county locations\
      \ within a state can vary slightly, a county in a state as far south as Georgia\
      \ *must* be located south of a county in a state as far north as Michigan. There\
      \ is no overlap in latitude where a Michigan county would be south of a Georgia\
