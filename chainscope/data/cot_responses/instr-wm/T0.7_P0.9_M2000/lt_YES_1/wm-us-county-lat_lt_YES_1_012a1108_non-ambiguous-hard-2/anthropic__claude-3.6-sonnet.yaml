    f5f5d4c7-68e1-4555-a04d-9fe4a2ba2efd: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s consider the states:

      - TX (Texas) is in the southern United States

      - ND (North Dakota) is in the northern United States


      2. Since these are counties in different states, we can determine their relative
      position by looking at their states:

      - Texas is located entirely south of North Dakota

      - Any county in Texas must be south of any county in North Dakota


      3. Therefore, since Crane County is in Texas and Slope County is in North Dakota,
      Crane County must be located south of Slope County.
