      their geographic locations in terms of latitude.


      Step 1: Identify the location of DeSoto County, MS.

      - DeSoto County is in the northwestern part of Mississippi, just south of Memphis,
      Tennessee. Mississippi is in the southeastern region of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Billings County, ND.

      - Billings County is in the western part of North Dakota. North Dakota is in
