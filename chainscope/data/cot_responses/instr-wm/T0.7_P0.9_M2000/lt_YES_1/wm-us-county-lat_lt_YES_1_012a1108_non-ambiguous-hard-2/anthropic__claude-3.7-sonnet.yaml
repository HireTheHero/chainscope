      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions
      of these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Randolph County is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Beltrami County is in Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - North Carolina is located on the east coast in the southeastern United States

      - Minnesota is located in the northern part of the Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Minnesota is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous United States,
      bordering Canada

      - North Carolina is much further south, in the southern portion of the eastern
      seaboard


      Step 4: Specifically for these counties:

      - Beltrami County is in northern Minnesota

      - Randolph County is in central North Carolina


      Given these facts, Randolph County, NC is definitely located south of Beltrami
      County, MN, as North Carolina is significantly south of Minnesota.

      2) Calumet County is in Wisconsin (WI), which is in the northern part of the
      United States.


      3) Geographically, Texas is located significantly south of Wisconsin on the
      map of the United States.


      4) Since Palo Pinto County is in Texas and Calumet County is in Wisconsin, Palo
      Pinto County must be south of Calumet County.


      5) To be more precise: Wisconsin is in the upper Midwest region, while Texas
      is in the South/Southwest region of the country.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'
    f25811b6-2042-494a-8ca8-640c591565af: 'I''ll solve this step by step to determine

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Texas is located in the southern United States

      - Wisconsin is located in the northern United States, specifically in the Upper
      Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Wisconsin is much further north in the continental United States

      - Texas is in the southern portion of the United States


      Step 4: Since counties follow the geographic position of their states, Palo
      Pinto County in Texas would be south of Calumet County in Wisconsin, as Texas
      is south of Wisconsin.


      YES, Palo Pinto County, TX is located south of Calumet County, WI.'

      To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic locations of both
      counties and compare their latitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Vermilion Parish is in Louisiana (LA)

      - Fall River County is in South Dakota (SD)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Louisiana is located in the southern United States, bordering the Gulf of
      Mexico

      - South Dakota is located in the northern central United States, bordering North
      Dakota and Canada


      Step 3: Compare relative positions.

      - Louisiana is significantly south of South Dakota in the United States

      - All parishes in Louisiana will be south of all counties in South Dakota


      Step 4: Specifically for these counties:

      - Vermilion Parish is in southern Louisiana

      - Fall River County is in southwestern South Dakota

      - The latitude difference is substantial, with Vermilion Parish being much farther
      south


      Therefore, YES, Vermilion Parish, LA is located south of Fall River County,
      SD.'

      Let me think about this step by step:


      1) Vermilion Parish is in Louisiana (LA), which is a state in the southern United
      States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico.


      2) Fall River County is in South Dakota (SD), which is a state in the northern
      Great Plains region of the United States.

      is one of the southernmost states in the continental US, while South Dakota
      is in the northern part of the country.


      4) Since Vermilion Parish is in Louisiana, and Fall River County is in South

      - Arizona is a southern state that borders Mexico.

      - Presque Isle County is located in the northeastern part of Michigan''s Lower
      Peninsula, on Lake Huron.

      - Gila County is in central Arizona.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Michigan''s position is much further north in the United States compared to

      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Wisconsin, including Pepin County, is much further north than Texas.

      - Rockwall County, being in Texas, is significantly further south than any county
      in Wisconsin.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Rockwall County (TX) is in a southern state and Pepin County (WI) is
      in a northern state, Rockwall County must be south of Pepin County.


      YES, Rockwall County, TX is located south of Pepin County, WI.'
    d38437fe-e2c6-42f6-a9ed-99edf53933b6: '# Is Rockwall County, TX located south
      of Pepin County, WI?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions
      of these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Rockwall County is in Texas (TX)

      - Pepin County is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Texas and Wisconsin.

      - Texas is located in the southern United States

      - Wisconsin is located in the northern part of the Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Wisconsin is much further north in the United States compared to Texas

      - Texas shares a border with Mexico to its south, while Wisconsin is near the
      Canadian border

      - All counties in Texas would be south of all counties in Wisconsin due to their
      respective state positions


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Rockwall County is in Texas and Pepin County is in Wisconsin, and Texas
      is entirely south of Wisconsin, Rockwall County must be south of Pepin County.


      YES'

      Morrison County, MN?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two counties.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) Wichita County is in Texas (TX), which is in the southern part of the United
      States.


      2) Morrison County is in Minnesota (MN), which is in the northern part of the
      United States.


      3) Geographically, Minnesota is located in the northern central United States,
      bordering Canada.


      4) Texas is located in the south-central United States, bordering Mexico.


      5) Since Minnesota is significantly north of Texas in terms of latitude, any
      county in Texas would be south of any county in Minnesota.


      Therefore, Wichita County, TX is indeed located south of Morrison County, MN.


      YES'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Wichita County is in Texas (TX), which is in the southern part of the United
      States.

      - Morrison County is in Minnesota (MN), which is in the northern part of the
