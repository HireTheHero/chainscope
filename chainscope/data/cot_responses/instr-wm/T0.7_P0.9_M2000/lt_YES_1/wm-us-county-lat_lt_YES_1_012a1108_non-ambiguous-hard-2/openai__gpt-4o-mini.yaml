      2. **Identify the location of McMullen County, TX**: McMullen County is located
      in South Texas, specifically in the southern part of the state, near the Gulf
      Coast.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Texas is significantly further south
      than Iowa. McMullen County, being in Texas, is therefore generally located south
      of Kossuth County, which is in Iowa.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that McMullen County is in Texas and Kossuth County
      is in Iowa, McMullen County is indeed located south of Kossuth County.


      So the final answer is: YES.'
