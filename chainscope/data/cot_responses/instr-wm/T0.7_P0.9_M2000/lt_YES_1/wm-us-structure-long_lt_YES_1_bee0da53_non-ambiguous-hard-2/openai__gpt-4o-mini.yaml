      1. **Locate Santa Margarita Lake**: Santa Margarita Lake is located in San Luis
      Obispo County, California. It is situated to the north of the city of San Luis
      Obispo.


      2. **Locate Magic Reservoir**: Magic Reservoir is located in southern Idaho,
      near the town of Hailey and the city of Twin Falls.


      3. **Determine relative positions**: California is located to the south of Idaho.
      Santa Margarita Lake, being in California, is positioned further south compared
      to Magic Reservoir in Idaho.


      4. **Assess west-east position**: Since Santa Margarita Lake is in California
      and further south, and Magic Reservoir is in Idaho further north, we need to
      analyze their east-west alignment. California is to the west of Idaho as a whole,
      but Santa Margarita Lake is not west of Magic Reservoir specifically; it is
      actually south.


      Based on this reasoning, Santa Margarita Lake is not located west of Magic Reservoir.


      The answer is: **NO**.'
    bb6953a9-1f3a-4e74-882e-638acb214c55: 'To determine whether Santa Margarita Lake,
      CA is located west of Magic Reservoir, ID, we need to establish the geographical
      locations of both sites:


      1. **Locate Santa Margarita Lake, CA**: Santa Margarita Lake is situated in
      San Luis Obispo County, California, which is in the central part of the state,
      near the coast.


      2. **Locate Magic Reservoir, ID**: Magic Reservoir is located in southern Idaho,

      Margarita Lake is located) is significantly west of southern Idaho (where Magic
      Reservoir is located).


      4. **Determine the west-east relationship**: Since Santa Margarita Lake is in

      - Trinity Dam, being in California, is therefore south of Anderson Ranch Dam,

      2. **Identify the location of FirstBank Southwest Tower, TX**: FirstBank Southwest

      in the northern part of the state.


      4. **Compare the east-west positions**: Since San Carlos Lake is in southeastern
      Arizona and Amarillo is in the northern Texas Panhandle, we can see that San

      2. **Location of Sarasota Opera House**: The Sarasota Opera House is located
      in Sarasota, Florida, which is in the southwestern part of the state of Florida.


      3. **Comparing Longitudes**: Generally, the easternmost points in the U.S. (like
      Florida) are to the east of central locations (like Iowa). Since Florida is
      further south and east compared to Iowa, we can infer that Dubuque, Iowa is
      likely to be west of Sarasota, Florida.

      the locations of both St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle, WA, and Sarang
      Community Church in Southern California, CA.


      1. **Locate St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral**: St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral
      is located in Seattle, Washington, which is in the northwestern part of the
      United States.


      2. **Locate Sarang Community Church**: Sarang Community Church is located in
      Southern California, which is in the southwestern part of the United States.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Seattle, WA is significantly north
      of Southern California. Since both locations are on the West Coast, we can assess
      their east-west positioning. However, because Seattle is north of Southern California,
      it is not possible for St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral to be west of Sarang
      Community Church, as that would imply it is positioned more to the west while
      still being north, which does not meet the criteria of being west in terms of
      direct geographical alignment.


      In conclusion, St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral is not located west of Sarang
      Community Church.


      The answer is: **NO**.'
