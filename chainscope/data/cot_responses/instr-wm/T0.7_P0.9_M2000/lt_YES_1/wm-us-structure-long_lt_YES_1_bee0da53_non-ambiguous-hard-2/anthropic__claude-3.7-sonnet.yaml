      and Massachusetts on the East Coast. When looking at a map of the US, Ohio is
      indeed west of Massachusetts. Any location in Ohio would be west of any location
      in Massachusetts.

      Step 3: Since John Martin Reservoir is in Colorado and Lovewell Reservoir is
      in Kansas, and Colorado is west of Kansas, John Martin Reservoir would be west
      of Lovewell Reservoir.


      NO WAIT - I should be more precise. While Colorado is generally west of Kansas,
      I need to consider the specific locations of these reservoirs within their states.
      John Martin Reservoir is in southeastern Colorado, while Lovewell Reservoir
      is in north-central Kansas. Given their specific locations, John Martin Reservoir
      is still west of Lovewell Reservoir.

      Both reservoirs could potentially be near the CO-KS border, but even in that
      case, the CO reservoir would still be west of the KS reservoir due to the straight
      east-west border between these states.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Bayles Lake is in Illinois, which is a state in the Midwestern United States.

      - 120 Wall Street is in New York City, which is in the state of New York on
      the East Coast.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions.

      - Illinois is located west of New York state.

      - The United States generally has states arranged with eastern states (like
      New York) closer to the Atlantic Ocean, and midwestern states (like Illinois)
      more inland and to the west.


      Step 3: Verify the specific locations.

      - Any location in Illinois, including Bayles Lake, would be west of New York
      City.

      - Wall Street is in Lower Manhattan, on the eastern side of New York City.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      - Since Illinois is west of New York, and Bayles Lake is in Illinois, while
      120 Wall Street is in New York, Bayles Lake must be west of 120 Wall Street.

      Step 3: Consider the specific longitude.

      - All of Illinois is west of New York City (where Wall Street is located)

      - Wall Street is in lower Manhattan, New York City

      - Any location in Illinois, including Bayles Lake, would be west of any location

      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of both dams.

      - Trinity Dam is located in California (CA)

      - Anderson Ranch Dam is located in Idaho (ID)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the western United States.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Idaho is an inland state, east of California


      Step 3: More specifically, California is entirely west of Idaho. The Pacific
      Ocean forms California''s western border, while Idaho is several states inland
      from the Pacific coast.


      Step 4: Since Trinity Dam is in California and Anderson Ranch Dam is in Idaho,
      and California is west of Idaho, Trinity Dam must be west of Anderson Ranch
      Dam.


      NO.

      Step 3: Be more precise about the locations.

      - Tennessee is positioned in the southeastern United States

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region

      - When comparing east-west positioning, Tennessee is generally west of Ohio


      Step 4: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Without specific city information, I need to rely on the general state positions

      - Given that Tennessee as a whole is west of Ohio, facilities in these states
      would generally follow this relationship


      Based on the geographic positions of Tennessee and Ohio, with Tennessee being
      west of Ohio, the Arnold Engineering Development Complex in Tennessee would
      be west of the Muskingum River Power Plant in Ohio.


      NO

      Step 2: Determine their relative positions geographically.

      - Iowa is a state in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Tennessee is a state in the southeastern United States

      - Generally, Iowa is west of Tennessee on a map of the United States


      Step 3: Check more specific locations.

      - Lake Icaria is in southwestern Iowa

      - Memphis is located in the southwestern corner of Tennessee, along the Mississippi
      River


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      - Even though Memphis is in the western part of Tennessee, Iowa is still entirely
      west of Tennessee

      - Therefore, Lake Icaria (in Iowa) must be west of St. Mary''s Episcopal Cathedral
      (in Memphis, Tennessee)

      San Andreas Lake is very close to the Pacific Ocean in California. Little Goose
      Dam is in eastern Washington, far from the coast. Since the Pacific coast runs
      roughly north-south, and both Washington and California border it, with Washington

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Badin Lake is in North Carolina (NC), which is a state on the east coast of
      the United States.

      - 2 Columbus Circle is in New York (NY), specifically in Manhattan, New York
      City, which is also on the east coast but further north than North Carolina.


      Step 2: Consider their east-west positioning.

      - In the United States, New York is located in the northeastern part of the
      country.

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern part of the country, but importantly,
      it''s generally southwest of New York.


      Step 3: Analyze the specific locations within their states.

      - Badin Lake is in central/western North Carolina.

      - 2 Columbus Circle is in Manhattan, on the eastern side of New York state.


      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison.

      - When comparing locations on the east coast of the US, places further south
      (like North Carolina) tend to be further west than places further north (like
      New York) due to the diagonal orientation of the east coast.

      - Additionally, Badin Lake is in the interior of North Carolina, while Manhattan
      is on the eastern edge of New York.


      NO. Badin Lake, NC is not located west of 2 Columbus Circle, NY. It is actually

      - Both states border the Pacific Ocean on their western edges


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning.

      - Both Oregon and California stretch from the Pacific Ocean eastward

      - San Bernardino is in southern California, in the inland region (not on the
