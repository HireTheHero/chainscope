      in San Mateo County, California. It is located on the San Francisco Peninsula,
      which is on the west coast of the United States.


      2. **Identify the location of Little Goose Dam, WA**: Little Goose Dam is located
      on the Snake River in the state of Washington. Washington is in the Pacific
      Northwest region of the United States, which is generally east of California.


      3. **Compare the longitudes**: California is located further west than Washington.
      Specifically, the San Francisco Peninsula, where San Andreas Lake is located,
      is significantly west of the area where Little Goose Dam is situated.


      Based on these steps, San Andreas Lake, CA is indeed located west of Little
      Goose Dam, WA.


      **Answer: YES**'
    812a92c9-c003-47ea-a332-b36fa683c0c5: 'To determine whether San Andreas Lake,
      CA is located west of Little Goose Dam, WA, we need to consider the geographical
      locations of both places:


      1. **San Andreas Lake, CA**: This lake is located in California, on the San
      Francisco Peninsula, just south of San Francisco. It is situated along the San
      Andreas Fault.


      2. **Little Goose Dam, WA**: This dam is located on the Snake River in southeastern
      Washington state, part of the Columbia River Basin.


      Now, let''s consider their relative positions:


      - San Andreas Lake, being on the San Francisco Peninsula, is located in the
      western part of California, which is on the west coast of the United States.

      - Little Goose Dam, being in southeastern Washington, is significantly inland,
      east of the Cascade Range.


      Since California is generally west of Washington, and specifically, the San
      Francisco Peninsula is far west of most locations in Washington, San Andreas
      Lake, CA is indeed west of Little Goose Dam, WA.

      1. **Locate Rose Valley Lake, PA**: Rose Valley Lake is located in Lycoming
      County, Pennsylvania. It is situated in the north-central part of the state.


      2. **Locate Kendall Cogeneration Station, MA**: The Kendall Cogeneration Station
      is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Cambridge is part of the Greater Boston
      area in the eastern part of Massachusetts.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Pennsylvania is generally west of Massachusetts.
      Specifically, Lycoming County in Pennsylvania is located to the west of Cambridge,
      Massachusetts.


      Therefore, Rose Valley Lake in Pennsylvania is indeed located west of Kendall

      west of UCCU Center, UT, we need to consider the geographical locations of both
      places.


      1. **Identify the location of Lake Tapps, WA**: Lake Tapps is located in Washington
      State, which is in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.


      2. **Identify the location of UCCU Center, UT**: UCCU Center is located in Orem,
      Utah, which is in the western part of the United States, but further inland
      than Washington State.
