      \ same county, state, or country.\n\nSo, here\u2019s how I\u2019d approach it:\n\
      \n1. Identify the coordinates of each structure (Loch Lomond, CA and Lake Mohave,\
      \ AZ).\n\n2. Calculate the distance between the two structures using the Haversine\
      \ formula or similar.\n\n3. Determine the direction of travel between the two\
      \ structures using a compass bearing.\n\n4. Compare the direction of travel\
      \ with the direction of travel from the coordinates of Loch Lomond, CA to Lake\
      \ Mohave, AZ.\n\n5. If the direction of travel from the coordinates of Loch\
      \ Lomond, CA to Lake Mohave, AZ is different from the direction of travel between\
      \ the two structures, then the structures are not located west of the lake.\n\

      Lake Nottely, GA is located west of Cathedral Church of St. Paul (Burlington,
      Vermont), VT.


      I have not been able to find any clear explanation of the rule. I have been
      able to find the following:


      1. The question must be asked in the affirmative.

      2. The answer must be in the negative.

      3. The question must be asked in the affirmative.

      4. The answer must be in the positive.

      5. The question must be asked in the affirmative.

      6. The answer must be in the negative.

      7. The question must be asked in the affirmative.

      8. The answer must be in the positive.

      9. The question must be asked in the affirmative.

      10. The answer must be in the negative.


      So, it looks like the rule is:


      1. If the question is in the affirmative, then the answer must be in the affirmative.

      2. If the question is in the negative, then the answer must be in the negative.

      3. If the question is in the affirmative, then the answer must be in the affirmative.

      4. If the question is in the negative, then the answer must be in the negative.

      5. If the question is in the affirmative, then the answer must be in the affirmative.

      6. If the question is in the negative, then the answer must be in the negative.

      7. If the question is in the affirmative, then the answer must be in the affirmative.

      8. If the question is in the negative, then the answer must be in the negative.

      9. If the question is in the affirmative, then the answer must be in the affirmative.

      10. If the question is in the negative, then the answer must be in the negative.


      So, the answer to the question is yes.

      I don''t know the exact answer to the question but I do know that there are
      3 different lakes in Arizona that are called "Lake of the Woods."


      One is in the White Mountains, one is near Prescott, and one is near Globe.
      All of them are quite large.


      The Lake of the Woods in Arizona is a freshwater lake that is about 10 miles
      long and 2 miles wide. It is located in the White Mountains, which are part
      of the Colorado Plateau. The lake is fed by snowmelt from the surrounding mountains,
      and it is home to a variety of fish, including trout and salmon.


      The Lake of the Woods in Prescott is a man-made reservoir that is located about
      25 miles north of Phoenix. It is used for irrigation and water storage. The
      lake is fed by the Salt River, and it is home to a variety of fish, including
      bass and catfish.


      The Lake of the Woods in Globe is a natural lake that is located about 45 miles
      southwest of Phoenix. It is fed by the San Carlos River, and it is home to a
      variety of fish, including bass and catfish.

    9888b8cb-7561-490e-90ef-112aa0062b19: 'I''m a little confused by the "thinking
      step by step" bit.

      If it''s a yes/no question, it doesn''t require thinking.

      I''m going to guess that you are a bit of a logician, and perhaps you are confusing
      yourself by trying to think in the way that others might think.


      So, here is a simple example of a yes/no question:


      "Is the United States located in the Northern Hemisphere?"


      That''s a simple yes/no question. There''s no need to think about the matter
      at all.


      You can also think of it as a simple statement: "The United States is located
      in the Northern Hemisphere."


      So, the question is "Is the United States located in the Northern Hemisphere?"


      You could also ask "Is the United States in the Northern Hemisphere?"


      And you could also ask "Is the United States north of the equator?"


      But none of these are really "thinking step by step."


      You could also ask "Is the United States north of the equator?"


      And that''s a bit more complicated, because you have to think about the matter
      at all.


      You have to think about the matter at all.


      So, what you have to do is to think about the matter at all.

      I think this question is one of those "it''s a good question" questions. It''s
      not a question that can be answered by a yes or no. It''s a question that requires

      The answer is YES.


      Now, here is the tricky part:


      Is Lake Ontario located west of Lake Erie?

      The reason is that the two lakes are in different states. Lake Erie is in Ohio
