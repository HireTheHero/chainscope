      1. **Tulsa Performing Arts Center** is located in downtown Tulsa, Oklahoma.

      2. **Grenada Lake** is located in north-central Mississippi, near the town of
      Grenada.


      Now consider the general geography:

      - Tulsa is in the northeastern part of Oklahoma.

      - Grenada Lake is in the northern part of Mississippi.


      Even though Tulsa is on the eastern edge of Oklahoma and Grenada Lake is in
