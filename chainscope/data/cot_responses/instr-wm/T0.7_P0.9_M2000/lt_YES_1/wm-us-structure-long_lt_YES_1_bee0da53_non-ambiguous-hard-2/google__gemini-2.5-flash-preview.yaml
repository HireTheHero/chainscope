    04806546-c7aa-44c8-9096-fa3934e079b5: 'Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the locations:** We need to know the locations of Copper Mountain
      Solar Facility, NV and Apache Lake, AZ.

      2.  **Find the location of Copper Mountain Solar Facility, NV:** A quick search
      reveals it is located near Boulder City, Nevada.

      3.  **Find the location of Apache Lake, AZ:** A quick search reveals it is located
      in central Arizona, northeast of Phoenix.

      4.  **Determine the relative positions:** Boulder City, NV is located east-southeast
      of Las Vegas. Central Arizona (where Apache Lake is) is located much further
      to the southeast of Boulder City.

      5.  **Compare the longitudes:** To determine if something is west of another
      location, we primarily look at longitude. Boulder City, NV is at approximately
      114.8 degrees West longitude. Apache Lake, AZ is at approximately 111.1 degrees
      West longitude.

      6.  **Analyze the comparison:** A higher degree of West longitude means a location
      is further west. Since Copper Mountain Solar Facility (near Boulder City) is
      at approximately 114.8 degrees West and Apache Lake is at approximately 111.1
      degrees West, 114.8 is further west than 111.1.


      Therefore, Copper Mountain Solar Facility is located west of Apache Lake.


      The answer is **YES**.'

      5.  **Visualize or consult a map:** Imagine or look at a map showing Oklahoma
      and Missouri. Oklahoma is clearly located to the west and south of Missouri.

      6.  **Apply the relative position to the specific lakes:** Since Oklahoma is
      west of Missouri, any location within Oklahoma (like Lake Ellsworth) will be
      west of any location within Missouri (like Lake Wappapello), assuming they are
      not at the extreme eastern/western borders of the states in a way that reverses
      the general trend. Lake Ellsworth is in southwestern Oklahoma, and Lake Wappapello
      is in southeastern Missouri, reinforcing the "west of" relationship for Lake
      Ellsworth relative to Lake Wappapello.

      OH.

      2.  Determine the approximate geographic coordinates or relative locations of
      AEDC, TN. AEDC is near Tullahoma, Tennessee. Tennessee is generally in the southeastern
      US.

      3.  Determine the approximate geographic coordinates or relative locations of
      Muskingum River Power Plant, OH. The Muskingum River Power Plant was located
      near Beverly, Ohio. Ohio is in the midwestern/eastern US, north of Tennessee.

      4.  Mentally picture or roughly sketch the relative positions of Tennessee and
      Ohio. Ohio is north-northeast of Tennessee.

      5.  Consider the relative east-west positions. Ohio is generally *east* of the
      more central parts of Tennessee, although the eastern edge of Tennessee is further
      east. However, the question asks about a specific location in TN (near Tullahoma,
      which is in central TN) relative to a location in OH (near Beverly, which is
      in southeastern OH).

      6.  Compare the longitudes. Tullahoma, TN is around 86.2 degrees West longitude.
      Beverly, OH is around 81.5 degrees West longitude.

      7.  A smaller West longitude number means the location is further east. 81.5
      is less than 86.2.

      a state can vary, the question asks about a point in IL and a point in PA. Since
      the entirety of Illinois is west of the entirety of Pennsylvania, any point
      in Illinois will be west of any point in Pennsylvania.

      4.  **Apply the general relationship to the specific points:** Olympia Centre,
      IL is in Illinois. The Cyclorama Building at Gettysburg, PA is in Pennsylvania.
      Since Illinois is west of Pennsylvania, Olympia Centre, IL is west of the Cyclorama
      Building at Gettysburg, PA.

      Plant Scherer is near Juliette, Georgia. Georgia is a southeastern state. Its
      longitude is roughly around -83 degrees West.

      3.  **Determine the coordinates (or relative positions) of Charles Playhouse,
      MA:** Charles Playhouse is in Boston, Massachusetts. Massachusetts is a northeastern
      state. Its longitude is roughly around -71 degrees West.

      4.  **Compare the longitudes:** -83 is less than -71.

      5.  **Interpret the comparison in terms of East/West:** On a map, smaller (more
      negative) longitudes are further West. Therefore, -83 West is further west than
      -71 West.

      6.  **Formulate the answer based on the comparison:** Since Plant Scherer is
      at approximately -83 degrees West longitude and Charles Playhouse is at approximately
      -71 degrees West longitude, Plant Scherer is located west of Charles Playhouse.

      \ the general east/west extent of the states:** Both Oregon and California span\
      \ a significant range of longitudes, from the Pacific coast eastward.\n\n5.\
      \  **Focus on the core of the question:** Is Lost Creek Lake (in OR) *west*\
      \ of *Sandals Church* (in CA)?\n\n6.  **Relate the locations geographically:**\
      \ Oregon is north of California. Imagine a map. If you are in Oregon and want\
      \ to go to California, you generally go south. If you are looking at two points,\
      \ one in Oregon and one in California, their relative east/west position depends\
      \ on their specific longitudes.\n\n7.  **Consider the possibility of overlap\
      \ in longitude:** Since both states run from the Pacific coast inland, there\
      \ is significant overlap in their longitudes. It's entirely possible for a location\
      \ in southern Oregon (like Lost Creek Lake) to be at a longitude that is *more\
      \ easterly* than a location in northern or even central California, or vice\
      \ versa. It's also possible for a location in southern Oregon to be at a longitude\
      \ that is *more westerly* than a location in eastern California.\n\n8.  **Evaluate\
      \ the question's structure:** The question asks if Lost Creek Lake is *west*\
      \ of Sandals Church. For this to be true, the longitude of Lost Creek Lake must\
      \ be *less* than the longitude of Sandals Church (further west).\n\n9.  **Determine\
      \ the typical longitudes:**\n    *   Lost Creek Lake, OR is near Medford, OR.\
      \ Medford's approximate longitude is around 122.8 degrees West. Lost Creek Lake\
      \ is slightly east of Medford, so its longitude is likely around 122.5 - 122.7\
      \ degrees West.\n    *   Sandals Church has locations in Riverside, San Bernardino,\
      \ Anaheim, etc. These cities are in Southern California. Riverside is around\
      \ 117.3 degrees West. San Bernardino is around 117.3 degrees West. Anaheim is\
      \ around 117.9 degrees West.\n\n10. **Compare the longitudes:**\n    *   Lost\
      \ Creek Lake: ~122.5 - 122.7 degrees West\n    *   Sandals Church (locations):\
      \ ~117.3 - 117.9 degrees West\n\n11. **Analyze the comparison:** A higher number\
      \ in West longitude means the location is further *east*.\n    *   122.x is\
      \ a *larger* number than 117.x.\n    *   Therefore, 122.x degrees West is *further\
      \ west* than 117.x degrees West.\n\n12. **Formulate the conclusion:** Lost Creek\
      \ Lake (at approx 122.x W) is located at a more westerly longitude than the\
      \ Sandals Church locations (at approx 117.x W). Therefore, Lost Creek Lake *is*\
      \ located west of Sandals Church.\n\n13. **Final Answer Check:** The reasoning\
      \ confirms that the western longitude of Lost Creek Lake is significantly further\
      \ west than the eastern longitude of the Sandals Church locations in Southern\
      \ California.\n\n**Final Answer:** YES"

      located in the intermountain western United States, generally southeast of Washington.

      4.  **Consider the question:** Is Lake Tapps, WA located *west* of UCCU Center,
      UT?

      5.  **Reason based on state locations:** Since Washington is generally northwest
      of Utah, any location within Washington is likely to be west of a location within
      Utah.

      6.  **Refine the reasoning (optional but helpful):** Washington is on the Pacific
      coast. Utah is inland. The entire state of Washington is west of the entire
      state of Utah. Therefore, any point in Washington is west of any point in Utah.


      **Conclusion:** Lake Tapps, WA is located west of UCCU Center, UT.

      \ is located west of 41 Cooper Square, NY.\n\nThe question asks about a structure\
      \ in Illinois. Gibson Generating Station is in **Indiana**, not Illinois.\n\n\
      Let's re-read the question carefully: \"Is Gibson Generating Station, **IL**\
      \ located west of 41 Cooper Square, NY?\"\n\nThere is no major power plant named\
      \ Gibson Generating Station in Illinois. There is a Gibson Generating Station\
      \ in Indiana.\n\nAssuming the question *intended* to ask about the Gibson Generating\
      \ Station in Indiana:\n\n1.  Gibson Generating Station, IN is near Owensville,\
      \ Indiana. Its longitude is approximately 87.6\xB0 W.\n2.  41 Cooper Square,\
      \ NY is in New York City, New York. Its longitude is approximately 74.0\xB0\
      \ W.\n3.  87.6\xB0 W is west of 74.0\xB0 W.\n\nHowever, the question specifically\
      \ states \"Gibson Generating Station, **IL**\". Since there isn't a well-known\
      \ Gibson Generating Station in Illinois, the premise as stated is flawed. But\
      \ if we must answer based *strictly* on the comparison of a location near 87.6\xB0\
      \ W (where the *actual* Gibson GS is) and 74.0\xB0 W, then the western location\
      \ is indeed west of the eastern location.\n\nLet's assume the \"IL\" was a typo\
      \ and the question meant the Gibson Generating Station in Indiana, as that's\
      \ the prominent one.\n\nStep 1: Find the location of Gibson Generating Station,\
      \ IN. It is near Owensville, Indiana.\nStep 2: Find the location of 41 Cooper\
      \ Square, NY. It is in New York City, New York.\nStep 3: Determine the longitude\
      \ of Gibson Generating Station, IN. It is approximately 87.6\xB0 W.\nStep 4:\
      \ Determine the longitude of 41 Cooper Square, NY. It is approximately 74.0\xB0\
      \ W.\nStep 5: Compare the longitudes. A larger number of degrees West longitude\
      \ means a location is farther west. 87.6\xB0 W is larger than 74.0\xB0 W.\n\
      Step 6: Therefore, Gibson Generating Station, IN is located west of 41 Cooper\
      \ Square, NY.\n\nGiven the specific wording \"Gibson Generating Station, IL\"\
      \ and the lack of such a prominent structure, the question is technically flawed.\
      \ However, if interpreted as asking about the well-known Gibson Generating Station\
      \ (which is in IN) relative to the NY address, the answer hinges on the longitude\
      \ comparison.\n\nLet's stick strictly to the name provided. Is there *any* structure\
      \ named \"Gibson Generating Station\" in Illinois? A quick search doesn't reveal\
      \ a major power plant with that name in Illinois. If such a structure exists,\
      \ its location would need to be determined. Without a known location for \"\
      Gibson Generating Station, IL\", the question cannot be definitively answered\
      \ based on geographic coordinates.\n\nHowever, the question asks for a YES/NO\
      \ answer about US structures and requires reasoning. It implies a comparison\
      \ of two points on a map. The most likely scenario is that the question intends\
      \ to compare the **well-known Gibson Generating Station (in Indiana)** with\
      \ the New York address, despite the typo. Let's proceed with that assumption,\
      \ acknowledging the flaw.\n\nStep 1: Assume \"Gibson Generating Station, IL\"\
      \ refers to the Gibson Generating Station in Indiana (the prominent one).\n\
      Step 2: Find the longitude of Gibson Generating Station, IN (near Owensville,\
      \ IN). It is approximately 87.6\xB0 W.\nStep 3: Find the longitude of 41 Cooper\
      \ Square, NY (New York City, NY). It is approximately 74.0\xB0 W.\nStep 4: Compare\
      \ the longitudes. 87.6\xB0 W is a larger number of degrees West than 74.0\xB0\
      \ W, meaning it is farther west.\nStep 5: Therefore, Gibson Generating Station,\

    bbd826c3-d54e-4490-af6a-7133cd952d1c: "Here's the thinking process to answer the\
      \ question:\n\n1.  **Identify the key locations:** The question is about two\
      \ locations: DeGray Lake, Arkansas (AR) and Sutton Lake, West Virginia (WV).\n\
      2.  **Determine the relative positions of the states:**\n    *   Arkansas is\
      \ generally in the South-Central part of the US.\n    *   West Virginia is generally\
      \ in the Appalachian region, in the Eastern US.\n    *   Mentally (or by looking\
      \ at a map), West Virginia is significantly *east* of Arkansas.\n3.  **Consider\
      \ the locations within the states:**\n    *   DeGray Lake is in west-central\
      \ Arkansas (near Arkadelphia).\n    *   Sutton Lake is in central West Virginia.\n\
      4.  **Compare the overall East/West positions:** Since West Virginia as a state\
      \ is much further east than Arkansas as a state, any location within West Virginia\
      \ is almost certainly going to be east of any location within Arkansas.\n5.\
      \  **Formulate the comparison:** We are asking if DeGray Lake (AR) is *west*\
      \ of Sutton Lake (WV). Based on the state comparison, Arkansas is west of West\
      \ Virginia. Therefore, a location in Arkansas will be west of a location in\
      \ West Virginia.\n6.  **Confirm the direction:** DeGray Lake is in AR, Sutton\
      \ Lake is in WV. AR is west of WV. So, DeGray Lake is west of Sutton Lake.\n\
      7.  **State the final answer:** The question is \"Is DeGray Lake, AR located\
      \ west of Sutton Lake (West Virginia), WV?\". The conclusion from the reasoning\
      \ is yes.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n*   AR is west of WV.\n*   DeGray\
      \ Lake is in AR.\n*   Sutton Lake is in WV.\n*   Therefore, DeGray Lake (in\
      \ AR) is west of Sutton Lake (in WV).\n\nThis confirms the statement in the\
      \ question is true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{YES}$."
    cf8dcb10-2fc6-4d06-86b7-69c0fda2e3b7: '1. **Identify the locations:** We are comparing
      DeGray Lake, Arkansas (AR) and Sutton Lake, West Virginia (WV).

      2. **Determine the relative positions:** We need to know the approximate longitudinal
      positions of AR and WV. Arkansas is in the central US, and West Virginia is
      in the eastern US.

      3. **Infer the longitudinal relationship:** Since West Virginia is east of Arkansas,
      any point in West Virginia will be further east than any point in Arkansas.

      4. **Apply to the specific locations:** Therefore, Sutton Lake, WV is east of
      DeGray Lake, AR.

      5. **Answer the question:** The question asks if DeGray Lake is *west* of Sutton
      Lake. Since Sutton Lake is east of DeGray Lake, DeGray Lake must be west of
      Sutton Lake.


      YES'
    d77423c1-2ae7-4793-bf4f-79412348215d: '1. **Identify the locations:** The two
      locations are DeGray Lake, AR and Sutton Lake, WV.

      2. **Determine the relative position of the states:** Arkansas (AR) is generally
      located west of West Virginia (WV).

      3. **Consider the locations within their states:** While the exact coordinates
      aren''t needed for a general comparison, DeGray Lake is in central Arkansas
      and Sutton Lake is in central West Virginia.

      4. **Relate the state positions to the lake positions:** Since Arkansas is west
      of West Virginia, and the lakes are roughly centrally located within those states,
      DeGray Lake is likely west of Sutton Lake.
