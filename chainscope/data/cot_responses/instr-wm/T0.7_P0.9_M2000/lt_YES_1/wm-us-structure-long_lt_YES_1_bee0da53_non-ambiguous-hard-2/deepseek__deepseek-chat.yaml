      the geographical locations of Lake Nottely, GA, and the Cathedral Church of
      St. Paul in Burlington, VT, and then compare their positions.


      1. **Lake Nottely, GA**: Lake Nottely is located in the northern part of Georgia,
      near the border with North Carolina. Georgia is in the southeastern region of
      the United States.


      2. **Cathedral Church of St. Paul (Burlington, VT)**: Burlington is located
      in the northwestern part of Vermont, near the border with New York and close
      to Lake Champlain. Vermont is in the northeastern region of the United States.

      \ by step. The question is: *Is Jocassee Dam, SC located west of H. Carl Moultrie\

      \ locations of both Jocassee Dam in South Carolina (SC) and the H. Carl Moultrie\
      \ Courthouse in Washington, D.C. (DC), and then compare their longitudes to\
      \ see which is further west.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\n**Jocassee\
      \ Dam, SC:**\nJocassee Dam is located in Oconee County, South Carolina. It's\
      \ part of the Jocassee Reservoir, which is situated in the northwest corner\
      \ of the state, near the borders with North Carolina and Georgia.\n\n**H. Carl\
      \ Moultrie Courthouse, DC:**\nThe H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse is located in\
      \ Washington, D.C. Specifically, it's situated in the Judiciary Square area,\
      \ which is in the central part of the city.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Coordinates\n\
      \nTo determine which location is further west, we need their longitude coordinates.\
      \ Longitude measures how far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian\
      \ (0\xB0 longitude). A higher longitude value indicates a location further west.\n\
      \n**Jocassee Dam, SC:**\nBased on available data, Jocassee Dam is approximately\
      \ at a longitude of around **-82.9\xB0 W**.\n\n**H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse,\
      \ DC:**\nThe H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse is located at approximately **-77.0\xB0\
      \ W**.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Longitudes\n\nNow, let's compare the two longitude\
      \ values:\n\n- Jocassee Dam, SC: **-82.9\xB0 W**\n- H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse,\
      \ DC: **-77.0\xB0 W**\n\nIn terms of longitude, the more negative (or further\
      \ west) the value, the further west the location is. Therefore, **-82.9\xB0\
      \ W** is more negative than **-77.0\xB0 W**, indicating that Jocassee Dam is\
      \ further west than the H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse.\n\n### Step 4: Verify with\
      \ a Map\n\nTo ensure our reasoning is correct, let's visualize the locations\
      \ on a map.\n\n- **Washington, D.C.** is located on the east coast of the United\
      \ States, near the Atlantic Ocean.\n- **Jocassee Dam, SC** is situated inland,\
      \ in the northwestern part of South Carolina.\n\nFrom the map, it's clear that\
      \ Jocassee Dam is west of Washington, D.C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter identifying\

      \ Jocassee Dam, SC is located west of H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse, DC."

      which is the westernmost part of the contiguous U.S.


      2. **Pathfinder Reservoir, WY**: This reservoir is located in central Wyoming,
      which is in the western United States but farther east than California.


      3. **Comparing longitudes**: Since California is west of Wyoming, any location
      in California (like Scotts Flat Reservoir) will be west of any location in Wyoming

      \ Southwest Tower, TX?**\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\nFirst, I need\
      \ to know where these two places are located.\n\n- **San Carlos Lake, AZ**:\
      \ This is a reservoir located in Arizona, USA. It's situated on the San Carlos\
      \ Apache Indian Reservation.\n  \n- **FirstBank Southwest Tower, TX**: This\
      \ is a building located in Texas, USA. Specifically, it's in the city of Amarillo.\n\
      \n### Step 2: Determine the Longitude of Each Location\n\nTo determine if one\
      \ location is west of the other, I need to compare their longitudes. Longitude\
      \ measures how far east or west a location is from the prime meridian (0\xB0\
      \ longitude).\n\n- **San Carlos Lake, AZ**: After a quick search, I find that\

      \ one is further west.\n\n- **San Carlos Lake, AZ**: -110.5\xB0\n  \n- **FirstBank\
      \ Southwest Tower, TX**: -101.8\xB0\n\nIn terms of longitude, a more negative\
      \ number means the location is further west. Therefore, -110.5\xB0 is more negative\

      \ by step. The question is: **Is Saint Anthony Cathedral Basilica, TX located\
      \ west of Theatre Building Chicago, IL?**\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\
      \nFirst, I need to identify the two locations mentioned:\n\n1. **Saint Anthony\
      \ Cathedral Basilica, TX**: This seems to refer to the San Fernando Cathedral,\
      \ which is also known as the Cathedral of San Fernando and is located in San\
      \ Antonio, Texas. It's a historic Catholic cathedral.\n\n2. **Theatre Building\
      \ Chicago, IL**: This is a bit ambiguous since there are multiple theater buildings\
      \ in Chicago. However, one prominent theater is the **Chicago Theatre**, which\
      \ is a well-known landmark on State Street in Chicago, Illinois.\n\n### Step\
      \ 2: Determine the Longitudes of Each Location\n\nTo find out if one location\
      \ is west of the other, we need to compare their longitudes. Locations with\
      \ smaller (more negative) longitudes are further west.\n\n- **San Antonio, TX**:\
      \ The approximate longitude is **-98.4936\xB0**.\n  \n- **Chicago, IL**: The\
      \ approximate longitude is **-87.6298\xB0**.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Longitudes\n\
      \nNow, let's compare these two longitude values:\n\n- **San Antonio, TX**: -98.4936\xB0\
      \n  \n- **Chicago, IL**: -87.6298\xB0\n\nSince **-98.4936\xB0** is a more negative\
      \ number than **-87.6298\xB0**, San Antonio is further west than Chicago.\n\n\
      ### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nGiven that San Antonio, Texas, where Saint Anthony\
      \ Cathedral Basilica is located, has a more westward longitude than Chicago,\
      \ Illinois, where the Theatre Building (Chicago Theatre) is situated, we can\

      3. **Compare the longitudes to see which one is further west.**\n\n### Step\
      \ 1: Identifying the Locations\n\n- **Hyco Lake, NC**: This is a reservoir located\

      1. **Locate Lake Tapps, WA**: Lake Tapps is a reservoir located in Pierce County,
      Washington, in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is west
      of the Cascade Range and relatively close to cities like Tacoma and Seattle.


      2. **Locate UCCU Center, UT**: The UCCU Center is an arena located in Orem,
      Utah, which is in the western United States but further inland compared to Washington.


      3. **Compare their positions**: Washington is located to the north and west
      of Utah. Specifically, Lake Tapps, WA, is significantly further west than UCCU
      Center, UT, because Washington is on the West Coast, while Utah is in the Mountain
      West region.


      4. **Conclusion**: Yes, Lake Tapps, WA, is located west of UCCU Center, UT.

      \ in Arkansas, which is in the southern central region of the United States.\n\
      \   - **Sutton Lake, WV**: This is located in West Virginia, which is in the\
      \ eastern region of the United States, specifically in the Appalachian area.\n\
      \n2. **Compare their longitudinal positions**:\n   - Arkansas is generally west\
      \ of West Virginia. For reference:\n     - The approximate longitude of DeGray\
      \ Lake, AR, is around -93\xB0W.\n     - The approximate longitude of Sutton\
      \ Lake, WV, is around -80.7\xB0W.\n   - Since -93\xB0W is further west than\
      \ -80.7\xB0W, DeGray Lake is west of Sutton Lake.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \n \
      \  - Yes, DeGray Lake, AR is located west of Sutton Lake, WV.\n\n**Answer: YES**"

      \ located west of Sutton Lake, WV, we need to compare the geographic coordinates\
      \ of these two locations.\n\n1. **Identify the location of DeGray Lake, AR:**\n\
      \   - DeGray Lake is in Arkansas, which is in the southern central part of the\
      \ United States.\n   - The approximate longitude of DeGray Lake, AR is around\
