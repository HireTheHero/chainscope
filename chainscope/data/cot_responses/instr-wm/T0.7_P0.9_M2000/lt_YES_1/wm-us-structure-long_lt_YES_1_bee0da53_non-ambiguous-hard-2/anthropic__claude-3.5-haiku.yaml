      - Copper Mountain Solar Facility is in Nevada

      - Apache Lake is in Arizona

      - Nevada is west of Arizona


      4. Specific positioning

      - Since Nevada is west of Arizona, and the solar facility is in Nevada, it is

      1. First, I''ll locate Lake Icaria, IA (Iowa)

      2. Then, I''ll locate St. Mary''s Episcopal Cathedral in Memphis, Tennessee

      3. Then I''ll determine their relative geographic positions


      Step 1: Lake Icaria is located in southwest Iowa, likely in Adams County.


      Step 2: St. Mary''s Episcopal Cathedral is located in Memphis, Tennessee, which
      is in the southwestern part of Tennessee.


      Step 3: Comparing their geographic positions:

      - Lake Icaria is in western Iowa

      - Memphis is in southwestern Tennessee

      - These locations are in different states, with Iowa being west of Tennessee


      Therefore, Lake Icaria is WEST of St. Mary''s Episcopal Cathedral.

      1. First, locate Saint Sophia Cathedral in Los Angeles, California

      - This is in the western part of the United States

      - Specifically, it''s in Los Angeles, which is in Southern California


      2. Next, locate Rockport Reservoir in Utah

      - This is in northeastern Utah, east of Salt Lake City


      3. Compare their geographic positions

      - Los Angeles is on the west coast of the United States

      - Rockport Reservoir is in Utah, which is much further east


      4. Determine their relative positions

      - Los Angeles (and Saint Sophia Cathedral) is west of Rockport Reservoir

      - This means Saint Sophia Cathedral is indeed located west of Rockport Reservoir


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
