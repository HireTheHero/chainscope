      Step 1: Rainbow Lake, Arizona

      - I do not find a definitive location for a Rainbow Lake in Arizona

      - This makes the comparison challenging


      Step 2: Woman Lake, Minnesota

      - Woman Lake is located in Cass County, Minnesota

      Given the uncertainty about Rainbow Lake''s location, I cannot confidently answer
      YES or NO.


      However, the question requires a YES or NO answer. In cases of uncertainty,
      I will default to the most likely answer based on the information available.


      NO
