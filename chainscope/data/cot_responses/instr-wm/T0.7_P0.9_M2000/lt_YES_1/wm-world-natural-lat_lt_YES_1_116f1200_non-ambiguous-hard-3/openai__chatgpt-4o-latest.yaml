      by Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. It is located in Southeast Asia, south of
      mainland China.


      Now, comparing their relative positions on the map:


      - Hongze Lake is in the mid-latitude region of eastern China.

      - The Gulf of Thailand is significantly farther south, near the equator compared
      to Hongze Lake.


      Therefore, based on their geographic locations, the Gulf of Thailand is indeed
      located south of Hongze Lake.
