      Dominican Republic. It is the largest lake in the Caribbean and is situated
      at a low elevation in the southwestern part of the country.


      2. **Identify Lake Oscawana''s Location**: Lake Oscawana is located in New York,
      USA. It is a smaller lake situated in the Hudson Valley region.


      3. **Geographical Context**: Now, consider the geographical relationship between
      the two lakes. Lake Enriquillo is in the Caribbean region (south of the United
      States), while Lake Oscawana is in the northeastern United States.


      4. **Determine the Relative Position**: Since Lake Enriquillo is located in
      the Dominican Republic (a more southern location) and Lake Oscawana is in New
      York (a more northern location), Lake Enriquillo cannot be south of Lake Oscawana.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:


      **NO**.'

      flat located in Argentina, specifically in the northwest part of the country,
      near the Andes Mountains.


      2. **Identify the Location of the Acarai Mountains**: The Acarai Mountains are
      located in southern Brazil, near the border with Guyana and Suriname.

      - Gozo is in the southern Mediterranean, while Loch Etchachan is located in
      northern Scotland.

      - Given that Gozo is significantly further south than Loch Etchachan, we can

      of Retteri is lower (indicating it is further south) than that of the Tanggula
      Mountains, then Retteri would indeed be south of the Tanggula Mountains.

      Now, we must compare their geographical positions:


      - Lake Inawashiro is situated in the northern hemisphere, while Lake Balanan
      is in the southern hemisphere.

      - Given that Lake Balanan is in Indonesia and significantly south of Japan,

      1. **Identify the location of Laguna de Leche**: Laguna de Leche is located
      in Cuba, specifically in the province of Villa Clara. It is a large freshwater
      lagoon.


      2. **Identify the location of Belmont Lake**: Belmont Lake is situated in Ontario,

      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Since Laguna de Leche is in Cuba and Belmont Lake
      is in Canada, we can conclude that Laguna de Leche is much further south than
      Belmont Lake.


      Based on this reasoning, we can definitively say that Laguna de Leche is located
