      Step 1: Let me identify where Lake Baskunchak is located.

      Lake Baskunchak is a salt lake located in Russia, specifically in the Astrakhan
      Oblast, in the northern part of the Caspian Depression.


      Step 2: Let me identify where the Shammar Mountains are located.

      The Shammar Mountains (also known as Jabal Shammar) are located in northern
      Saudi Arabia, in the northwestern part of the Arabian Peninsula.


      Step 3: Compare the locations to determine their north-south relationship.

      Lake Baskunchak is in Russia, which is in the northern hemisphere, specifically
      in the southern part of Russia.

      The Shammar Mountains are in Saudi Arabia, which is much further south than
      Russia.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the relative positions.

      Since Saudi Arabia (where Shammar Mountains are) is located far south of Russia
      (where Lake Baskunchak is), the Shammar Mountains are located south of Lake
      Baskunchak.

      Step 1: Identify Lake Rukwa''s location.

      Lake Rukwa is located in southwestern Tanzania in East Africa. Tanzania is in
      the southern hemisphere, but in the eastern part of Africa.


      Step 2: Identify Lake Yliki''s location.

      Lake Yliki (also spelled Yliki or Iliki) is a lake in Greece, specifically in
      central Greece. Greece is in the northern hemisphere in southern Europe.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Tanzania is below the equator (in the southern hemisphere), while Greece is
      above the equator (in the northern hemisphere).


      Step 4: Determine their relative north-south positions.

      Since Lake Rukwa is in the southern hemisphere and Lake Yliki is in the northern
      hemisphere, Lake Rukwa is south of Lake Yliki.


      YES, Lake Rukwa is located south of Lake Yliki.'

      - The Yablonoi Mountains (also spelled Yablonovy) are a mountain range in Siberia,
      Russia, forming part of the watershed between the Arctic Ocean and the Pacific
      Ocean.

      - Dongting Lake is in central China, roughly between 28-30 degrees North latitude.

      - The Yablonoi Mountains are in southern Siberia, Russia, roughly between 50-55
      degrees North latitude.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Since Dongting Lake is at approximately 28-30 degrees North and the Yablonoi
      Mountains are at approximately 50-55 degrees North, Dongting Lake is located
      further south.


      NO, Dongting Lake is not located south of the Yablonoi Mountains. It is located

      Dongting Lake is located in northeastern Hunan Province in China. It''s one
      of China''s largest freshwater lakes and is situated in the middle-lower reaches
      of the Yangtze River basin, in central-eastern China.

      of eastern Siberia, forming part of the watershed between the Arctic Ocean and
      the Pacific Ocean.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      China is located south of Russia. Dongting Lake in central-eastern China is
      therefore south of the Yablonoi Mountains, which are in southern Siberia, Russia.


      NO.


      Wait, I need to correct myself. I made an error in my reasoning. Let me reconsider:


      The Yablonoi Mountains are in southern Siberia in Russia, which is in the northern
      part of Asia. Dongting Lake is in central-eastern China, which is south of Russia.
      Since Russia is north of China, and the Yablonoi Mountains are in Russia while
      Dongting Lake is in China, Dongting Lake is indeed south of the Yablonoi Mountains.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both Mambilla Plateau and Rif.

      - Mambilla Plateau is located in eastern Nigeria, in West Africa.

      - Rif (or the Rif Mountains) is located in northern Morocco, in North Africa.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on the north-south axis.

      - Morocco is in the northernmost part of Africa, bordering the Mediterranean
      Sea.

      - Nigeria is located much further south in West Africa, closer to the equator.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - The Rif Mountains are approximately between 34-36 degrees North latitude.

      - The Mambilla Plateau is approximately around 6-7 degrees North latitude.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since Mambilla Plateau is at a much lower latitude (closer to the equator)
      than Rif, it is located south of Rif.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both the Sudirman Range and the Philippine
      Sea.

      - The Sudirman Range is a mountain range in Papua, Indonesia (on the island
      of New Guinea).

      - The Philippine Sea is a marginal sea east of the Philippines and north of
      New Guinea.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - New Guinea (where the Sudirman Range is located) is south of the Philippine
      Sea.

      - The Sudirman Range specifically is in the central highlands of Papua/New Guinea.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - Since the Sudirman Range is in New Guinea, which is south of the Philippine
      Sea, the Sudirman Range is located south of the Philippine Sea.

      Clear Fork Reservoir is a reservoir in north-central Ohio, United States.


      North Star Bay is located in northwestern Greenland, specifically at Thule Air

      Since North Star Bay is in Greenland (which is far north in the Arctic region),

      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of both Carancahua Bay and Echo Lake
      (Montana).


      Step 2: Carancahua Bay is located on the Gulf Coast of Texas, near the cities
      of Port Lavaca and Palacios.


      Step 3: Echo Lake in Montana is located in the northwestern part of Montana,
      in Flathead County, near Glacier National Park.


      Step 4: To determine if one is south of the other, I need to compare their latitudes.
      Texas is located in the southern United States, while Montana is in the northern
      United States, bordering Canada.


      Step 5: Since Texas is significantly south of Montana, Carancahua Bay (in Texas)
      must be south of Echo Lake (in Montana).


      NO - the correct answer is YES. Carancahua Bay in Texas is indeed located south

      Texas is significantly south of Montana in terms of latitude. The entire state
      of Texas lies south of Montana.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Carancahua Bay is in Texas (a southern state) and Echo Lake is in Montana
      (a northern state), Carancahua Bay must be south of Echo Lake.

      Strait and Didicas Volcano to answer this question.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Gaspar Strait.

      Gaspar Strait is a strait located between Bangka Island and Belitung Island
      in Indonesia. It''s part of the Java Sea, which places it in Southeast Asia,
      specifically around the equator in the southern part of Indonesia.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Didicas Volcano.

      Didicas Volcano is located in the Philippines, specifically in the Babuyan Islands
      in the northern part of the Philippines. It''s a submarine volcano that has
      formed an island.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      The Philippines is located north of Indonesia. Specifically, Didicas Volcano
      in the northern Philippines is considerably north of Gaspar Strait in Indonesia.


      Step 4: Determine if Gaspar Strait is south of Didicas Volcano.

      Since the Philippines (where Didicas Volcano is located) is north of Indonesia
      (where Gaspar Strait is located), Gaspar Strait must be south of Didicas Volcano.


      YES, Gaspar Strait is located south of Didicas Volcano.'
