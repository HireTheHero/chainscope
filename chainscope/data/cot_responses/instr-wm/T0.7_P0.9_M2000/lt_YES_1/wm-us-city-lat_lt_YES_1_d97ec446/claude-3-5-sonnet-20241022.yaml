    aaaa85e9-7ef0-4d29-b6e5-fc8c841a276c: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. Key West and Stock Island are both in the Florida Keys


      2. Looking at their relative positions:

      - Stock Island is located immediately east of Key West

      - Both islands are oriented roughly east-west

      - In terms of latitude (north-south position), they are essentially at the same
      latitude


      3. Neither island is significantly north or south of the other - they are side
      by side


      Therefore, the answer is: NO


      Key West is not located south of Stock Island - they are at approximately the
      same latitude, with Stock Island being east of Key West.'

      - Both Kellogg and Smelterville are located in Shoshone County, Idaho

      2. Looking at their relative positions:

      - Looking at their latitude coordinates:

      - Kellogg is slightly north of Smelterville

      - They''re very close, but Kellogg sits slightly higher on the map

      2. Let me consider their states'' positions:

      - Oklahoma is located in the central part of the US

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern part of the US


      3. Comparing state positions:

      - New Mexico is directly west of Texas

      - Oklahoma is north of Texas

      - Therefore, New Mexico is southwest of Oklahoma


      4. Final geographic analysis:

      - Since El Valle de Arroyo Seco is in New Mexico and Kellyville is in Oklahoma

      - And New Mexico is southwest (not directly south) of Oklahoma

      - The New Mexico location is actually west and slightly south of the Oklahoma
      location


      NO


      (The answer is no because while El Valle de Arroyo Seco is slightly south of
      Kellyville, it''s primarily west of it. To be considered "south of" something,
      it should be more directly south rather than southwestern.)'

      1. Let me locate both cities:

      - Liberty Center, Ohio is in Henry County, in the northwestern part of Ohio


      2. Let me consider their relative positions:

      - St. John, IN is near the Illinois border in the very northern part of Indiana

      - Liberty Center, OH is in northern Ohio, but not at the extreme northern edge


      3. Since Indiana and Ohio are next to each other at roughly the same latitude,
      I can compare:

      - St. John is much closer to Lake Michigan, in the northern part of Indiana

      - Liberty Center is further south than the Lake Michigan shoreline


      4. Therefore, St. John, IN is actually NORTH of Liberty Center, OH
