      2. **Locate Paradise Heights, FL:** Paradise Heights is a neighborhood in Miami
      Gardens, Florida, in the southeastern part of the state.


      3. **Compare latitudes:** Texas is generally further west and slightly north
      of Florida.  Southern Texas is still significantly north of southern Florida.


      4. **Consider "south":**  "South" implies lower latitude.


      5. **Conclusion:** Port Lavaca, TX, having a higher latitude than Paradise Heights,
      FL, is NOT south of it.

      Valley, but further north along Interstate 5.


      3. **Compare their relative positions:**  Tracy is north of Modesto, and Riverbank
      is near Modesto. Therefore, Riverbank is south of Tracy.
