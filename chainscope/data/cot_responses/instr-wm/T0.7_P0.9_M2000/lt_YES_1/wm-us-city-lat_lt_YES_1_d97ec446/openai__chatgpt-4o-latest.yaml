      2. Brookfield Center, OH is an unincorporated community in Trumbull County,
      which is also in northeastern Ohio.

      3. To determine the relative positions, we note that Peninsula is situated near
      the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, south of Cleveland.

      4. Brookfield Center is located closer to the Pennsylvania border, northeast
      of Youngstown.

      5. Since Trumbull County (where Brookfield Center is) is generally north of
      Summit County (where Peninsula is), Brookfield Center is north of Peninsula.
