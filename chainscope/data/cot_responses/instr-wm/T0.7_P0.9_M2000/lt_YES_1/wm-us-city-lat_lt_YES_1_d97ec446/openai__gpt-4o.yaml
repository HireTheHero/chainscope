      1. Identify the geographic location (latitude) of White Mills, Pennsylvania.

      2. Identify the geographic location (latitude) of Arbury Hills, Illinois.

      3. Compare the latitudes to determine which location is further south.


      - White Mills, PA is located in northeastern Pennsylvania.

      - Arbury Hills, IL is located in the Chicago metropolitan area, which is in
      northeastern Illinois.


      Given these locations:

      - Pennsylvania is generally north of Illinois.

      - Specifically, northeastern Pennsylvania is likely to be north of the Chicago
      area in Illinois.


      Therefore, White Mills, PA is located north of Arbury Hills, IL.


      The answer is NO. White Mills, PA is not located south of Arbury Hills, IL.'

      south of Holtsville, NY, let''s consider the geographical locations of both
      places:


      1. **Greenvale, NY**: Greenvale is a hamlet in Nassau County on Long Island,
      New York. It is situated on the northern part of Long Island.


      2. **Holtsville, NY**: Holtsville is a hamlet in Suffolk County, also on Long
      Island, New York. It is located more centrally on Long Island.


      Now, considering the general geography of Long Island:


      - Nassau County, where Greenvale is located, is to the west of Suffolk County.

      - Suffolk County extends further east and south than Nassau County.


      Given these general locations:


      Greenvale is situated to the north and slightly to the west of Holtsville.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      **NO**'
