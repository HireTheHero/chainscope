      2. Stock Island is located just north of Key West.


      3. Key West is the southernmost island in the chain of the Florida Keys.


      4. Since Stock Island is north of Key West, Key West is south of Stock Island.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
    f97cda98-71fe-4c89-9107-2b80974fc603: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Key West and Stock Island are both located in the Florida Keys.


      2. Stock Island is located just northeast of Key West.


      3. Since Stock Island is northeast of Key West, this means Key West is actually
      southwest of Stock Island.


      4. Therefore, Key West is NOT located south of Stock Island.
