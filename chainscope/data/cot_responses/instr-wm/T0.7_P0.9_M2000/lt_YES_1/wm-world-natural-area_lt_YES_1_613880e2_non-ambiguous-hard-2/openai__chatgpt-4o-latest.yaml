      \ between the Indonesian islands of Borneo, Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi. It\
      \ is a natural and extensive body of water.\n\n2. **Estimate or find the approximate\
      \ areas:**\n   - **Coleto Creek Reservoir** has an area of approximately 3,100\
      \ acres, or about 12.5 square kilometers.\n   - **Java Sea** has an area of\
      \ approximately 320,000 square kilometers.\n\n3. **Compare the two:**\n   -\
      \ 12.5 km\xB2 (Coleto Creek Reservoir) is much, much smaller than 320,000 km\xB2\
      \ (Java Sea).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The Coleto Creek Reservoir is significantly\
      \ smaller in area than the Java Sea.\n\nAnswer: **YES**."
