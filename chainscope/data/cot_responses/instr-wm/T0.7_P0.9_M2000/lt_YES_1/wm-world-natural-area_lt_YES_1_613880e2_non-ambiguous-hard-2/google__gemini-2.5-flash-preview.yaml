      \ the final YES/NO answer.\n\n*   Chukchi Sea area is approximately 595,000\
      \ sq km.\n*   Irminger Sea area is approximately 480,000 sq km.\n*   595,000\
      \ sq km is greater than 480,000 sq km.\n*   Therefore, the Chukchi Sea does\
      \ *not* have a smaller area than the Irminger Sea.\n\nThe answer is NO.Here's\
      \ the step-by-step thinking:\n1.  Identify the two bodies of water being compared:\
      \ Chukchi Sea and Irminger Sea.\n2.  Find the approximate area of the Chukchi\
      \ Sea.\n3.  Find the approximate area of the Irminger Sea.\n4.  Compare the\
      \ two areas to determine if the Chukchi Sea's area is smaller than the Irminger\
      \ Sea's area.\n5.  The Chukchi Sea has an approximate area of 595,000 sq km.\n\
      6.  The Irminger Sea has an approximate area of 480,000 sq km.\n7.  Comparing\
      \ 595,000 sq km to 480,000 sq km, we see that 595,000 is greater than 480,000.\n\
      8.  Therefore, the Chukchi Sea does not have a smaller area than the Irminger\
      \ Sea.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{NO}$."
