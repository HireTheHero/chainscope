      between Greenland and Iceland. It is much smaller in area compared to the Chukchi
      Sea, with an estimated area of around 300,000 square kilometers.


      Based on these approximate measurements, the Chukchi Sea is larger in area than
      the Irminger Sea.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, the Chukchi Sea does not have a smaller area than
      the Irminger Sea.'

      Now, comparing the two:

      - Coleto Creek Reservoir is approximately 12.5 square kilometers.

      - Java Sea is approximately 320,000 square kilometers.


      From this comparison, it is clear that the Java Sea is significantly larger
