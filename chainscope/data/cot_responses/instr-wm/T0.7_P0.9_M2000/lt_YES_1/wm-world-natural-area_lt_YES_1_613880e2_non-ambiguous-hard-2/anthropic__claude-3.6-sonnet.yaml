      1) First, let me recall the size of Coleto Creek Reservoir:

      - Coleto Creek Reservoir is a man-made lake in Texas, USA

      - It has an area of approximately 3,100 acres (12.5 square kilometers)


      2) Now, let me recall the size of Java Sea:

      - Java Sea is a large body of water between the Indonesian islands

      - It covers an area of about 320,000 square kilometers


      3) Now I can compare:

      - Coleto Creek Reservoir: 12.5 square kilometers
