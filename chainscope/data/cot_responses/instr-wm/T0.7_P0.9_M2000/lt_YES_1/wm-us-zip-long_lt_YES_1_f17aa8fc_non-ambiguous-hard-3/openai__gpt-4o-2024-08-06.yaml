      is located west of 01430 in Massachusetts, we need to consider their relative
      geographical positions.


      1. Zip codes in the United States are generally assigned from east to west.
      Lower numbers are typically found on the East Coast, and higher numbers are
      on the West Coast.


      2. The zip code 01430 is in Massachusetts, which is located in the northeastern
