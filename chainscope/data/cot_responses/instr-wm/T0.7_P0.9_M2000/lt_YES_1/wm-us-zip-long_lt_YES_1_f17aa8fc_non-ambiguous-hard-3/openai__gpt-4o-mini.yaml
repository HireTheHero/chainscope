      Louisiana (LA) is located west of zip code 31636 in Georgia (GA), we need to
      consider the geographic locations of both zip codes.


      1. **Locate 70062**: The zip code 70062 is in the city of Kenner, Louisiana,
      which is located near New Orleans in the southeastern part of the state.


      2. **Locate 31636**: The zip code 31636 corresponds to the city of Valdosta,
      Georgia, which is situated in the southern part of Georgia, near the Florida
      border.


      3. **Compare Longitudes**: The primary method to determine if one location is
      west of another is to compare their longitudes. Louisiana (specifically Kenner)
      is generally located at a longitude of around -90 degrees, while Valdosta, Georgia,
      is located at a longitude of around -83 degrees.


      4. **Determine Position**: Since -90 degrees (Kenner, LA) is less than -83 degrees
      (Valdosta, GA), Kenner is west of Valdosta.


      Based on this analysis, we conclude that 70062 (LA) is indeed west of 31636

      state near Lake Michigan.


      2. **Identify the location of 03784, NH**: The zip code 03784 corresponds to
      the area of Woodsville, New Hampshire, which is located in the northern part
      of the state, near the border with Vermont.


      3. **Determine relative positions**: Michigan is to the west of New Hampshire
      when considering the overall geography of the United States. Since 49453 is
      in Michigan and 03784 is in New Hampshire, we need to check if 49453 is specifically
      west of the location of 03784.


      4. **Compare longitudes**: New Hampshire is generally east of Michigan. The
      longitude of 49453 is approximately -86.23, while the longitude of 03784 is
      approximately -72.06. Since -86.23 (Michigan) is west of -72.06 (New Hampshire),
      it confirms that 49453 is west of 03784.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      YES.'
