      west of 30342, GA?" we need to consider the geographic locations of these ZIP
      codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the ZIP codes.

      - ZIP code 75033 is in Frisco, Texas.

      - ZIP code 30342 is in Atlanta, Georgia.


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of Texas and Georgia.

      - Texas is located to the west of Georgia in the United States.


      Step 3: Confirm the specific cities'' positions.

      - Frisco, TX (75033) is in the northern part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex,
      which is in north-central Texas.

      - Atlanta, GA (30342) is in northern Georgia.


      Step 4: Compare the longitudes.

      - Frisco, TX (75033) is approximately at longitude -96.87.

      - Atlanta, GA (30342) is approximately at longitude -84.38.


      Step 5: Analyze the longitudes.

      - Longitude values become more negative as you go west, so a more negative longitude
      indicates a location further west.

      - Since -96.87 (Frisco) is more negative than -84.38 (Atlanta), Frisco is located
      further west than Atlanta.


      Final Answer: YES.'

      Texas is located west of ZIP code 32579 in Florida, we need to follow these
      steps:


      **Step 1: Identify the locations of the ZIP codes.**


      - ZIP code 77362 is in Texas. Specifically, it corresponds to the city of Pinehurst,
      TX, which is in southeastern Texas, northwest of Houston.


      - ZIP code 32579 is in Florida. It corresponds to Shalimar, FL, which is in
      the Florida Panhandle, near the Gulf Coast and close to Destin.


      **Step 2: Determine the longitudinal positions.**


      - Pinehurst, TX (ZIP 77362) has an approximate longitude of around -95.7 degrees.


      - Shalimar, FL (ZIP 32579) has an approximate longitude of around -86.6 degrees.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**


      - A more negative longitude means a location is farther west.


      - -95.7 (Texas) is more negative than -86.6 (Florida), so Pinehurst, TX is farther
      west than Shalimar, FL.


      **Conclusion:**


      YES, 77362, TX is located west of 32579, FL.'

      Step 1: Understand what the ZIP codes represent.

      - ZIP codes are numerical codes assigned by the United States Postal Service
      (USPS) to specific areas in the country.

      - Generally, ZIP codes increase from east to west across the country.

      - That means lower ZIP codes are typically found on the East Coast, and higher
      ZIP codes are found as you move westward.


      Step 2: Identify the locations of the two ZIP codes.

      - 07016 is a ZIP code in Cranford, New Jersey.

      - 45801 is a ZIP code in Lima, Ohio.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions of New Jersey and Ohio.

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast.

      - Ohio is located to the west of New Jersey, in the Midwest region of the U.S.


      Step 4: Confirm that Lima, OH (45801) is geographically west of Cranford, NJ
      (07016).

      - By looking at a map, we can confirm that Lima, Ohio is indeed west of Cranford,
      New Jersey.

      **Step 1: Identify the cities and states associated with the ZIP codes.**


      - **ZIP code 67218** is located in Wichita, Kansas.

      - **ZIP code 63670** is located in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri.


      **Step 2: Understand the general geography of Kansas and Missouri.**


      - Kansas is located to the west of Missouri.

      - Wichita is in south-central Kansas.

      - Ste. Genevieve is in eastern Missouri, near the Mississippi River (which forms
      the eastern border of Missouri).
