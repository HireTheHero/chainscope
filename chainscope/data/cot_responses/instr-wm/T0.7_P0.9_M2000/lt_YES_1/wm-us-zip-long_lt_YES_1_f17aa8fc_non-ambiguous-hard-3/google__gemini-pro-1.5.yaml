      70712 is in Baker, LA (near Baton Rouge). Both cities confirm the general east-west

      2. **General US Geography:** Texas is generally west of Louisiana.


      3. **Specific Longitude Needed?:**  While there can be some slight north-south
      variations within each state, the general east-west relationship of the states
      makes it highly probable that a TX zip code will be west of an LA zip code.  Therefore,
      checking specific longitude is likely unnecessary.

      ZIP code:** 45371 is in Ohio, and 19043 is in Pennsylvania.

      2. **Determine the relative east-west positions of Ohio and Pennsylvania:**
      Ohio is generally west of Pennsylvania.

      3. **Consider if there are any exceptions:** While Ohio is mostly west of Pennsylvania,
      a small portion of eastern Ohio might be on the same longitude as western Pennsylvania.
      However, ZIP code 45371 (Ohio) is centrally located in Ohio. ZIP code 19043
      (Pennsylvania) is in southeastern Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia.

      4. **Conclusion:** Since Ohio is generally west of Pennsylvania, and the specific
      ZIP codes reinforce this general location (central Ohio vs. southeastern Pennsylvania),
      45371, OH is indeed west of 19043, PA.

      Wilmington, NC is at approximately -77.9 longitude. Pauline, SC is at approximately

      need to find the longitude of 76001 (Texas) and 36107 (Alabama).  Longitude
      determines east/west position.


      2. **Compare the longitudes:** Higher longitude values are further west. We''ll
      compare the longitudes to see which is greater.


      3. **Determine west/east:**  If 76001 has a higher longitude than 36107, then
      it is west of 36107.


      Using a zip code lookup, we find:

      * 76001 (Arlington, TX) is approximately at -97.1 longitude.

      * 36107 (Montgomery, AL) is approximately at -86.3 longitude.


      Since -97.1 is less than -86.3, 76001 is west of 36107.

      2. **General US Geography:** Texas is significantly west of Florida.
