      \nI'm focusing on the geographical relationship between zip codes 92672 (California)\
      \ and 85013 (Arizona). I've broken down the inputs, identifying each zip code\
      \ and its associated state. I'm now exploring methods to determine their relative\
      \ geographical positions on a west-east axis.\n\n\n**Assessing East-West Proximity**\n\
      \nI've determined that 92672 is in San Clemente, CA, and 85013 is in Phoenix,\
      \ AZ. My current step is comparing their east-west positions, leveraging a map\
      \ of the United States. I plan to use the visual aid to ascertain which city\
      \ is located further west on the map and determine the geographical relationship\
      \ between the two.\n\n\n**Verifying Geographical Westness**\n\nI've determined\
      \ that San Clemente, CA, is located west of Phoenix, AZ. Now I'm consolidating\
      \ the process. It involved identifying locations, consulting a US map, and confirming\
      \ the relationship. To solidify my certainty, I also found the approximate longitudes\
      \ of both cities, with San Clemente having a more negative (and thus more westward)\
      \ longitude.  I'm confident in my conclusion.\n\n\n**Concluding Spatial Relationship**\n\
      \nI've determined San Clemente, CA, is west of Phoenix, AZ. To solidify my certainty,\
      \ I retrieved their approximate longitudes. San Clemente's is approximately\
      \ -117.6\xB0 W, while Phoenix's is roughly -112.1\xB0 W. With San Clemente's\
      \ longitude being a more negative value, this confirms that it is west of Phoenix.\

      I''ve zeroed in on the core inquiry: determining the relative geographic position
      of two zip codes. Currently, I''m breaking down the initial request. My preliminary
      step involves extracting and clarifying the specific input: zip code 15057.
      Further steps include researching and deconstructing the specific location requests.



      **Determining Geographical Positions**


      I''m now fully immersed in the core problem and have refined the specific inquiries:
      is zip code 15057 (PA) west of 07871 (NJ)? I''ve deconstructed the user''s question,
      including input analysis and desired output formats. I''ve begun locating the
      zip codes. I''ve found 15057 corresponds to Library, PA, near Pittsburgh in
      western PA. I''ve also located 07871 as Sparta, NJ, which is in northwestern
      New Jersey. My next step will be to compare these geographical locations.



      **Comparing Geographical Locations**


      I''ve now mapped the two zip codes. I''ve pinpointed that 15057 (Library, PA)
      is in Western Pennsylvania, and 07871 (Sparta, NJ) is in Northwestern New Jersey.
      I''ve formulated the comparison steps: First I''ll identify the locations, then
      compare them. I''ll explain that because Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey,
      any location within PA is geographically west of any location within NJ. Therefore,
      the answer is clear.



      **Synthesizing the Explanation**


      I''ve formulated a detailed plan for presenting the geographic comparison. I''ve
      broken it down into locating the zip codes, determining their specific locations
      within Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and then comparing their positions. My plan
      includes step-by-step reasoning and a final yes/no answer. I''ll highlight that
      Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey, making any location in PA west of any location
      in NJ. I''ll test the output.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of 15057, PA:** This zip code is for Library, Pennsylvania,
      which is a suburb of Pittsburgh in the western part of the state.

      2.  **Identify the location of 07871, NJ:** This zip code is for Sparta, New
      Jersey, which is in the northwestern part of the state.

      3.  **Compare the two locations:** The state of Pennsylvania is entirely to
      the west of the state of New Jersey. Therefore, any location in western Pennsylvania
      is geographically west of any location in New Jersey.

      OH. This zip code corresponds to Rocky River, a western suburb of Cleveland,
      Ohio.

      2.  Next, we identify the geographical location of the zip code 18037, PA. This
      zip code corresponds to Catasauqua, a borough near Allentown in eastern Pennsylvania.

      3.  Finally, we compare the two locations. The state of Ohio is entirely west
      of the state of Pennsylvania. More specifically, Cleveland, Ohio is geographically
      located to the west of Allentown, Pennsylvania.


      Therefore, 44116, OH is located west of 18037, PA.

      zip code is west of the Iowa zip code. Now, I''m methodically dissecting the
      problem into a set of actionable steps, focusing on location identification.



      **Evaluating the States'' Locations**


      I''ve pinpointed the Wyoming zip code in Casper, and the Iowa zip code in Sioux
      Center. Considering their states, Wyoming is in the Mountain West and Iowa in
      the Midwest. Based on a mental map and regional knowledge, Wyoming is undeniably
      west of Iowa. Thus, the original question is answered: Yes.



      **Mapping the Longitudes**


      I''ve calculated the longitudes now to confirm the relative positioning. Casper,
      WY, at approximately -106.3 degrees, and Sioux Center, IA, around -96.1 degrees.
      The longitude comparison confirms Casper''s position as west. All is well, and
      I am now constructing the conclusive answer.



      **Confirming the Conclusion**


      I''ve reviewed all steps, the location verifications, and the comparison, confirming
      Wyoming''s western position relative to Iowa. I''ve now constructed the structured
      output, including the reasoning steps and the final, conclusive answer. The

      **Confirming Geographic Relationships**


      I''ve now formulated a clear, step-by-step plan: First, I identified the locations
      associated with each zip code, New Geneva, PA, and Ramsey, NJ. Then, I compared
      their general locations within their respective states. The core concept of
      "west vs. east" is now clearly understood, and I have verified the answer with
      the exact longitudes of both locations. This approach confirms the answer.

      I''ve broken down the user''s request into manageable steps. My current plan
      involves pinpointing the locations of both zip codes and then comparing their
      positions. This will involve a clear geographical comparison and longitude verification.

      1.  First, we need to identify the location associated with the zip code 15468,
      PA. This zip code corresponds to New Geneva, Pennsylvania, which is in the southwestern
      part of the state.

      2.  Next, we identify the location for zip code 07440, NJ. This zip code corresponds
      to Ramsey, New Jersey, which is in the northeastern part of the state.

      3.  Finally, we compare the two locations geographically. The entire state of
      Pennsylvania is located to the west of the entire state of New Jersey. Therefore,
      any location in Pennsylvania is west of any location in New Jersey.

      their relative positions is the key: since Illinois is in the Midwest and New
      Jersey is on the East Coast, the Midwest (and thus Chicago) must be west of
      the East Coast (and thus Long Valley). This establishes the crucial relationship:
      60626 is indeed west of 07852. I''m now documenting the step-by-step reasoning
      for clarity.



      **Summarizing the Logic**


      I''ve refined my approach to address the user''s query. I''ve broken it down
      into locating each zip code''s corresponding city and state, then comparing
      their geographical positions.  My plan is to detail each step, clearly establishing
      the spatial relationship, culminating in a conclusive "YES."



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to identify the city and state for each zip code.

      2.  The zip code 60626 is in Chicago, Illinois.

      3.  The zip code 07852 is in Long Valley, New Jersey.

      4.  Next, we compare the geographical locations of Illinois and New Jersey.
      Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States, while New Jersey is
      an East Coast state.

      5.  Geographically, Illinois is located to the west of New Jersey.


      Therefore, 60626, IL is located west of 07852, NJ.

      I''ve started by identifying the core question: determining the relative west-east
      geographic positioning of two zip codes. I''m now focused on deconstructing
      the input. First up, recognizing 60626. Next, I''ll look to find 07852. I''ll
      need a reference to map these.



      **Formulating the Reasoning**


      I''m now breaking down the comparison of the two zip codes. I am identifying
      each location by state. I will then compare those states to establish the final
      geographic relationship. I believe that I have the basic framework of my answer.



      **Outlining the Procedure**


      I''ve now expanded on the framework to include concrete steps. I''ve broken
      down the process into specific actions, from identifying zip codes and states
      to formulating a final "YES" or "NO" answer. This should provide a clear and
      direct answer.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to identify the location associated with the zip code 60626,
      IL. This zip code is for a northern part of Chicago, Illinois.

      2.  Next, we need to identify the location associated with the zip code 07852,
      NJ. This zip code is for Long Valley, New Jersey.

      3.  Finally, we compare the geographical locations of the two states. Illinois
      is in the Midwestern United States, while New Jersey is on the East Coast.

      4.  On a map of the United States, Illinois is located to the west of New Jersey.

      I''m currently focused on defining the geographic positions of the zip codes.
      Finding the location of 15139 is the first step in this analytical process.



      **Locating Zip Code Positions**


      I''ve determined that 15139 is in Tarentum, PA, near Pittsburgh in Western PA,
      while 07432 is in Oakland, NJ, near NYC. My analysis showed that Pennsylvania
      is west of New Jersey. Thus, the zip code in Pennsylvania is geographically
      west of the one in New Jersey.



      **Establishing Geolocation Logic**


      I''ve established that 15139 (Tarentum, PA) is west of 07432 (Oakland, NJ) by
      identifying both locations and comparing their positions. My logic is now formalized
      with step-by-step reasoning that clearly supports the final "YES" answer. The
      process is optimized for direct, concise answers.



      **Refining the Geolocation Logic**


      I''ve refined the logic by explicitly stating the US location of the zip codes,
      then comparing their relative positions. Tarentum, PA, is near Pittsburgh in
      Western PA, and Oakland, NJ, is near NYC in Northeastern NJ. Pennsylvania is
      west of New Jersey. Thus, the PA zip code is west of the NJ zip code, leading
      to a direct "YES" answer. The reasoning is now more concise and geographical
      comparison is more clear.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of 15139, PA:** This zip code is for Tarentum, Pennsylvania,
      which is located in Allegheny County in the western part of Pennsylvania.

      2.  **Identify the location of 07432, NJ:** This zip code is for Oakland, New
      Jersey, which is located in Bergen County in the northeastern part of New Jersey.

      3.  **Compare the locations:** On a map of the United States, the state of Pennsylvania
      is west of the state of New Jersey. More specifically, western Pennsylvania
      is significantly west of northeastern New Jersey.


      Therefore, 15139, PA is located west of 07432, NJ.

      \nI've identified the core question and deconstructed the user's request to\
      \ pinpoint the inputs, the relationship to be checked, and the desired output\
      \ format. The plan is to determine the longitudes. I'm currently locating the\
      \ cities and gathering their longitudes via search. The search results show\
      \ East St. Louis, IL, and Okolona, KY.\n\n\n**Mapping the Longitudes**\n\nI've\
      \ now expanded on the initial approach. I've identified the input and output\
      \ requirements, and devised the step-by-step methodology, including the comparison\
      \ logic. I've begun searching and compiling the necessary longitude values for\

      \ reasoning:\n\n1.  First, we need to identify the geographical location, specifically\
      \ the longitude, of zip code 62207, IL. This zip code corresponds to the area\
      \ of East St. Louis, Illinois. The approximate longitude for this area is -90.1\xB0\
      \ W.\n\n2.  Next, we identify the geographical location and longitude of zip\
      \ code 40219, KY. This zip code corresponds to the area of Louisville, Kentucky.\
      \ The approximate longitude for this area is -85.7\xB0 W.\n\n3.  To determine\
      \ if one location is west of another, we compare their longitudes. In the Western\
      \ Hemisphere, a more negative longitude value (a larger number after the minus\
      \ sign) means it is further west.\n\n4.  Comparing the two longitudes, -90.1\xB0\
      \ is more negative than -85.7\xB0. Therefore, 62207, IL is located west of 40219,\
      \ KY.\n\nYES"

      2.  Next, we identify the geographical location of zip code 40219, KY. This\

      west of zip code 32579 in Florida. I''ve begun to break down the input, starting
      with zip code 77362 in Texas. Next, I will look up their actual locations and
      compare them.



      **Analyzing Zip Code Positions**


      I''ve determined that zip code 77362 is for New Caney, TX, and 32579 is for
      Navarre, FL. To compare locations, I will analyze their longitudes: a more westerly
      location has a more negative longitude value. I know that Texas is generally
      west of Florida. Next, I plan to compare longitude values specifically to confirm
      that New Caney, TX is west of Navarre, FL.



      **Confirming Geographic Placement**


      I''ve determined that 77362 is indeed west of 32579. To confirm, I analyzed
      the approximate longitudes of New Caney, TX and Navarre, FL, respectively. I
      also established the fact that Texas is located to the west of Florida, and
      furthermore, southeastern Texas is located to the west of the Florida Panhandle.



      **Refining Reasoning Steps**


      I''m focused on consolidating the steps into a clear, logical sequence.  I started
      by pinpointing the locations of the zip codes. Then I compared the locations,
      specifically longitudes. Based on that, I confirmed the initial geographical
      relationship. Now I am formulating a clear response to the original query.

      3.  Finally, we compare the geographical locations. New Caney, Texas, is located
      in the southeastern part of Texas. Navarre, Florida, is located in the Florida
      Panhandle.

      4.  Geographically, the entire state of Texas is west of the entire state of

      I''ve identified the two ZIP codes and their associated cities: Anderson, Indiana
      and Highland Mills, New York. My focus is now on comparing these locations geographically.
      I''m mapping them mentally. Indiana is in the Midwest, and New York is on the

      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to identify the location of the zip code 44627, OH. This
      zip code corresponds to Fredericksburg, Ohio.

      2.  Next, we identify the location of the zip code 10598, NY. This zip code
      corresponds to Yorktown Heights, New York.

      3.  Finally, we compare the geographical locations of these two places. The
      state of Ohio is located entirely to the west of the state of New York. Therefore,
      any location in Ohio is west of any location in New York.

      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to identify the city or area associated with the zip code
      30354, GA. This zip code corresponds to the southern part of Atlanta, Georgia,
      near the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.

      2.  Next, we identify the city or area for 29405, SC. This zip code corresponds
      to North Charleston, South Carolina.

      3.  Finally, we compare the geographical locations of Atlanta, GA, and North
      Charleston, SC. Atlanta is located in north-central Georgia, while North Charleston
      is on the Atlantic coast of South Carolina. The entire state of Georgia is west
      of the coastal part of South Carolina. Therefore, Atlanta, GA is located west
      of North Charleston, SC.

      \ Initially, my thought process involved retrieving latitude and longitude coordinates.\
      \ I'm now refining that by considering the Earth's curvature, since the distance\
      \ between the two zip codes will have a large degree of effect on the positioning.\n\
      \n\n**Analyzing Latitude & Longitude**\n\nI've identified the longitude coordinates\

      \ SC) at -79.99\xB0 W.  Now, I'll directly compare these longitudes to determine\
      \ if the zip code in Georgia is west of the one in South Carolina. The comparison\
      \ appears pretty straightforward now, given the data acquired.\n\n\n**Reasoning\
      \ the Conclusion**\n\nI've now rigorously validated the logic for the conclusion.\
      \ My process was methodical: identifying city/state pairs from the zip codes;\

      of two US zip codes. Now, the focus is on extracting the relevant zip code information
      and associated states. From this data, a geographical comparison can be constructed.



      **Assessing State Positioning**


      I''ve identified the locations: Terre Haute, IN, and Perkasie, PA. My next step
      involves confirming the relative positioning of the states. A visual check of
      a US map quickly establishes Indiana''s westward location relative to Pennsylvania.
      Therefore, the geographical relation should be true.

      extracting the two zip codes, preparing the groundwork for the comparison. My
      next step is to research these zip codes for their general areas.



      **Analyzing Geographic Coordinates**


      I''ve successfully pinpointed the locations, finding Cahokia, IL, and Centreville,
      VA. Cahokia is in southwestern Illinois near St. Louis, while Centreville is
      in northern Virginia, near D.C. Now, I''m ready to compare the positions and
      determine if Cahokia is west of Centreville.



      **Evaluating Locational Relationships**


      I''ve now mapped the geographical areas and cities associated with both zip
      codes. Cahokia, IL, is located in the Midwest and Centreville, VA, is on the
      East Coast. My focus has shifted to comparing the relative positions of these
      locations within the broader continental context. I''m confirming my reasoning,
      and preparing to articulate the geographical relationship.



      **Defining Zip Code Locations**


      I''m now assembling the pieces: 62204 is Cahokia, IL, and 20121 is Centreville,
      VA. I''m charting the locations on a mental map. My next step is to refine the
      geographical relationship between the two locations, clarifying the continental
      positioning for the final answer.

      1.  First, we need to identify the location of the zip code 62204, IL. This
      zip code corresponds to Cahokia, Illinois, which is in the Midwestern United
      States, near St. Louis, Missouri.

      2.  Next, we identify the location of the zip code 20121, VA. This zip code
      corresponds to Centreville, Virginia, which is in the eastern United States,
      near Washington, D.C.

      3.  When looking at a map of the United States, the state of Illinois is located
      geographically to the west of the state of Virginia.

      4.  Therefore, Cahokia, IL (62204) is west of Centreville, VA (20121).

      two zip codes and the relationship being tested, "west of". This helps clarify
      the specific geographical comparison needed.



      **Analyzing State Positions**


      I''ve successfully identified the towns associated with the zip codes. Then,
      I looked at Michigan in the Midwest and New Hampshire on the East Coast. The
      comparison of longitudes seems like the next obvious step to determine the east-west
      relationship. I also made sure to consider where each state is located in the
      USA, to check the overall position.

      I''ve started by pinpointing the core problem: determining the relative geographic
      positions of the two zip codes. Next, I''m breaking down the problem into its
      essential components. I need to figure out what information is necessary to
      answer the question.



      **Comparing Geographical Locations**


      I''ve compared the locations. I know Coaldale, PA, is in eastern Pennsylvania,
      and Stonington, CT, is in southeastern Connecticut. Pennsylvania is west of
      Connecticut, thus, zip code 18218 is west of zip code 06379.



      **Reasoning Through the Solution**


      I''ve clearly articulated the logical steps: pinpoint the zip code locations,
      then assess their relative positions. Furthermore, I''m now focusing on the
      specific locations within each state, using Coaldale, PA, and Stonington, CT,
      as examples.



      **Evaluating the Longitude**


      I''m now crunching the longitude data to confirm my conclusion. Specifically,
      I''ve determined the approximate longitude for each zip code. It seems that
      the greater the value of the longitude in degrees West, the further west the
      location.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to identify the locations for each zip code.

      2.  The zip code 18218 is for Coaldale, Pennsylvania (PA).

      3.  The zip code 06379 is for Stonington, Connecticut (CT).

      4.  Next, we compare the geographical locations of Pennsylvania and Connecticut.
      The entire state of Pennsylvania is located to the west of the entire state
      of Connecticut.

      5.  Therefore, any location in Pennsylvania is west of any location in Connecticut.

      longitude comparison, and will base my final "yes/no" response on this analysis.
      My next step will be to verify the precise longitudes for each location.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to identify the city and state for each zip code.

      2.  The zip code 46203 is located in Indianapolis, Indiana.

      3.  The zip code 20032 is located in Washington, D.C.

      4.  Next, we compare the geographical locations of Indianapolis, IN, and Washington,
      D.C. on a map of the United States.

      5.  Indianapolis, Indiana is in the Midwest. Washington, D.C. is on the East
      Coast.

      \nI'm currently focused on the core question: Determining the relative geographical\
      \ position of zip codes 77340 and 39530. Breaking it down, I understand I need\
      \ the longitude of each zip code to determine which is further west. Currently,\
      \ I'm working to figure out how to retrieve this longitude data efficiently.\n\
      \n\n**Calculating Longitude Differences**\n\nI've determined that 77340 (Humble,\
      \ TX) has a longitude of approximately -95.26\xB0, while 39530 (Biloxi, MS)\
      \ sits at roughly -88.88\xB0. I understand that in the Western Hemisphere, more\
      \ negative longitudes are further west. Comparing the two values, I see that\
      \ -95.26 is more negative than -88.88. Therefore, 77340 is indeed located west\
      \ of 39530. I've successfully answered the user's core question.\n\n\n**Synthesizing\

      \ West. Biloxi, MS is at a longitude of approximately 88.88\xB0 West.\n4.  **Determine\
      \ the directional relationship.** On a map of the United States, a location\
      \ with a higher West longitude (like 95.26\xB0 W) is farther west than a location\
      \ with a lower West longitude (like 88.88\xB0 W). Therefore, Humble, TX is west\

      I''ve established the core question: comparing the geographical positions of
      two zip codes. My next step involves breaking down the input, specifically the
      zip codes 43207 and 10457. This deconstruction is crucial for the next phase,
      comparing their respective longitudes.



      **Comparing Geographical Locations**


      I''ve successfully identified the city/area associated with each zip code: Columbus,
      OH (43207) and The Bronx, NYC (10457). Now, the key comparison is between Columbus,
      Ohio, and The Bronx, New York City. I''m leveraging my existing geographical
      knowledge of the US states to determine their relative east/west positions,
      and thus the answer to the core question.



      **Confirming Geographical Westwardness**


      I''ve clearly defined the step-by-step reasoning and am now confident in the
      answer. The process involved identifying locations, comparing geographical positions,
      and confirming the Midwest''s position relative to the Northeast. I''ve also
      verified this by considering longitude coordinates. The final answer, confirming
      43207''s westward position, is clear.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of the first zip code:** 43207 is a US zip code
      located in Columbus, Ohio.

      2.  **Identify the location of the second zip code:** 10457 is a US zip code
      located in The Bronx, New York.

      3.  **Compare the geographical positions:** Ohio is a state in the Midwestern
      United States. New York is a state in the Northeastern United States. Geographically,
      Ohio is located to the west of New York.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, Columbus, Ohio (43207) is west of The Bronx,
      New York (10457).

      \nI've zeroed in on the core query: determining the relative west-east positions\
      \ of two zip codes. Now, I'm breaking the process down into actionable steps.\
      \ First, I'll research the geographical coordinates of both zip codes. That\
      \ initial step feels solid, and I'll move on from there!\n\n\n**Analyzing Locational\
      \ Data**\n\nI've identified the precise locations of both zip codes. I've found\
      \ Stilwell, Kansas, and Follansbee, West Virginia. Now, comparing them is the\

      references for the two states. I''ll compare the results, which will involve
      comparing the longitudinal locations. The conclusion will be derived from these
      comparisons.



      **Refining the Logical Steps**


      I''ve refined my approach: pinpointing the zip codes, which I know are in Kansas
      and West Virginia. I''m now creating a step-by-step explanation. This involves
      comparing state-level positions. Kansas is in the Midwest, and West Virginia
      is in the East. My conclusion, derived from this comparison, will answer the

      I''m focusing on the user''s question: determining the relative east-west position
      of two US zip codes. I need to figure out how to give them a simple "YES" or
      "NO" answer. My current plan is to provide the reasoning behind it too.



      **Analyzing Geographical Positions**


      I''ve determined that 73142 is in Oklahoma City, OK and 30534 is in Dawsonville,
      GA. Now I''m comparing Oklahoma and Georgia''s locations. I''m visualizing a
      map to understand their relative positions. Georgia is in the southeastern US,
      while Oklahoma is in the South Central US, making Oklahoma west of Georgia.



      **Finalizing the Reasoning**


      I''m structuring the output to clearly explain the process. I''m focusing on
      presenting the steps logically: identifying the locations, comparing them geographically,
      and then concluding with the answer. I plan to use a clear step-by-step format
      to ensure easy understanding, before providing the final "YES".



      **Finalizing the Output**


      I''m now putting the final touches on the output structure. I''ve re-reviewed
      the step-by-step logic, and it''s crystal clear. The geographical comparison
      and the final YES are well-supported. I''m focusing on ensuring it''s concise,
      easily understandable and that I''ve answered the user''s question, and provided
      a reasoning behind the answer.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we identify the location associated with zip code 73142, OK. This
      zip code corresponds to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

      2.  Next, we identify the location associated with zip code 30534, GA. This
      zip code corresponds to Dawsonville, Georgia.

      3.  Finally, we compare the geographical positions of Oklahoma and Georgia on
      a map of the United States. Oklahoma is located to the west of Georgia.

      of Oklahoma''s 73142 versus Georgia''s 30534. My initial focus is on deconstructing
      the request. I''ll need to pinpoint the precise location of 73142, OK, as the
      first step in this geographic comparison.



      **Refining Geographic Comparison**


      I''m now fully immersed in the comparison. After locating the zip codes, I''m
      focusing on longitude comparison. My logic is clear: Westward locations have
      smaller longitude values. I''ve found Oklahoma City''s longitude and Dawsonville''s.
      Now, it''s a simple matter of direct comparison to determine the final answer,
      which I''ll present with a concise explanation.



      **Determining Westward Position**


      I''ve finalized my reasoning and steps. After identifying each zip code''s location
      (Oklahoma City, OK and Dawsonville, GA), I confirmed Oklahoma''s westward position
      relative to Georgia on a US map. The formal steps are ready for presentation,
      starting with location identification and culminating in the clear conclusion:
      Yes, 73142 is west of 30534. The whole process is now complete.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of the first zip code:** 73142 is a zip code for
      Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

      2.  **Identify the location of the second zip code:** 30534 is a zip code for
      Dawsonville, Georgia.

      3.  **Compare the states'' locations:** On a map of the United States, the state
      of Oklahoma is located geographically to the west of the state of Georgia.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, any location in Oklahoma is west of any location
      in Georgia.

      \nI'm currently focused on determining if zip code 84056 is west of 80487. To\
      \ achieve this, I've broken down the problem: first, finding the geographical\
      \ coordinates (latitude and longitude) associated with each zip code, then determining\
      \ their relative positioning. The aim now is to acquire this geographical data,\
      \ which is key to answering the core question.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Geographic\
      \ Coordinates**\n\n\\n\\nI've now successfully pinpointed the geographical coordinates\

      \ and incontrovertible.\n\n\n</think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n\
      1.  First, we need to identify the city and state associated with each zip code.\n\
      \    *   The zip code 84056 is for Spanish Fork, Utah.\n    *   The zip code\
      \ 80487 is for Steamboat Springs, Colorado.\n\n2.  Next, we need to determine\
      \ the geographical relationship between Utah and Colorado. The state of Utah\
      \ is located directly to the west of the state of Colorado.\n\n3.  Finally,\
      \ we can determine the relative positions. Since Spanish Fork, UT, is in a state\
      \ that is entirely west of Colorado, where Steamboat Springs is located, Spanish\
      \ Fork must be west of Steamboat Springs. To be more precise, we can look at\
      \ their longitudes:\n    *   Spanish Fork, UT is at approximately 111.6\xB0\
      \ W longitude.\n    *   Steamboat Springs, CO is at approximately 106.8\xB0\
      \ W longitude.\n\n4.  A location with a higher western longitude number (e.g.,\
      \ 111.6\xB0 W) is farther west than a location with a lower western longitude\
      \ number (e.g., 106.8\xB0 W). Therefore, 84056, UT is west of 80487, CO.\n\n\
