    004504f9-78d1-4b6e-ac7b-1df3158db256: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, identify the authors and books:

      - The Baroness Rendell of Babergh (Ruth Rendell) wrote "Shake Hands Forever"

      - Edward Abbey wrote "The Monkey Wrench Gang"


      2. Research the publication dates:

      - "Shake Hands Forever" was published in 1975

      - "The Monkey Wrench Gang" was published in 1975


      3. Compare the publication dates:

      - Both books were published in the same year (1975)

      - Since they were published in the same year, neither was released "earlier"
      than the other


      4. Therefore, the answer is NO. Neither book was released earlier than the other.


      NO'

      1. Richard Preston''s "Micro" was published posthumously in 2011, after Preston''s
      death. The book was partially written by Michael Crichton and completed by Preston.


      2. Michael Connelly''s "The Drop" was published in 2011 as well.


      3. Specifically, "Micro" was published in November 2011.

      2. Louise Rennison''s "Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging" was published
      in 1999.

      1. First, I''ll find the publication date for Steven Gould''s "Exo"

      - "Exo" was published on September 10, 2014


      2. Next, I''ll find the publication date for Bernard Cornwell''s "Waterloo:
      The History of Four Days, Three Armies and Three Battles"

      3. Compare the publication dates

      - Cornwell''s book was published on May 5, 2014

      - Gould''s book was published on September 10, 2014

      - This means Cornwell''s book came out earlier


      4. Answer the specific question: Was Gould''s "Exo" released earlier than Cornwell''s
      "Waterloo"?

      - No, it was not


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'
