      Days, Three Armies and Three Battles," we need to identify the release dates
      for both books.


      1. **Steven Gould''s "Exo":** "Exo" is the fourth book in the Jumper series
      by Steven Gould. It was published on August 5, 2014.


      2. **Bernard Cornwell''s "Waterloo: The History of Four Days, Three Armies and
      Three Battles":** This book was published on September 11, 2014.


      Now that we have both release dates:


      - "Exo" was released on August 5, 2014.

      - "Waterloo: The History of Four Days, Three Armies and Three Battles" was released
      on September 11, 2014.


      Comparing these dates shows that "Exo" was released earlier than "Waterloo."


      Therefore, the answer is YES.'

      \u6B77\u7A0B\":** Zhao Ziyang's memoir was published posthumously. The English\
      \ version, \"Prisoner of the State,\" was released in 2009. This is the relevant\

      \ in 2009. Without specific dates for these releases, we generally consider\
      \ them as being released in the same year.\n\nTherefore, based on the information\

      \ one was released earlier than the other based solely on the year. However,\
      \ since the first two volumes of \"1Q84\" were released in Japan in May 2009,\
      \ and without specific earlier publication details for \"\u6539\u9769\u6B77\u7A0B\

      1. "Catching Fire" by Suzanne Collins is the second book in the "Hunger Games"
      series. It was published on September 1, 2009.


      2. "Summertime" by J. M. Coetzee is a fictionalized memoir and was released
      in 2009 as well. However, specific publication dates can vary by country, usually
      around August 2009.


      Comparing these dates:


      - "Summertime" was generally released in August 2009.

      - "Catching Fire" was released on September 1, 2009.


      Therefore, "Summertime" was released earlier than "Catching Fire."


      NO, Suzanne Collins''s "Catching Fire" was not released earlier than J. M. Coetzee''s
      "Summertime."'
