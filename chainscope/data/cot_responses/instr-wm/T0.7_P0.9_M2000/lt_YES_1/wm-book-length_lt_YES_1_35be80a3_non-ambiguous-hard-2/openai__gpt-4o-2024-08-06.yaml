      1. "If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer" is not authored by Dominick Dunne.
      It was written by O.J. Simpson with contributions from the Goldman family and
      Dominick Dunne wrote the afterword. The book is approximately 208 pages long.

      - "If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer" has about 208 pages.

      - "Tales from Jabba''s Palace" has about 400 pages.

      1. **Sharon Moalem''s Book:** The full title of Sharon Moalem''s book is "The

      However, the book you mentioned, "Why We Look, Smell, Taste, Feel, and Act the

      Child, is part of the Pendergast series and was published in 2015. "Crimson
      Shore" has approximately 352 pages.
