    98b9fcd6-0299-40fc-a99f-e87a71362572: 'Okay, let''s break this down.


      **Step 1: Find the page count for Whitley Strieber''s *Billy*.**

      A common edition of Whitley Strieber''s *Billy* (e.g., the Tor Books paperback
      published in 1991) has **400 pages**. Other editions might vary slightly (e.g.,
      some hardcovers are listed around 384 pages).


      **Step 2: Find the page count for Peter Straub''s *Black House*.**

      *Black House* was co-authored by Peter Straub and Stephen King. A common edition
      (e.g., the Random House hardcover first edition) has **625 pages**. Paperback
      editions are often longer, sometimes listed as 672 or even 784 pages.


      **Step 3: Compare the page counts.**

      Comparing the common editions:

      *   *Billy*: ~384-400 pages

      *   *Black House*: ~625-784 pages


      Even taking the longest listed common edition for *Billy* (400 pages) and the
      shortest listed common edition for *Black House* (625 pages), 400 is fewer than
      625.


      **Step 4: Determine the answer.**

      Since the page count of *Billy* is less than the page count of *Black House*
      across their typical editions, Whitley Strieber''s *Billy* does have fewer pages
      than Peter Straub''s *Black House*.

      but he is not the author or editor of the entire book.

      4.  **Find the page count for *Tales from Jabba''s Palace* (the anthology):**
      This book typically has around 448 to 464 pages, depending on the edition (e.g.,
      the Bantam Spectra paperback has 448 pages).

    e30b9bc3-25c1-4c1a-86ad-7c9f61854b08: 'Okay, here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the first book and its relevant version:** The question refers
      to "Dominick Dunne''s If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer." While O.J. Simpson
      was the original author of "If I Did It," the version published by the Goldman
      family, which includes extensive commentary by Dominick Dunne, is titled "If
      I Did It: Confessions of the Killer by The Goldman Family." This is the version
      relevant to the question.

      2.  **Find the page count for the first book:** The Beaufort Books edition (2007)
      of "If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer" (with Dunne''s commentary) has **224
      pages**.

      3.  **Identify the second book:** The question refers to "M. Shayne Bell''s
      Tales from Jabba''s Palace." "Tales from Jabba''s Palace" is an anthology of
      Star Wars short stories edited by Kevin J. Anderson, to which M. Shayne Bell
      contributed one story.

      4.  **Find the page count for the second book:** The Bantam Spectra paperback
      edition of "Tales from Jabba''s Palace" has **432 pages**.

      5.  **Compare the page counts:** "If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer" (224
      pages) is being compared to "Tales from Jabba''s Palace" (432 pages).

      6.  **Determine if the first book has fewer pages:** 224 is less than 432.


      Therefore, Dominick Dunne''s "If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer" (referring
      to the version with his commentary) does have fewer pages than "Tales from Jabba''s
      Palace."

      A quick search reveals that "The Killing" (CHERUB series, book 12) by Robert

      Step 2: Find the page count for William T. Vollmann''s "The Rifles".
