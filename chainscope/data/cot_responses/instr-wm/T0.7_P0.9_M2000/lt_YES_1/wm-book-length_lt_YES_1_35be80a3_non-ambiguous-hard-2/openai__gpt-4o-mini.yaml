      has fewer pages than Neel Mukherjee''s "The Lives of Others," we can follow
      these steps:


      1. **Find the page count for "Summertime"**: "Summertime" is generally published
      with around 272 pages, depending on the edition.


      2. **Find the page count for "The Lives of Others"**: "The Lives of Others"
      typically has around 400 pages in most editions.


      3. **Compare the page counts**: Now we compare the two numbers. 272 pages (for
      "Summertime") is less than 400 pages (for "The Lives of Others").

      1. Research the page count for "Foe" by Iain Reid. The standard edition typically
      has around 256 pages.

      2. Next, check the page count for "Lunar Park" by Bret Easton Ellis. The standard
      edition usually has around 368 pages.


      Now we can compare the two page counts:


      - "Foe" has approximately 256 pages.

      - "Lunar Park" has approximately 368 pages.
