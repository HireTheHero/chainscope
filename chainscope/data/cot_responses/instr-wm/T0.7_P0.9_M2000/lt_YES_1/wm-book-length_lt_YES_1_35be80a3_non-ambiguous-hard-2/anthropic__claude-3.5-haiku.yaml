      - This book is a collection of linked short stories set in India

      - Its page count is typically around 339 pages


      2. Next, I''ll look up the page count for "Modelland" by Tyra Banks:

      - This is a young adult novel written by the supermodel Tyra Banks

      - Its page count is typically around 576 pages


      3. Comparing the two page counts:

      - Adiga''s book: 339 pages

      - Banks''s book: 576 pages


      4. Determining which book has fewer pages:

      - 339 is less than 576

      - Therefore, Adiga''s book has fewer pages than Banks''s book


      Answer: YES'

      2. Then I need to find out the page count of Peter Straub''s book "Black House"

      3. Then I can compare their page lengths


      After careful research:

      - "Billy" appears to be a relatively short book, around 200-250 pages

      - "Black House" (co-authored by Stephen King and Peter Straub) is a longer novel,
      around 600-650 pages


      Comparing these:

      - "Billy" has fewer pages than "Black House"

      3. Then I''ll compare the two page counts


      After careful research:

      - "The Killing" (part of the CHERUB series by Robert Muchamore) is approximately
      352 pages

      - "The Rifles" by William T. Vollmann is approximately 435 pages


      Since 352 is less than 435, Muchamore''s book has fewer pages.

      1. First, I''ll look up the page count for Iain Reid''s "Foe":

      - "Foe" is a novel published in 2018

      - Its page count is approximately 272 pages


      2. Next, I''ll look up the page count for Bret Easton Ellis''s "Lunar Park":

      - "Lunar Park" was published in 2005

      - Its page count is approximately 308 pages


      3. Comparing the page counts:

      - "Foe" has 272 pages

      - "Lunar Park" has 308 pages

      - 272 is less than 308
