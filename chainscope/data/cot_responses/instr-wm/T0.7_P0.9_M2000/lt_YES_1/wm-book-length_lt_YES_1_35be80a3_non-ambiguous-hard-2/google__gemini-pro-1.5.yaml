      need the page count of the edition containing it.  Let''s assume we are talking

      book, it must have fewer pages than the 384 page collection.  And since 384

      \ collection of images, not a traditional text-based book with a standard page\
      \ count in the same way novels do.  There are varying editions and formats.\n\
      \    * \"A Princess of Landover\" has varying page counts depending on the edition,\
      \ but typically falls around 200-250 pages.\n\n3. **Compare (with caution):**\
      \ Since \"Bj\xF6rk/Bj\xF6rk\" doesn't have a conventional page count comparable\
      \ to a novel, a direct comparison is difficult.  It likely has fewer *physical\
      \ pages* than most editions of \"A Princess of Landover\".\n\n4. **Consider\
