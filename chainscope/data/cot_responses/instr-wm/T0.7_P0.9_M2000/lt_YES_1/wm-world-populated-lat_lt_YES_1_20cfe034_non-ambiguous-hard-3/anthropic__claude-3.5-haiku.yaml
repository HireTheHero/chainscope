      - Gicumbi District is in Rwanda (central Africa)

      - These locations are on different continents


      4. Determining relative position:

      - Since they are in different continents, their north-south relationship is
      clear

      - UMuziwabantu is south of the equator

      - Gicumbi District is also south of the equator, but in a different continent

      - From a global perspective, UMuziwabantu is south of Gicumbi District


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
    a8c29a32-eb69-4eca-91aa-8fd278ab701e: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. UMuziwabantu Local Municipality is located in South Africa, specifically
      in the KwaZulu-Natal province.


      2. Gicumbi District is located in Rwanda, in the northern part of the country.


      3. South Africa and Rwanda are different countries, located on different parts
      of the African continent.


      4. To determine if UMuziwabantu is south of Gicumbi, we need to compare their

      5. South Africa is located in the southern part of Africa, while Rwanda is in
      the eastern part of Africa, more towards the north.


      6. Therefore, UMuziwabantu is indeed located south of Gicumbi District.
