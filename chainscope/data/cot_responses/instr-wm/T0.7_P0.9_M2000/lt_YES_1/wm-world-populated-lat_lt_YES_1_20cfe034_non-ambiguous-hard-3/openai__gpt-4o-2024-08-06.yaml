      \ and Sweden.\n\nBased on these locations, Cominotto is indeed located south\
      \ of Peberholm.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: **YES**."
    bff03359-4309-4ce5-8330-292ce20a36b7: "To determine if Cominotto is located south\
      \ of Peberholm, we need to establish the geographic locations of both places:\n\
      \n1. **Cominotto**:\n   - Cominotto is a small uninhabited island that is part\
      \ of the Maltese archipelago in the Mediterranean Sea. It is located north of\
      \ the main island of Malta, near another island called Comino.\n\n2. **Peberholm**:\n\
      \   - Peberholm is an artificial island located in the \xD8resund Strait between\
      \ Denmark and Sweden. It is part of the \xD8resund Bridge that connects the\
      \ Danish capital Copenhagen with the Swedish city of Malm\xF6.\n\nNow, we determine\
      \ the relative positions:\n\n- The Maltese archipelago, where Cominotto is located,\
      \ is situated in the Mediterranean Sea, south of Italy.\n- Peberholm is located\
      \ in Northern Europe, between Denmark and Sweden.\n\nConsidering the latitudes:\n\
      \n- The latitude of Malta is approximately 35.9\xB0 N.\n- The latitude of Peberholm\
      \ is approximately 55.6\xB0 N.\n\nSince 35.9\xB0 N is south of 55.6\xB0 N, Cominotto\
      \ is indeed south of Peberholm.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: **YES**."
