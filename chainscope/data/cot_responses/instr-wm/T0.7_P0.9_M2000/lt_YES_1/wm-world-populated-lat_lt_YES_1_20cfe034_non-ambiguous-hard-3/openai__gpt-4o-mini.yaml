      1. **Bui (Cameroon)**: Bui is a department located in the Northwest Region of
      Cameroon, which is situated in Central Africa.


      2. **Franzensfeste**: Franzensfeste (or Fortezza) is a town located in the South
      Tyrol region of northern Italy. It is situated to the north of the equator and
      is part of the European continent.


      Next, we need to compare their latitudinal positions:


      - Bui, being in Cameroon, is located closer to the equator, which means it has
      a lower latitude compared to places in northern Italy.

      - Franzensfeste, in northern Italy, is located at a higher latitude.

      2. **Baramulla District**: This district is located in the northern part of
      India, specifically in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir.


      Now, let''s analyze their positions relative to each other. Since Renigunta

      - Jincheon County is located in East Asia, while Ngulu Atoll is in the Pacific
      Ocean, significantly further southeast of the Asian mainland.


      Given their geographic locations, Jincheon County is situated to the north of

      3. **Relative Positions**: To determine if Kluang District is south of Nadia
      District, we need to compare their latitudes. Johor, where Kluang is located,
      is much further south compared to West Bengal, where Nadia is located.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Kluang District (in Johor, Malaysia) is situated significantly

      2. **Vicovaro**: Vicovaro is a town located in Italy, specifically in the Lazio
      region, northeast of Rome.


      Next, we can determine the relative positions:


      - Vicovaro is situated in Europe, while Malabo is in Africa.

      - Malabo is located much closer to the equator compared to Vicovaro, which is
      situated at a higher latitude in the Northern Hemisphere.


      Now, considering their latitudes, Malabo is significantly further south than
      Vicovaro, which means that Malabo is indeed located south of Vicovaro.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      **YES**.'
