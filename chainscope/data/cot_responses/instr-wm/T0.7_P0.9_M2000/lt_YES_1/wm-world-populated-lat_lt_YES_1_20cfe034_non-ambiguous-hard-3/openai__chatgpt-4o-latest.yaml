      \ uninhabited islet located in the Mediterranean Sea.\n   - It is part of the\
      \ Maltese archipelago and lies just northwest of the island of Comino, between\
      \ the islands of Gozo and Malta.\n   - Malta is situated in Southern Europe,\
      \ south of Italy.\n\n2. **Identify the location of Peberholm**:\n   - Peberholm\
      \ is an artificial island in the \xD8resund Strait.\n   - It is part of the\
      \ \xD8resund Bridge connecting Denmark and Sweden.\n   - Geographically, it\
      \ lies between Copenhagen (Denmark) and Malm\xF6 (Sweden), in Northern Europe.\n\
      \n3. **Compare the latitudes**:\n   - Cominotto (Malta) is located at approximately\
      \ 36\xB0 north latitude.\n   - Peberholm (Denmark/Sweden) is located at approximately\
      \ 55\xB0 north latitude.\n\n4. **Determine which is further south**:\n   - 36\xB0\
