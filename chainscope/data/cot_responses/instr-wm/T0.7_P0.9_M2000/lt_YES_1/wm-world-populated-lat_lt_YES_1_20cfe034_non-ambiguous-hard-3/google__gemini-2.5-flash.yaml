      **Step 1: Locate Kluang District.**

      Kluang District is located in the state of Johor, Malaysia.


      **Step 2: Locate Nadia District.**

      Nadia District (also spelled Nadia or Nabadwip) is located in the state of West
      Bengal, India.


      **Step 3: Determine the relative geographical positions.**

      * Malaysia is a country in Southeast Asia.

      * India is a country in South Asia.


      Geographically, Malaysia (and specifically Johor where Kluang is) is situated
      to the southeast of India (and specifically West Bengal where Nadia is). This
      means that if you were to draw a line from Nadia to Kluang, you would generally
      be moving in a southeasterly direction.


      **Step 4: Answer the question.**

      Since Kluang District is to the southeast of Nadia District, it is indeed located
      south of Nadia District.

      n Defla located south of Rhodesia, Nottinghamshire?\"\n    *   First, the phrasing\

      n Defla south of Rhodesia (Zimbabwe)? No, A\xEFn Defla is in North Africa, Rhodesia/Zimbabwe\

      \ A\xEFn Defla south of Nottinghamshire? Yes, A\xEFn Defla (North Africa) is\
      \ south of Nottinghamshire (England).\n\nHowever, the question combines \"Rhodesia\"\
      \ and \"Nottinghamshire\" in a way that suggests a single, combined, or nested\
      \ location reference. Since \"Rhodesia, Nottinghamshire\" does not describe\
      \ a real, single geographic entity, the premise of the question is flawed.\n\
      \nBut if we have to give a YES/NO answer based on the most direct interpretation\
      \ of \"south of X\", even with the flawed premise:\n\n*   A\xEFn Defla is *north*\
      \ of the geographical area that was Rhodesia.\n*   A\xEFn Defla is *south* of\
      \ Nottinghamshire.\n\nThe question asks \"south of Rhodesia, Nottinghamshire\"\
      . This implies a location that is *both* Rhodesia *and* Nottinghamshire, or\
      \ a location within Nottinghamshire that is called Rhodesia. Neither exists\
      \ in a geographic sense that makes the question coherent.\n\nHowever, if we\
      \ are forced to pick the primary geographical reference that \"Rhodesia\" points\

      \ consider if A\xEFn Defla is south of *either* of them, the question becomes\
      \ ambiguous.\n\nBut the question asks \"Is A\xEFn Defla located south of **Rhodesia,\
      \ Nottinghamshire**?\" This implies a single, combined point or region. Since\
      \ such a point/region does not exist, the premise is flawed.\n\nIf we *must*\
      \ choose, the most misleading part is \"Rhodesia, Nottinghamshire\" as a single\
      \ entity. Let's assume the question is trying to trick us with the combination.\n\
      \nA\xEFn Defla is in North Africa.\nRhodesia is in Southern Africa.\nNottinghamshire\
      \ is in England.\n\nA\xEFn Defla is *north* of Rhodesia.\nA\xEFn Defla is *south*\
      \ of Nottinghamshire.\n\nThe phrasing \"south of Rhodesia, Nottinghamshire\"\
      \ is a compound. For A\xEFn Defla to be south of this compound, it would need\
      \ to be south of *both* elements, or south of a single location that is described\
      \ by both. As it's impossible for Rhodesia to be in Nottinghamshire, the premise\
      \ of the question is inherently nonsensical in a geographic context.\n\nHowever,\
      \ if we interpret it as \"Is A\xEFn Defla south of the place called Rhodesia,\
      \ AND also south of the place called Nottinghamshire?\"\n*   South of Rhodesia?\
      \ NO (it's north)\n*   South of Nottinghamshire? YES\n\nSince one part is NO,\
      \ the combined \"south of A and B\" would be NO.\n\nIf it means \"Is A\xEFn\
      \ Defla south of the *combination* of Rhodesia and Nottinghamshire?\", since\
      \ that combination doesn't exist, the question cannot be answered definitively.\n\
      \nLet's assume the question is trying to establish a hierarchy or a single point.\n\
      The primary point of confusion is the non-existent \"Rhodesia, Nottinghamshire\"\
      .\n\nHowever, if we parse it as \"Is A\xEFn Defla south of [the location that\
      \ is Rhodesia and/or Nottinghamshire]?\"\nA\xEFn Defla is north of the former\
      \ Rhodesia.\nA\xEFn Defla is south of Nottinghamshire.\n\nGiven the construction\
      \ \"south of X, Y\", it's usually interpreted as \"south of X which is located\
      \ in Y\". Since Rhodesia is not in Nottinghamshire, the premise is false.\n\n\
      If the question implies a single location, and that location doesn't exist,\
      \ how can it be south of it?\n\nLet's consider the most straightforward interpretation\
      \ of the geographical relationship for the *first* named place relative to the\
      \ second: \"Is A\xEFn Defla located south of Rhodesia?\" and then \"which is\
      \ in Nottinghamshire?\".\n\nA\xEFn Defla is in Algeria (North Africa).\nRhodesia\
      \ was in Southern Africa.\nNottinghamshire is in England.\n\nA\xEFn Defla is\
      \ geographically *north* of the former territory of Rhodesia.\nThe inclusion\
      \ of \"Nottinghamshire\" makes the location \"Rhodesia, Nottinghamshire\" geographically\
      \ impossible as a single entity.\n\nTherefore, the premise of the question is\
      \ flawed. However, if forced to answer YES or NO, and recognizing that \"Rhodesia,\
      \ Nottinghamshire\" is a non-existent location, the question itself is unanswerable\
      \ in a factual geographic sense.\n\nBut if we must give a YES/NO, and the question\
      \ is designed to catch a geographical impossibility:\n\nThe phrase \"Rhodesia,\
      \ Nottinghamshire\" refers to a place that does not exist. Rhodesia was in Africa,\
      \ Nottinghamshire is in England. They are not geographically connected in that\
      \ way. Therefore, you cannot be \"south of\" a non-existent place.\n\nNO."

      **Step 1: Locate Biak**

      Biak is an island in Papua, Indonesia. Its approximate coordinates are around
      **1 degree South latitude**.


      **Step 2: Locate Moriya, Ibaraki**

      Moriya is a city in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. Its approximate coordinates are
      around **35 degrees North latitude**.


      **Step 3: Compare Latitudes**

      * Biak: ~1 degree South

      * Moriya, Ibaraki: ~35 degrees North


      **Step 4: Determine Relative Position (North/South)**

      On a global map, locations with South latitude are *south* of the equator. Locations
      with North latitude are *north* of the equator. Therefore, any location in the
      Southern Hemisphere will be south of any location in the Northern Hemisphere.


      Since Biak is at ~1 degree South latitude and Moriya, Ibaraki is at ~35 degrees
      North latitude, Biak is significantly south of Moriya, Ibaraki.
