      If the latitude of The New School for Leadership and Journalism is less than
      that of the Harry H Gordon School Annex, then it is located further south.


      Now, based on these steps, let''s provide the answer:


      If the New School for Leadership and Journalism has a lower latitude value than
      the Harry H Gordon School Annex, then the answer is YES. If not, then the answer
      is NO.


      Without specific latitude data here, I can''t give a definitive YES or NO, but

      runs north to south in Brooklyn, but 1751 Flatbush Avenue is situated in the
      Midwood neighborhood, which is more central in Brooklyn. The Belt Parkway is
      further south, running closer to the coastline.


      4. **Conclusion based on geographic understanding**: Since the Belt Parkway
      is located further south compared to the central location of 1751 Flatbush Avenue,
      the Bay Family Center is not located south of the Belt Shore Parkway Bridge
      over Ocean Parkway.

      1. **Understanding Light Numbers**: In marine navigation, the numbering of lights
      often follows a sequential order along a waterway. In many cases, higher numbers
      indicate a progression along a channel or waterway.


      2. **Geographical Orientation**: Raritan Bay is located between New Jersey and
      Staten Island, New York. The lights in the bay guide maritime traffic through
      the channels.


      3. **Channel Flow**: Typically, in a north-south oriented bay or channel, as
      is the case with Raritan Bay, the numbering of navigational aids tends to start
      from the mouth of the bay (where it meets the ocean) and increases as you move
      inland or upstream.


      Given these points, if RARITAN BAY LIGHT 58 has a higher number than RARITAN
      BAY LIGHT 42, it is likely further into the bay or further along the channel.

    7fe88cf4-2bab-4ae6-8e3e-87f593f15c20: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps needed:


      1. **Understand the locations**: Raritan Bay Light 58 and Raritan Bay Light
      42 are navigational aids located in the waters around Staten Island, New York.
      These specific lights are part of the navigational system in Raritan Bay, which
      is situated between New Jersey and Staten Island.


      2. **Determine the general orientation**: Navigational lights are typically
      numbered in a sequence that corresponds to their positions relative to each
      other. Lower numbers often indicate a position closer to the mouth of a waterway,
      while higher numbers may indicate positions further inland or upstream.


      3. **Research specific locations**: To precisely determine the answer, one would
      ideally look at a nautical chart of Raritan Bay to see the exact positions of
      Light 58 and Light 42. Without access to a current chart, we can infer based
      on typical numbering practices.


      4. **Make an informed inference**: Given that these are navigational lights
      and assuming they follow standard numbering practices, Light 58 is likely located
      further from the start of the channel than Light 42, suggesting that Light 58
      is more inland or upstream.


      Therefore, based on the assumption that Light 58 is further inland or upstream
      than Light 42, it would likely be located north of Light 42.

      1. **Identify the Locations**: RARITAN BAY LIGHT 58 and 42 are navigational
      aids located in Raritan Bay, which is adjacent to Staten Island, New York.


      2. **Understand Navigational Light Numbering**: In general, navigational lights
      are numbered sequentially. The numbers often increase as you move in a specific
      direction, usually upstream or towards the main navigation channel.


      3. **Typical Numbering Direction**: In many U.S. waters, light numbers increase
      when moving inland or up a river. In coastal areas, like bays, it might follow
      the main shipping route.


      4. **Compare the Numbers**: RARITAN BAY LIGHT 58 has a higher number than RARITAN

      4. **Evaluating North-South Orientation**: If the sequence follows a typical
      entrance-to-inward pattern, Light 58 could be further into the bay than Light
      42, potentially placing it north of Light 42.


      5. **Geographical Check**: Without specific coordinates, the exact north-south
      relationship could depend on the layout of the channel and the bay itself.


      Based on standard assumptions about navigational numbering and lack of specific
      coordinates, the inference would be that Light 58 is not south of Light 42.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**.'

      \n1. **Identify the Locations:** Raritan Bay Lights are part of the navigational\

      \ New York. These lights are typically positioned in a numerical order along\
      \ waterways.\n\n2. **Numerical Order and Positioning:** Generally, navigational\

      \ lower numbers often start at the entrance of the bay or harbor and increase\
      \ as they move inland or along a particular path.\n\n3. **Orientation in Raritan\
      \ Bay:** Given that Raritan Bay opens to the south towards the Atlantic Ocean,\
      \ the lower-numbered lights would likely be positioned closer to the mouth of\
      \ the bay. Therefore, higher-numbered lights, like Light 58, would be further\

      geographic locations relative to each other. These lights are navigational aids
      in Raritan Bay, part of the waterways surrounding Staten Island, NYC.


      1. **Understand the Naming**: Lights in waterways are often numbered and can
      be part of a sequence following the waterway''s path. The numbering does not
      inherently indicate north or south but rather their order or location along
      the navigational path.


      2. **Look at a Map**: To accurately compare the two, consulting a nautical chart
      or map showing these specific lights would be ideal. This would allow us to
      see their exact positions relative to each other.


      3. **Determine Relative Position**: If RARITAN BAY LIGHT 58 appears below RARITAN
      BAY LIGHT 42 on the map (assuming north is at the top of the map, which is standard),
      then it is south.


      Without specific map data or coordinates provided here, we can''t definitively

      3. **Determine the relative positions**: The carousel is situated in the southern
      part of Prospect Park. MS 61 is located on Empire Boulevard, which runs east-west
      along the northern edge of Prospect Park.
