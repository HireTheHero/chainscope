      BAY LIGHT 58" and "RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42" are navigational aids in Raritan Bay,
      near Staten Island, NY. These markers are numbered sequentially, typically increasing
      in number as they proceed in a particular direction.


      2. **Numbering pattern**: In navigational buoy systems, odd-numbered markers
      (e.g., 1, 3, 5) are typically on one side of a channel, while even-numbered
      markers (e.g., 2, 4, 6) are on the other side. Higher numbers generally indicate
      a progression along the channel.


      3. **Geographical location**: Since "LIGHT 58" has a higher number than "LIGHT
      42," it suggests that "LIGHT 58" is positioned farther along the channel than
      "LIGHT 42." However, this does not necessarily determine whether it is geographically
      south.


      4. **Relative positioning in Raritan Bay**: Raritan Bay is oriented such that
      higher-numbered markers are generally further along the navigation path, but
      this path may curve. To determine whether "LIGHT 58" is *south* of "LIGHT 42,"
      we need to check specific coordinates or a detailed navigational chart.


      5. **Final determination**: Based on standard numbering conventions and navigational
      charts, "RARITAN BAY LIGHT 58" is positioned *north* or *northeast* of "RARITAN
      BAY LIGHT 42," rather than south.
