      Step 1: W Brighton I Houses Building 1 is located in the W Brighton neighborhood

      Step 1: Grace St Pauls Lutheran Church

      - After checking, this church is located at 4 W 29th Street in Manhattan


      Step 2: Central Park Cedar Hill

      - Cedar Hill is located in the northeast section of Central Park

      - Its coordinates are approximately at the intersection of 79th Street and East
      Drive


      Step 3: Comparing Positions

      - Grace St Pauls Lutheran Church is at 29th Street (south)

      - Central Park Cedar Hill is around 79th Street (north)

      - 29th Street is south of 79th Street
