      is located south of Hillman Houses in Manhattan, we need to understand the geography
      of Manhattan and the relative positions of these two locations.


      1. **Understanding Manhattan''s Geography**: Manhattan is one of the five boroughs
      of New York City, and it''s generally divided into three main areas: Uptown,
      Midtown, and Downtown. These areas are loosely defined by the streets that run
      north-south (called "streets") and the avenues that run east-west (called "avenues").


      2. **Identifying Williamsburg**: Williamsburg is not a neighborhood in Manhattan.
      It''s actually a neighborhood in the borough of Brooklyn, which is directly
      south of Manhattan, separated by the East River.


      3. **Identifying Hillman Houses**: Hillman Houses is a public housing project
      located on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The Lower East Side is a neighborhood
      in the southern part of Manhattan.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Since Williamsburg is in Brooklyn and Hillman Houses
      is in Manhattan, we can immediately conclude that Williamsburg is not south
      of Hillman Houses, as they are in different boroughs.

    8ecaebe3-d7b7-4ba7-81af-bac55052c515: 'To determine if CONEY ISLAND HOUSES BUILDING
      3, Brooklyn is located south of CONEY ISLAND HOUSES, Brooklyn, let''s break
      down the steps:


      1. **Understanding Locations**: First, we need to understand the general layout
      of Coney Island. Coney Island is a peninsula in Brooklyn, New York City, bordered
      by the Atlantic Ocean to the south, Gravesend Bay to the north, and the Coney
      Island Creek to the northeast.


      2. **Coney Island Houses**: The Coney Island Houses are a public housing project
      located in Coney Island, Brooklyn. Public housing projects are typically large
      developments, but without specific addresses, it''s hard to pinpoint their exact
      location within Coney Island. However, knowing they are within Coney Island
      helps narrow down the area.


      3. **Building 3**: The specification "BUILDING 3" suggests a particular building
      within the Coney Island Houses development. Public housing projects often have
      multiple buildings, each with its own address or designation.


      4. **Relative Location**: To determine if BUILDING 3 is south of the general
      area known as Coney Island Houses, we would need to know the layout of the housing
      project itself. However, public housing projects are not typically divided in
      a way that one building is significantly south of the others in a linear fashion;
      they are more likely spread out over a area.


      5. **Conclusion**: Without exact addresses or a detailed map of the Coney Island
      Houses showing the relative positions of its buildings, it''s difficult to make
      a definitive statement about the location of BUILDING 3 relative to the broader
      Coney Island Houses area. However, given that both are within the Coney Island
      area, and assuming BUILDING 3 is part of the Coney Island Houses complex, it
      would be reasonable to consider that BUILDING 3 is not necessarily "south" of
      the Coney Island Houses in a broader geographical sense, as both are contained
      within the same general area.


      Given the lack of specific information about the layout and the fact that both
      locations are within the same housing project in Coney Island, the question
      seems to imply a distinction that may not be meaningful without more context.
      However, to provide an answer based on the information given and the steps of

      ANNEX is located south of the BRONX CC GREENHOUSE, we need to follow a few steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: Both the Student Center Annex and the Greenhouse
      are on the campus of Bronx Community College (BCC), which is located in the
      University Heights neighborhood of the Bronx.


      2. **Understand the Campus Layout**: Without a specific campus map, we can make
      some assumptions based on typical college campus layouts. Greenhouses are often
      located on the outskirts of a campus, possibly in a more open or less developed
      area, while student centers are typically more central to the main campus area.


      3. **Assume a North-South Orientation**: If we assume that the campus has a
      north-south orientation (a common layout for campuses), and if the Greenhouse
      is indeed located on the outskirts, it might be positioned to the north or south
      of the main campus area.


      4. **Consider the Naming**: The term "Annex" often suggests a structure that
      is an addition to a main building. If the Student Center Annex is an addition
      to the main Student Center, it''s likely located near or attached to the main
      Student Center, which would be more central on campus.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on these assumptions, it''s more likely that the BRONX
      CC STUDENT CENTER ANNEX is not located south of the BRONX CC GREENHOUSE. It''s
      more probable that the Student Center Annex is closer to the central campus

    599ad0c6-01ba-42be-a44b-85a3c358f96c: 'To determine if BRONX CC STUDENT CENTER
      ANNEX is located south of BRONX CC GREENHOUSE, we need to establish the locations
      of both:


      1. **Identify the location of Bronx Community College (Bronx CC)**: Bronx Community
      College is located in University Heights, a neighborhood in the western part
      of the Bronx, New York City. It''s situated on a hill overlooking the Harlem
      River.


      2. **Identify the location of the Student Center Annex**: Typically, annexes
      are located on or near the main campus. Without more specific information, we
      can assume the Student Center Annex is on the Bronx CC campus.


      3. **Identify the location of the Greenhouse**: Again, without more specific
      information, we can assume the Greenhouse is also on the Bronx CC campus.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Since both the Student Center Annex and the Greenhouse
      are likely on the same campus, they are in close proximity to each other.


      5. **Determine the relative positions**: Without more specific information about
      the layout of the campus, it''s challenging to determine the exact relative
      positions of the Student Center Annex and the Greenhouse. However, since they
      are both on the same campus, they would be relatively close to each other.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given that both the Student Center Annex and the Greenhouse
      are likely on the Bronx Community College campus and in close proximity to each
      other, it''s not possible to definitively state that one is south of the other

      1. **Identify the location of South Bronx Community Charter High School**: The
      school is located in the South Bronx, a region in the southern part of the borough
      of the Bronx, New York City. The exact address might not be specified, but it''s

      Educational Center is also located in the South Bronx, but without a more specific
      address, it''s hard to pinpoint its exact location within the region.


      3. **Understand the geography of the South Bronx**: The South Bronx is a region
      that spans from the southernmost tip of the Bronx to about 149th Street. It''s
      bordered by the East River to the south and east, the Harlem River to the west,
      and the Bronx River to the north.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Given that both the South Bronx Community Charter

      \ Avenue in the Bronx, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Locations**:\
      \ \n   - **Lehman College** is located in the Bronx, specifically in the Bedford\
      \ Park neighborhood. The Communications Building would be on the campus of Lehman\
      \ College.\n   - The **Presbyterian Church of Ghana** on Hammersley Avenue is\
      \ also in the Bronx, though the specific neighborhood is not mentioned.\n\n\
      2. **Understand the Geography of the Bronx**: The Bronx is one of the five boroughs\
      \ of New York City. It is the northernmost borough and is bordered by Westchester\
      \ County to the north.\n\n3. **Determine Relative Positions**: Without specific\
      \ addresses, we can't determine the exact locations of these two points. However,\
      \ we can make a general assumption based on the locations:\n   - **Lehman College**:\
      \ Located in Bedford Park, which is in the central part of the Bronx.\n   -\
      \ **Presbyterian Church of Ghana on Hammersley Avenue**: Without knowing the\
      \ specific neighborhood, we can only assume it's somewhere in the Bronx.\n\n\
      4. **Consider the Question**: The question asks if the Lehman College Communications\
      \ Building is located south of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana on Hammersley\
      \ Avenue.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that both locations are in the Bronx,\
      \ and without specific addresses to determine their exact positions, it's difficult\
      \ to definitively answer whether one is south of the other. However, given the\
      \ general location of Lehman College in central Bronx, it's unlikely that it\
      \ would be south of a church that is also somewhere in the Bronx.\n\nIn summary,\
      \ without more specific information about the locations, it's challenging to\
      \ provide a definitive answer. However, based on the available information,\
      \ it seems unlikely that the Lehman College Communications Building would be\

    d5427b53-77ad-48c3-9e48-c596336c6701: 'To answer whether RARITAN BAY LIGHT 58
      is located south of RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42, we need to understand the context
      and the geography involved.


      1. **Identify the Locations**: Both RARITAN BAY LIGHT 58 and RARITAN BAY LIGHT
      42 are likely to be navigational aids or lighthouses located in Raritan Bay,
      which is a bay in New Jersey and Staten Island, New York.


      2. **Understand the Geography**: Raritan Bay is a large body of water that separates
      New Jersey from Staten Island. The bay extends in a generally north-south direction.


      3. **Consider the Numbers**: The numbers "58" and "42" are likely to be identifiers
      for the specific navigational aids. It''s unclear whether these numbers correspond
      to their location, but it''s possible that higher numbers might be further south.


      4. **Assess Relative Positions**: Without detailed maps or specific information
      about the locations of these navigational aids, it''s difficult to determine
      their exact positions. However, based on the general north-south orientation
      of Raritan Bay, it''s plausible that RARITAN BAY LIGHT 58 could be located south
      of RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the context and the potential for the numbers to indicate
      a southward direction, it''s reasonable to conclude that RARITAN BAY LIGHT 58
      is likely located south of RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42. However, without more specific
      information, this conclusion is based on assumptions about the numbering system
      and the geography.


      The final answer is: **YES**'
    f33879a0-7336-45c3-ac2a-4260a4933f92: 'To answer this question, we need to understand
      the context of RARITAN BAY LIGHT and the numbering system used for these lights.


      1. **Understanding the Context**: RARITAN BAY LIGHT likely refers to a series
      of navigational aids, such as lighthouses or buoys, located in Raritan Bay.
      These aids are often numbered to help sailors and navigators identify specific
      locations along the bay.


      2. **Assuming Sequential Numbering**: Based on the context, it''s reasonable
      to assume that the numbering of these lights follows a sequential pattern. This
      means that LIGHT 58 would be located further along the bay than LIGHT 42.


      3. **Considering the Direction of the Bay**: Raritan Bay is located in New Jersey
      and New York, and it opens into the Atlantic Ocean. It is generally accepted
      that the bay runs in a north-south direction, with the northern end being closer
      to New York City and the southern end being closer to the Atlantic Ocean.


      4. **Conclusion**: If we assume that the numbering of the lights corresponds
      to their location along the bay, and that the bay runs north-south, then LIGHT
      58 would be located further south than LIGHT 42. Therefore, the answer to the
      question is: $\boxed{YES}$

      1. **Understand the Geography of NYC**: The Bronx and Manhattan are two of the
      five boroughs of New York City. The Bronx is located north of Manhattan, and
      is the only borough of New York City that is located primarily on the mainland.


      2. **Identify the Locations**: Co-op City is a large cooperative housing development

      of both schools. This can be done using maps, online directories, or other sources
      of information.


      2. **Understand the Geography of Brooklyn**: Brooklyn is a borough of New York
      City and has a relatively complex geography. It''s divided into several neighborhoods,
      and understanding these can help us understand the relative positions of the
      two schools.


      3. **Compare the Locations**: Once we have identified the locations of both
      schools, we can compare them. We need to understand if one is north, south,
      east, or west of the other.


      4. **Consider the Specific Question**: The question asks if the School of Creativity
      and Innovation is south of Mount Roraima Day Care School. So, we specifically
      need to focus on the south direction.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the locations and the geography of Brooklyn, we
