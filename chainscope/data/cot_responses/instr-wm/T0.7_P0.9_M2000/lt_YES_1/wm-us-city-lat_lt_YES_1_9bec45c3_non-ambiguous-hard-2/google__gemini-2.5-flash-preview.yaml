      asks about Swainsboro, GA and Pleasant Garden, NC.

      2.  **Determine the state of each location:** Swainsboro is in Georgia (GA).
      Pleasant Garden is in North Carolina (NC).

      3.  **Consider the relative geographic positions of the states:** Georgia is
      generally located south of North Carolina in the continental United States.

      4.  **Consider potential anomalies:** While Georgia is generally south of North
      Carolina, individual cities near the border or along a north-south line might
      have different relative positions. However, Swainsboro is in central-eastern
      GA, and Pleasant Garden is in central NC. These locations are not near the state
      border in a way that would easily reverse the general north-south relationship
      of the states.

      5.  **Confirm using a mapping tool (mental check or actual):** A quick mental
      check or look at a map shows that Swainsboro, GA is significantly further south
      than Pleasant Garden, NC.


      Therefore, Swainsboro, GA is located south of Pleasant Garden, NC.

      3.  **Compare the typical latitude of Virginia and Wisconsin:** Virginia is
      a southern state in the US. Wisconsin is a northern state in the US.

      4.  **Infer the relative north/south position:** States in the south are generally
      further south (lower latitude) than states in the north. Therefore, Virginia
      is generally south of Wisconsin.

      5.  **Apply the inference to the specific cities:** A city in Virginia is highly

      is a Midwestern state, bordering Canada. Wisconsin is clearly significantly
      farther north than Virginia.

      3.  **Reason about the locations within the states:** Even if Beaver Dam were
      the southernmost point of Wisconsin and Blackstone were the northernmost point
      of Virginia, Wisconsin is so much farther north overall that Beaver Dam would
      still be north of Blackstone.

      4.  **Confirm the relative position:** Since Wisconsin is north of Virginia,
      any city in Wisconsin will be north of any city in Virginia. Therefore, Blackstone,
      VA is located south of Beaver Dam, WI.

      asks about Salt Creek, CO and Stirling, NJ.

      2.  **Determine the latitude of Salt Creek, CO:** Colorado is a state in the
      Mountain West region of the United States. It is roughly centered around 39
      degrees North latitude. Salt Creek is a general term for a creek, and there
      are many Salt Creeks in Colorado. However, the state of Colorado itself is located
      at a relatively high latitude in the US.

      3.  **Determine the latitude of Stirling, NJ:** Stirling is a CDP (Census Designated
      Place) in Morris County, New Jersey. New Jersey is a state in the Mid-Atlantic
      region of the United States. It is located at a lower latitude than Colorado.
      Stirling, NJ is located around 40.65 degrees North latitude.

      4.  **Compare the latitudes:** While a precise location for "Salt Creek, CO"
      isn''t given, all of Colorado is located significantly west of New Jersey and
      generally at a similar or higher latitude than Stirling, NJ. For instance, Denver,
      CO is at about 39.7 degrees North, and Colorado extends further north. Stirling,
      NJ is at about 40.65 degrees North.

      5.  **Conclude the relative north/south position:** Since Stirling, NJ is at
      approximately 40.65 degrees North latitude and most of Colorado is at latitudes
      around or below 40 degrees North, Stirling, NJ is generally located *north*
      of most points in Colorado, including any potential location of "Salt Creek"
      within the state.


      Therefore, Salt Creek, CO is *not* located south of Stirling, NJ. Salt Creek,
      CO is located *south* of Stirling, NJ if its latitude is lower than Stirling''s
      latitude. Based on the general locations, this is not the case.

      is more central (and to the east of Washington), any point in Washington will
      generally be at a higher (more northerly) latitude than any point in Nebraska.

      6.  **Apply to the specific cities:** Therefore, Brinnon, WA will be north of
      Valentine, NE.

      7.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if Valentine, NE is *south* of
      Brinnon, WA. Since Brinnon is north of Valentine, Valentine must be south of
      Brinnon.

      2.  **Determine the states:** Valentine is in Nebraska (NE). Brinnon is in Washington
      (WA).

      3.  **Determine the general location of the states:** Nebraska is in the central
      US. Washington is in the northwestern US.

      4.  **Consider the relative latitude:** Washington state is significantly further
      north than Nebraska state.

      5.  **Consider specific locations within states:** While locations *within*
      states can vary, the general geographic relationship between WA and NE is that
      WA is much further north. Valentine is in northern Nebraska, and Brinnon is
      on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington, which is a relatively northern part
      of the state.

      6.  **Compare latitudes:** Since Washington is generally north of Nebraska,
      it is highly likely that any location in Nebraska will be south of any location
      in Washington. Brinnon, being in WA, will be north of Valentine, being in NE.

      7.  **Formulate the answer:** If Brinnon is north of Valentine, then Valentine
      is south of Brinnon.


      **Conclusion:** Valentine, NE is located south of Brinnon, WA.

      5.  **Compare the latitudes:** 40 degrees North (Eighty Four) is a lower number
      than 44.4 degrees North (Fort Pierre).

      6.  **Understand latitude and direction:** Lower North latitude numbers mean
      the location is further south.

      7.  **Conclusion:** Since Eighty Four, PA has a lower North latitude than Fort
      Pierre, SD, Eighty Four, PA is located south of Fort Pierre, SD.

      2.  **Determine the state of each city:** Bruce is in Mississippi (MS). Larned
      is in Kansas (KS).

      3.  **Visualize or know the relative positions of the states:** Kansas is a
      Midwestern state, located roughly in the center of the US. Mississippi is a
      Southern state, located further south and east than Kansas.

      4.  **Infer the relative north-south positions of cities within those states:**
      Since Mississippi is significantly south of Kansas, a city in Mississippi (Bruce)
      will almost certainly be south of a city in Kansas (Larned). While there might
      be edge cases near state borders, the general north-south relationship of these
      two states is clear.

      5.  **Confirm the relationship:** Mississippi is directly south of states like
      Tennessee and Arkansas, which are themselves south of states like Missouri and
      Kansas. Therefore, Mississippi is well south of Kansas.
