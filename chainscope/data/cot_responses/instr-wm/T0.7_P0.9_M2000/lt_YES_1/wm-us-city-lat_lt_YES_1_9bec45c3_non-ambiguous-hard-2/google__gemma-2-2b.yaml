      not just answer it. Here''s how I''d approach it:


      1. Think about the relationship between the two cities - are they in the same
      state? In the same country? In the same continent?


      2. Think about the directions - are they south or north of each other? East
      or west?


      3. Think about the distance - how far apart are they?


      4. Think about the time - how long would it take to travel between them?


      Once you have considered all of these factors, you can then answer the question.
      For example, if the cities are in different states, then the answer is "no".
      If they are in the same state but in different directions, then the answer is
      "yes". If they are in the same state and the same direction, then the answer
      is "no".
