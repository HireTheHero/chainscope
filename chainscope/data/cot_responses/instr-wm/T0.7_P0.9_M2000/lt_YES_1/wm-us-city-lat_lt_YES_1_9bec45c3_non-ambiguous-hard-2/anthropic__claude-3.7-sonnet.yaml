      - Southern California locations are typically between 32-36 degrees North latitude.

      - Whitewood, SD is approximately at 44.5 degrees North latitude.

      - Since a lower latitude number indicates a more southern location, and Buckhorn,
      CA (in Southern California) would have a lower latitude number than Whitewood,
      SD, Buckhorn is south of Whitewood.

      Step 2: Consider their relative latitudes.

      - Minnesota is generally east of Washington state.

      - For north-south positioning, I need to consider their latitudes.

      - Washington state extends quite far north (bordering Canada).

      - Minnesota is also northern, but its position relative to Washington depends
      on specific city locations.


      Step 3: Compare their specific positions.

      - St. Peter, MN is in southern Minnesota.

      - Concrete, WA is in northwestern Washington.

      - Washington state is generally at a higher latitude than Minnesota.

      - Concrete, WA is located in the northern part of Washington, making it even

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both cities.

      - Portageville, MO is in Missouri, which is in the central United States.

      - Grindstone, PA is in Pennsylvania, which is in the northeastern United States.


      Step 2: Determine their relative north-south positions.

      - Missouri is generally south of Pennsylvania in the United States.

      - More specifically, Missouri is in the central part of the US, while Pennsylvania
      is in the northeast.


      Step 3: Check the specific locations within their states.

      - Portageville is in the southeastern "bootheel" region of Missouri.

      - Georgia is located south of Virginia in the United States.

      - Virginia is north of Georgia, with several states (North Carolina, South Carolina)
      between them.


      Step 3: Verify if the specific locations within these states might change this
      relationship.

      - Berry College is in northwest Georgia, near Rome, GA.

      - McLean is in northern Virginia, near Washington D.C.

      - Even though Berry College is in the northern part of Georgia and McLean is
      in the northern part of Virginia, the overall north-south relationship between
      the states remains the same.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on these geographic positions.

      - Since Georgia is south of Virginia, and the specific locations within these
      states don''t change this relationship, Berry College, GA is south of McLean,
      VA.


      YES, Berry College, GA is located south of McLean, VA.'

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - NE stands for Nebraska, which is in the central United States.

      - WA stands for Washington, which is in the northwestern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south positioning of these states.

      Canada.

      - Nebraska is in the central plains region, significantly south of Washington.


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      - Valentine is in Nebraska, so it inherits Nebraska''s general position south
      of Washington.

      - Brinnon is in Washington, so it inherits Washington''s general position north
      of Nebraska.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      degrees North.

      - South Dakota is in the northern Great Plains region, with latitudes generally
      around 43-46 degrees North.


      Step 3: More specifically:

      - Huntington Station, NY is on Long Island, with a latitude of approximately
      40.8 degrees North.

      - Box Elder, SD (near Rapid City) has a latitude of approximately 44.1 degrees

      - Texas is also a southern state, but its southern border with Mexico runs along
      different latitudes.


      Step 3: More specifically:

      - Ojus is in Miami-Dade County in southern Florida, near Miami.

      - Las Quintas Fronterizas is likely in the Rio Grande Valley area of southern
      Texas, near the Mexican border.


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      ID?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two cities by finding their
      latitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Lecompton is in Kansas (KS), which is in the central United States.

      - Grace is in Idaho (ID), which is in the northwestern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography.

      - Idaho is a northern state, bordering Canada.

      - Kansas is more centrally located in the US, significantly south of the Canadian
      border.


      Step 3: Compare latitudes.

      - Northern states like Idaho generally have higher latitudes (further north).

      - Central states like Kansas generally have lower latitudes (further south).

      - Grace, ID would likely be at a higher latitude than Lecompton, KS.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on latitude comparison.

      - Since Lecompton, KS is at a lower latitude than Grace, ID, it is located south
      of Grace, ID.


      NO


      Wait, I need to correct myself. The question asks if Lecompton is south of Grace,
      and my reasoning concluded that it is indeed south. So the answer should be:


      YES'
