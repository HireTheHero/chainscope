      1. Pocola is a city located in Oklahoma (OK), which is in the central United
      States.


      2. Fortuna is a city located in California (CA), which is on the west coast
      of the United States.


      3. Oklahoma is east of California.


      4. More specifically, Oklahoma is located in the southeastern part of the United
      States, while California is in the southwestern part.


      5. This means that cities in Oklahoma are generally east and north of cities
      in California.


      6. Therefore, Pocola, OK would be located north and east of Fortuna, CA.


      7. Since the question asks if Pocola is south of Fortuna, the answer is NO.
