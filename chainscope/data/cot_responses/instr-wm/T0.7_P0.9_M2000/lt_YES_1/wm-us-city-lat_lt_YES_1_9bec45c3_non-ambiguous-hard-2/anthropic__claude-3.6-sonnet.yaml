      1. First, I need to consider the general geography of Florida (FL) and Oklahoma
      (OK)

      2. Florida is located in the southeastern United States

      3. Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States

      4. Any location in Florida will be south of any location in Oklahoma, as Florida
      is entirely below Oklahoma on the map

      5. Therefore, since Pomona Park is in Florida and Burns Flat is in Oklahoma,
      Pomona Park must be south of Burns Flat


      Answer: YES'

      4. Therefore, any city in South Carolina must be south of any city in Virginia


      Answer: YES'
    b4ef340e-adb8-4533-8a67-d570f7b966ca: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. Cash, SC is in South Carolina

      2. Rich Creek, VA is in Virginia

      3. Virginia is north of South Carolina on the US map

      4. Therefore, any city in South Carolina will be south of any city in Virginia


      Since Cash, SC is in South Carolina and Rich Creek, VA is in Virginia, Cash
      must be south of Rich Creek.


      Answer: YES'
    d5efa43b-c401-4b57-9190-db8fce636d6f: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me establish the locations:

      - Cash, SC is in South Carolina

      - Rich Creek, VA is in Virginia


      2. Looking at the geography of these states:

      - Virginia is north of South Carolina

      - Virginia borders North Carolina

      - South Carolina is south of North Carolina


      3. Therefore, any city in South Carolina would be south of any city in Virginia,
      since South Carolina is entirely south of Virginia.


      4. Since Cash is in South Carolina and Rich Creek is in Virginia, Cash must
      be south of Rich Creek.


      Answer: YES'
