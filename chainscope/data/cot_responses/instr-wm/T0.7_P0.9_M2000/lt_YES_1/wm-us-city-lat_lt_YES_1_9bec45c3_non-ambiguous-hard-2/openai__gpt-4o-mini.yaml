      while Whitewood, SD is in the northern central part of the country.


      4. **Latitude comparison**: Generally, California is further south compared
      to South Dakota. Buckhorn, being in California, would have a lower latitude
      than Whitewood, which is in South Dakota.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since Buckhorn, CA is in the southern part of the US and
      Whitewood, SD is to the north, Buckhorn is indeed located south of Whitewood.

      2. **Locate Stirling, New Jersey**: Stirling is a small community located in
      Morris County, New Jersey, which is in the northeastern part of the United States.


      3. **Determine their relative positions**: Colorado is west of New Jersey. Therefore,
      any location in Colorado, including Salt Creek, would be to the west of any
      location in New Jersey, including Stirling.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Salt Creek is in Colorado (west) and Stirling is in
      New Jersey (east), Salt Creek cannot be south of Stirling.


      The answer to the question is **NO**.'
