      3. **Compare latitudes:** Mississippi is generally south of Texas, although
      some parts of Texas extend further south than some parts of Mississippi.  Therefore,
      I need to be certain of the specific locations.

      Idaho (ID).**  States in the US are arranged in a fairly predictable north-south,
      east-west grid.


      2. **Therefore, a city in Kansas is likely south of a city in Idaho.** While
      there can be exceptions near state borders, the general geographic relationship
      holds.


      3. **Lecompton, KS and Grace, ID likely follow this general pattern.**  There''s
      nothing to suggest these cities are exceptions to the typical north-south arrangement
      of their respective states.


      **YES**

      3. **Relative Position:**  Kansas is generally south of Idaho.

      4. **Specific City Locations Aren''t Necessary:** Since Kansas is south of Idaho,
      any city in KS will be south of any city in ID.

      there can be some exceptions due to the states'' shapes, the general trend holds.

      the central United States.

      2. **Grace, ID:** Idaho (ID) is in the northwestern United States.

      3. **General Latitude:**  States further north have higher latitudes.  Idaho
      is significantly north of Kansas.

      4. **South means lower latitude:** A location south of another will have a lower
      latitude.


      Therefore, Lecompton, KS *cannot* be south of Grace, ID.

      Idaho (ID).**  States in the US follow a pretty clear north-south layout.


      2. **Therefore, a city in Kansas is likely south of a city in Idaho.**  While
      there can be exceptions with cities on the very borders of states, Lecompton
      and Grace are likely far enough from their respective state borders for this
      general rule to hold true.

      knowledge of US geography strongly suggests this.)
