      - Mississippi Valley State University is in the western part of Mississippi

      - Davenport University is in the western part of Michigan


      4. Determine relative positioning:

      - Since Mississippi is west of Michigan, any point in Mississippi will be west
      of any point in Michigan


      5. Therefore, Mississippi Valley State University is definitively west of Davenport
      University.
