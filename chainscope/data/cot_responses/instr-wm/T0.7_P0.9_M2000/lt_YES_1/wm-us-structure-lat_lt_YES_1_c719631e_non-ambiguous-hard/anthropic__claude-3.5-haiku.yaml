      - This is located near the city of Beacon in the Hudson Valley region of New
      York State


      2. Next, locate the New York State Capitol

      - The State Capitol is located in Albany, New York

      - Albany is in the eastern part of New York State, north of Dutchess County


      3. Determine the relative positions

      - Beacon Reservoir is southwest of Albany

      - This means Beacon Reservoir is south of the New York State Capitol


      4. Therefore, the answer is: YES, Beacon Reservoir (Dutchess County, New York),
      NY is located south of New York State Capitol, NY.'

      1. First, locate Sunrise Musical Theater, FL:

      - Sunrise is a city in Broward County, Florida

      - It is located near Fort Lauderdale, in southeastern Florida


      2. Next, locate Corpus Christi Cathedral in Corpus Christi, TX:

      - Corpus Christi is a city on the Gulf Coast of Texas

      - It is in southeastern Texas


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Sunrise, FL is on the east coast of Florida

      - Corpus Christi, TX is on the Gulf Coast of Texas

      - Looking at a map, Sunrise, FL is actually east and northeast of Corpus Christi,
      TX


      4. The specific question is whether Sunrise Musical Theater is SOUTH of Corpus
      Christi Cathedral:

      - Since Sunrise is northeast of Corpus Christi, it is NOT south of it

      - Hells Canyon Dam is located in Idaho, in the western United States

      - It is situated on the Snake River, near the border of Oregon and Idaho


      3. Compare their geographical locations:

      - New York City is on the East Coast

      - Idaho is in the Pacific Northwest region

      - New York is significantly east of Idaho


      4. Determine their relative north-south positioning:

      - New York City is much further south compared to Hells Canyon Dam

      - Idaho is north of the 45th parallel, while New York City is around the 40th
      parallel


      5. Conclusion:

      - 257 Central Park West, NY is definitively located south of Hells Canyon Dam,
      ID


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      1. Navajo Generating Station is located in Page, Arizona, which is in the northwestern
      part of Arizona.


      2. Bergen Performing Arts Center is located in Englewood, New Jersey, which
      is in the northeastern part of the United States.

      - This reservoir is located in Oklahoma

      - Specifically, it''s in eastern Oklahoma, near the city of Sallisaw

      - It''s in the eastern part of the state

      3. Comparing their geographical locations:

      - Oklahoma is southwest of Pennsylvania

      - Robert S. Kerr Reservoir is even further southwest within Oklahoma

      - Washington Avenue Immigration Station is in the northeast of the US


      4. Determining the relative position:

      - Since Robert S. Kerr Reservoir is southwest of the immigration station, it
      is NOT south of the station

      - "South of" would mean being directly below the station on a map, which is
      not the case here


      5. Conclusion:

      The reservoir is actually northwest of the immigration station, not south of
      it.
