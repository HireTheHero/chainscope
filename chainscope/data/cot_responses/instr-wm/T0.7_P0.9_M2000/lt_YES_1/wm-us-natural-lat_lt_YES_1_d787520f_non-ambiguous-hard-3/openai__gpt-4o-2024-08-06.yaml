      1. **Identify the Location of Joe Pool Lake**: Joe Pool Lake is located in North
      Texas, near the cities of Cedar Hill, Grand Prairie, and Mansfield.


      2. **Identify the Location of Lake Traverse**: Lake Traverse is located on the
      border between northeastern South Dakota and western Minnesota.


      3. **Determine Latitude**: Generally, Texas is situated south of South Dakota.
      More specifically, Joe Pool Lake is in the northern part of Texas, but given
      that Texas is much further south compared to South Dakota, it is reasonable
      to conclude that Joe Pool Lake is south of Lake Traverse.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is YES, Joe Pool Lake is located south of
      Lake Traverse.'
