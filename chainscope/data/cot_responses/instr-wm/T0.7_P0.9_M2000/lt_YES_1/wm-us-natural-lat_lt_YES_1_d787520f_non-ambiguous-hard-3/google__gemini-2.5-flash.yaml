      2.  **Locate Sapphire Mountains, MT:** This is in Montana.

      3.  **Understand relative positions of Arizona and Montana:** Arizona is in
      the southwestern US. Montana is in the northwestern US, bordering Canada.


      Because Arizona is geographically south of Montana, any location in Arizona
