      California is generally south of Montana in the United States. Montana borders
      Canada to the north, while California extends along the west coast much further
      south.


      Step 4: More specifically, Bristol Lake is in the southern part of California
      (Mojave Desert region), while the Anaconda Range is in western Montana.


      Since Montana is entirely north of California, and Bristol Lake is in California
      while the Anaconda Range is in Montana, Bristol Lake must be south of the Anaconda
      Range.


      YES, Bristol Lake, CA is located south of Anaconda Range, MT.'

      - California extends along the west coast, with parts of it much further south
      than Montana.


      Step 3: Locate the specific features within their states.

      - The Anaconda Range is a mountain range in southwestern Montana.

      - Bristol Lake is a dry lake in the Mojave Desert in southern California.


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      - Any location in Montana, including the Anaconda Range, would be significantly
      further north than southern California.

      - Bristol Lake in southern California would therefore be south of the Anaconda
      Range in Montana.


      NO - Bristol Lake, CA is located south of Anaconda Range, MT.

      - Straits of Mackinac is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic arrangement of US states.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States

      - Michigan is located in the northern Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Michigan is much further north than Florida

      - The Straits of Mackinac connect Lakes Michigan and Huron in northern Michigan

      - Lake Miccosukee is in northern Florida, but Florida as a whole is far south
      of Michigan


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since Florida is south of Michigan, and Lake Miccosukee is in Florida, while
      the Straits of Mackinac are in Michigan, Lake Miccosukee must be south of the
      Straits of Mackinac.

      Lake Miccosukee is located in northern Florida, near the Florida-Georgia border.


      Step 2: Let me identify where the Straits of Mackinac, MI are located.

      The Straits of Mackinac are located in northern Michigan, connecting Lake Michigan
      and Lake Huron, between Michigan''s Upper and Lower Peninsulas.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Florida is one of the southernmost states in the continental US, while Michigan
      is in the northern part of the country. Northern Florida (where Lake Miccosukee
      is) is still significantly south of northern Michigan (where the Straits of

      of Diaz Lake, CA and Priest Lake, ID to answer this question.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both lakes.

      - Diaz Lake is in California (CA), near the town of Lone Pine in Inyo County,
      in the eastern part of California.

      - Priest Lake is in Idaho (ID), located in the northern panhandle of Idaho.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of California and Idaho.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States, extending north-south.

      - Idaho is located inland, to the northeast of California.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Northern Idaho (where Priest Lake is) is at a higher latitude than most of
      California.

      - Diaz Lake in eastern California is in the central-southern part of the state.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Priest Lake, ID is in the northern part of Idaho, roughly between 48-49 degrees
      north latitude.

      - Diaz Lake, CA is in the eastern Sierra region of California, roughly around
      36-37 degrees north latitude.

      - Since a lower latitude number indicates a more southern location, Diaz Lake
      is south of Priest Lake.
