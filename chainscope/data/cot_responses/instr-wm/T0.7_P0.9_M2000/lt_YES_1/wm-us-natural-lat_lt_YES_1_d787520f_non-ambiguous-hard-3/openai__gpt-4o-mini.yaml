      - California is generally located to the south of Washington state.

      - Temescal Mountains, being in southern California, are even further south compared
      to many other locations in California.


      Next, we determine the relative positions:


      - The Temescal Mountains in California are situated south of Soap Lake in Washington
      state.


      So, after analyzing the locations step by step, the answer to the question "Is
      Temescal Mountains, CA located south of Soap Lake, WA?" is:

      1. **Locate Lake Miccosukee**: Lake Miccosukee is situated in the state of Florida,
      specifically in the northwestern region of the state.


      2. **Locate the Straits of Mackinac**: The Straits of Mackinac are located in
      Michigan, connecting Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, and they are situated in
      the northern part of the state.


      3. **Compare the Locations**: Florida is located to the south of Michigan. Since
      Lake Miccosukee is in Florida and the Straits of Mackinac are in Michigan, Lake
      Miccosukee is indeed to the south of the Straits of Mackinac.
