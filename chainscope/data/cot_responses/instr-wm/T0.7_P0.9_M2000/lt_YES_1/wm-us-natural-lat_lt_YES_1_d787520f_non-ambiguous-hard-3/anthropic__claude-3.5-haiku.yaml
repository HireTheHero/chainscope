    f5a0891c-f296-4762-82c8-8e06ec6aca38: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Locate Inks Lake, TX:

      - Inks Lake is located in Burnet County, Texas

      - It is in the central part of Texas, west of Austin


      2. Locate Lake Sharpe, SD:

      - Lake Sharpe is located in central South Dakota

      - It is formed by the Missouri River and is north of Pierre, SD


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Texas is located in the southern part of the United States

      - South Dakota is located in the northern part of the United States


      4. Determine relative position:

      - Since Inks Lake is in Texas (south) and Lake Sharpe is in South Dakota (north),
      Inks Lake is south of Lake Sharpe


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      \ I'll locate Lake of the Arbuckles in Oklahoma\n\u2022 This is a reservoir\
      \ in the Arbuckle Mountains in southern Oklahoma\n\n2. Next, I'll locate Lake\
      \ Osakis in Minnesota\n\u2022 This is a lake in central Minnesota\n\n3. Comparing\
      \ their geographical locations:\n\u2022 Oklahoma is south of Minnesota\n\u2022\
      \ Lake of the Arbuckles is in southern Oklahoma\n\u2022 Lake Osakis is in central\
      \ Minnesota\n\n4. Reasoning about their relative positions:\n\u2022 Since Oklahoma\
      \ is entirely south of Minnesota, and Lake of the Arbuckles is in southern Oklahoma\n\
      \u2022 This means Lake of the Arbuckles is indeed south of Lake Osakis\n\nTherefore,\
      \ the answer is: YES."
