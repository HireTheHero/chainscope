    a05bcabd-cf34-45f8-93d8-4cec997e29c5: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Brookville Lake Dam in Indiana

      2. Then, I''ll locate Youghiogheny River Lake in Pennsylvania

      3. Then I''ll determine their relative positions


      Brookville Lake Dam is in Franklin County, Indiana, which is in the western
      part of the state.


      Youghiogheny River Lake is located in southwestern Pennsylvania, in Garrett
      County, Maryland.


      Comparing their geographic positions:

      - Indiana is west of Pennsylvania

      - Brookville Lake Dam is in western Indiana

      - Youghiogheny River Lake is in eastern Pennsylvania


      Therefore, Brookville Lake Dam is indeed west of Youghiogheny River Lake.


      The answer is: YES'
