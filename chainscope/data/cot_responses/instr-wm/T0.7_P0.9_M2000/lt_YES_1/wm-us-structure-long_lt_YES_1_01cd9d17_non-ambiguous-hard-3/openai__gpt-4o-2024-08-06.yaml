      1. **Identify the location of Benedum Center**: The Benedum Center for the Performing
      Arts is located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.


      2. **Identify the location of Betts House**: The Betts House is part of Yale
      University, which is located in New Haven, Connecticut.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Pittsburgh, PA is located in the western
      part of Pennsylvania, whereas New Haven, CT is in the southern part of Connecticut.


      4. **Compare the longitudes**: Pennsylvania is generally west of Connecticut.
