      is located west of Beacon Reservoir in Dutchess County, NY, we need to consider
      the geographic locations of both places.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Skokie Lagoons, IL.

      - Skokie Lagoons is a forest preserve located in Cook County, near the village
      of Winnetka, in the northern suburbs of Chicago, Illinois.

      - Chicago is in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Beacon Reservoir, NY.

      - Beacon Reservoir is located near the city of Beacon in Dutchess County, New
      York.

      - Dutchess County is in the Hudson Valley region of New York State, which is
      in the northeastern United States.


      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      - Illinois (and specifically Chicago) is located to the west of New York State.

      - Therefore, Skokie Lagoons, which is near Chicago, is west of Beacon Reservoir
      in New York.


      Answer: YES.'

      locations of both lakes and compare their longitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Buckhorn Lake, Kentucky.

      - Buckhorn Lake is located in eastern Kentucky, specifically in Perry County.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Hyco Lake, North Carolina.

      - Hyco Lake is located in Person County, which is in the northern part of central

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Rosary Cathedral is in Toledo, Ohio.

      - Barrow Street Theatre is in New York City, New York.


      Step 2: Understand U.S. geography.

      - New York City is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      - Toledo, Ohio, is located in the Midwest, to the west of New York.


      Step 3: Compare relative positions.

      - Since Ohio is west of New York, and Toledo is in northern Ohio, it follows
      that Toledo is west of New York City.

      - Therefore, Rosary Cathedral is west of Barrow Street Theatre.

      to:


      **Step 1: Identify the location of Saint Sophia Cathedral**

      - Saint Sophia Cathedral is located in Los Angeles, California.

      - Los Angeles is in southern California, near the Pacific coast.

      - Its approximate longitude is around **-118.3 degrees**.


      **Step 2: Identify the location of Horseshoe Lake, Arizona**

      - Horseshoe Lake is a reservoir located in central Arizona, north of Phoenix.

      - Its approximate longitude is around **-111.7 degrees**.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes**

      - Longitude values increase as you go west to east (more negative means further
      west).

      - -118.3 (Los Angeles) is less than -111.7 (Horseshoe Lake), which means Los
      Angeles is farther west than Horseshoe Lake.


      **Conclusion:**

      Since Los Angeles is at a more western longitude than Horseshoe Lake, the cathedral
      is west of the lake.

      this might be a confusion in the question). It is near the border between Illinois
      and Indiana.

      - Mountaineer Wind Energy Center is located in West Virginia, specifically in
