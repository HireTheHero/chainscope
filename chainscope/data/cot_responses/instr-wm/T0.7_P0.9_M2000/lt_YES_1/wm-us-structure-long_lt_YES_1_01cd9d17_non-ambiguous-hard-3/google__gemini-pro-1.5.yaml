    faae1976-69bb-4957-955a-f2babd3693a1: '1. **Find the locations:** We need the
      longitude of each building.

      2. **Compare longitudes:**  West means a smaller longitude value.  We''ll check
      if Nashville Municipal Auditorium has a smaller longitude than the Cathedral
      of All Souls.


      Nashville Municipal Auditorium is in Nashville, TN.  Nashville is further west
      than Asheville, NC.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

    fd0b877e-6e48-48de-aa04-700c6bf7604b: '1. **Find the locations:** We need the
      longitude coordinates of both structures.

      2. **Compare longitudes:**  Western locations have lower longitude values.  We''ll
      compare the longitude of Nashville Municipal Auditorium to the longitude of
      the Cathedral of All Souls.


      Nashville Municipal Auditorium is located at approximately -86.7755.

      Cathedral of All Souls is located at approximately -82.5528.


      Since -86.7755 is less than -82.5528, Nashville Municipal Auditorium is west
      of the Cathedral of All Souls.
