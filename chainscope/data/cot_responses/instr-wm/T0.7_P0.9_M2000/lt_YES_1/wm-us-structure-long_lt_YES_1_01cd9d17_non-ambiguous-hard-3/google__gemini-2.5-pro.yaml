      Virginia. I am now confident that Missouri is west of West Virginia.



      **Summarizing State Positions**


      I''m now in the process of formulating a structured response, starting with
      an identification of state locations. My focus is on synthesizing a step-by-step
      reasoning process. First, I will establish that Pomme de Terre Lake is located
      in Missouri, and Sutton Lake is located in West Virginia. Following that, a
      comparison of the relative geographical positions of Missouri and West Virginia
      will be provided. The final step concludes that Pomme de Terre Lake is indeed
      west of Sutton Lake.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Locate Pomme de Terre Lake:** Pomme de Terre Lake is in the state of Missouri
      (MO).

      2.  **Locate Sutton Lake:** Sutton Lake is in the state of West Virginia (WV).

      3.  **Compare the states'' locations:** On a map of the United States, the state
      of Missouri is located entirely to the west of the state of West Virginia.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, any location in Missouri is west of any location
      in West Virginia.

      \ I've pinpointed Fermi 1 as the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station, located\
      \ in Monroe County, Michigan, and Round House in Somerville, Massachusetts.\

      \ Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station is at 83.26\xB0 W, and Round House\
      \ is at 71.12\xB0 W. Since 83.26 > 71.12, the former is indeed west of the latter.\

      \ Path**\n\nI've outlined the logical structure of my response. Now, I've confirmed\
      \ Indiana is west of Pennsylvania, which simplifies the answer. My final step\
      \ is crafting the response, emphasizing a clear, concise 'YES' answer based\
      \ on state-level geographical relationships.\n\n\n</think>Here is the step-by-step\

      I'm zeroing in on the crux of the user's query: pinpointing if Brookville Lake\
      \ Dam, IN, resides west of Youghiogheny River Lake, PA. It boils down to a fundamental\
      \ geographical comparison. My next step will be to confirm the locations of\
      \ the places in question.\n\n\n**Analyzing Geographic Positions**\n\nI've determined\
      \ the coordinates of the two locations: Brookville Lake Dam, IN is approximately\
      \ at 39.46\xB0 N, 84.99\xB0 W, and I'm currently working to pinpoint the coordinates\

      \ arriving at the correct final answer.\n\n\n**Establishing Westward Superiority**\n\
      \nCurrently, I'm working to consolidate the findings. I've pinpointed the coordinates\

      \ 36.9\xB0 N, 111.4\xB0 W for the Navajo Generating Station. Based on their\
      \ respective longitudes, which represent east-west position, I'm ready to formally\
      \ conclude and affirm that the New Exchequer Dam is indeed located west of the\
      \ Navajo Generating Station.\n\n\n</think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\

      I confirmed Iowa''s western position relative to Ohio, thus establishing Lake
      Icaria''s western location. My next step is organizing these points into a clear
      response.



      **Refining Final Response**


      I''m now crafting the final response, starting with a clear, step-by-step presentation
      of the geographical reasoning. I''m focusing on concise explanations, beginning
      with locating the sites within their respective states, then confirming the
      states'' relative positions. I''m aiming for clarity in establishing that since
      Iowa is west of Ohio, Lake Icaria is necessarily west of Meander Creek Reservoir.
      My next focus is on a final "YES" or "NO" response.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to identify the state for each location. Lake Icaria is in
      Iowa (IA). Meander Creek Reservoir is in Ohio (OH).

      2.  Next, we need to determine the geographical relationship between these two
      states.

      3.  On a map of the United States, the state of Iowa is located to the west
      of the state of Ohio.

      4.  Since the entire state of Iowa is west of the entire state of Ohio, Lake
      Icaria must be west of Meander Creek Reservoir.

      to establish their relative positions. I''m anticipating some interesting spatial
      relationships between these two diverse points.



      **Assessing Relative Positions**


      I''m now focusing on the difference in longitudes. After reviewing the information
      I have, I realize that longitude *increases* as you go *east*. So, the Lower
      Granite Dam, located east of Seattle, should have a larger longitude value than
      St. Mark''s Cathedral. I need to get those specific coordinates to quantify
      the difference.

      I''ve just pinpointed the two places I''m working with: the Aladdin Theater
      in Portland, Oregon, and Hebgen Lake in Montana. Next step is nailing down their
      exact coordinates, so I can work out how far apart they are.



      **Mapping the Distances**


      I''ve now established that the Aladdin Theater is further west than Hebgen Lake,
      which is crucial for visualizing their positions. Next up, I will need to get
      more precise longitudes and latitudes. Then, I''ll be able to calculate the
      separation between the two sites.



      **Reasoning Through The Positions**


      I''ve thoroughly organized the states where these sites reside: Oregon and Montana.
      By cross-referencing their general locations, and considering the Aladdin Theater''s
      position in Portland, Oregon and Hebgen Lake''s location in Montana, I can safely
      conclude that the Aladdin Theater is farther west. I''ve formulated the step-by-step
      reasoning.

      Montana.

      3.  **Compare the geographical positions of the states:** On a map of the United
      States, the state of Oregon is located on the Pacific Coast. The state of Montana
      is located to the east of Oregon (with Idaho in between).

      4.  **Conclusion:** Since the entire state of Oregon is west of the entire state
      of Montana, any point within Portland, Oregon, is west of any point within Hebgen
      Lake, Montana.

      I''ve successfully identified the two locations as the Muskingum River Power
      Plant in Ohio and the Cyclorama Building at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. My current
      focus is pinpointing the exact coordinates for both sites. The Muskingum River
      Power Plant''s name suggests its location, so that''s promising. Gettysburg
      will require a bit more digging.



      **Comparing the Locations**


      I''ve determined the state and city for each location: Beverly, Ohio for the
      Muskingum River Plant and Gettysburg, Pennsylvania for the Cyclorama Building.

      I''ve pinpointed the core question: determining if the Benton County Wind Farm
      in Indiana sits west of Lake Surprise in New Jersey. Now, I''m breaking it down,
      identifying the specific geographic coordinates needed for each location to
      enable a precise comparison. This stage involves pinpointing the exact position
      of each.



      **Pinpointing Precise Locations**


      I''m now focused on gathering geographical coordinates. I''ve determined that
      the wind farm is in Benton County, Indiana, near Fowler. Lake Surprise is in
      the Watchung Reservation, Union County, New Jersey. My next step is to find
      the exact latitude and longitude for each location to compare them effectively,
      ensuring I have the correct data for the comparison.



      **Mapping Relative Positioning**


      I''ve moved beyond gathering coordinates and started visualizing the relationship.
      Using the established locations and their approximate longitudes, I''m now comparing
      the values, noting that a more negative longitude indicates a location further
      west. This comparison confirms the wind farm''s westerly position relative to
      Lake Surprise. I''m compiling this into step-by-step reasoning.



      **Structuring Logical Reasoning**


      I''ve formalized the comparison process. My steps are now clearly articulated:
      Identifying locations, finding approximate longitudes, and contrasting those
      values. The step-by-step formulation is complete, leading directly to the final
      answer, ensuring the user''s requirements are met precisely. Now, I''m formatting
      the answer appropriately.

      New Mexico lies east of California, hence, any location in California is west
      of any location in New Mexico. The answer should now be clear.



      **Mapping Out the Solution**


      I''m now synthesizing my findings. I''ve formalized the step-by-step process:
      Locate Don Pedro (CA), then Heron Lake (NM). I''m comparing the states, and
      I''m preparing to confirm that California is west of New Mexico, leading to
      the concluding "YES" to the original question. The answer is almost ready to
      be presented.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of Don Pedro Reservoir, CA:** Don Pedro Reservoir
      is located in Tuolumne County, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains
      in central California.

      2.  **Identify the location of Heron Lake, NM:** Heron Lake is located in Rio
      Arriba County in northern New Mexico.

      3.  **Compare the locations of the two states:** The state of California is
      on the Pacific coast of the United States. The state of New Mexico is located
      to the east of Arizona, which is itself east of California.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, any location in California is geographically
      west of any location in New Mexico.

      I''m currently focused on the core geographical question: is Don Pedro Reservoir
      west of Heron Lake? I''ve successfully deconstructed the question, identifying
      the two key locations that need comparison. Next, I''ll need to determine their
      respective longitudes and then make the assessment.



      **Determining Longitudinal Data**


      I''ve moved onto the next crucial phase: pinpointing the longitudinal coordinates
      for each location. I''ve started by locating Don Pedro Reservoir in central
      California. Subsequently, I''ll pinpoint Heron Lake''s position in northern
      New Mexico. The relative east-west positions of the two, i.e., the comparison
      of their longitudinal values, will tell me if Don Pedro Reservoir is west of
      Heron Lake.



      **Evaluating Positional Comparisons**


      I''ve now parsed the question fully, identified the two locations, and confirmed
      the "west of" relationship is dependent on longitude. I''ve also confirmed my
      understanding of the comparative question. My focus is now on how to determine
      the relative longitudes. I can see that a map of the US would provide the answer,
      as California is west of New Mexico.



      **Formulating a Definitive Answer**


      I''m streamlining the entire thought process into a clear, concise conclusion.
      I''ve synthesized the key steps: identifying locations, comparing their longitudes
      using US map visualization and then confirming it through specific longitude
      values. I''m now on the verge of finalizing the answer, presenting the step-by-step
      reasoning and the final "YES" answer.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the first location:** Don Pedro Reservoir is in California.

      2.  **Identify the second location:** Heron Lake is in New Mexico.

      3.  **Compare their relative positions on a map of the United States:** The
      state of California is on the Pacific coast. The state of New Mexico is located
      to the east of Arizona and is much farther inland.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, any location in California is geographically
      west of any location in New Mexico.

      \ Lake Crabtree: ~78.79\xB0 W), I made a comparative analysis. Recognizing that\
      \ larger longitude values in the Western Hemisphere indicate positions further\
      \ west, the final answer emerged. The solution has been organized into a step-by-step\
      \ reasoning that culminates in a clear and concise \"YES\" as the definitive\
      \ answer.\n\n\n</think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Find the\
      \ location of Lake Nottely, GA:** Lake Nottely is located in Union County, in\
      \ the northern part of Georgia. Its approximate longitude is 84.05\xB0 West.\n\
      2.  **Find the location of Lake Crabtree, NC:** Lake Crabtree is located in\
      \ Wake County, North Carolina, near Raleigh and Morrisville. Its approximate\
      \ longitude is 78.79\xB0 West.\n3.  **Compare the longitudes:** When comparing\
      \ longitudes in the Western Hemisphere, a larger number indicates a position\
      \ further to the west. Since 84.05 is a larger number than 78.79, Lake Nottely\
      \ is located further west than Lake Crabtree.\n\n**YES**"
    e326492c-0f2d-4a06-9244-cd96efe99ab7: "<think>**Comparing Locations Geographically**\n\
      \nI'm focusing on the core geographical question: is Lake Nottely, GA, west\
      \ of Lake Crabtree, NC? My first task is identifying this as a longitude comparison\
      \ problem. It's clear I'll need to find the longitudes of both locations to\
      \ determine their relative positions. Next, I will need to deconstruct the question\
      \ into necessary steps to reach the end.\n\n\n**Analyzing Coordinate Data**\n\
      \nI've determined the initial coordinates for both lakes, with Lake Nottely,\
      \ GA, at approximately -84.1 degrees longitude and Lake Crabtree, NC, around\
      \ -78.8 degrees. Now I will compare the longitudes and check for errors, and\
      \ refine the locations to arrive at a definitive east/west relationship. The\
      \ next step is to finalize the answer by comparing the two longitudes.\n\n\n\
      **Determining Relative Longitudes**\n\nThe longitudes are now compared, with\
      \ Lake Nottely at -84.1 degrees and Lake Crabtree at -78.8 degrees. I've concluded\
      \ that because -84.1 is more negative than -78.8, Lake Nottely is indeed located\
      \ west of Lake Crabtree. My final step is to formally state the yes/no answer\
      \ to the original geographical inquiry.\n\n\n**Refining the Response Structure**\n\
      \nI've revised the structure to align with the step-by-step reasoning requested.\
      \ My approach is now more directly focused on finding, comparing, and concluding\
      \ the relationship between the two longitudes. I've broken down the steps clearly,\
      \ ensuring the final answer is well-supported and easy to follow. I think this\
      \ format delivers the information in a more digestible way.\n\n\n**Formulating\
      \ a Concise Response**\n\nI've finalized my response structure. I'm focusing\
      \ on providing the user with a clear, step-by-step answer, starting with identifying\
      \ the relevant longitudes for each lake. The subsequent steps involve comparing\
      \ these longitudes and formulating the final conclusion in a way that directly\
      \ addresses the initial geographical query. The response is now organized for\
      \ logical flow and clarity. I will now integrate this format and craft the definitive\
      \ response.\n\n\n</think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Step 1:\
      \ Locate Lake Nottely, GA.** Lake Nottely is a reservoir in Union County, in\
      \ the northern part of Georgia. Its approximate longitude is 84.1\xB0 West.\n\
      \n2.  **Step 2: Locate Lake Crabtree, NC.** Lake Crabtree is a reservoir in\
      \ Wake County, North Carolina, near the cities of Raleigh and Morrisville. Its\
      \ approximate longitude is 78.8\xB0 West.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**\
      \ In the Western Hemisphere, a location with a higher longitude number is further\
      \ west. Comparing the two values, 84.1\xB0 is a higher number than 78.8\xB0\
      .\n\n4.  **Step 4: Conclusion.** Since the longitude of Lake Nottely (84.1\xB0\
      \ W) is greater than the longitude of Lake Crabtree (78.8\xB0 W), Lake Nottely\
      \ is located to the west of Lake Crabtree.\n\n**YES**"
