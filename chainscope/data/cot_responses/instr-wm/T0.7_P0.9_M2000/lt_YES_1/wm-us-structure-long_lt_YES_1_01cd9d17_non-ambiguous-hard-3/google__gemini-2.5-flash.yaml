      determine the answer.


      **Step 1: Locate St. Ambrose Cathedral (Des Moines, Iowa), IA.**

      * Des Moines, Iowa is in the central United States.

      * Its approximate longitude is -93.62 degrees West.


      **Step 2: Locate Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project, WY.**

      * The "WY" indicates Wyoming.

      * This project is a large wind farm located in Carbon County, Wyoming.

      * Wyoming is west of Iowa.

      * Specifically, Carbon County, Wyoming, is roughly between -106 and -108 degrees
      West longitude.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      * St. Ambrose Cathedral: Approximately -93.62 degrees West.

      * Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project: Approximately -106 to -108
      degrees West.


      **Step 4: Determine "west of."**

      A location is "west of" another if its longitude is a larger negative number
      (or a larger number when dealing with West longitudes, as they increase as you
      go west).


      * -106 is a larger negative number than -93.62.

      * Therefore, the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project is geographically
      west of St. Ambrose Cathedral.


      **Final Answer:**

      YES'

      answer.


      **Step 1: Locate Saint Joseph Parish (Mountain View, California), CA**

      Mountain View, California is on the west coast of the United States. Its approximate
      longitude is -122.08 degrees West.


      **Step 2: Locate Navajo Lake, NM**

      Navajo Lake is in New Mexico, which is in the southwestern United States. Its
      approximate longitude is -107.82 degrees West.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes**

      *   Saint Joseph Parish: -122.08 degrees West

      *   Navajo Lake: -107.82 degrees West


      On a longitude scale, numbers further west are more negative. Since -122.08
      is a more negative number (further to the left on a number line) than -107.82,
      Saint Joseph Parish is located west of Navajo Lake.

    cd8cdd17-d7fb-46d4-895a-8514cd3f8b89: 'Let''s break this down step-by-step:


      1.  **Locate Rose Valley Lake, PA:** This is a real place. A quick search confirms
      it''s in Delaware County, Pennsylvania.

      2.  **Locate Bunch-of-Grapes, MA:** This sounds like a fictional or highly obscure
      place. A search for "Bunch-of-Grapes, MA" (or any variation) does not yield
      a recognizable town, landmark, or geographical feature in Massachusetts. There
      might be a very small, unofficial local nickname, or it could be a made-up place
      name for the purpose of the question.


      Given that "Bunch-of-Grapes, MA" does not appear to be a real, established geographical
      location, it''s impossible to determine its position relative to Rose Valley
      Lake, PA.


      Therefore, the question cannot be answered with a definitive YES or NO based
      on verifiable geographical information.


      However, if we are forced to treat "Bunch-of-Grapes, MA" as a hypothetical point
      somewhere within Massachusetts, then almost all of Pennsylvania (including Rose
      Valley Lake) is *west* of Massachusetts.


      But since the premise of locating "Bunch-of-Grapes, MA" fails, the question
      is unanswerable as posed.


      If I *must* give a YES/NO answer assuming "Bunch-of-Grapes, MA" refers to *any*
      point within the state of Massachusetts:


      Pennsylvania is generally west of Massachusetts. Rose Valley Lake is in eastern
      Pennsylvania, but still west of the vast majority of Massachusetts.


      So, if "Bunch-of-Grapes, MA" is anywhere within Massachusetts, Rose Valley Lake,
      PA, is almost certainly west of it.

      \ there isn't a prominent, named \"San Andreas Lake\" that is widely recognized\
      \ or easily found on maps as a distinct body of water. There are many small,\
      \ unnamed lakes and reservoirs along or near the fault, but not a \"San Andreas\
      \ Lake\" like Lake Tahoe or Salton Sea. For the purpose of this question, we\
      \ have to assume it refers to a hypothetical or very small, obscure body of\
      \ water *somewhere along the San Andreas Fault in California*. The San Andreas\
      \ Fault runs generally northwest-southeast through California. For a rough geographical\

      \ has longitudes generally between 114\xB0W and 124\xB0W. Any point along the\
      \ San Andreas Fault will have a longitude further west than 112.44\xB0W. For\
      \ example, parts of the fault near Los Angeles are around 118\xB0W, and further\

      \ location with a higher West longitude number is further west. Since California's\
      \ longitudes (where \"San Andreas Lake\" would be) are all higher west longitudes\
      \ (e.g., 118\xB0W, 120\xB0W) than Panguitch Lake's longitude (112.44\xB0W),\

      increase.


      Since 101.83 is a larger number than 97.44 (when referring to West longitudes),
      Amarillo, TX is further west than Norman, OK.


      **Conclusion:**


      YES'
