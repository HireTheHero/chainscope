      To solve this, I need to consider the relative locations of Illinois and New
      York on a map of the United States.


      Step 1: Identify the general locations.

      - Illinois is a state in the Midwest region of the United States.

      - New York is a state in the Northeast region of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions east-west.

      - Illinois is west of New York. States in the Midwest like Illinois are generally
      west of states in the Northeast like New York.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations.

      - Skokie Lagoons would be in Illinois, so it would be in the Midwest.

      - Beacon Reservoir in Dutchess County would be in New York, so it would be in
      the Northeast.

      Determining if Skokie Lagoons, IL is west of Beacon Reservoir, NY


      I need to determine the east-west relationship between these two water bodies
      by examining their locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Skokie Lagoons is in Illinois (IL)

      - Beacon Reservoir is in Dutchess County, New York (NY)


      ## Step 2: Determine relative positions of the states

      Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while New York
      is in the Northeast region.


      On a US map, Illinois is significantly west of New York. The entire state of
      Illinois is west of New York state.


      ## Step 3: Draw conclusion about the specific locations

      Since Skokie Lagoons is in Illinois and Beacon Reservoir is in New York, and
      Illinois is entirely west of New York, it follows that Skokie Lagoons must be
      west of Beacon Reservoir.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both water bodies.

      - Skokie Lagoons is located in northeastern Illinois, near Chicago.

      - Beacon Reservoir is located in Dutchess County in eastern New York state.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States.

      - New York is in the Northeast region.

      - On a map of the United States, Illinois is positioned to the west of New York.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Even though both may have specific locations within their respective states,
      the overall east-west relationship remains consistent - any location in northeastern
      Illinois would be west of a location in eastern New York.

      longitude values, while states to the right (east) have higher longitude values.


      Step 3: Consider the locations of the specific lakes within their states

      Even if the lakes are on opposite edges of their respective states, the fact
      that Kansas and Tennessee are quite far apart means that the general state positions
      likely determine the answer.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion

      Since Kansas is west of Tennessee, it''s almost certain that Big Hill Lake in
      Kansas is west of Boone Lake in Tennessee.</think>I''ll solve this step-by-step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations by state.

      - Big Hill Lake is in Kansas (KS)

      - Boone Lake is in Tennessee (TN)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      Kansas is located in the central United States, while Tennessee is in the eastern
      United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      On a map of the United States, Kansas is positioned to the west of Tennessee.
      The entire state of Kansas lies west of the entire state of Tennessee.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific lakes.

      Since Big Hill Lake is in Kansas and Boone Lake is in Tennessee, and Kansas
      is entirely west of Tennessee, it follows that Big Hill Lake must be west of
      Boone Lake.

      - Copper Mountain Solar Facility is in Nevada (NV)


      California is generally west of Nevada on the US map. California borders the
      Pacific Ocean on its western side, while Nevada is inland and borders California
      on its eastern side.


      Given this general geographic relationship between the two states, it''s likely
      that a structure in California would be west of a structure in Nevada. However,
      I should be careful because the exact locations within each state matter. For
      example, if Pine Flat Dam were in far eastern California and Copper Mountain
      Solar Facility were in far western Nevada, the answer might not be so straightforward.


      Pine Flat Dam is located in Fresno County in central California, on the Kings
      River.

      Copper Mountain Solar Facility is located near Boulder City, Nevada, which is
      in the southern tip of Nevada near Las Vegas.


      Since Pine Flat Dam is in central California, and Copper Mountain Solar Facility
      is in southern Nevada, the dam should be west of the solar facility, following
      the general west-to-east orientation of California to Nevada.</think># Is Pine
      Flat Dam, CA located west of Copper Mountain Solar Facility, NV?


      I need to determine the relative locations of these two structures.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) Pine Flat Dam is located in Fresno County, California

      2) Copper Mountain Solar Facility is located near Boulder City in southern Nevada

      3) California is generally west of Nevada on the US map

      4) California borders the Pacific Ocean on its west side, while Nevada is inland
      and east of California

      5) Even considering their specific locations within their states, central California
      (where Pine Flat Dam is) would be west of southern Nevada (where Copper Mountain
      Solar Facility is)


      Therefore, YES, Pine Flat Dam, CA is located west of Copper Mountain Solar Facility,
      NV.'

      So the answer would be YES, the Basilica in Ohio is located west of the Edison
      Theatre in New York.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the
      relative east-west positions of these two locations.

      - Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon is in North Jackson, Ohio
      (OH)

      - Edison Theatre is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positioning of these states.

      Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while New York is
      in the Northeast.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      On a map of the United States, Ohio is positioned to the west of New York. This
      is true regardless of the specific locations within each state.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on their state locations.

      Since North Jackson, Ohio is in a state that is west of New York state, the
      Basilica must be west of Edison Theatre.

      - Even though North Jackson is in northeastern Ohio, all of Ohio is west of
      New York

      - Regardless of where in New York the Edison Theatre is located, the Ohio location
      must be west of it

      To determine which is further west, I need to know their relative longitudes.
      West corresponds to higher (more negative) longitude values in the Western Hemisphere.


      Let me think about the general locations:

      - Flagstaff, Arizona is in northern Arizona

      - Santa Fe, New Mexico is in northern New Mexico


      Arizona is generally west of New Mexico, as Arizona borders California on the
      west while New Mexico borders Texas on the east.


      Given the geographic arrangement of these states, it''s very likely that Flagstaff,
      AZ is west of Santa Fe, NM. Therefore, the Orpheum Theater in Flagstaff would

      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      - Flagstaff is in northern Arizona

      - Santa Fe is in northern New Mexico

      - These cities maintain the same west-east relationship as their states


      Since Flagstaff, Arizona is west of Santa Fe, New Mexico, the Orpheum Theater
      must be west of the Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi.

      Let me think about the locations:


      1. Las Vegas, New Mexico is in the northeastern part of New Mexico state

      2. Bull Shoals Dam is in northern Arkansas


      In the United States, states are generally arranged as follows from west to
      east:

      - Western states include California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Idaho, Utah,
      Arizona, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico

      - Central states include North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma,
      Texas

      - Eastern states include Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, and
      further east


      New Mexico is definitely west of Arkansas. New Mexico borders Arizona to its
      west and Texas to its east, while Arkansas is east of Texas. So any location
      in New Mexico would be west of any location in Arkansas.

      - Arizona is in the southwestern United States

      - Texas is in the south-central United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Arizona is generally west of Texas

      - Arizona borders California to its west and New Mexico to its east

      Since Sahuarita Lake is in Arizona and Red Bluff Reservoir is in Texas, and
      Arizona is west of Texas, it''s likely that Sahuarita Lake is west of Red Bluff
      Reservoir.


      However, I should be careful because Red Bluff Reservoir might be in western
      Texas (near the New Mexico border), and Sahuarita Lake might be in eastern Arizona.
      So let me think more precisely.


      Sahuarita Lake is in Sahuarita, Arizona, which is in southern Arizona, near
      Tucson.

      Red Bluff Reservoir is on the Texas-New Mexico border, in the western part of

      (Oklahoma), OK?


      I''ll think about this step by step:


      1) First, I need to consider the general geography of the United States.

      2) Arizona (AZ) is located in the southwestern United States.

      3) Oklahoma (OK) is located in the south-central United States.

      4) On a map of the US, Arizona is positioned significantly to the west of Oklahoma.

      5) Kaibab Lake is in Arizona, while Lake Ellsworth is in Oklahoma.

      6) Since Arizona is entirely west of Oklahoma geographically, any lake in Arizona
      (including Kaibab Lake) would be west of any lake in Oklahoma (including Lake
      Ellsworth).


      YES, Kaibab Lake, AZ is located west of Lake Ellsworth, OK.'
    809a28a7-a6e3-4238-8660-dbfe8f80f056: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the locations of Kaibab Lake in Arizona and Lake Ellsworth in Oklahoma,
      and then compare their east-west positions.


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Arizona is in the southwestern part of the United States

      - Oklahoma is in the south-central part of the United States

      - Generally, Arizona is west of Oklahoma


      Let me be more specific about these lakes:

      - Kaibab Lake is in Arizona (AZ)

      - Lake Ellsworth is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Since Arizona is west of Oklahoma on the map of the United States, and Kaibab
      Lake is in Arizona while Lake Ellsworth is in Oklahoma, it''s reasonable to
      conclude that Kaibab Lake is west of Lake Ellsworth.


      So yes, Kaibab Lake, AZ is located west of Lake Ellsworth, OK.</think>I need
      to determine the relative east-west positions of these two lakes.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these lakes are located.

      - Kaibab Lake is in Arizona (AZ)

      - Lake Ellsworth is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes.

      - Arizona lies entirely west of Oklahoma on the U.S. map

      - States in the western U.S. (like Arizona) are at more westerly longitudes
      than central states (like Oklahoma)


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the lakes.

      Since Kaibab Lake is in Arizona and Lake Ellsworth is in Oklahoma, and Arizona
      is west of Oklahoma, Kaibab Lake must be west of Lake Ellsworth.


      YES'

      In the US, states are positioned such that:

      - Virginia (VA) is on the East Coast


      Looking at their relative positions on a US map:

      Therefore, La Comedia Dinner Theatre in Ohio should be west of Truro Church
      in Fairfax, Virginia.


      Let me double-check this logic: When we look at a US map, Ohio is positioned
      to the west of Virginia. So any location in Ohio would be west of any location
      in Virginia, regardless of their specific locations within those states.</think>I

      St. Louis, Missouri is located in the Midwest region of the United States, roughly

      further west have higher longitude values.


      The key information is that:

      - St. Louis is in Missouri (MO), which is in the Midwest region

      - Fairfax is in Virginia (VA), which is on the East Coast


      Missouri is significantly west of Virginia in the United States. Missouri is
      roughly in the middle of the country while Virginia is on the eastern seaboard.


      So Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis in St. Louis, MO is west of Fairfax Community
      Church in VA.</think>To determine if Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis (in St.
      Louis, MO) is located west of Fairfax Community Church (in VA), I need to compare
      their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Consider the locations of Missouri and Virginia within the United States.

      - Missouri (MO) is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Virginia (VA) is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 2: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Missouri is significantly west of Virginia on the US map

      - St. Louis is in eastern Missouri, but even eastern Missouri is still west
      of any part of Virginia

      - Fairfax is in northern Virginia, near Washington DC


      Step 3: Make the determination based on their positions.

      - Since Missouri is west of Virginia on the US map, the Cathedral Basilica in
      St. Louis must be west of the Fairfax Community Church

      1. Is East Branch Clarion River Lake, PA located west of 120 Wall Street, NY?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two locations.


      First, I need to understand where each location is:


      - East Branch Clarion River Lake is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 120 Wall Street is in New York (NY), specifically in Manhattan, New York City


      In the United States, Pennsylvania is located west of New York State. More specifically:

      - Pennsylvania is in the Mid-Atlantic region

      - New York is in the Northeast


      Wall Street is in the southeastern part of Manhattan in New York City, which
      is in the southeastern part of New York State.

      East Branch Clarion River Lake would be somewhere in Pennsylvania, which is

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - East Branch Clarion River Lake is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 120 Wall Street is in New York (NY), specifically in Manhattan, New York City


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Pennsylvania is located west of New York State on the map of the United States.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - 120 Wall Street is in the southeastern part of Manhattan in New York City,
      which itself is in the southeastern part of New York State.

      - East Branch Clarion River Lake is in Pennsylvania, which as a whole state
      lies west of New York City.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these geographic relationships.

      Since Pennsylvania is west of New York, and East Branch Clarion River Lake is
      in Pennsylvania while 120 Wall Street is in New York City, the lake must be
      west of Wall Street.

      The United States is generally oriented with west on the left side of the map
      and east on the right side. Kansas (KS) is located in the central part of the
      United States, while Indiana (IN) is located in the Midwest, but further east
      than Kansas.


      Kansas is definitely west of Indiana in terms of longitude. Since Hillsdale
      Lake is in Kansas and Griffy Lake is in Indiana, Hillsdale Lake would be west
      of Griffy Lake.


      So the answer is YES, Hillsdale Lake, KS is located west of Griffy Lake, IN.</think>I
      need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two lakes by looking
      at which states they''re in.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each lake is located.

      - Hillsdale Lake is in Kansas (KS)

      - Griffy Lake is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of Kansas and Indiana.

      - Kansas is located in the central United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region

      - Looking at a US map, Kansas is significantly west of Indiana


      Step 3: Since lakes are fixed geographic features within their states, the relative
      position of the states determines the relative position of the lakes.

      - Since Kansas is west of Indiana, Hillsdale Lake must be west of Griffy Lake


      YES, Hillsdale Lake, KS is located west of Griffy Lake, IN.'

      - Civic Theatre is in New Orleans, Louisiana (LA)


      Texas is generally west of Louisiana in the United States. Louisiana borders
      Texas on Texas''s eastern border.

      - New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana, quite far east in the state

      - Barker Reservoir is in Texas (likely in the Houston area based on major reservoirs
      in Texas)


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these geographic facts

      Even if Barker Reservoir were in eastern Texas, it would still be west of New

      First, let me think about the states:

      - Illinois (IL) is in the Midwest

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Illinois is west of Pennsylvania. On a west-to-east

      Since Peoria, Illinois is in Illinois, and the Sparks Shot Tower is in Pennsylvania,
      and Illinois is west of Pennsylvania, then the Cathedral in Peoria would be

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region


      On a west-to-east basis, Illinois is positioned clearly to the west of Pennsylvania.
      The entire state of Illinois lies west of Pennsylvania.


      Since Peoria is in Illinois, and the Sparks Shot Tower is in Pennsylvania, the

      - Nashville, Tennessee is in the central part of Tennessee

      - North Carolina is a state on the east coast of the US


      Tennessee is generally west of North Carolina in the United States. Tennessee

      - Kanuga Conference Center is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Tennessee is located to the west of North Carolina. These states actually share
      a border, with North Carolina to the east of Tennessee.


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities within these states.

      Nashville is in the central part of Tennessee, while Kanuga Conference Center

      Step 2: Consider the specific cities.

      Nashville is located in the central part of Tennessee. Kanuga Conference Center
      is in Hendersonville, North Carolina, which is in the western part of North
      Carolina.


      Step 3: Compare the relative east-west positions.

      Even though Kanuga is in western North Carolina, all of Tennessee (including
      Nashville) is still west of even the westernmost parts of North Carolina due
      to how the states are positioned.


      YES, the Cathedral of the Incarnation in Nashville, Tennessee is located west

      To determine if one is west of the other, I need to compare their longitudes.
      Places further west have a larger negative longitude value (in the Western Hemisphere).


      First, let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - South Dakota is in the northern central part of the US

      - Michigan is in the upper Midwest, bordering the Great Lakes


      Generally speaking, South Dakota is west of Michigan. The entire state of South
      Dakota is west of Michigan.


      Since Big Bend Dam is in South Dakota, and the Cathedral of Saint Andrew is
      in Grand Rapids, Michigan, we can conclude that Big Bend Dam is west of the
      Cathedral of Saint Andrew.</think># Is Big Bend Dam, SD located west of Cathedral
      of Saint Andrew (Grand Rapids, Michigan), MI?


      I''ll think about the geographic locations of these two places:


      1. Big Bend Dam is located in South Dakota (SD), which is in the north-central
      United States.

      2. Cathedral of Saint Andrew is in Grand Rapids, Michigan (MI), which is in
      the Upper Midwest region.


      Looking at the geography of the United States:

      - South Dakota is positioned to the west of Michigan in the country''s layout

      - All of South Dakota is west of all of Michigan

      - Since Big Bend Dam is in South Dakota, and the Cathedral of Saint Andrew is
      in Michigan, the dam must be west of the cathedral


      YES, Big Bend Dam, SD is located west of Cathedral of Saint Andrew in Grand
      Rapids, Michigan.'

      I need to determine if Brookville Lake Dam is located west of Youghiogheny River
      Lake.


      First, let''s consider the general geography:

      - Indiana (IN) is a state in the Midwest of the United States

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is a state in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region of the United
      States

      - Generally, Indiana is west of Pennsylvania on a map of the United States


      Since Brookville Lake Dam is in Indiana and Youghiogheny River Lake is in Pennsylvania,
      and Indiana is generally west of Pennsylvania, it''s very likely that Brookville
      Lake Dam is west of Youghiogheny River Lake.


      To be more precise:

      - Brookville Lake Dam would be in the eastern part of Indiana

      - Youghiogheny River Lake would be somewhere in Pennsylvania, possibly in the
      western part since it''s a river that flows through parts of West Virginia,
      Pennsylvania, and Maryland

      First, I know that Indiana (IN) is a state in the Midwest of the United States,
      while Pennsylvania (PA) is a state in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region.


      In terms of their general positions, Indiana is west of Pennsylvania on a US
      map. Indiana borders Illinois to its west and Ohio to its east, while Pennsylvania
      is further east, bordering Ohio on its western side.


      Since Brookville Lake Dam is in Indiana and Youghiogheny River Lake is in Pennsylvania,
      and Indiana is west of Pennsylvania, it''s very likely that Brookville Lake
      Dam is west of Youghiogheny River Lake.


      To be even more precise, I should consider where these specific locations are
      within their states. Brookville Lake is in eastern Indiana, and Youghiogheny
      River Lake is in southwestern Pennsylvania. Even with these specific locations,
      the general west-to-east relationship holds, as eastern Indiana is still west
      of southwestern Pennsylvania.</think>To determine whether Brookville Lake Dam,
      IN is located west of Youghiogheny River Lake, PA, I need to consider the geographic

      region of the United States, while Pennsylvania (PA) is in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic
      region.


      Step 2: Looking at a map of the US, Indiana is positioned west of Pennsylvania.
      The entire state of Indiana lies west of the entire state of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within each state. Brookville Lake Dam
      is in eastern Indiana, while Youghiogheny River Lake is in southwestern Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Even though Brookville Lake Dam is in eastern Indiana (closer to Pennsylvania)
      and Youghiogheny River Lake is in southwestern Pennsylvania (closer to Indiana),
      the west-to-east relationship still holds because the states themselves don''t

      Now I need to determine which one is further west. In the United States:

      - California is located on the west coast

      - Arizona is located east of California


      In general, locations in California tend to be west of locations in Arizona
      due to the geographic positions of these states. California borders the Pacific
      Ocean on its western side, while Arizona is an inland state that borders California
      on its eastern side.


      So if New Exchequer Dam is in California and Navajo Generating Station is in
      Arizona, then it''s very likely that New Exchequer Dam is west of Navajo Generating
      Station.


      However, I should check if there are any unusual geographic arrangements that
      might make this untrue, such as if the dam is on the far eastern edge of California
      and the generating station is on the far western edge of Arizona.

      with California to the west)


      Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the specific structures.

      - Since New Exchequer Dam is in California, and Navajo Generating Station is
      in Arizona, the dam would be located west of the generating station.


      YES, New Exchequer Dam, CA is located west of Navajo Generating Station, AZ.'

      Next, I need to think about the geographic relationship between California and
      Arizona. California is located on the west coast of the United States, while
      Arizona is inland and east of California.


      Given the general geography of these states:

      - California is west of Arizona

      - New Exchequer Dam is in California

      - Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona


      Therefore, it is likely that New Exchequer Dam (in CA) is west of Navajo Generating
      Station (in AZ).


      However, I should be careful about making assumptions based just on state locations,
      since specific locations within states could change this relationship. Let me
      consider the specific locations within these states:


      New Exchequer Dam is on the Merced River in California, which is in the central
      part of California.

      Navajo Generating Station is in Page, Arizona, which is in the northern part
      of Arizona near the Utah border.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona is an inland state that borders California to the east


      Step 3: Examine more specific locations.

      - New Exchequer Dam is located in central California (in Mariposa County)

      - Navajo Generating Station was located in northern Arizona near Page, AZ


      Step 4: Determine the east-west relationship.

      - Since California is entirely west of Arizona, and these structures are not

      To determine whether one is west of the other, I need to think about the geographical
      locations of California and Arizona states, and then more specifically about
      these structures.


      General state locations:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona is inland, bordering California on California''s eastern border


      Based on the general geography of the states:

      - California is west of Arizona

      - Structures in California are typically west of structures in Arizona


      New Exchequer Dam is in California (CA), and Navajo Generating Station is in
      Arizona (AZ).


      Since California is west of Arizona, and New Exchequer Dam is in California
      while Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona, New Exchequer Dam would generally
      be west of Navajo Generating Station.


      There could potentially be exceptions if the structures are very close to the
      CA-AZ border and positioned in an unusual way, but given that New Exchequer

      California is located on the west coast of the United States, while Arizona
      is an inland state that borders California on its eastern side.


      Step 2: Apply this state-level geography to the structures.

      New Exchequer Dam is in California (CA), which means it''s in the state that''s
      further west.

      Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona (AZ), which is east of California.

      1. Basilica of San Albino in New Mexico (NM)

      2. King Mountain Wind Farm in Texas (TX)


      Then I need to determine if the basilica is west of the wind farm.


      Let me think about the rough geography:

      - New Mexico is generally west of Texas in the United States

      - Basilica of San Albino is in New Mexico

      - King Mountain Wind Farm is in Texas


      Given that New Mexico borders Texas on its eastern side, and Texas is east of

      The Basilica of San Albino is specifically in Mesilla, New Mexico, which is
      in the southern part of New Mexico near Las Cruces and close to the Mexico border.


      King Mountain Wind Farm is in Texas, and while I don''t know its exact location,
      Texas wind farms are often in the western parts of Texas.

      2. **King Mountain Wind Farm** is located in Upton County, Texas (TX), in the

      Looking at the geographic relationship between states:

      - New Mexico is located directly west of Texas

      - Even though King Mountain Wind Farm is in western Texas, it is still east
      of the New Mexico border


      Since the Basilica of San Albino is in New Mexico, and New Mexico is west of

      relative locations of two structures in the western United States:

      1. Trojan Nuclear Power Plant in Oregon (OR)

      2. Ice Harbor Dam in Washington (WA)


      The question specifically asks if Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is located west
      of Ice Harbor Dam.


      To answer this, I need to determine the locations of these two structures:


      Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was located in Columbia County, Oregon, along the
      Columbia River. It was on the western side of Oregon, not far from Portland.


      Ice Harbor Dam is located on the Snake River in Washington state. The Snake
      River flows through eastern Washington and eventually joins the Columbia River.


      In terms of US geography, Oregon is west of Washington state, but Washington
      wraps around the northern part of Oregon. So I need to be more specific about
      these locations.


      The Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was on the western side of Oregon, near the Pacific
      coast. Ice Harbor Dam is on the Snake River in eastern Washington.


      Generally speaking, locations in western Oregon would be west of locations in
      eastern Washington. So Trojan Nuclear Power Plant would likely be west of Ice
      Harbor Dam.


      However, I should confirm based on more specific geographic knowledge:

      - Western Oregon is definitely west of eastern Washington

      - The Trojan plant was on the Columbia River in western Oregon

      - Ice Harbor Dam is on the Snake River in eastern Washington


      So yes, Trojan Nuclear Power Plant in Oregon was west of Ice Harbor Dam in Washington.</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two structures.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both structures.

      - Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was located in Columbia County, Oregon, along the
      Columbia River near Rainier, in the northwestern part of Oregon.

      - Ice Harbor Dam is located on the Snake River in eastern Washington state,
      near the town of Burbank.


      Step 2: Compare their geographical positions.

      - Northwestern Oregon is situated toward the Pacific coast.

      - Eastern Washington is much further inland, away from the Pacific coast.

      - The Snake River (where Ice Harbor Dam is located) is in the eastern portion
      of Washington state.


      Step 3: Determine their relative east-west positioning.

      - Places closer to the Pacific coast are more western than places further inland.

      - Northwestern Oregon is west of eastern Washington.

      - Therefore, Trojan Nuclear Power Plant''s location is west of Ice Harbor Dam''s
      location.


      YES'

      by step:


      1. The question is asking about the relative locations of two structures: Trojan

      2. Specifically, I need to determine if Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is located
      west of Ice Harbor Dam.


      3. To answer this, I need to think about the geography of Oregon and Washington
      states.


      4. Washington state is north of Oregon.


      5. The Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was located on the Columbia River in Oregon,
      near Rainier, Oregon. The Columbia River forms much of the border between Oregon
      and Washington.


      6. Ice Harbor Dam is on the Snake River in Washington state. The Snake River
      is a major tributary of the Columbia River, joining the Columbia from the east.


      7. Generally speaking, the Columbia River flows west to the Pacific Ocean, and
      the Snake River flows westward to join the Columbia.


      8. Since Ice Harbor Dam is on the Snake River in eastern Washington, and Trojan
      Nuclear Power Plant was on the Columbia River in western Oregon (closer to the
      Pacific coast), Trojan would be west of Ice Harbor Dam.</think># Is Trojan Nuclear
      Power Plant, OR located west of Ice Harbor Dam, WA?


      Let me think through the geographic locations of these two structures:


      1) Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was located in Oregon along the Columbia River
      near Rainier, in the northwestern part of the state close to the Pacific Ocean.


      2) Ice Harbor Dam is located on the Snake River in Washington state, in the
      eastern part of Washington near the Idaho border.


      3) In the Pacific Northwest, the general geography flows from east to west,
      with the Cascade Mountains in the middle and the Pacific Ocean to the west.


      4) The Snake River (where Ice Harbor Dam is) flows westward to join the Columbia
      River in eastern Washington.


      5) The Columbia River (where Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was) continues flowing
      west to the Pacific Ocean.


      Given these locations, Trojan Nuclear Power Plant in Oregon would be significantly
      west of Ice Harbor Dam in Washington.

    c7c9e581-4961-434d-83b3-869f9b29b952: '<think>To determine whether Trojan Nuclear
      Power Plant in Oregon is located west of Ice Harbor Dam in Washington, I need
      to know the geographical locations of both facilities.


      Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was located in Columbia County, Oregon, along the
      Columbia River. It was about 40 miles north of Portland, Oregon.


      Ice Harbor Dam is on the Snake River in Washington state, near the town of Burbank.
      The Snake River is a tributary of the Columbia River.


      In terms of geography in the Pacific Northwest:

      - Generally, the Columbia River flows west toward the Pacific Ocean

      - The Snake River joins the Columbia River from the east

      - Washington state is north of Oregon


      Since Ice Harbor Dam is on the Snake River in Washington, and the Snake River
      is east of where it joins the Columbia River, and Trojan Nuclear Power Plant
      was on the Columbia River closer to the Pacific Ocean, Trojan would be west
      of Ice Harbor Dam.


      Another way to think about it: Oregon''s Columbia County is in the northwest
      part of Oregon, relatively close to the Pacific coast. The Snake River area
      of Washington is in the eastern part of Washington state.


      So geographically, Trojan Nuclear Power Plant in Oregon would be west of Ice
      Harbor Dam in Washington.</think># Is Trojan Nuclear Power Plant, OR located
      west of Ice Harbor Dam, WA?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two facilities.


      ## Step 1: Locate both facilities

      - Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was located in Columbia County, Oregon, along the
      Columbia River, approximately 40 miles north of Portland, near the Pacific coast.

      - Ice Harbor Dam is located on the Snake River in eastern Washington state,
      near the town of Burbank.


      ## Step 2: Consider the geography

      - The Columbia River flows westward toward the Pacific Ocean.

      - The Snake River (where Ice Harbor Dam is) is a tributary that joins the Columbia
      River from the east.

      - Western Oregon is closer to the Pacific Ocean than eastern Washington.


      ## Step 3: Compare positions

      - Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was in western Oregon, relatively close to the
      Pacific Ocean.

      - Ice Harbor Dam is in eastern Washington, much further inland.


      Therefore, Trojan Nuclear Power Plant in Oregon is located west of Ice Harbor
      Dam in Washington.


      YES'

      Power Plant in Oregon is located west of Ice Harbor Dam in Washington.


      To solve this, I need to consider the geography of Oregon and Washington:


      1) Oregon is generally west of Washington, but there''s overlap since they''re
      adjacent states.

      2) The Columbia River forms much of the border between Oregon and Washington.


      Let me think about the specific locations:

      - Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was in Oregon, along the Columbia River

      - Ice Harbor Dam is on the Snake River in Washington


      The Snake River flows into the Columbia River from the east. Washington is north
      of Oregon, but the Snake River is in the eastern part of Washington.


      Given the geography of the Pacific Northwest:

      - Things on the Columbia River in Oregon would generally be west of things on
      the Snake River in Washington

      - The Columbia River flows west to the Pacific Ocean

      - The Snake River joins the Columbia from the east


      So Trojan Nuclear Power Plant in Oregon on the Columbia River would be west
      of Ice Harbor Dam which is on the Snake River in eastern Washington.


      The answer should be YES.</think># Is Trojan Nuclear Power Plant, OR located
      west of Ice Harbor Dam, WA?


      Let me think about the geographical locations of these two structures:


      1) Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was located in Oregon, along the Columbia River
      in the northwestern part of the state (near Rainier, OR).


      2) Ice Harbor Dam is located on the Snake River in southeastern Washington state.


      3) The Snake River flows from the east and joins the Columbia River in southern
      Washington.


      4) The Columbia River flows westward to the Pacific Ocean.


      5) Locations along the Columbia River in northwestern Oregon (like Trojan) are
      generally west of locations on the Snake River in southeastern Washington (like
      Ice Harbor Dam).


      Given these geographical facts, Trojan Nuclear Power Plant in Oregon would be
      located west of Ice Harbor Dam in Washington.

      relative locations of two structures in the US: Trojan Nuclear Power Plant in
      Oregon (OR) and Ice Harbor Dam in Washington (WA).


      To answer this, I need to determine the east-west relationship between these
      two locations. In the US, when comparing locations on an east-west axis:

      - West = closer to the Pacific Ocean

      - East = closer to the Atlantic Ocean


      Let me think about the general geography:

      1. Oregon (OR) is a state on the Pacific coast

      2. Washington (WA) is also a Pacific coast state, located directly north of
      Oregon


      Now for the specific locations:

      - Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was in Oregon, likely in the northern part of the
      state since it mentions OR

      - Ice Harbor Dam is in Washington state


      The crucial question is: Which is further west?


      The Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was located on the Columbia River, which forms
      the border between Oregon and Washington. It was near Rainier, Oregon, which
      is in the northwest part of Oregon, relatively close to the Pacific Ocean.


      Ice Harbor Dam is on the Snake River in Washington state. The Snake River is
      a tributary of the Columbia River, located inland in the eastern part of Washington
      state.


      Given that Washington and Oregon both stretch from the Pacific coast to inland
      areas, and dams are typically built inland on rivers, while the Trojan plant
      was on the Columbia River closer to the coast, Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was
      almost certainly west of Ice Harbor Dam.</think># Is Trojan Nuclear Power Plant,
      OR located west of Ice Harbor Dam, WA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two structures.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was located in Oregon (OR), specifically near Rainier,
      OR, along the Columbia River in the northwestern part of the state.

      - Ice Harbor Dam is located in Washington (WA) on the Snake River in the southeastern
      part of Washington.


      Step 2: Consider the geography of the Pacific Northwest.

      - Oregon and Washington are both Pacific coast states.

      - The Columbia River forms much of the border between them.

      - The Snake River (where Ice Harbor Dam is located) is a tributary of the Columbia
      River that flows through eastern Washington.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was situated in the western part of Oregon, relatively
      close to the Pacific coast.

      - Ice Harbor Dam is located in eastern Washington, considerably inland.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Locations closer to the Pacific Ocean are further west than inland locations.

      - Trojan was near the western portion of the Columbia River, while Ice Harbor
      Dam is on the Snake River in the inland eastern part of Washington.


      YES, Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is located west of Ice Harbor Dam.'

      First, let me consider the states:

      - Colorado (CO) is located directly west of Kansas (KS) in the United States.

      - When comparing locations in these two states, a location in Colorado will
      generally be west of a location in Kansas.


      Fitzsimons Army Medical Center is in Colorado, and Milford Lake is in Kansas.


      Since Colorado is west of Kansas, and these locations are in their respective
      states, Fitzsimons Army Medical Center (CO) should be west of Milford Lake (KS).


      Let me double check this geographic reasoning:

      - The entirety of Colorado''s eastern border touches Kansas''s western border

      - So any location in Colorado must be west of any location in Kansas


      Therefore, Fitzsimons Army Medical Center in Colorado is located west of Milford
      Lake in Kansas.</think># Is Fitzsimons Army Medical Center, CO located west

      Step 1: Identify the states where each location is situated.

      - Fitzsimons Army Medical Center is in Colorado (CO)

      - Milford Lake is in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Colorado is located directly west of Kansas in the United States

      - The entire eastern border of Colorado touches the western border of Kansas


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific locations.

      - Since Fitzsimons Army Medical Center is in Colorado, and Milford Lake is in
      Kansas

      - Any location in Colorado would be west of any location in Kansas due to their
      relative state positions

      1. Fitzsimons Army Medical Center, CO (Colorado)

      2. Milford Lake, KS (Kansas)


      First, I need to understand the geographical relationship between Colorado and
      Kansas. Colorado is directly west of Kansas in the United States.


      Since Fitzsimons Army Medical Center is in Colorado (CO), and Milford Lake is
      in Kansas (KS), it''s likely that Fitzsimons Army Medical Center is west of
      Milford Lake.


      However, I should be careful about making assumptions based solely on state
      borders, as the specific locations within each state could change the answer.
      I need to consider where within these states these locations are.


      Fitzsimons Army Medical Center is (or was) located in Aurora, Colorado, which
      is in the east-central part of Colorado.

      Milford Lake is in Kansas, likely in the northern or central part of the state.

      - Fitzsimons Army Medical Center is in Colorado (CO)

      - Milford Lake is in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Colorado is located directly west of Kansas in the United States.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Even though Fitzsimons Army Medical Center is in the eastern part of Colorado
      (in Aurora), and Milford Lake might be in the western part of Kansas, the entire
      state of Colorado lies west of Kansas.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since Colorado is entirely west of Kansas, any location in Colorado (including
      Fitzsimons Army Medical Center) would be west of any location in Kansas (including
      Milford Lake).

      value (more negative or less positive) are located further west.

      Since San Bernardino is in California and Apache Lake is in Arizona, it''s very
      likely that Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral in San Bernardino is west of Apache
      Lake.


      This is a straightforward geographical fact about the US - California is west
      of Arizona.</think># Is Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral (San Bernardino, California)
      located west of Apache Lake (Arizona)?


      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to consider the general geography of the western United States.


      2) California is located on the western side of the continental United States,
      bordering the Pacific Ocean.


      3) Arizona is located inland, directly east of California.


      4) San Bernardino, California is in the southern part of California.


      5) Apache Lake is in Arizona, likely in the central or eastern part of the state.


      6) Since all of California is west of all of Arizona (the states share a border
      with California on the west side of Arizona), any location in California would
      be west of any location in Arizona.


      Therefore, Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral in San Bernardino, California is
      indeed located west of Apache Lake, Arizona.

      California is generally west of Arizona in the United States. That''s a good
      starting point, but I need to be more precise since locations near the border
      could have different relationships.


      San Bernardino is a city in Southern California, located inland from Los Angeles.
      It''s in the eastern part of California, but still California is west of Arizona.


      Apache Lake is in Arizona. I believe it''s in central Arizona, east of Phoenix.


      Given the general geography of the United States:

      - California is on the west coast

      - Arizona is east of California

      - San Bernardino is in California (though eastern California)

      - Apache Lake is in Arizona


      Since California is west of Arizona, and San Bernardino is in California while
      Apache Lake is in Arizona, it''s very likely that Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral
      in San Bernardino is west of Apache Lake.


      To be completely sure, I would need the exact coordinates, but based on the
      states'' positions, San Bernardino, CA should be west of any location in Arizona.</think>#
      Is Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral (San Bernardino, California), CA located

      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1. Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral is located in San Bernardino, California

      2. Apache Lake is located in Arizona

      3. California is positioned west of Arizona on the US map

      4. San Bernardino is in the eastern part of California, but even eastern California

      5. Apache Lake is in central Arizona, east of Phoenix

      6. The state boundary between California and Arizona represents a clear east-west
      division


      Since San Bernardino is in California and Apache Lake is in Arizona, and California
      is entirely west of Arizona, the cathedral must be west of the lake.

      However, I should be a bit more careful with this reasoning because locations
      near the border could potentially violate this general rule. But the Topaz Solar
      Farm is not on the eastern edge of California - it''s in San Luis Obispo County,
      which is closer to the Pacific coast. And Bridge Canyon Dam (also known as Bridge
      Canyon Dam site, as I don''t believe the dam was ever constructed) would be
      on the Colorado River, which forms part of the border between Arizona and California/Nevada,
      but in the western part of Arizona.


      So my conclusion holds: Topaz Solar Farm in California is indeed west of Bridge
      Canyon Dam in Arizona.</think># Is Topaz Solar Farm, CA located west of Bridge
      Canyon Dam, AZ?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two structures.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Topaz Solar Farm is located in California (CA)

      - Bridge Canyon Dam is located in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - California is positioned on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona is inland and east of California


      Step 3: Consider specific locations within the states.

      - Topaz Solar Farm is in San Luis Obispo County, California, which is in central
      California

      - Bridge Canyon Dam (site) would be on the Colorado River in western Arizona


      Step 4: Determine relative positioning.

      Since California is west of Arizona, and Topaz Solar Farm is not on the eastern
      edge of California but rather in the central part of the state, while Bridge
      Canyon Dam is in Arizona, the solar farm must be west of the dam.

      is inland.


      The Topaz Solar Farm is specifically in San Luis Obispo County, California,
      which is in the central coast region of California.


      Bridge Canyon Dam (sometimes called Hualapai Dam) was a proposed dam on the

      - San Luis Obispo County is in central/western California

      - The Bridge Canyon Dam site is in western Arizona, but even western Arizona
      is east of central California


      Step 4: Make the final determination based on longitude.

      - All of California is west of all of Arizona on a map of the United States

    ed46fc93-905e-4724-aa09-53d3d0006faf: '<think>I need to determine the relative
      geographic positions of St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle, WA and Lower
      Granite Dam, WA.


      First, let me think about where Seattle is located. Seattle is in western Washington
      state, on the Puget Sound, which is connected to the Pacific Ocean. Seattle
      is definitely in the western part of Washington state.


      Now, where is Lower Granite Dam? Lower Granite Dam is on the Snake River in
      eastern Washington. The Snake River forms part of the border between Washington
      and Idaho, and it''s in the eastern part of Washington state.


      Washington state runs from the Pacific Ocean in the west to Idaho in the east.
      So if Seattle is in western Washington, and Lower Granite Dam is in eastern
      Washington, then St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle would be west of
      Lower Granite Dam.


      So the answer is YES, St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle, WA is located
      west of Lower Granite Dam, WA.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the locations of both structures and compare their east-west positions.


      Step 1: Locate St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral.

      St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral is in Seattle, Washington. Seattle is located
      in western Washington state, on the Puget Sound near the Pacific Ocean.


      Step 2: Locate Lower Granite Dam.

      Lower Granite Dam is on the Snake River in eastern Washington state. The Snake
      River forms part of the Washington-Idaho border in the eastern portion of the
      state.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      Washington state extends from the Pacific Ocean in the west to Idaho in the
      east. Since Seattle is in western Washington and Lower Granite Dam is in eastern
      Washington, Seattle is west of the dam.


      Therefore, St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle is located west of Lower
      Granite Dam.


      YES'

      Lake in Iowa (IA) is west of the Shrine Church of St. Stanislaus in Ohio (OH).


      In the United States, states are arranged geographically where western states
      have a lower longitude than eastern states. So I need to determine the relative
      positions of Iowa and Ohio.


      Iowa (IA) is in the Midwest region of the United States. It borders Illinois
      to the east, Missouri to the south, Nebraska to the west, South Dakota to the
      northwest, Minnesota to the north, and Wisconsin to the northeast.

      to the east, West Virginia to the southeast, Kentucky to the south, Indiana
      to the west, and Michigan to the north.


      Iowa is definitely west of Ohio in the United States. Since Saylorville Lake

      - Saylorville Lake is in Iowa (IA)

      - Shrine Church of St. Stanislaus is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Ohio is also
      in the Midwest but further east. Iowa borders states like Nebraska and South
      Dakota to its west, and Illinois to its east. Ohio borders Pennsylvania to its
      east and Indiana to its west.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-east axis.

      On a map of the United States, Iowa is positioned west of Ohio. The entire state
      of Iowa lies to the west of the entire state of Ohio.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific locations.

      Since Saylorville Lake is within Iowa, and the Shrine Church of St. Stanislaus
      is within Ohio, the lake must be west of the church.

      The entire state of Colorado lies west of Kansas.


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of the water bodies based on their

      to identify the locations of John Martin Reservoir, CO and Kanopolis Lake, KS,
      and determine their relative positions (east-west).


      First, let me identify where these bodies of water are located:

      - John Martin Reservoir is in Colorado (CO)

      - Kanopolis Lake is in Kansas (KS)


      Generally speaking, Colorado is west of Kansas in the United States. Colorado
      borders Kansas on Kansas''s western border.


      So just based on the states, John Martin Reservoir in Colorado would likely
      be west of Kanopolis Lake in Kansas.


      To be more precise, I would want to know the specific locations within each
      state. John Martin Reservoir is likely in eastern Colorado (since it''s a reservoir
      and many of Colorado''s reservoirs are in the eastern part of the state to supply
      water to the plains). Kanopolis Lake would be somewhere in Kansas.


      Even if John Martin Reservoir is in far eastern Colorado and Kanopolis Lake
      is in far western Kansas, the Colorado location would still be west of the Kansas
      location due to the states'' relative positions.


      So based on the geographic relationship between Colorado and Kansas, John Martin
      Reservoir, CO is west of Kanopolis Lake, KS.</think>I''ll determine whether
      John Martin Reservoir in Colorado is west of Kanopolis Lake in Kansas by examining
      their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the general locations of both water bodies.

      - John Martin Reservoir is located in Colorado (CO)

      - Kanopolis Lake is located in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Colorado is directly west of Kansas in the United States. They share a border,
      with Colorado being the westernmost of the two states.


      Step 3: Consider specific locations within each state.

      Even if John Martin Reservoir were in eastern Colorado and Kanopolis Lake in
      western Kansas, the Colorado location would still be west of the Kansas location
      due to the states'' positions relative to each other.


      YES, John Martin Reservoir, CO is located west of Kanopolis Lake, KS.'

      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1. Leesville Lake is located in Ohio

      2. Astor Theatre is located in New York City, New York

      3. Ohio is a Midwestern state, while New York is a Northeastern state

      4. Looking at the US map, Ohio is entirely west of New York state

      about the locations


      To determine if Leesville Lake (Ohio) is west of Astor Theatre (New York City),

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Generally, Ohio is west of New York state


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - Leesville Lake is in Ohio

      - Astor Theatre is in New York City, which is in eastern New York state

      - The relative positions of these specific locations maintain the same west-east
      relationship as their states


      Since Ohio is west of New York, and Leesville Lake is in Ohio while Astor Theatre
      is in New York City, Leesville Lake is indeed west of Astor Theatre.

      if Herb Parsons Lake in Tennessee is located west of Fontana Lake in North Carolina.


      To answer this, I need to consider the relative geographic positions of these
      two lakes.


      First, let''s consider the states:

      - Herb Parsons Lake is in Tennessee (TN)

      - Fontana Lake is in North Carolina (NC)


      Generally speaking, Tennessee is located to the west of North Carolina in the
      United States. The states share a border, with Tennessee on the western side
      of that border and North Carolina on the eastern side.


      Looking at the specific lakes:

      - Herb Parsons Lake is in Tennessee, likely in the western or central part of
      the state

      - Fontana Lake is in North Carolina, and it''s actually located in the western
      part of North Carolina, near the Tennessee border (it''s in the Great Smoky
      Mountains area)


      Given that Tennessee is west of North Carolina, and that Herb Parsons Lake is
      in Tennessee while Fontana Lake is in North Carolina, it''s highly likely that
      Herb Parsons Lake is indeed west of Fontana Lake.</think>I need to determine
      the relative positions of these two lakes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both lakes.

      - Herb Parsons Lake is in Tennessee (TN)

      - Fontana Lake is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      Tennessee is located directly west of North Carolina. The states share a border
      with Tennessee on the west side and North Carolina on the east side.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations of these lakes.

      - Herb Parsons Lake is located in western Tennessee

      - Fontana Lake is located in western North Carolina, near the Tennessee border
      in the Great Smoky Mountains region


      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison.

      Even though Fontana Lake is in western North Carolina, it is still east of the
      Tennessee state line. Since Herb Parsons Lake is in Tennessee, it must be west
      of Fontana Lake.


      YES'

      Lake, TN is located west of Fontana Lake, NC, I need to identify the locations
      of both lakes.


      Herb Parsons Lake is in Tennessee (TN).

      Fontana Lake is in North Carolina (NC).


      In the United States, the states are arranged such that:

      - Tennessee (TN) is generally west of North Carolina (NC)

      - Tennessee borders North Carolina on NC''s western side


      Since Herb Parsons Lake is in Tennessee (TN) and Fontana Lake is in North Carolina
      (NC), and Tennessee is west of North Carolina, it is likely that Herb Parsons
      Lake is west of Fontana Lake.


      However, I should be careful about lakes that might be near the border between
      states. Let me think about where exactly these lakes are located:


      Herb Parsons Lake is in western Tennessee, near Memphis.

      Fontana Lake is in western North Carolina, near the Tennessee border.


      Given these more specific locations, Herb Parsons Lake (being in western Tennessee)
      would indeed be west of Fontana Lake (which is in western North Carolina).</think>#

      4) Fontana Lake is in North Carolina (NC).

      5) More specifically, Herb Parsons Lake is in western Tennessee.

      6) Fontana Lake is in western North Carolina, near the Tennessee border.

      7) Even though both lakes are in the western portions of their respective states,
      the entire state of Tennessee lies west of North Carolina.


      Therefore, Herb Parsons Lake in Tennessee must be west of Fontana Lake in North

      locations of Aladdin Theater in Portland, Oregon and Hebgen Lake in Montana.


      First, let''s consider the general geographic positions:

      - Portland, Oregon is located in the northwestern United States, on the west
      coast.

      - Montana is located in the northwestern United States, but it''s inland and
      east of Oregon.


      Oregon is west of Montana in general. Since Portland is in Oregon, and Hebgen
      Lake is in Montana, Portland should be west of Hebgen Lake.


      The Aladdin Theater is in Portland, Oregon, so it would be west of Hebgen Lake,
      Montana.


      Let me double-check by thinking about the rough coordinates:

      - Oregon is on the Pacific coast

      - Montana is an inland state that borders Canada to the north

      - Oregon is entirely west of Montana


      So yes, the Aladdin Theater in Portland, Oregon would be west of Hebgen Lake,
      Montana.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Oregon (OR) is located on the Pacific coast of the United States, while Montana
      (MT) is an inland state several states to the east.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations.

      Portland is in the northwestern part of Oregon, near the Oregon-Washington border.

      Hebgen Lake is in southwestern Montana, near Yellowstone National Park.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      Even though Portland is in the eastern part of Oregon and Hebgen Lake is in
      the western part of Montana, the entire state of Oregon lies west of Montana.
      The states of Idaho and Washington lie between them.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Portland, Oregon (where the Aladdin Theater is located) is entirely west
      of any point in Montana (including Hebgen Lake), the Aladdin Theater must be
      west of Hebgen Lake.


      YES, the Aladdin Theater in Portland, Oregon is located west of Hebgen Lake,
      Montana.'

      2. Where Hebgen Lake, Montana is located

      3. Compare their east-west positions to determine if the Aladdin Theater is
      west of Hebgen Lake


      I know that Oregon is on the west coast of the United States, bordering the
      Pacific Ocean. Portland is in the northwestern part of Oregon.


      Montana is an inland state in the northwestern United States, east of Oregon.
      There are several states between Oregon and Montana: Idaho being the main one.


      Generally speaking, locations in Oregon will be west of locations in Montana.
      This is because Oregon is further west in the United States than Montana.


      Hebgen Lake is in southwestern Montana, near the Wyoming border and close to
      Yellowstone National Park.


      Since Portland, Oregon is on the western side of Oregon, and Hebgen Lake is
      in Montana which is east of Oregon, the Aladdin Theater in Portland would be
      west of Hebgen Lake.</think># Is Aladdin Theater (Portland, Oregon) located
      west of Hebgen Lake, MT?


      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to determine the relative locations of Portland, Oregon and
      Hebgen Lake, Montana.


      2) Portland, Oregon is located in the northwestern part of Oregon, near the
      Pacific coast. Oregon itself is on the west coast of the United States.


      3) Hebgen Lake is located in southwestern Montana, near the Wyoming border and
      Yellowstone National Park.


      4) Looking at the geographic positions of these states: Oregon is directly west
      of Idaho, and Montana is east of Idaho.


      5) This means that any location in Oregon (including the Aladdin Theater in
      Portland) would be west of any location in Montana (including Hebgen Lake).


      Therefore, YES, the Aladdin Theater in Portland, Oregon is located west of Hebgen
      Lake, Montana.'

      - Pacific Ocean

      - West Coast states (Washington, Oregon, California)

      - Idaho, Nevada, Utah, etc.

      - Montana, Wyoming, etc.


      Since Oregon is a West Coast state and Montana is further inland to the east,
      any location in Oregon (including the Aladdin Theater in Portland) would generally
      be west of any location in Montana (including Hebgen Lake).


      So the Aladdin Theater in Portland, Oregon should be west of Hebgen Lake, Montana.</think>#

      Northwest region of the United States, near the Pacific coast.


      2) Hebgen Lake is in Montana, which is an inland state east of Oregon.


      3) In the United States, the states along the west coast (Washington, Oregon,
      California) are generally west of the inland states like Montana.


      4) Oregon is entirely west of Montana on the map.


      5) Therefore, Portland (being in Oregon) must be west of any location in Montana,

      Portland, Oregon is located in the northwestern United States, on the West Coast.
      Oregon borders the Pacific Ocean on its western side.


      Montana is an inland state in the northwestern United States, east of Idaho
      and west of North Dakota. It''s considerably east of Oregon.


      Hebgen Lake is in Montana, near the western border with Idaho and close to Yellowstone
      National Park.


      So geographically:

      - Portland, OR is in the western part of Oregon

      - Hebgen Lake, MT is in the western part of Montana


      However, even the western part of Montana is still east of Oregon. The entire
      state of Idaho lies between western Montana and Oregon.


      So Aladdin Theater in Portland, Oregon would be west of Hebgen Lake, Montana.</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations geographically.

      - Aladdin Theater is in Portland, Oregon, which is located in the northwestern
      United States near the Pacific coast.

      - Hebgen Lake is in Montana, which is an inland state in the northwestern United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      - Oregon is on the Pacific coast.

      - Montana is an inland state east of Idaho.

      - Idaho sits between Oregon and Montana.


      Step 3: Determine specific locations within these states.

      - Portland is in the northern part of Oregon, near its western border.

      - Hebgen Lake is in the southwestern part of Montana, near Yellowstone National
      Park and the Idaho border.


      Step 4: Compare their longitudes.

      - Even though Hebgen Lake is in western Montana, the entire state of Montana
      is still east of Oregon.

      - Portland, being near the Pacific coast, is significantly further west than
      any point in Montana.

      in Portland, Oregon is west of Hebgen Lake, Montana.


      To solve this, I need to think about the relative east-west positioning of Oregon
      and Montana in the United States.


      The United States is arranged with the Pacific Ocean on the west and the Atlantic
      Ocean on the east. States on the west coast include Washington, Oregon, and
      California. Moving eastward from there, you encounter Idaho, Montana, Wyoming,
      etc.


      Oregon is a west coast state, bordering the Pacific Ocean. Montana is an inland
      state, located to the east of Idaho, which itself is east of Oregon.


      Portland is located in the northwestern part of Oregon, near the border with
      Washington state.


      Hebgen Lake is in Montana, which is entirely east of Oregon.


      Therefore, any location in Oregon, including the Aladdin Theater in Portland,
      would be west of any location in Montana, including Hebgen Lake.


      So the answer is YES, the Aladdin Theater is located west of Hebgen Lake.</think>I
      need to determine the east-west relationship between these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Oregon is on the west coast of the United States, while Montana is an inland
      state to the east. Oregon borders the Pacific Ocean, while Montana is several
      states away from the coast.


      Step 2: Consider Portland''s location within Oregon.

      Portland is in the northwestern part of Oregon, near the Columbia River.


      Step 3: Consider Hebgen Lake''s location within Montana.

      Hebgen Lake is in the southwestern part of Montana, near Yellowstone National
      Park.


      Step 4: Compare their longitude positions.

      Even though Portland is in the eastern part of Oregon and Hebgen Lake is in
      the western part of Montana, the entire state of Oregon is west of Montana geographically.
      Idaho sits between these two states.


      Step 5: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Oregon is entirely west of Montana on the map of the United States, the
      Aladdin Theater in Portland must be west of Hebgen Lake.

      if Mississinewa Lake Dam in Indiana (IN) is located west of Sterling Memorial
      Library in Connecticut (CT).


      To answer this, I need to compare the geographical locations (specifically longitudes)
      of these two places. In the United States, places that are more westward have
      higher longitude values (when using the conventional negative values for western
      hemisphere).


      Let me think about the states first:

      - Indiana (IN) is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Connecticut (CT) is in the Northeast region of the United States, specifically
      in New England


      Generally speaking, Indiana is west of Connecticut. All of Indiana is west of
      all of Connecticut in terms of longitude.


      So without even knowing the specific locations of Mississinewa Lake Dam or Sterling
      Memorial Library, I can determine that a location in Indiana would be west of
      a location in Connecticut.


      Therefore, Mississinewa Lake Dam, IN is located west of Sterling Memorial Library,
      CT.</think>To determine if Mississinewa Lake Dam, IN is located west of Sterling
      Memorial Library, CT, I need to compare their geographical locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these structures are located.

      - Mississinewa Lake Dam is in Indiana (IN)

      - Sterling Memorial Library is in Connecticut (CT)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states in the US.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Connecticut is located in the Northeast region (New England)


      Step 3: Compare their geographical positions.

      - Indiana is entirely west of Connecticut on the US map

      - All locations in Indiana have longitudes west of all locations in Connecticut


      Step 4: Make the conclusion about the specific structures.

      - Since Mississinewa Lake Dam is in Indiana, and Sterling Memorial Library is
      in Connecticut, the dam must be west of the library.

      - Indiana (IN) is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Connecticut (CT) is in the Northeast region of the United States, specifically
      in New England


      In terms of east-west positioning, states in the Midwest like Indiana are generally
      west of the northeastern states like Connecticut.


      So Indiana is west of Connecticut. Since Mississinewa Lake Dam is in Indiana
      and Sterling Memorial Library is in Connecticut, the dam would be west of the
      library.</think>I need to determine if Mississinewa Lake Dam in Indiana is west

      - Mississinewa Lake Dam is in Indiana (IN)

      - Sterling Memorial Library is in Connecticut (CT)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of these states.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Connecticut is located in the Northeast region (New England)


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - On a US map, Indiana is clearly west of Connecticut

      - All of Indiana is west of all of Connecticut


      Step 4: Since Mississinewa Lake Dam is in Indiana and Sterling Memorial Library
      is in Connecticut, the dam must be west of the library.

      1. I need to determine if Mississinewa Lake Dam in Indiana (IN) is located west
      of Sterling Memorial Library in Connecticut (CT).


      2. This requires understanding the geographic locations of these two places
      in the United States.


      The United States generally follows a west-to-east orientation where:

      - Western states include places like California, Oregon, Washington, etc.

      - Central states include places like Kansas, Nebraska, etc.

      - Eastern states include places like New York, Connecticut, etc.


      Indiana (IN) is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Connecticut
      (CT) is in the Northeast region, specifically in New England.


      Looking at the map of the US:

      - Indiana is roughly in the middle of the country but leans east

      - Connecticut is on the East Coast


      Since Indiana is west of Connecticut, any structure in Indiana (including Mississinewa
      Lake Dam) would be west of any structure in Connecticut (including Sterling
      Memorial Library).</think>I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Mississinewa Lake Dam is in Indiana (IN)

      - Sterling Memorial Library is in Connecticut (CT)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions in the United States.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Connecticut is located on the East Coast in the New England region


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Indiana is significantly west of Connecticut on the US map

      - All locations in Indiana are west of all locations in Connecticut


      Step 4: Make the conclusion.

      Since Mississinewa Lake Dam is in Indiana, and Sterling Memorial Library is
      in Connecticut, the dam must be west of the library.

      to determine the relative locations of two structures in the US: the Basilica
      of St. John in Des Moines, Iowa, and the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects
      in Michigan.


      First, let''s identify the states:

      - Basilica of St. John is in Des Moines, Iowa (IA)

      - Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects is in Michigan (MI)


      Next, I need to determine their relative east-west positions. In the US, states
      that are more western have lower longitude values than states that are more
      eastern.


      Iowa (IA) is located in the Midwest region of the United States.

      Michigan (MI) is located in the Great Lakes region of the Midwest.


      When comparing these two states geographically, Iowa is located to the west
      of Michigan. Iowa borders states like Nebraska and South Dakota to its west,
      while Michigan is further east, bordering states like Ohio and is adjacent to
      the Great Lakes.


      Therefore, Des Moines, Iowa (where the Basilica of St. John is located) is west
      of any location in Michigan (where the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects are
      located).</think>I need to determine if the Basilica of St. John in Des Moines,
      Iowa is west of the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects in Michigan.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each structure is located.

      - Basilica of St. John is in Des Moines, Iowa (IA)

      - Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Michigan is
      in the Great Lakes region of the Midwest.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      On a map of the United States, Iowa is positioned to the west of Michigan. Iowa
      shares borders with states like Nebraska and South Dakota to its west, while
      Michigan is further east, bordering states like Ohio and Wisconsin.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion about the specific locations.

      Since Des Moines is in Iowa, and Iowa is west of Michigan (where the Brewster-Douglass
      Housing Projects are located), the Basilica of St. John must be west of the
      Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects.

      1. Basilica of St. John is in Des Moines, Iowa (IA)

      2. Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects is in Michigan (MI)


      Generally speaking, Iowa is west of Michigan in the United States. Let me verify
      this:

      - Iowa is in the Midwest region, bordering the Mississippi River on the east

      - Michigan is also in the Midwest, but further east, bordering the Great Lakes


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Iowa is approximately in the middle of the country

      - Michigan is closer to the eastern part of the country


      Des Moines is the capital city of Iowa, located in the central part of the state.

      The Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects were in Detroit, Michigan, which is in
      the southeastern part of Michigan.


      Given these locations, Des Moines, Iowa would be west of Detroit, Michigan.

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Basilica of St. John is in Des Moines, Iowa (IA)

      - Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects is in Michigan (MI)


      ## Step 2: Determine their geographical positions

      - Des Moines, Iowa is located in the central Midwest region of the United States

      - Michigan is located in the eastern Midwest region, significantly east of Iowa

      - More specifically, the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects were in Detroit,
      which is in southeastern Michigan


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      Iowa is entirely west of Michigan on the US map. Des Moines (in central Iowa)
      is therefore west of any location in Michigan, including Detroit where the Brewster-Douglass
      Housing Projects are located.

      The question is asking whether the Basilica is located west of the housing projects.


      First, I need to determine the relative positions of Iowa and Michigan. In the
      US:

      - Iowa (IA) is in the Midwest, roughly in the middle of the country

      ## Step 3: Consider specific cities

      - Des Moines is in central Iowa

      - The Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects were in Detroit, Michigan (eastern
      Michigan)

      - Any location in Iowa would be west of any location in Michigan

      1) Muskingum River Power Plant is in Ohio (OH)

      Generally, Ohio is west of Pennsylvania in the United States. But I should be
      more precise about these specific locations.


      Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Pennsylvania
      is in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region. On a map of the US, Ohio is indeed
      west of Pennsylvania.


      More specifically:

      - The Muskingum River runs through eastern Ohio

      - Gettysburg is in southern Pennsylvania


      Even though the Muskingum River is in eastern Ohio, Ohio itself is entirely
      west of Pennsylvania. So any location in Ohio would be west of any location
      in Pennsylvania.


      Therefore, the Muskingum River Power Plant in OH would be west of the Cyclorama
      Building at Gettysburg, PA.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west

      Looking at the geography of the United States:

      - Ohio is entirely west of Pennsylvania

      - The two states share no border, as West Virginia comes between them

      - Even eastern Ohio is west of western Pennsylvania


      Since the Muskingum River Power Plant must be in Ohio and the Cyclorama Building
      must be in Pennsylvania (as indicated by their state abbreviations), the power
      plant must be west of the Cyclorama Building.

      Lake is west of Arrowrock Dam.


      First, let''s establish some basic geography:

      - Oregon (OR) is a state on the west coast of the United States

      - Idaho (ID) is a state to the east of Oregon


      This already gives us a hint that Lost Creek Lake in Oregon might be west of

      Pathfinder Reservoir is located in central Wyoming on the North Platte River.

      Since Idaho is entirely west of Wyoming, and C. J. Strike Dam is in Idaho while

      of C.J. Strike Dam in Idaho (ID) and Pathfinder Reservoir in Wyoming (WY), and
      then figure out which one is more westerly.


      First, let me recall the general geography of the western United States:

      - Idaho is west of Wyoming

      - Idaho is generally in the Pacific Northwest region

      - Wyoming is in the Rocky Mountain region, east of Idaho


      Since C.J. Strike Dam is in Idaho and Pathfinder Reservoir is in Wyoming, and
      Idaho is west of Wyoming, it''s likely that C.J. Strike Dam is west of Pathfinder
      Reservoir.


      However, I should consider whether these locations might be near the border
      between states, which could make their relative positions different from the
      general relationship between the states. But given that Idaho is entirely west
      of Wyoming (they share a border, with Idaho on the west), any location in Idaho
      would be west of any location in Wyoming.


      So the answer is likely YES, but let me double-check my geography knowledge
      to be sure.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these
      two structures.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each structure is located.

      - C.J. Strike Dam is in Idaho (ID)

      - Pathfinder Reservoir is in Wyoming (WY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Idaho and Wyoming.

      - Idaho is located entirely west of Wyoming

      - These states share a border, with Idaho on the western side and Wyoming on
      the eastern side


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific structures.

      - Since C.J. Strike Dam is in Idaho, and Pathfinder Reservoir is in Wyoming

      - And since Idaho is entirely west of Wyoming

      - It follows that C.J. Strike Dam must be west of Pathfinder Reservoir

      2. Pathfinder Reservoir in Wyoming (WY)


      First, let me think about the general geographic layout of these states. Idaho
      is west of Wyoming, as Idaho is in the Pacific Northwest region while Wyoming
      is more in the Mountain West region. The entire state of Idaho lies west of
      Wyoming.


      Since C. J. Strike Dam is in Idaho (ID) and Pathfinder Reservoir is in Wyoming

      To be completely certain, I should consider if there might be any unusual geographic
      configurations that could make this not true (like if the dam were in far eastern

      To answer this question, I''ll need to compare the geographic locations of these

      1) C. J. Strike Dam is located in Idaho (ID)

      2) Pathfinder Reservoir is located in Wyoming (WY)

      3) Geographically, the state of Idaho lies entirely to the west of Wyoming

      4) Since these structures are in their respective states, their relative positions
      follow the same east-west relationship as their states


      Since Idaho is west of Wyoming, and C. J. Strike Dam is in Idaho while Pathfinder
      Reservoir is in Wyoming, C. J. Strike Dam must be west of Pathfinder Reservoir.

      2. Cathedral Basilica of St. James in Brooklyn, NY (New York)


      I need to determine if the Ohio location is west of the New York location.


      Generally speaking, Ohio is west of New York state, as the United States extends
      from east (Atlantic coast) to west (Pacific coast), and New York is on the eastern
      seaboard while Ohio is more inland.


      More specifically:

      - Brooklyn is in New York City, which is in the southeastern part of New York
      state

      - Tappan Lake would be in Ohio, and virtually any location in Ohio would be
      west of any location in New York City


      This is because the entire state of Ohio lies west of New York state. Even the
      easternmost part of Ohio would be west of the westernmost part of New York City.


      So yes, Tappan Lake, OH is located west of Cathedral Basilica of St. James in
      Brooklyn, NY.</think>To determine if Tappan Lake, Ohio is west of the Cathedral
      Basilica of St. James in Brooklyn, New York, I need to consider the geographic
      positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Consider the relative positions of Ohio and New York states.

      Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while New York is
      on the East Coast. Generally, Ohio lies west of New York state.


      Step 2: Examine the specific locations.

      Tappan Lake is in eastern Ohio, in Harrison County.

      The Cathedral Basilica of St. James is located in Brooklyn, which is in the
      southeastern part of New York state.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-east axis.

      Even the easternmost points in Ohio are still west of New York City (including
      Brooklyn). The entire state of Ohio lies west of the longitude line that passes
      through Brooklyn.


      YES'

      OH is located west of the Cathedral Basilica of St. James in Brooklyn, NY.


      To determine this, I need to compare their east-west positions, which is their
      longitude. In the United States, locations further west have a higher (more
      negative) longitude number.


      Let me think about where these places are:

      1. Tappan Lake is in Ohio (OH)

      2. The Cathedral Basilica of St. James is in Brooklyn, New York (NY)


      Generally, Ohio is west of New York. This is because the United States has New
      York on the east coast, while Ohio is more inland and therefore west of New
      York.


      So based on general geography of US states, Tappan Lake in Ohio would be west
      of any location in New York, including the Cathedral Basilica of St. James in
      Brooklyn.


      Therefore, Tappan Lake, OH is located west of Cathedral Basilica of St. James
      (Brooklyn), NY.</think># Is Tappan Lake, OH located west of Cathedral Basilica
      of St. James (Brooklyn), NY?


      I''ll reason through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to consider the general geographic locations of Ohio and New
      York states.

      2) Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States.

      3) New York is located in the Northeast region of the United States.

      4) When looking at a map of the US, Ohio is positioned to the west of New York.

      5) Tappan Lake is in eastern Ohio, but even the easternmost parts of Ohio are
      still west of New York City.

      6) Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs of New York City, located on the western
      end of Long Island.

      7) The Cathedral Basilica of St. James is in Brooklyn, so it''s in the eastern
      part of the United States.


      Since Ohio is west of New York, Tappan Lake (in Ohio) must be west of the Cathedral
      Basilica of St. James (in Brooklyn, New York).


      YES'

      In the United States, states are generally positioned such that:

      - Ohio (OH) is west of New York (NY)

      - Ohio is in the Midwest while New York is on the East Coast


      Let me think about the specific locations:

      - Tappan Lake is in Ohio, which is west of New York state

      - The Cathedral Basilica of St. James is in Brooklyn, which is in New York City
      in the eastern part of New York state


      Since Ohio is west of New York, and Tappan Lake is in Ohio, while the Cathedral
      Basilica is in Brooklyn (eastern New York), it follows that Tappan Lake, OH
      is indeed west of the Cathedral Basilica of St. James in Brooklyn, NY.</think>To
      determine if Tappan Lake, OH is located west of Cathedral Basilica of St. James

      United States.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations. Tappan Lake is in eastern Ohio, while
      the Cathedral Basilica of St. James is in Brooklyn, which is in New York City
      in the eastern part of New York state.


      Step 3: Even though Tappan Lake is in eastern Ohio, all of Ohio is still west
      of Brooklyn, New York.


      Step 4: Looking at their relative positions on a map, Tappan Lake in Ohio is
      definitely west of any location in Brooklyn, New York.


      YES, Tappan Lake, OH is located west of Cathedral Basilica of St. James in Brooklyn,
      NY.'

      California is generally west of Utah in the United States. Looking at the geography:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Utah is an inland state, east of California


      In terms of longitude:

      - Places in California typically have longitudes further west (more negative

      Auditorium in Tennessee is located west of Cathedral of All Souls in Asheville,
      North Carolina, I need to compare their relative east-west positions.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - Nashville Municipal Auditorium is in Nashville, Tennessee

      - Cathedral of All Souls is in Asheville, North Carolina


      Tennessee is generally west of North Carolina in the United States. If we look
      at a map of the US, Tennessee is to the west of North Carolina.


      More specifically:

      - Nashville is in the central part of Tennessee

      - Asheville is in the western part of North Carolina


      Even though Asheville is in western North Carolina, Nashville would still be
      further west because Tennessee itself is west of North Carolina.


      So Nashville Municipal Auditorium would be west of Cathedral of All Souls in
      Asheville.</think># Is Nashville Municipal Auditorium, TN located west of Cathedral
      of All Souls (Asheville, North Carolina), NC?


      I need to determine the east-west relationship between these two locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Nashville Municipal Auditorium is in Tennessee (TN)

      - Cathedral of All Souls is in Asheville, North Carolina (NC)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      Tennessee is located directly west of North Carolina on the US map.


      ## Step 3: Consider the specific cities

      - Nashville is in the central part of Tennessee

      - Asheville is in the western part of North Carolina


      ## Step 4: Compare their relative positions

      Even though Asheville is in western North Carolina, Nashville is still further
      west because Tennessee as a whole is west of North Carolina.


      Therefore, Nashville Municipal Auditorium, TN is indeed located west of Cathedral
      of All Souls in Asheville, NC.

      1. Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is in Minneapolis, Minnesota (MN)

      2. Point Beach Nuclear Plant is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Generally speaking, Minnesota is west of Wisconsin, as Wisconsin borders Minnesota

      locations of two places: Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in Minneapolis,
      Minnesota, and Point Beach Nuclear Plant in Wisconsin.


      To determine if one is west of the other, I need to know their relative positions
      on a map.


      First, let''s establish where Minneapolis is relative to Wisconsin. Minneapolis
      is in Minnesota, which is west of Wisconsin. Wisconsin is directly east of Minnesota.


      Point Beach Nuclear Plant is in Wisconsin. I believe it''s located on the eastern
      shore of Wisconsin, along Lake Michigan.


      So we have:

      - Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in Minneapolis, MN (western state)

      - Point Beach Nuclear Plant in WI (eastern state)


      Additionally, Minneapolis is in the eastern part of Minnesota, but Wisconsin
      extends further east to Lake Michigan. The Point Beach Nuclear Plant, being
      on Lake Michigan, would be on the far eastern side of Wisconsin.


      Given these facts, Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in Minneapolis would
      be west of Point Beach Nuclear Plant in Wisconsin.</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positioning of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      - Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is in Minneapolis, Minnesota (MN)

      - Point Beach Nuclear Plant is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - Minnesota is located west of Wisconsin on the US map


      Step 2: Consider more specific locations within these states.

      - Minneapolis is in eastern Minnesota, near the Wisconsin border

      - Point Beach Nuclear Plant is located on the eastern shore of Wisconsin along
      Lake Michigan


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Even though Minneapolis is in eastern Minnesota, it''s still west of most
      of Wisconsin

      - Point Beach Nuclear Plant, being on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, is
      at the easternmost part of Wisconsin


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Any location in Minneapolis would be west of a location on Wisconsin''s eastern
      shore


      YES, Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota is located
      west of Point Beach Nuclear Plant, Wisconsin.'

      Dam in California is located west of Causey Reservoir in Utah.


      First, let me think about the general geography of California (CA) and Utah
      (UT):

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Utah is an inland state, east of California


      Given the general geography, any location in California would typically be west
      of any location in Utah. This is because California is west of Utah on a map
      of the United States.


      So without even knowing the exact locations of Trinity Dam or Causey Reservoir,
      I can reason that since Trinity Dam is in California, and Causey Reservoir is
      in Utah, Trinity Dam would be west of Causey Reservoir.


      To double-check: California is adjacent to the Pacific Ocean on its western
      border, while Utah is several states away from the Pacific. Utah shares borders
      with Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and Idaho, but not with
      California directly. However, Nevada sits between California and Utah.</think>To
      determine if Trinity Dam, CA is located west of Causey Reservoir, UT, I need
      to analyze their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Consider the states where these structures are located.

      - Trinity Dam is in California (CA)

      - Causey Reservoir is in Utah (UT)


      Step 2: Examine the relative positions of these states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Utah is an inland state positioned east of California

      - These states aren''t adjacent - Nevada lies between them


      Step 3: Apply directional logic.

      - Since California is west of Utah on the US map, and these water structures
      are within their respective states, Trinity Dam in California would be west
      of Causey Reservoir in Utah.


      YES, Trinity Dam, CA is located west of Causey Reservoir, UT.'

      2. Lake Mohawk is in Ohio (OH). Ohio is also a state in the Midwest region of
      the United States.


      3. In terms of geography, Indiana is located directly west of Ohio. The entire
      state of Indiana is west of Ohio.


      4. Since Old National Centre is in Indiana, and Lake Mohawk is in Ohio, and
      Indiana is west of Ohio, it follows that Old National Centre is west of Lake
      Mohawk.


      However, I should be careful about locations near the border. Let me think about
      where exactly these locations are:


      Old National Centre is likely in Indianapolis, which is the capital and largest
      city of Indiana, located in the central part of the state.


      Lake Mohawk in Ohio - I''m not 100% certain of its exact location, but since
      it''s specified as being in Ohio, and Ohio is east of Indiana, the general geographic
      relationship should hold.</think># Determining if Old National Centre, IN is
      west of Lake Mohawk, OH


      I need to determine the relative locations of these two places.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Old National Centre is in Indiana (IN)

      - Lake Mohawk is in Ohio (OH)


      ## Step 2: Understand the geographic relationship between these states

      - Indiana is located entirely west of Ohio

      - The two states share a border, with Indiana on the west side and Ohio on the
      east side


      ## Step 3: Apply this to the specific locations

      - Since Old National Centre is in Indiana, and Lake Mohawk is in Ohio

      - And Indiana is west of Ohio

      - It follows that Old National Centre must be west of Lake Mohawk


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      1. Find the location of Old National Centre in Indiana

      2. Find the location of Lake Mohawk in Ohio

      3. Determine if Old National Centre is west of Lake Mohawk


      Step 1: Locate Old National Centre, IN

      Old National Centre is a concert venue in Indianapolis, Indiana. Indianapolis
      is in the central part of Indiana.


      Step 2: Locate Lake Mohawk, Ohio

      Lake Mohawk is a lake in Ohio. Based on my knowledge, it''s likely in eastern
      Ohio.


      Step 3: Compare the locations

      Indiana is west of Ohio in the United States. Indianapolis is in central Indiana,
      which means it''s definitely west of the Ohio border. If Lake Mohawk is in Ohio
      (regardless of where in Ohio), then Old National Centre (in Indianapolis, Indiana)
      would be west of it.


      Therefore, Old National Centre in Indiana is west of Lake Mohawk in Ohio.</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Old National Centre is in Indianapolis, Indiana

      - Lake Mohawk is in Ohio


      Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      Indiana is directly west of Ohio on the US map.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Indianapolis (where Old National Centre is located) is in central Indiana

      - Lake Mohawk is somewhere in Ohio, regardless of its specific location within
      Ohio


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on state geography.

      Since the entire state of Indiana is west of the entire state of Ohio, and Old
      National Centre is in Indiana while Lake Mohawk is in Ohio, Old National Centre
      must be west of Lake Mohawk.


      NO


      Wait, I made an error in my conclusion. If Indiana is west of Ohio, and Old
      National Centre is in Indiana while Lake Mohawk is in Ohio, then Old National
      Centre is west of Lake Mohawk, not east.


      The correct answer is: YES'

      2. Lake Mohawk in Ohio (OH)


      Specifically, I need to figure out if Old National Centre is west of Lake Mohawk.


      Let me think about the geography:

      - Indiana (IN) is a state that is generally west of Ohio (OH)

      - Old National Centre is in Indiana

      - Lake Mohawk is in Ohio


      Since Indiana is west of Ohio, and Old National Centre is in Indiana while Lake
      Mohawk is in Ohio, it''s very likely that Old National Centre is west of Lake
      Mohawk.


      However, I should be careful about edge cases. If Old National Centre is in
      the far eastern part of Indiana and Lake Mohawk is in the far western part of
      Ohio, there could be an exception. But generally speaking, the state boundary
      would still put the Indiana location west of the Ohio location.</think># Reasoning
      Step by Step


      To determine if Old National Centre in Indiana is located west of Lake Mohawk
      in Ohio, I need to consider their geographic locations:


      1. First, let''s consider the states: Indiana (IN) is located directly west
      of Ohio (OH).


      2. Old National Centre is in Indianapolis, which is in central Indiana.


      3. Lake Mohawk, Ohio is in eastern Ohio (in Stark County).


      4. Since Indiana borders Ohio on Ohio''s western side, and Indianapolis is not
      on the far eastern edge of Indiana, the Old National Centre must be west of
      any location in Ohio, including Lake Mohawk.


      5. Even the easternmost points of Indiana are still west of locations in eastern
      Ohio like Lake Mohawk.

      Determining if Rose Valley Lake (PA) is west of Bunch-of-Grapes (MA)


      I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these two locations.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states'' positions

      Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States, but is positioned
      west of Massachusetts. Massachusetts is on the Atlantic coast, while Pennsylvania
      is more inland.


      ## Step 2: Apply this to the specific locations

      - Rose Valley Lake is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - Bunch-of-Grapes is in Massachusetts (MA)


      Since Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts, any location in Pennsylvania (including
      Rose Valley Lake) would be west of any location in Massachusetts (including
      Bunch-of-Grapes).


      ## Conclusion

      YES, Rose Valley Lake (Pennsylvania) is located west of Bunch-of-Grapes, Massachusetts.'

      First, let me identify the locations:

      1. Rose Valley Lake is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      2. Bunch-of-Grapes is in Massachusetts (MA)


      To determine if one place is west of another, I need to consider their relative
      positions on a map of the United States.


      Pennsylvania (PA) is located west of Massachusetts (MA) in the United States.
      Pennsylvania is in the Mid-Atlantic region, while Massachusetts is in the New
      England region in the northeastern part of the country.


      Since Rose Valley Lake is in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts,
      and Bunch-of-Grapes is in Massachusetts, it follows that Rose Valley Lake is
      west of Bunch-of-Grapes.</think># Reasoning about geographic locations


      To determine if Rose Valley Lake (Pennsylvania) is west of Bunch-of-Grapes,
      Massachusetts, I need to consider the relative positions of these two states.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Rose Valley Lake is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - Bunch-of-Grapes is in Massachusetts (MA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States (New England region)

      - Pennsylvania is located in the Mid-Atlantic region

      - On a map of the United States, Pennsylvania is positioned to the west of Massachusetts


      Step 3: Since Rose Valley Lake is in Pennsylvania, and Bunch-of-Grapes is in
      Massachusetts, the relative positions of these specific locations follow the
      same relationship as their states.


      YES, Rose Valley Lake (Pennsylvania), PA is located west of Bunch-of-Grapes,
      MA.'

      2. Then we need to compare their east-west positions to determine if Rose Valley
      Lake is west of Bunch-of-Grapes.


      Rose Valley Lake is in Pennsylvania (PA). Pennsylvania is located in the eastern
      part of the United States, but it''s west of Massachusetts (MA).


      Massachusetts is one of the easternmost states in the US, located in the New
      England region on the Atlantic coast.


      Pennsylvania is located southwest of Massachusetts.


      Therefore, Rose Valley Lake in Pennsylvania would be west of any location in
      Massachusetts, including Bunch-of-Grapes.


      So the answer is YES, Rose Valley Lake (PA) is located west of Bunch-of-Grapes
      (MA).</think>I need to determine if Rose Valley Lake in Pennsylvania is located
      west of Bunch-of-Grapes in Massachusetts.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' locations.

      Pennsylvania is located in the eastern United States, but it is positioned west
      of Massachusetts.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of the states.

      Massachusetts is one of the easternmost states in the continental US, located
      in New England along the Atlantic coast.

      Pennsylvania is southwest of Massachusetts.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific locations.

      Since Pennsylvania is entirely west of Massachusetts, any location in Pennsylvania
      (including Rose Valley Lake) would be west of any location in Massachusetts
      (including Bunch-of-Grapes).


      YES, Rose Valley Lake (Pennsylvania) is located west of Bunch-of-Grapes, Massachusetts.'

      1. James R. Thompson Center is in Illinois (IL), specifically in Chicago.

      2. Church of St. Joseph is in Bronxville, New York (NY).


      To determine which is west of the other, I need to consider their relative positions
      on a map of the United States.


      Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States, while New York is in
      the Northeast.


      On a west-to-east direction, states generally follow this pattern:

      - West Coast (California, Oregon, Washington)

      - Mountain states (Nevada, Utah, Colorado, etc.)

      - Central/Midwest states (including Illinois)

      - Eastern states (including New York)


      Since Illinois is in the Midwest and New York is in the Northeast, Illinois
      is west of New York.


      Therefore, the James R. Thompson Center in Illinois would be west of the Church
      of St. Joseph in New York.</think># Is James R. Thompson Center, IL located

      2. The Church of St. Joseph is in Bronxville, New York.


      To determine which is further west, I need to consider their geographic positions:


      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York is in the Northeast region of the United States

      - On a map of the US, Illinois is west of New York


      Since Chicago, Illinois is west of Bronxville, New York, the James R. Thompson
      Center is located west of the Church of St. Joseph.

      James R. Thompson Center is in Illinois, specifically in Chicago. Chicago is
      in the Midwest region of the United States.


      The Church of St. Joseph is in Bronxville, New York. Bronxville is in Westchester

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Utah is an inland state, east of California

      CA is located west of El Vado Lake, NM, I need to identify the locations of
      both lakes and compare their east-west positions.


      Lake Yosemite is in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the United
      States.

      El Vado Lake is in New Mexico (NM), which is in the southwestern United States,
      but east of California.


      The states themselves tell us the general answer:

      - California is west of New Mexico on a map of the United States

      - Therefore, locations in California are generally west of locations in New
      Mexico


      To be more specific about these lakes:

      - Lake Yosemite is in Merced County, California, in the central part of the
      state

      - El Vado Lake is in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, in the northern part of
      that state


      Since California is west of New Mexico, and these lakes are in their respective
      states, Lake Yosemite is indeed west of El Vado Lake.</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two lakes.


      Step 1: Identify the states where the lakes are located.

      - Lake Yosemite is in California (CA)

      - El Vado Lake is in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      California is located on the west coast of the United States, while New Mexico
      is an inland state in the southwestern United States. On a map of the US, California
      is positioned to the west of New Mexico.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the lakes.

      Since Lake Yosemite is in California and El Vado Lake is in New Mexico, and
      California is west of New Mexico, it follows that Lake Yosemite is west of El
      Vado Lake.


      YES, Lake Yosemite, CA is located west of El Vado Lake, NM.'

      To determine which is further west, I need to think about the geographical locations
      of Ohio and New Jersey within the United States.

      - Tennessee is definitely west of North Carolina

      - North Carolina is on the Atlantic coast

      - Tennessee is an inland state that doesn''t reach the coast


      So unless these lakes are in very unusual positions within their states (like

      - Tennessee is located west of North Carolina on a U.S. map

      - North Carolina is on the Atlantic coast, while Tennessee is an inland state


      Step 3: Consider potential exceptions.

      - Even accounting for the lakes'' specific locations within their states, the

      Let me recall the geographic positions of these states:

      - Texas is located in the southwestern United States

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States


      Generally speaking, Texas is west of Alabama. So a location in Texas would typically
      be west of a location in Alabama.


      More specifically:

      - Fort Worth is in north-central Texas

      - Birmingham is in central Alabama


      Since Texas is entirely west of Alabama on a map of the United States, any location
      in Texas (including Fort Worth) would be west of any location in Alabama (including
      Birmingham).


      So the Blackstone Hotel in Fort Worth, Texas would be located west of the Independent
      Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Alabama.</think>I need to determine the east-west
      relationship between these two locations.


      First, let me consider the states:

      - The Blackstone Hotel is in Fort Worth, Texas

      - The Independent Presbyterian Church is in Birmingham, Alabama


      Looking at the geographic positions of these states:

      - Texas is located in the southwestern United States

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States


      On a west-to-east basis, Texas is entirely west of Alabama. The entire state
      of Texas lies to the west of the entire state of Alabama.


      Since Fort Worth is in Texas and Birmingham is in Alabama, it follows that Fort
      Worth must be west of Birmingham. Therefore, the Blackstone Hotel in Fort Worth,
      Texas must be west of the Independent Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Alabama.

      by step to determine if the Blackstone Hotel in Fort Worth, Texas is located
      west of the Independent Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Alabama.


      First, I need to consider the relative geographic positions of Texas and Alabama
      in the United States.

      - Texas is located in the southwestern part of the United States

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern part of the United States

      - Generally, Texas is west of Alabama

      - Fort Worth is a city in north-central Texas

      - Birmingham is a city in central Alabama


      In the United States, states that are further west have lower longitude values
      (more negative numbers). Since Texas is west of Alabama, any location in Texas
      would generally be west of any location in Alabama.


      Therefore, the Blackstone Hotel in Fort Worth, Texas would be west of the Independent
      Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Alabama.</think>To determine if the Blackstone
      Hotel in Fort Worth, Texas is located west of the Independent Presbyterian Church
      in Birmingham, Alabama, I need to consider the geographic positions of these
      two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Texas is located in the southwestern United States, while Alabama is in the
      southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Compare the geographic coordinates.

      Fort Worth, Texas is located in the north-central part of Texas, with a longitude
      that places it in the western half of the United States.

      Birmingham, Alabama is located in the central part of Alabama, with a longitude
      that places it in the eastern half of the United States.


      Step 3: Apply the general geographic knowledge.

      In the continental United States, Texas is definitely west of Alabama. Any location
      in Texas (including Fort Worth) would be west of any location in Alabama (including
      Birmingham).


      YES, the Blackstone Hotel in Fort Worth, Texas is located west of the Independent

      locations have higher longitude values than eastern locations.


      Fort Worth, Texas is located in the central-northern part of Texas, which is
      in the south-central United States.

      Birmingham, Alabama is located in the central-northern part of Alabama, which

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Texas and Alabama in the United
      States.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States

      First, I''ll think about the general geographic layout of California and Nevada:

      - Nevada is directly east of California


      Now, let''s be more specific about these locations:

      - Santa Margarita Lake is in California, which means it''s somewhere in California

      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Nevada is located directly east of California


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific locations.

      - Since California is entirely west of Nevada on a map

      - Any location in California (including Santa Margarita Lake) would be west

      positions of two locations: Santa Margarita Lake, CA and Central Christian Church
      in Henderson, Nevada.


      Let me think about the general geography:

      - California (CA) is on the west coast of the United States

      - Nevada (NV) is east of California


      Given this general knowledge, we can already say that most places in California
      are west of most places in Nevada. However, to be more precise, let me think
      about the specific locations:


      Santa Margarita Lake is in California. Based on the name, it''s likely in a
      place called Santa Margarita, which I believe is in central/southern California.


      Henderson, Nevada is a city near Las Vegas, in the southern part of Nevada,
      close to the California border.


      Even though Henderson is close to the California border, all of Nevada is east
      of most of California. Since Santa Margarita Lake is in California and Central
      Christian Church is in Henderson, Nevada, Santa Margarita Lake would be west
      of the church.


      So the answer should be YES, Santa Margarita Lake, CA is located west of Central
      Christian Church in Henderson, Nevada.</think># Is Santa Margarita Lake, CA
      located west of Central Christian Church (Henderson, Nevada), NV?


      Let me think about the relative locations of these two places:


      1) Santa Margarita Lake is in California (CA)

      2) Central Christian Church is in Henderson, Nevada (NV)

      3) California is located on the west coast of the United States

      4) Nevada is located east of California

      5) Henderson is in southern Nevada, near Las Vegas

      6) Even though both might be in the southern portions of their respective states,
      the entire state of California is west of Nevada


      Since California is always west of Nevada geographically, any location in California
      (including Santa Margarita Lake) would be west of any location in Nevada (including
      Central Christian Church in Henderson).


      YES'
    fc1aa514-7ea8-4426-9371-fd8216bedb70: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the locations of Santa Margarita Lake in California and Central
      Christian Church in Henderson, Nevada, and then determine their relative positions
      (east-west).


      1. Santa Margarita Lake is in California, which is generally west of Nevada
      on the US map.

      2. Henderson, Nevada is near Las Vegas, which is in the eastern part of Nevada,
      close to the Arizona border.

      3. California is on the west coast of the United States, while Nevada is inland,
      east of California.


      Based on the general geography of the western United States, California is west
      of Nevada. Since Santa Margarita Lake is in California and Central Christian
      Church is in Henderson, Nevada, Santa Margarita Lake would be west of the church.


      Let me double-check this reasoning. California borders Nevada on Nevada''s western
      border. Henderson is in southern Nevada near Las Vegas. Santa Margarita Lake
      is somewhere in California. Since all of California is west of Nevada, Santa
      Margarita Lake must be west of any location in Nevada, including Henderson.</think>#
      Determining if Santa Margarita Lake, CA is west of Central Christian Church
      in Henderson, NV


      I need to figure out the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Santa Margarita Lake is in California

      - Central Christian Church is in Henderson, Nevada


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between California and Nevada

      California lies entirely to the west of Nevada on the US map. California is
      along the Pacific coast, while Nevada is an inland state that borders California
      on its eastern side.


      ## Step 3: Consider specific locations

      Henderson, Nevada is in the southern part of Nevada (near Las Vegas). While
      Santa Margarita Lake is in California, its specific location within California
      doesn''t matter for this question because ALL of California is west of ALL of
      Nevada.


      ## Conclusion

      YES, Santa Margarita Lake, CA is located west of Central Christian Church in
      Henderson, Nevada.'

      whether FirstBank Southwest Tower in Texas is located west of the National Weather
      Center in Oklahoma.


      To answer this question, I need to:

      1. Determine the location of FirstBank Southwest Tower in Texas

      2. Determine the location of National Weather Center in Oklahoma

      3. Compare their relative east-west positions


      FirstBank Southwest Tower is in Texas (TX), specifically with "Southwest" in
      the name which suggests it might be in the southwestern part of Texas.


      The National Weather Center is in Oklahoma (OK).


      Now, I need to think about the relative positions of Texas and Oklahoma. Generally:

      - Oklahoma is north of Texas

      - Oklahoma is east of the western parts of Texas, but west of the eastern parts
      of Texas


      Given that the FirstBank Southwest Tower has "Southwest" in its name, it''s
      likely in the southwestern part of Texas. This would put it west of Oklahoma.


      However, I need to be more precise. Let me think about the specific locations:


      After reflection, I believe FirstBank Southwest Tower is likely in Amarillo,
      which is in the Texas Panhandle (northwest Texas). The National Weather Center
      is likely in Norman, Oklahoma, which is in central Oklahoma.

      TX located west of National Weather Center, OK?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two buildings

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - FirstBank Southwest Tower is located in Amarillo, Texas, which is in the Texas
      Panhandle (northern part of Texas)

      - The National Weather Center is located in Norman, Oklahoma, which is in central
      Oklahoma


      ## Step 2: Compare their geographical positions

      - Texas is generally south of Oklahoma

      - However, the Texas Panhandle extends northward along Oklahoma''s western border

      - Amarillo, TX is in the western part of the Texas Panhandle

      - Norman, OK is in the central part of Oklahoma, much further east


      ## Step 3: Determine east-west relationship

      - Amarillo, TX is significantly west of Norman, OK

      - On a map, Amarillo would be to the left (west) of Norman

      Texas is generally west and south of Oklahoma. The Texas Panhandle specifically
      extends north along the western side of Oklahoma.


      Amarillo is in the Texas Panhandle, which is west of Oklahoma. Norman is in

      step-by-step:


      1. The question is asking about the relative locations of two places: Auraria
      Campus in Colorado (CO) and Council Grove Lake in Kansas (KS).


      2. To determine if Auraria Campus is west of Council Grove Lake, I need to know
      their approximate locations.


      3. Auraria Campus is in Denver, Colorado. Colorado is a state in the western
      United States.


      4. Council Grove Lake is in Kansas. Kansas is a state in the central United
      States.


      5. Geographically, Colorado is located directly west of Kansas in the United
      States.


      6. Since Auraria Campus is in Colorado, and Council Grove Lake is in Kansas,
      and Colorado is west of Kansas, it follows that Auraria Campus would be west
      of Council Grove Lake.


      7. Let me double-check this: Denver (where Auraria Campus is) is on the eastern
      side of Colorado, but even the eastern edge of Colorado is still west of Kansas.


      So, Auraria Campus in Colorado is indeed west of Council Grove Lake in Kansas.</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these locations are found.

      - Auraria Campus is in Colorado (CO)

      - Council Grove Lake is in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Colorado is located directly west of Kansas in the United States


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Auraria Campus is in Denver, which is on the eastern side of Colorado

      - Council Grove Lake is in Kansas, likely in the central or eastern part

      - Even though Denver is on the eastern side of Colorado, all of Colorado is
      still west of Kansas


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion based on these geographic relationships.

      Since Colorado is entirely west of Kansas, and Auraria Campus is in Colorado
      while Council Grove Lake is in Kansas, Auraria Campus must be west of Council
      Grove Lake.


      YES'

      locations of both places:


      1. Auraria Campus is in Colorado (CO), specifically in Denver.

      2. Council Grove Lake is in Kansas (KS).


      Now, I need to determine their relative east-west positioning. The United States
      generally has states arranged such that states further west have lower longitude
      numbers. Colorado is west of Kansas in the United States.


      Since Auraria Campus is in Colorado, and Council Grove Lake is in Kansas, and
      Colorado is west of Kansas, it follows that Auraria Campus is west of Council
      Grove Lake.


      Let me double-check this reasoning:

      - Colorado is west of Kansas

      - Auraria Campus is in Colorado (specifically Denver)

      - Council Grove Lake is in Kansas

      - Therefore, Auraria Campus is west of Council Grove Lake</think>I need to determine

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Colorado and Kansas.

      Colorado lies directly west of Kansas in the United States. The entire state
      of Colorado is west of the entire state of Kansas.


      Step 3: Since Auraria Campus is in Colorado and Council Grove Lake is in Kansas,
      and Colorado is west of Kansas, Auraria Campus must be west of Council Grove

      - Council Grove Lake is in Kansas (indicated by KS)


      Auraria Campus is specifically in Denver, Colorado, which is not on the far
      eastern edge of Colorado, but more central to the state.


      Council Grove Lake would be somewhere in Kansas, and regardless of its specific

      - Colorado is located directly west of Kansas

      - Kansas shares its western border with Colorado''s eastern border


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions within their states.

      - Auraria Campus is in Denver, which is in the central part of Colorado

      - Council Grove Lake is somewhere in Kansas, but regardless of its exact position
      in Kansas, it must be east of any point in Colorado


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      positions on the US map - West Virginia borders the western side of Virginia.


      Step 3: Determine more specific locations.

      - Pleasants Power Station is in eastern West Virginia, situated along the Ohio
      River.

      - Lake Accotink is in Fairfax County in northern Virginia, near Washington DC
      in the eastern part of the state.


      Step 4: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Even though Pleasants Power Station is in eastern WV, the entire state of
      WV lies west of northern Virginia where Lake Accotink is located.


      YES, Pleasants Power Station, WV is located west of Lake Accotink, VA.'

      of two places and compare their east-west positions:

      1. Pleasants Power Station in West Virginia (WV)

      2. Lake Accotink in Virginia (VA)


      Let me think about their general locations:


      West Virginia is a state that is generally west of Virginia. The state boundary
      between them runs roughly north-south.


      Pleasants Power Station would be somewhere in West Virginia. Since WV is west
      of VA, there''s a good chance the power station is west of anything in Virginia.


      Lake Accotink is in Virginia (VA). It''s likely in the eastern part of Virginia
      based on many lakes and water features being in that region.


      Given the state locations (WV being west of VA), it is highly likely that Pleasants
      Power Station in West Virginia is west of Lake Accotink in Virginia.


      Actually, let me be more precise. Pleasants Power Station is likely along the
      Ohio River in western WV. Lake Accotink is likely in eastern VA, possibly near
      the DC area if it''s a notable lake. This would definitely put Pleasants Power
      Station west of Lake Accotink.</think># Reasoning about the locations


      To determine whether Pleasants Power Station, WV is located west of Lake Accotink,
      VA, I need to consider the geographic locations of both places.


      1) **Pleasants Power Station**: This is located in Pleasants County, West Virginia,
      along the Ohio River in the western part of the state.


      2) **Lake Accotink**: This is a reservoir located in Springfield, Fairfax County,
      Virginia, in the eastern part of Virginia near Washington, D.C.


      3) **Geographical relationship**: West Virginia is generally west of Virginia.
      More specifically, Pleasants County is in the northwestern part of West Virginia,
      while Fairfax County is in the northeastern part of Virginia.


      Since Pleasants Power Station is in western West Virginia, and Lake Accotink
      is in eastern Virginia, the power station must be west of the lake.


      Therefore, YES, Pleasants Power Station, WV is located west of Lake Accotink,
      VA.'

      of Pleasants Power Station in West Virginia and Lake Accotink in Virginia, and
      then figure out if the power station is west of the lake.


      First, let me establish the general geography:

      - West Virginia (WV) is a state that borders Virginia (VA)

      - Generally, West Virginia is to the west of Virginia (as the name suggests)


      Now for the specific locations:

      - Pleasants Power Station would be in Pleasants County, WV, which is in the
      northwestern part of West Virginia along the Ohio River

      - Lake Accotink is in Virginia. Based on the "VA" designation, it''s likely
      in northern Virginia, possibly near the DC metro area


      Given the general geography, since West Virginia is west of Virginia, and Pleasants
      Power Station is in West Virginia while Lake Accotink is in Virginia, it''s
      highly likely that Pleasants Power Station is indeed west of Lake Accotink.


      To be more precise:

      - Pleasants Power Station is along the Ohio River in northwestern WV

      - Lake Accotink is likely in northern VA (Fairfax County area)


      So directionally, Pleasants Power Station would be northwest of Lake Accotink,
      which means it is west of Lake Accotink.</think>To determine if Pleasants Power
      Station, WV is located west of Lake Accotink, VA, I need to identify where both
      locations are and compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Pleasants Power Station is located in Pleasants County, West Virginia, along
      the Ohio River in the northwestern part of the state.

      - Lake Accotink is located in Fairfax County, Virginia, in the northern part
      of the state near Springfield (part of the Washington D.C. metropolitan area).


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions.

      - West Virginia is generally west of Virginia, as its name suggests.

      - Pleasants County is in the northwestern portion of West Virginia.

      - Fairfax County is in the northeastern part of Virginia.


      Step 3: Determine directional relationship.

      - When comparing these specific locations, Pleasants Power Station is indeed
      west of Lake Accotink.

      - Pleasants Power Station is closer to the Ohio River border with Ohio, while
      Lake Accotink is in the DC metro area in northern Virginia.


      YES, Pleasants Power Station, WV is located west of Lake Accotink, VA.'

      5. In the United States, states that are further west have lower longitude values

      6. Since California is entirely west of New Mexico on a map of the United States,

      7. Therefore, Don Pedro Reservoir in California must be west of Heron Lake in

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New Mexico is an inland state in the southwestern United States

      - California is entirely west of New Mexico


      Since Don Pedro Reservoir is in California, and Heron Lake is in New Mexico,

      1. Don Pedro Reservoir in California

      2. Heron Lake in New Mexico


      First, let''s recall the general geographic positions of California and New
      Mexico within the United States:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - New Mexico is an inland state in the southwestern United States, but it is
      east of California


      Just based on state locations, Don Pedro Reservoir in California would be west
      of Heron Lake in New Mexico. But let me be more precise.


      California is entirely west of New Mexico. The easternmost point of California
      is still west of the westernmost point of New Mexico. So any location in California
      (including Don Pedro Reservoir) would be west of any location in New Mexico
      (including Heron Lake).


      So based on this reasoning, Don Pedro Reservoir, CA is located west of Heron
      Lake, NM.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two bodies of water.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these bodies of water are located.

      - Don Pedro Reservoir is in California (CA)

      - Heron Lake is in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of California and New Mexico.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New Mexico is an inland southwestern state


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning of these states.

      - California is entirely west of New Mexico

      - The easternmost point of California is still west of the westernmost point
      of New Mexico


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific water bodies.

      - Since Don Pedro Reservoir is in California, and Heron Lake is in New Mexico,
      and California is west of New Mexico, Don Pedro Reservoir must be west of Heron
      Lake.

      is west of Lake Crabtree, NC, I need to know the locations of both lakes.


      Lake Nottely is in Georgia (GA), specifically in Union County in the northern
      part of the state.


      Lake Crabtree is in North Carolina (NC), specifically near Raleigh in Wake County.


      Georgia is generally west of North Carolina in the United States. If we look
      at a map of the US, Georgia is to the west and slightly south of North Carolina.


      However, I need to be more precise about these specific lakes, as their locations
      within their respective states matter.


      Lake Nottely is in the very northeastern part of Georgia, close to the North
      Carolina border.


      Lake Crabtree is in the central part of North Carolina, near Raleigh.


      Generally speaking, any location in Georgia would be west of central North Carolina,
      where Lake Crabtree is located. Even the easternmost parts of Georgia are typically
      west of central North Carolina.


      So Lake Nottely in northeastern Georgia should be west of Lake Crabtree in central
      North Carolina.</think>I need to determine the relative locations of these two
      lakes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both lakes.

      - Lake Nottely is in Georgia (GA), specifically in Union County in the northern
      part of the state.

      - Lake Crabtree is in North Carolina (NC), located near Raleigh in the central
      part of the state.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Georgia and North Carolina.

      - Georgia is positioned west of North Carolina on the US map.

      - Even the northeastern corner of Georgia (where Lake Nottely is) is generally
      west of central North Carolina.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Lake Nottely is in the northeastern part of Georgia, near the North Carolina
      border.

      - Lake Crabtree is in the central part of North Carolina (Wake County).

      - When comparing these specific locations, Lake Nottely is still west of Lake
      Crabtree.


      YES, Lake Nottely, GA is located west of Lake Crabtree, NC.'

      First, let''s think about the states:

      - Lake Nottely is in Georgia (GA)

      - Lake Crabtree is in North Carolina (NC)


      Generally speaking, Georgia is south and west of North Carolina. But that''s
      a generalization about the states overall, and we need to be more precise about
      these specific lakes.


      Lake Nottely is in northern Georgia, likely in the mountainous region.

      Lake Crabtree is in North Carolina, but I need to determine its specific location.


      Lake Crabtree is near Raleigh, in the central part of North Carolina.

      Lake Nottely is in the very northern part of Georgia, in the Blue Ridge Mountains
      area.


      Given the geography of the southeastern United States, northern Georgia (where
      Lake Nottely is) would be west of central North Carolina (where Lake Crabtree
      is located).


      So yes, Lake Nottely, GA is located west of Lake Crabtree, NC.</think># Is Lake
      Nottely, GA located west of Lake Crabtree, NC?


      Let me work through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to consider the geographic locations of Georgia (GA) and North
      Carolina (NC). Georgia is generally southwest of North Carolina.


      2) Lake Nottely is located in northern Georgia, in Union County, near the North
      Carolina border. It''s in the Blue Ridge Mountains region.


      3) Lake Crabtree is located in Wake County, North Carolina, near Raleigh in
      the central part of the state.


      4) When comparing their specific locations, Lake Nottely is in the far northeastern
      part of Georgia, while Lake Crabtree is in the central part of North Carolina.


      5) On a map, locations in northern Georgia (even northeastern Georgia) are still
      west of central North Carolina.


      Therefore, YES, Lake Nottely, GA is located west of Lake Crabtree, NC.'

      step:


      1. I need to determine the locations of Lake Nottely in Georgia (GA) and Lake

      2. In terms of US geography, Georgia is generally south of North Carolina.


      3. But the question is asking about east-west positioning, not north-south.


      4. Georgia is generally positioned to the west of North Carolina when looking
      at a US map. Georgia''s eastern border meets the western portions of South Carolina,
      while North Carolina is further east.


      5. Lake Nottely is in Georgia (GA), which would place it in the western part
      relative to North Carolina.


      6. Lake Crabtree is in North Carolina (NC), which would place it in the eastern
      part relative to Georgia.


      Given these general state positions, Lake Nottely in GA would typically be west

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Georgia is positioned to the west of North Carolina on a US map. Georgia''s
      eastern border connects with South Carolina, while North Carolina lies further
      east.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the lakes.

      Since Lake Nottely is in Georgia (the more western state) and Lake Crabtree
      is in North Carolina (the more eastern state), Lake Nottely would be west of
      Lake Crabtree.


      YES, Lake Nottely, GA is located west of Lake Crabtree, NC.'
