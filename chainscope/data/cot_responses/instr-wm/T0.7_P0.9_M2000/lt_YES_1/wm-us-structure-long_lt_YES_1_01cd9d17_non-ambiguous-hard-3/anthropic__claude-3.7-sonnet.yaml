      determine the relative locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations mentioned.

      - Rose Valley Lake is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - Bunch-of-Grapes is in Massachusetts (MA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.

      - Pennsylvania is located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States

      - Massachusetts is located in the New England region of the United States

      - Generally, Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Verify the specific locations within their states.

      - Rose Valley Lake would be somewhere within Pennsylvania

      - Bunch-of-Grapes would be somewhere within Massachusetts


      Step 4: Since Pennsylvania as a whole is west of Massachusetts, any location
      in Pennsylvania (including Rose Valley Lake) would be west of any location in
      Massachusetts (including Bunch-of-Grapes).


      Therefore, Rose Valley Lake (PA) is located west of Bunch-of-Grapes (MA).

      Pennsylvania is located west of Massachusetts in the United States. Pennsylvania
      is in the Mid-Atlantic region, while Massachusetts is in the Northeast/New England
      region.


      Step 3: Consider if there could be exceptions based on the specific locations
      within each state.

      Even though specific locations within states could sometimes create exceptions
      to general state-to-state relationships, the east-west relationship between
      Pennsylvania and Massachusetts is clear. The easternmost point of Pennsylvania
      is still west of the westernmost point of Massachusetts.


      Step 4: Apply this knowledge to the specific locations.

      Since Rose Valley Lake is in Pennsylvania, and Bunch-of-Grapes is in Massachusetts,
      Rose Valley Lake must be west of Bunch-of-Grapes.

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central region of the United States.

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States.

      - Generally, Oklahoma is west of Tennessee.


      Step 2: Let''s be more specific about Lake Hudson and Memphis.

      - Lake Hudson is in northeastern Oklahoma.

      - Memphis is located in the southwestern corner of Tennessee, along the Mississippi
      River.
