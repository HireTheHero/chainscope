      1. **Locate Buckhorn Lake, KY**: Buckhorn Lake is situated in Perry County,
      Kentucky. It is positioned in the eastern part of the state.


      2. **Locate Hyco Lake, NC**: Hyco Lake is located in Person County, North Carolina,
      which is in the northern part of the state.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Kentucky is to the northwest of North
      Carolina. Buckhorn Lake, being in eastern Kentucky, is still generally northwest
      of Hyco Lake, which lies in north-central North Carolina.


      4. **Westward position**: When we consider the directions, "west" means that
      something is to the left when facing north. Since Buckhorn Lake is northwest
      of Hyco Lake, it is not directly west but rather more to the north and west.


      Thus, after analyzing the locations of both lakes, we conclude that Buckhorn
      Lake is not directly west of Hyco Lake.


      The answer is **NO**.'

      1. **Location of Trojan Nuclear Power Plant**: The Trojan Nuclear Power Plant
      is situated along the Columbia River in Rainier, Oregon. It is located to the
      west of the river.


      2. **Location of Ice Harbor Dam**: The Ice Harbor Dam is located on the Snake
      River in Washington, near the town of Burbank. This dam is upstream from the
      confluence of the Columbia River and the Snake River.


      3. **Geographic Relationship**: The Ice Harbor Dam is east of the Columbia River,
      while the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is west of it. Since the Columbia River
      flows northward and the Trojan plant is west of it, this indicates that the
      Trojan plant is west of the Ice Harbor Dam.


      Considering these points, the answer is:


      **YES**.'

      in California is located west of Heron Lake in New Mexico, we can analyze the
      geographic locations of both sites.


      1. **Locate Don Pedro Reservoir**: Don Pedro Reservoir is situated in California,
      approximately in the Sierra Nevada region, specifically in Tuolumne County.


      2. **Locate Heron Lake**: Heron Lake is located in northern New Mexico, in Rio
      Arriba County.


      3. **Determine their longitudes**: California is located to the west of New
      Mexico. The longitudes for Don Pedro Reservoir are approximately -120.5 degrees,
      while Heron Lake is approximately -106.5 degrees.


      4. **Comparing longitudes**: Since the longitude of Don Pedro Reservoir (-120.5)
      is less than that of Heron Lake (-106.5), it indicates that Don Pedro Reservoir
      is located further west compared to Heron Lake.
