    4a3b93c7-f928-4465-862f-38364df1ea57: 'To determine if Marston Lake, CO is located
      south of Front Range, CO, we need to understand the geography and compare their
      relative positions. Here are the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations:** Marston Lake is located in Colorado, specifically
      in the Denver metropolitan area. Front Range is a mountain range that runs north-south
      through Colorado, including the Denver area.


      2. **Understand the geography:** The Front Range is a prominent mountain range
      that forms the easternmost edge of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. It runs
      north-south through the state, including the Denver metropolitan area.


      3. **Compare the positions:** Since Marston Lake is located in the Denver metropolitan
      area and the Front Range runs north-south through this area, it is possible
      that Marston Lake could be located south of the Front Range.


      4. **Conclusion:** Given the general location of Marston Lake in the Denver
      metropolitan area and the north-south orientation of the Front Range through
      the area, it is reasonable to conclude that Marston Lake is located south of
      the Front Range.
