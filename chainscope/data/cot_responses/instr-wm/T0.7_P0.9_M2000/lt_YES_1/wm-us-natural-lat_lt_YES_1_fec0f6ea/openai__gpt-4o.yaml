      1. **Identify the location of Lake Tuendae:** Lake Tuendae is located in Zzyzx,
      California, which is in the Mojave Desert within San Bernardino County.


      2. **Identify the location of Soda Lake:** Soda Lake is also located in San
      Bernardino County, California, and is part of the Soda Dry Lake area near the
      town of Baker in the Mojave Desert.


      3. **Compare their positions:** Zzyzx (where Lake Tuendae is located) is situated
      just south of Soda Lake. The Zzyzx Road exit is off Interstate 15, south of
      Baker, CA, and Soda Lake is north of the Zzyzx area.


      Based on this geographical information, Lake Tuendae is indeed located south
      of Soda Lake in San Bernardino County, CA.


      **Answer: YES**'

      2. **Identify the location of Lizard Pond:** There are several bodies of water

      geographical positions:


      1. **Identify the Latitude of Lake Worth, Texas**: Lake Worth is a city near
      Fort Worth, Texas. Fort Worth is located at approximately 32.7 degrees North
      latitude.


      2. **Identify the Latitude of Imperial Reservoir, Arizona**: Imperial Reservoir
      is located on the Colorado River near Yuma, Arizona. Yuma is situated at about
      32.7 degrees North latitude as well.


      Now, comparing the latitudes:


      - Lake Worth is at approximately 32.7 degrees North.

      - Imperial Reservoir is also around 32.7 degrees North.


      Given this information, Lake Worth and Imperial Reservoir are approximately
      on the same latitude. However, without more precise coordinates, it''s difficult
      to definitively say one is south of the other, but they are approximately aligned
      east to west rather than north to south.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Lake Worth (Texas), TX located south

      is located) is generally east of Osceola County, but more importantly for this
      question, it is north of the main area of Kissimmee where Lake Tohopekaliga
      is located.


      Thus, Lake Washington is located north of Lake Tohopekaliga.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Lake Washington (Florida), FL located
      south of Lake Tohopekaliga, FL?" is **NO**.'
