      - The Front Range is a section of the Rocky Mountains that runs north-south
      along the eastern edge of Colorado

      - It extends from Wyoming to southern Colorado, roughly parallel to Interstate
      25

      - Specifically, it is southwest of Denver, in the southwest part of the city


      3. Comparing the locations:

      - Since Marston Lake is southwest of Denver, which itself is located along the

      - Minnesota is east of Washington

      - This means Lake Windigo is much further east than Angle Lake

      1. Locate Alturas Lake, ID:

      - Alturas Lake is located in Idaho, specifically in Sawtooth National Recreation
      Area in central Idaho

      - It is in the central part of Idaho, in the mountainous region of the state


      2. Locate Saginaw Bay, MI:

      - Saginaw Bay is located in eastern Michigan, on the western side of Lake Huron

      - It is in the eastern part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Idaho is in the western United States

      - Michigan is in the northeastern United States

      - Idaho is west of Michigan


      4. Determine their relative north/south positioning:

      - Idaho is generally at a lower latitude than Michigan

      - This means Alturas Lake is south of Saginaw Bay

      \u2022 Bristol Lake is around 35.3\xB0 N latitude\n\n4. Since Lake of the Arbuckles\

      1. First, I need to locate Lake of the Arbuckles in Oklahoma

      2. Then, I need to locate Bristol Lake in California

      3. Then, I''ll determine their relative geographic positions


      Step 1: Lake of the Arbuckles is located in the Arbuckle Mountains region of
      south-central Oklahoma, in Murray County.


      Step 2: Bristol Lake is located in the Mojave Desert region of southeastern
      California, in San Bernardino County.


      Step 3: Comparing their geographic positions:

      - Lake of the Arbuckles is in Oklahoma (central US)

      - Bristol Lake is in California (western US)

      - California is west of Oklahoma

      - So a lake in California would be west, not south, of a lake in Oklahoma


      Therefore, Lake of the Arbuckles is NOT located south of Bristol Lake.
