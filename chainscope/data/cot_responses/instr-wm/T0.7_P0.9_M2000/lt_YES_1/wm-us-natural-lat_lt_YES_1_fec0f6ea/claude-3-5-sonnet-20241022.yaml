      - Calcasieu Lake is closer to the Gulf Coast, making it further south

    fe629234-419a-47b9-aa0f-eaf79d7ffc64: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let me locate both mountain ranges:

      - The Animas Mountains are located in southwestern New Mexico, in Hidalgo County

      - The Peloncillo Mountains (Hidalgo County) are also located in southwestern
      New Mexico, in Hidalgo County


      2) Looking at their specific locations:

      - The Animas Mountains run north-south and are located in the central part of
      Hidalgo County

      - The Peloncillo Mountains form part of the New Mexico-Arizona border, on the
      western edge of Hidalgo County


      3) In terms of their relative positions:

      - The Animas Mountains are positioned east of the Peloncillo Mountains

      - Both ranges run roughly parallel to each other

      - The Animas Mountains are at approximately the same latitude as the Peloncillo
      Mountains


      Therefore: NO, the Animas Mountains are not located south of the Peloncillo
      Mountains - they are located east of them at roughly the same latitude.

      - Lake Phalen is also in Saint Paul, Minnesota


      2. Looking at their relative positions:

      - Como Lake is located in the Como Park neighborhood

      - Lake Phalen is located in the Phalen Park area

      - Como Lake is positioned in the northwest part of Saint Paul

      - Lake Phalen is positioned in the northeast part of Saint Paul

    c8021c5a-8bdc-4412-bd3e-eb0fbc140444: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Eastman Lake, CA:

      - Eastman Lake is in Madera County, California

      - It''s located in central California, east of Madera city


      2. Next, I''ll locate Crazy Lake, CA:

      - Crazy Lake is located in Modoc County, California

      - Modoc County is in the far northeastern corner of California


      3. Now I can compare their locations:

      - Modoc County (Crazy Lake) is near the Oregon border

      - Madera County (Eastman Lake) is in the central part of California

      - Therefore, Eastman Lake is located further south than Crazy Lake


      Answer: YES'
