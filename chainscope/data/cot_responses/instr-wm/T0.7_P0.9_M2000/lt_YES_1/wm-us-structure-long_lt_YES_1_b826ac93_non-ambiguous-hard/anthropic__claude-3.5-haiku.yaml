    eaee361e-105a-409b-98a2-4fe95fa00c00: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate Red Bluff Reservoir, TX:

      - Red Bluff Reservoir is located in West Texas, near the New Mexico border

      - It is situated in Pecos County, in the western part of Texas


      2. Next, locate Basilica of St. John in Des Moines, Iowa:

      - Heron Lake is in Rio Arriba County, northwestern New Mexico


      2. Next, I''ll locate Civic Center Music Hall:

      - This is located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma


      3. Comparing their geographic positions:

      - Heron Lake, NM is in the western part of New Mexico

      - Oklahoma City is east of New Mexico


      4. So if Heron Lake is in western New Mexico, and Oklahoma City is east of New
      Mexico, then Heron Lake is definitely west of the Civic Center Music Hall.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

    d45ee2fb-e0e5-4c25-ae9c-2ec34a11fd3d: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Jocassee Dam in South Carolina

      - This is in the western part of South Carolina, in the mountainous region near
      the border with Georgia


      2. Next, I''ll locate Boldt Castle in New York

      - Boldt Castle is located in the Thousand Islands region of New York, specifically
      on Heart Island in the St. Lawrence River

      - This is in the northeastern part of New York state, near the Canadian border


      3. Compare their geographical positions

      - Jocassee Dam is in the southeastern United States (South Carolina)

      - Boldt Castle is in the northeastern United States (New York)

      - These locations are quite far apart, on opposite sides of the country


      4. Determine their relative west/east positioning

      - Since Jocassee Dam is in South Carolina (southeast) and Boldt Castle is in
      New York (northeast), Jocassee Dam is actually EAST of Boldt Castle


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      2. Next, I''ll locate Mammoth Pool Reservoir:

      - Mammoth Pool Reservoir is located in California

      - Specifically, it''s in the Sierra Nevada mountain range in central California


      3. Consider their relative geographic positions:

      - Washington is north of California

      - Mount Baker Theatre is in the far northwest of Washington

      - Mammoth Pool Reservoir is in central California

      - This means Mount Baker Theatre is definitively west of Mammoth Pool Reservoir


      4. Therefore, the answer is: YES.


      The reasoning is that Mount Baker Theatre''s location in northwestern Washington
      puts it geographically west of Mammoth Pool Reservoir''s location in central
      California.


      Answer: YES'

      - North Jackson is in Mahoning County, northeastern Ohio


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Truman Reservoir is in central Missouri (west-central part of the state)

      - The shrine is in northeastern Ohio

      - Missouri is west of Ohio


      4. Comparing their relative positions:

      3. Consider their geographic relationship

      - Michigan is west of Washington, DC

      - However, the question is specifically about the precise locations of these
      two specific structures


      4. To definitively answer, I would need precise geographic coordinates for both
      structures


      5. Without those exact coordinates, I cannot confidently state whether one specific
      structure is west of the other


      6. However, given that Michigan is west of DC, and Fermi 1 is in Michigan, the
      most likely answer is YES.


      Answer: YES'

      1. First, locate Tellico Reservoir, TN:

      - Tellico Reservoir is located in eastern Tennessee, specifically in Loudon
      and Monroe counties


      2. Next, locate Church of St. Joseph in Bronxville, NY:

      - Bronxville is a village in Westchester County, New York, located north of
      New York City


      3. Compare their geographic positions:

      - Tellico Reservoir is in eastern Tennessee (which is in the southeastern United
      States)

      - Bronxville, NY is in southeastern New York state (in the northeastern United
      States)


      4. Determine their relative positions:

      - Tennessee is west of New York

      - So Tellico Reservoir is west of Bronxville, NY

      - Carbon County, WY is specifically west of Harlan County, NE


      4. Therefore, the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project is indeed
      located west of Harlan County Reservoir


      The answer is: YES.'
