      1. First, let me locate both counties:

      - Cambria County is in west-central Pennsylvania

      - Cattaraugus County is in western New York


      2. Looking at their relative positions:

      - Cattaraugus County is along the NY-PA border

      - Cambria County is several counties away from the NY border


      3. Comparing their east-west positions:

      - Cattaraugus County is in the western part of NY

      - Cambria County is in central PA, significantly east of where Cattaraugus County
      sits


      4. Final check:

      - If you draw a line directly south from Cattaraugus County, it would hit Pennsylvania
      well west of Cambria County

      1) First, I need to locate both counties:

      - Terrell County is in southwest Georgia

      - Wakulla County is in the Florida panhandle


      2) For reference points:

      - Terrell County, GA is south of Columbus, GA

      - Wakulla County, FL is just south of Tallahassee, FL

      - Magoffin County is in the eastern portion of Kentucky

      - Oglethorpe County is in the eastern part of Georgia

      - Being in eastern Kentucky puts Magoffin County further east than most of Georgia

      1) First, let me identify the locations:

      - McDowell County is in North Carolina

      - Athens County is in Ohio

      - McDowell County, NC is in the western part of North Carolina, in the Appalachian

      - Athens County, OH is in southeastern Ohio


      3) Comparing the states:

      - Ohio is generally west of North Carolina

      1. First, I need to locate both counties in Michigan

      - Kalkaska County is in the northern Lower Peninsula

      - Mackinac County is in the eastern Upper Peninsula

      - Kalkaska County is roughly in the middle of the northern Lower Peninsula

      - Mackinac County is at the eastern end of the Upper Peninsula

      - Clermont County is in southwestern Ohio

      - Shiawassee County is in central Michigan


      2. Since these are in different states, I need to consider their relative positions:

      - Michigan is north of Ohio

      - Both Michigan and Ohio share similar longitude ranges


      3. Within their respective states:

      - Clermont County is in the southwestern part of Ohio

      - Shiawassee County is in the central part of Michigan


      4. Given that Michigan and Ohio are roughly aligned longitudinally (east-west),
      and Clermont is in southwestern Ohio while Shiawassee is in central Michigan,
      Clermont County would be west of Shiawassee County.

      - Johnston County, NC is in eastern North Carolina

      - Blair County, PA is in central Pennsylvania


      2. When comparing east-west positions, I can consider that:

      - Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina

      - But east-west positioning is what matters here

      - Pennsylvania''s center is roughly aligned with or slightly west of North Carolina''s
      center


      3. Within their respective states:

      - Johnston County is in the eastern portion of NC

      - Blair County is in the central portion of PA


      4. Therefore:

      - Being in eastern NC, Johnston County is further east than central PA

      - This means Johnston County is EAST of Blair County, not west


      Answer: NO'
    ae4d7110-a542-44bb-bd81-ee2339878663: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, I need to know roughly where both counties are located:

      - Johnston County is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Blair County is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      2) North Carolina is south of Pennsylvania, but that''s not what we''re comparing.
      We need to compare their east-west positioning.


      3) Pennsylvania is a more northern state that extends fairly far west into the
      interior US.

      - Blair County, PA is in central Pennsylvania


      4) North Carolina is an Atlantic coast state

      - Johnston County is in east-central North Carolina, not far from Raleigh


      5) Given that Blair County, PA is in central PA and Johnston County, NC is in
      eastern NC, Johnston County would be EAST of Blair County.


      Therefore, NO - Johnston County, NC is not located west of Blair County, PA.'
