      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on the US map.

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern part of the US

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern part of the US


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Pennsylvania is generally east of states like Ohio and west of New Jersey

      - North Carolina is on the Atlantic coast, roughly south of Pennsylvania


      Step 4: More specifically, Centre County is in central Pennsylvania, as its
      name suggests

      - New Hanover County is in southeastern NC, on the Atlantic coast


      Step 5: When comparing locations on the same latitude in the eastern US, places
      further west have higher longitude values than places further east.

      - Centre County, PA is inland and more westward than coastal counties on the
      Atlantic

      - New Hanover County, NC is on the Atlantic coast, which means it''s quite far

      - Oregon is located on the Pacific coast, in the northwestern United States

      - Nevada is inland, east of California and south of Oregon


      Step 3: Determine their relative east-west positioning.

      - Oregon is generally west of Nevada on a map

      - However, I need to check the specific counties'' positions


      Step 4: Analyze the specific counties.

      - Wallowa County is in the northeastern corner of Oregon

      - Lander County is in north-central Nevada


      Step 5: Compare their longitudes.

      - Even though Wallowa is in northeastern Oregon (the easternmost part of the

      - Conecuh County is in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions.

      - Florida is generally south of Alabama

      - However, the Florida Panhandle extends westward along Alabama''s southern
      border


      Step 3: Locate these specific counties.

      - Santa Rosa County is in the western part of Florida''s Panhandle

      - Conecuh County is in southern Alabama


      Step 4: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Santa Rosa County is one of the westernmost counties in Florida, bordering
      Alabama

      - Conecuh County is in south-central Alabama, not at the western edge of the
      state


      Step 5: Make the final determination.

      - Santa Rosa County is in the far western part of Florida''s Panhandle

      - Conecuh County is further east in Alabama

      - Therefore, Santa Rosa County is west of Conecuh County

      - Denton County is located in north-central Texas, part of the Dallas-Fort Worth
      metroplex.

      - Hill County is located in central Texas, south of the Dallas-Fort Worth area.


      Step 2: Consider their east-west positioning.

      - Denton County is in the eastern half of north Texas.

      - Hill County is roughly in the central part of Texas.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes.

      - Denton County is positioned in the eastern portion of north-central Texas.

      - Hill County is positioned more centrally in the state.

      - When comparing counties in Texas, those that are more central are generally
      west of those that are in the eastern portion of north-central Texas.


      Step 4: Based on their relative positions, Hill County is southwest of Denton
      County. Since we''re specifically asking about the east-west positioning (not
      diagonal), I need to determine if Hill County is directly west of Denton County.

      Step 1: Recall the general locations of Arkansas and Louisiana within the United
      States.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States.

      - Louisiana is located south of Arkansas, along the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 2: Consider the east-west positioning of these states.

      - Arkansas and Louisiana share a partial border.

      - Arkansas is generally to the northwest of Louisiana.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations of Yell County and Calcasieu Parish.

      - Yell County is in west-central Arkansas.

      - Calcasieu Parish is in southwestern Louisiana, near the Texas border.


      Step 4: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Since Arkansas is generally west and north of Louisiana, and Calcasieu Parish
      is in the southwestern part of Louisiana (rather than the northwestern part
      that would be closest to Arkansas), Yell County would be west of Calcasieu Parish.


      YES, Yell County, AR is located west of Calcasieu Parish, LA.'

      - Both states border the Pacific Ocean on their western sides.


      Step 3: Consider the east-west positioning within these states.

      - California extends further east than Oregon''s western portions.

      - Tulare County is in central/eastern California, in the San Joaquin Valley,
      east of the coastal ranges.

      - Umatilla County is in northeastern Oregon, bordering Washington state.

      eastern border.

      - Umatilla County is in the northeastern part of Oregon, quite far from the
      Pacific coast.

      - Given Oregon''s position north of California, and Umatilla being in northeastern
      Oregon while Tulare is in central/eastern California, Tulare County would be
      west of Umatilla County.


      NO - Tulare County, CA is not located west of Umatilla County, OR. It is actually
      east of Umatilla County.


      Wait, I need to double-check this. Looking more carefully at the map positions:

      - Tulare County is indeed in central California, in the San Joaquin Valley

      - Umatilla County is in northeastern Oregon

      - When comparing their longitudes, Tulare County is actually west of Umatilla
      County

      the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay.


      Step 3: Looking at their relative positions, Anne Arundel County is north of
      Calvert County, but importantly for this question, Anne Arundel County is positioned
      to the west of Calvert County. Anne Arundel borders the western side of Calvert
      County.


      Step 4: To verify, Anne Arundel County shares its eastern/southeastern border
      with Calvert County, which means Anne Arundel is to the west of Calvert.

      positioning of New Castle County, DE and Accomack County, VA.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these counties.

      - New Castle County is in Delaware (DE), which is on the eastern seaboard of
      the US.

      - Accomack County is in Virginia (VA), also on the eastern seaboard.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions.

      - Accomack County is on Virginia''s Eastern Shore, which is on the Delmarva
      Peninsula.


      Step 3: Analyze east-west positioning.

      - The Delmarva Peninsula contains parts of Delaware (western part), Maryland
      (middle), and Virginia (eastern part).

      - Accomack County is on the eastern side of the Delmarva Peninsula, bordering
      the Atlantic Ocean.

      - New Castle County is on the western side of Delaware, bordering Maryland and

      New Castle County is the northernmost county in Delaware, located in the northern
      part of the state.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Accomack County, Virginia is located.

      Accomack County is located on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, which is on the
      Delmarva Peninsula.


      Step 3: Consider the geography of the Delmarva Peninsula.

      The Delmarva Peninsula contains parts of Delaware (eastern side), Maryland,
      and Virginia (southern tip). Delaware is on the eastern side of the peninsula,
      while the Eastern Shore of Virginia is at the southern portion.

      Step 1: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Minnesota is in the northern part of the central United States.

      - Louisiana is in the southern part of the central United States.

      - Generally, Minnesota is north of Louisiana.


      Step 2: Consider east-west positioning.

      - Minnesota is primarily situated in the upper Midwest region.

      - Louisiana is located in the Deep South along the Gulf of Mexico.

      - While there is some east-west overlap between states, Minnesota as a whole
      tends to be positioned more to the west than Louisiana.


      Step 3: Look at the specific counties.

      - Faribault County is in southern Minnesota.

      - Caddo Parish is in northwestern Louisiana (parishes in Louisiana are equivalent
      to counties).

      - Even though Caddo Parish is in the western part of Louisiana, Minnesota''s

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States

      - Ohio is located in the midwestern United States, north of Tennessee


      Step 3: Consider the east-west positioning.

      - Ohio is generally east of the Mississippi River and in the eastern half of
      the US

      - Tennessee is also east of the Mississippi River and in the eastern half of
      the US

      - However, Ohio is positioned more to the northeast relative to Tennessee


      Step 4: More specifically, Ohio is positioned to the northeast of Tennessee,
      which means Tennessee is southwest of Ohio. On a west-east axis, Tennessee is
      generally west of Ohio.


      Step 5: Claiborne County is in northeastern Tennessee, while Lucas County is

      Step 1: Let me recall the approximate locations of these counties in Texas.

      - Sutton County is located in west-central Texas, in what''s often considered
      part of the Edwards Plateau region.

      - Coke County is located in west-central Texas as well, but more in the north-central
      part of the state.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Sutton County is positioned further west in Texas, roughly in the area between
      San Angelo and Del Rio.

      - Coke County is positioned more eastward, north of San Angelo and east of the
      Permian Basin area.

      Step 5: Geographically, Gratiot County is indeed west of Hillsdale County. Gratiot
      is more centrally located in the state, while Hillsdale extends toward the southeast
      corner of Michigan.


      NO.


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me verify again:


      Gratiot County is in central Michigan, and Hillsdale County is in southern Michigan
      near the Ohio border. When looking at a map of Michigan counties, Hillsdale
      County is actually positioned southwest of Gratiot County, not east of it.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both counties.

      - Musselshell County is in Montana (MT)

      - San Juan County is in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Montana is in the northwestern part of the United States

      - New Mexico is in the southwestern part of the United States

      - Both states are in the western half of the country


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Montana is generally north of New Mexico

      - However, the question asks about east-west positioning, not north-south

      - Montana is positioned somewhat east of New Mexico on the map

      - This means counties in Montana would generally be east of counties in New
      Mexico


      Step 4: Specifically for these counties:

      - Musselshell County is in central/eastern Montana

      - San Juan County is in northwestern New Mexico (near the Four Corners area)

      - San Juan County, NM is further west than Musselshell County, MT

      Step 1: Let me identify the states involved.

      - Oglethorpe County is in Georgia (GA)

      - Magoffin County is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Georgia and Kentucky.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - Kentucky is located more to the north of Georgia


      Step 3: Consider the east-west positioning.

      - Georgia is generally positioned in the eastern part of the US

      - Kentucky is also in the eastern US, but positioned somewhat more westerly
      than most of Georgia


      Step 4: More specifically, Georgia is positioned mostly to the southeast of
      Kentucky. This means that most of Georgia is actually east of Kentucky, not
      west.


      Step 5: To be even more precise, Oglethorpe County is in the northeastern part
      of Georgia, while Magoffin County is in eastern Kentucky. Looking at their specific
      positions, Oglethorpe County would be to the southeast of Magoffin County, meaning
      it is east of Magoffin County, not west.

      - Kentucky is positioned more to the west compared to most of Georgia


      Step 4: More specifically for these counties:

      - Oglethorpe County is in northeastern Georgia

      - Magoffin County is in eastern Kentucky


      Step 5: Eastern Kentucky is generally east of the main body of Kentucky, while
      northeastern Georgia is on the eastern side of Georgia. Since Georgia as a whole
      is east of Kentucky, and these counties are both on the eastern sides of their
      respective states, Oglethorpe County would be east of Magoffin County, not west.

      Step 4: More specifically, Georgia''s eastern border is the Atlantic Ocean,
      while Kentucky is entirely inland and positioned more to the west.


      Step 5: Oglethorpe County is in the northeastern part of Georgia, while Magoffin
      County is in eastern Kentucky.


      Step 6: Even though Magoffin County is in eastern Kentucky, Kentucky as a whole

      - While there is some westward extension, the primary relationship is that Yavapai
      is north of Maricopa, not west of it.

      - Maricopa County (which contains Phoenix) is also in central Arizona


      Step 2: Consider their specific positions relative to each other.

      - Yavapai County is located in north-central Arizona

      - Maricopa County is directly south of Yavapai County

      - Yavapai County shares its southern border with Maricopa County

      - Archuleta County is located in the southwestern part of Colorado, with Pagosa
      Springs as its county seat.

      - Gunnison County is in the central-western part of Colorado, with Gunnison
      as its county seat.


      Step 2: Consider their positions relative to each other.

      - Archuleta County borders New Mexico to the south and is part of the Four Corners
      region.

      - Gunnison County is more centrally located in the western half of the state,
      in the Rocky Mountains.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Archuleta County is in the far southwestern corner of Colorado.

      - Gunnison County is more central but still in western Colorado.

      - Archuleta County is further west than Gunnison County.

      Delta, and Mesa.


      Step 4: When looking at a map of Colorado, Archuleta County is positioned to
      the south and west of Gunnison County. While Archuleta is definitely south of
      Gunnison, it is not actually west of it - it''s more southwesterly, with Gunnison
      being northwest of Archuleta.

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Colorado is directly north of New Mexico

      - Colorado is generally aligned with New Mexico in terms of east-west positioning


      Step 3: Determine the specific locations of these counties within their states.

      - Adams County, CO is in the north-central part of Colorado, just east of Denver

      - Eddy County, NM is in the southeastern corner of New Mexico, bordering Texas

      1) First, I need to identify where Letcher County, KY is located. Kentucky is
      in the eastern part of the United States, and Letcher County is in the easternmost
      part of Kentucky, bordering Virginia.


      2) Next, I need to identify where Sanilac County, MI is located. Michigan is
      in the northern Midwest region of the United States. Sanilac County is in the
      eastern part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula, bordering Lake Huron.


      3) To determine which is further west, I need to compare their relative positions.
      Kentucky is generally south of Michigan, but the question is about east-west
      positioning.


      4) Eastern Kentucky (where Letcher County is) is approximately at the same longitude
      as central/western Ohio, while eastern Michigan (where Sanilac County is) is
      east of that, roughly at the same longitude as eastern Ohio or western Pennsylvania.


      5) Therefore, Letcher County, KY is west of Sanilac County, MI.


      NO, Letcher County, KY is not located west of Sanilac County, MI. It is actually
      located east of Sanilac County, MI.

      Letcher County, KY is in the eastern part of Kentucky, and Sanilac County, MI
      is in the eastern part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula. When comparing their
      longitudes, Letcher County is actually further east than Sanilac County.


      YES, Letcher County, KY is located west of Sanilac County, MI.'

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the eastern United States.

      - Pennsylvania is generally west of the Atlantic coast.

      - North Carolina''s eastern portion (where Tyrrell County is located) extends
      toward the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 3: More specifically, Tyrrell County is located in the eastern part of
      North Carolina, very close to the Atlantic coast in what''s known as the "Outer
      Banks" region.


      Step 4: Schuylkill County is located in east-central Pennsylvania, but Pennsylvania
      as a whole is situated inland from the Atlantic coast.


      Step 5: When comparing east-west positioning, locations closer to the Atlantic
      coast in the eastern US are generally further east than inland locations.


      Given that Tyrrell County is on the eastern coast of North Carolina (very close
      to the Atlantic Ocean), while Schuylkill County is in inland Pennsylvania, Schuylkill
      County would be west of Tyrrell County.

      Bullitt County is located in north-central Kentucky, just south of Louisville/Jefferson
      County in the northern part of the state.


      Step 2: Let me recall the approximate location of Metcalfe County, KY.

      Metcalfe County is located in south-central Kentucky, near the Tennessee border.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Bullitt County is in the central part of Kentucky but toward the north.

      Metcalfe County is also in the central part of Kentucky but toward the south.


      Step 4: On a west-to-east axis in Kentucky, these counties are roughly aligned
      in the central portion of the state, but Metcalfe County is typically considered
      to be slightly east of Bullitt County.

      Mississippi River, north of Baton Rouge.


      Step 2: Consider their positions relative to each other.

      - St. Mary Parish is in the south-central part of Louisiana.

      - West Feliciana Parish is in the eastern part of Louisiana, bordering Mississippi.


      Step 3: Determine east-west positioning.

      - West Feliciana Parish, despite having "West" in its name, is actually in the
      eastern portion of Louisiana.

      - St. Mary Parish is more centrally located in Louisiana''s southern coast.

      - St. Mary Parish is west of West Feliciana Parish.


      NO, St. Mary Parish is not located west of West Feliciana Parish. It is located
      south and slightly east of West Feliciana Parish.


      Wait, I need to double-check this. Looking at Louisiana''s geography more carefully:

      - West Feliciana Parish is in the eastern part of Louisiana, bordering Mississippi.

      - St. Mary Parish is in south-central Louisiana along the coast.


      When comparing their longitudes, St. Mary Parish is indeed west of West Feliciana
      Parish.


      YES, St. Mary Parish, LA is located west of West Feliciana Parish, LA.'

      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of Johnston County, NC and Blair County,
      PA.

      - Johnston County is in North Carolina (NC), which is on the east coast of the
      United States.

      - Blair County is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is also on the east coast but
      further north than North Carolina.


      Step 2: Consider their relative east-west positions.

      - Pennsylvania is generally east of the Appalachian Mountains and in the eastern
      part of the United States.

      - North Carolina is also on the eastern seaboard.

      - When comparing states on the same coast, the east-west relationship depends
      on their specific longitudes.


      Step 3: Pennsylvania is generally west of North Carolina when comparing locations
      at similar latitudes. This is because the US eastern coastline curves, with
      the northern states (like PA) being further inland/westward than the southern
      coastal states (like NC).


      Step 4: Johnston County, NC would be in eastern North Carolina, while Blair
      County, PA would be in central Pennsylvania. Given the geography of the eastern
      US, Pennsylvania counties are generally west of North Carolina counties.


      NO - Johnston County, NC is NOT located west of Blair County, PA. It is east
      of Blair County.'

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Think about east-west positioning specifically.

      - Both states are on the eastern side of the US

      - Pennsylvania is generally north of North Carolina

      - But for east-west positioning, Pennsylvania is generally west of North Carolina,
      as the East Coast curves inward as you move north from NC to PA


      Step 4: To be more precise about these specific counties:

      - Johnston County is in central/eastern North Carolina

      - Blair County is in central Pennsylvania


      Given the geography of the eastern United States, with the coastline angling
      northeast to southwest, North Carolina extends further east than Pennsylvania.

      6) Blair County, PA is located in central Pennsylvania.


      7) Johnston County, NC is located in the east-central part of North Carolina.


      8) North Carolina as a whole is generally west of the same latitudinal points
