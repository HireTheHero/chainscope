      - It is located in the southeastern part of Minnesota


      3. Compare their geographic positions

      - Louisiana is south of Minnesota

      - Caldwell Parish is east of Fillmore County''s longitude

      - Therefore, Caldwell Parish is not west of Fillmore County


      4. Reasoning conclusion: Caldwell Parish is east of Fillmore County, not west
      of it.

      5. Since Yavapai County is northwest of Maricopa County, this means it is both
      north and west of Maricopa County.


      6. Therefore, Yavapai County is indeed located west of Maricopa County.


      Answer: YES'
