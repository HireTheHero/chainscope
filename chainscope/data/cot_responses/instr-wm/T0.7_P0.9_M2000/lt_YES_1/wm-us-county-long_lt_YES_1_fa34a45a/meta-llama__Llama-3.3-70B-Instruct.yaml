      \ **General geographic knowledge**: Oregon is generally west of Nevada. This\
      \ is a broad starting point.\n3. **Specific county locations**: \n   - Wallowa\
      \ County, OR is in the northeastern part of Oregon.\n   - Lander County, NV\
      \ is in the central part of Nevada.\n4. **Comparing longitudes**: To determine\
      \ if one is west of the other, comparing their longitudes is key. Without exact\
      \ longitude values, we consider their relative positions:\n   - Oregon's eastern\
      \ edge is roughly around 117\xB0W to 119\xB0W longitude.\n   - Nevada's western\
      \ edge is roughly around 115\xB0W to 116\xB0W longitude, with the central part\
      \ being around 116\xB0W to 117\xB0W.\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that Wallowa\
      \ County is in northeastern Oregon, it is likely to be at a longitude that could\
      \ be close to or slightly east of the central part of Nevada (where Lander County\
      \ is located). However, considering Oregon's general westward position relative\
      \ to Nevada, but also acknowledging that the eastern parts of Oregon are closer\
      \ to the longitudes of central Nevada, we must consider the specifics of their\
      \ geographic locations.\n\nGiven the above steps and acknowledging that precise\
      \ longitudes for each county would provide a definitive answer, we can infer\
      \ based on general geographic principles and the relative positions of Oregon\
      \ and Nevada that Wallowa County, being in the northeastern part of Oregon,\
      \ is not as far west as other parts of Oregon but still could be west or near\
      \ the same longitude as central Nevada, depending on the exact longitudes.\n\
      \nHowever, without exact longitude values for a precise comparison, the general\
      \ geographic intuition might lead one to consider that parts of Oregon, especially\
      \ the eastern parts, could be near or slightly east of central Nevada in terms\
      \ of longitude. But knowing that Oregon as a whole is west of Nevada, and considering\
      \ the easternmost parts of Oregon are closer to Nevada but still generally west,\
      \ the question hinges on the specific longitudes of Wallowa County, OR, and\
      \ Lander County, NV.\n\nGiven the above considerations, the answer to whether\
      \ Wallowa County, OR is located west of Lander County, NV, considering general\
      \ geographic knowledge and without precise longitude values for each, leans\
      \ towards a geographic understanding that places Oregon generally west of Nevada,\
      \ but the specific locations of these counties require precise longitude comparison\
      \ for a definitive answer.\n\nHowever, since I must provide a YES or NO answer\
      \ based on the information and considering that Wallowa County is in the northeastern\
      \ part of Oregon, which might not be as far west as other parts of the state\
      \ but is still part of a state generally west of Nevada, and given that Lander\
      \ County is in central Nevada, the precise answer depends on the exact longitudes.\
      \ But for the purpose of this question and based on general geographic understanding,\
      \ the answer would be informed by recognizing Oregon's general position relative\
      \ to Nevada.\n\nThe final answer is: YES"

      \ based on typical geographical layouts. Wallowa County, OR, is in the northeastern\
      \ part of Oregon, near the Idaho border. Lander County, NV, is in the central\
      \ part of Nevada.\n4. **Comparing positions**: Given Oregon's western position\
      \ relative to Nevada, even the easternmost part of Oregon (where Wallowa County\
      \ is located) is likely to be west of the westernmost part of Nevada. However,\
      \ since Lander County is centrally located in Nevada and not on the eastern\
      \ edge, and considering Wallowa County's northeastern position in Oregon, we\
      \ need to consider their relative longitudes.\n5. **Longitudinal comparison**:\
      \ Oregon's longitude ranges approximately from 116\xB0W to 124\xB0W, with Wallowa\

      \ precise knowledge or research, but given the general proximity of their longitudes,\
      \ the question hinges on the specific longitudes of these counties.\n\nGiven\
      \ the detailed geographical analysis and without precise longitude values for\
      \ each county, one might initially think this requires more specific data. However,\
      \ knowing that both counties are at similar longitudes (around 117\xB0W), the\
      \ question essentially becomes about which one is slightly more west or east\
      \ within that range.\n\nGiven Wallowa County, OR, is at approximately 117\xB0\
      W and Lander County, NV, is also around a similar longitude, the difference\
      \ in their longitudinal positions might be very small. However, Oregon is generally\
      \ west of Nevada, but these specific counties are close in longitude. For the\
      \ purpose of this question and based on the steps outlined, considering the\
      \ need for a YES/NO answer and without more precise longitudinal data provided\
      \ here, we lean on the general westward position of Oregon relative to Nevada\

      County, TX, and Denton County, TX. Hill County is located in the central part
      of Texas, and Denton County is located in the north-central part of Texas.


      2. **Determine the relative positions**: Next, we need to determine the relative
      positions of these two counties. To do this, we can look at a map or consider
      their positions relative to major cities or landmarks. Denton County is part
      of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, situated to the north of the metroplex''s
      central areas. Hill County, on the other hand, is south of the Dallas-Fort Worth
      metroplex.


      3. **Analyze the directional relationship**: Given that Denton County is north
      of the central Dallas-Fort Worth area and Hill County is south of this area,
      we can infer their directional relationship. "West" refers to the direction
      towards the setting sun, which in the context of Texas geography, means moving
      towards the western part of the state from any given point.


      4. **Conclusion**: Considering the typical layout of Texas counties and knowing
      that Denton County is north and more towards the eastern part of the northern
      region of Texas, while Hill County is more centrally located but still to the
      south of Denton County, we can assess if Hill County is west of Denton County.
      Given the geography, Hill County is not directly west of Denton County; rather,
      it is more southward.


      Based on this analysis, the answer is: **NO**.'

      of Texas, near the Oklahoma border.

      3. **Jim Hogg County Location**: Jim Hogg County is situated in the southern
      part of Texas, near the Mexico border.

      4. **Compare Locations**: Comparing their locations, Wichita County is significantly
      north and slightly west of the central part of Texas, while Jim Hogg County
      is in the south, closer to the southern tip of Texas.

      5. **Determine Direction**: Since Wichita County is north of Jim Hogg County
      and considering the geography of Texas, we can infer that Wichita County is
      indeed west of Jim Hogg County because as you move north from Jim Hogg County,
      you would be moving in a direction that could place you west of it, given the

      TX, and Jim Hogg County, TX, are located within Texas.


      2. **Wichita County Location**: Wichita County is located in the northern part

      3. **Jim Hogg County Location**: Jim Hogg County is situated in southern Texas.
      Its county seat is Hebbronville.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Next, we compare the locations of these two counties
      in terms of their geographical positions within Texas. Wichita County is in
      the north, and Jim Hogg County is in the south.


      5. **Determine Westward Position**: Since Wichita County is in northern Texas
      and Jim Hogg County is in southern Texas, we need to consider their east-west
      positions relative to each other. Generally, the northern parts of Texas are
      wider from east to west compared to the southern parts, but the key here is
      their relative positions.


      6. **Conclusion**: Wichita County, being in northern Texas, is generally west
      and slightly north of many southern Texas counties due to the shape of Texas.
      However, Jim Hogg County is in the southern tip of Texas, and when comparing
      directly, Wichita County is actually northwest of Jim Hogg County. But considering
      the question is about being "west" of Jim Hogg County, we must think about their
      direct east-west alignment.


      Given these steps, Wichita County is indeed west of Jim Hogg County because
      when you draw a line east-west across Texas, Wichita County would fall to the
      west of Jim Hogg County, considering their respective positions in the state.

      west of Clallam County, WA, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Coos County is in Oregon (OR), and Clallam County
      is in Washington (WA). Both are states in the United States.


      2. **Understand the geography**: Oregon and Washington are adjacent states in
      the Pacific Northwest. Oregon is located to the south of Washington.


      3. **Specific county locations**: Coos County in Oregon is on the southern coast
      of Oregon, near the California border but still north of it. Clallam County
      in Washington is on the northern coast of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington,
      which places it north of Coos County''s latitude.


      4. **West/East orientation**: Given that Coos County, OR, is south of Clallam
      County, WA, and considering the general geography of the region, we need to
      establish their longitudinal relationship. However, since they are both coastal
      counties, their east-west relationship can be inferred from their state positions
      and specific locations within those states.


      5. **Determine longitudinal relationship**: Coos County, being in southern Oregon,
      is generally west of Clallam County, WA, due to the Pacific coastline running
      north-south and the fact that Oregon is directly south of Washington. However,
      the exact west-east relationship depends on their specific longitudes.


      6. **Conclusion based on geography**: Given that both counties are coastal,
      Coos County, OR, would indeed be west or very close to the same longitude as
      Clallam County, WA, considering the states'' border runs in a somewhat diagonal
      fashion from southwest to northeast. However, since Clallam County is on the
      Olympic Peninsula, which extends westward into the Pacific, it''s essential
      to consider the peninsula''s westward extension.


      Considering these steps, the question of whether Coos County, OR, is west of
      Clallam County, WA, can be resolved by understanding that Clallam County extends
      further west due to the Olympic Peninsula''s geography. Therefore, Coos County,
      OR, cannot be west of Clallam County, WA, given the peninsula''s westward reach
      into the Pacific Ocean.


      The answer is: NO.'

      1. **Identify the locations**: Coos County is in the state of Oregon (OR), and
      Clallam County is in the state of Washington (WA).


      2. **Understand the geography**: Oregon and Washington are adjacent states in
      the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Oregon is located south of
      Washington.


      3. **Specific county locations**: Coos County in Oregon is on the coast, relatively
      in the southwestern part of the state. Clallam County in Washington is also
      on the coast but is located in the northwestern part of the state, near the
      Olympic Peninsula.


      4. **Compare longitudes**: To determine if one is west of the other, we need
      to compare their longitudes. However, given the geographical layout, we must
      consider their positions relative to each other rather than just their longitudes,
      as their latitudes (north-south positions) also play a role in their overall
      positioning.


      5. **Relative positions**: Clallam County, WA, is north of Coos County, OR.
      Considering the coastline of the Pacific Northwest, moving north along the coast
      from Oregon into Washington means you are not moving west in terms of longitude
      but rather north in terms of latitude.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given that Coos County, OR, is south of Clallam County, WA,
      and considering the general westward direction of the coastline in this region
      does not significantly alter the fact that Coos County is not west of Clallam
      County in a geographical sense relevant to this question, we can conclude that
      Coos County, OR, is not west of Clallam County, WA.

      from Calvert County to Anne Arundel County involves moving northward rather
      than westward. The Chesapeake Bay runs along the eastern edge of both counties,
      and the general layout of Maryland''s counties along the bay is more north-south
      than east-west.

      is located west of Calvert County, MD, we need to consider the geographical
      positions of these two counties.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to know where both counties are located.
      Anne Arundel County is situated in the central part of Maryland, surrounding
      the city of Annapolis, which is its county seat. Calvert County is located in
      the southern part of Maryland, along the Chesapeake Bay''s western shore.


      2. **Compare Positions**: Next, we compare their positions relative to each
      other. Anne Arundel County is north of Calvert County because Annapolis (the
      capital of Maryland and within Anne Arundel County) is north of the areas typically
      considered part of Calvert County.


      3. **East-West Orientation**: Considering the east-west orientation, the Chesapeake
      Bay plays a significant role in Maryland''s geography, dividing the state. Both
      counties border the Chesapeake Bay, but Anne Arundel County is on the western
      side of the bay, and so is Calvert County.


      4. **Determine Westward Position**: Given that both counties border the western
      shore of the Chesapeake Bay and considering their north-south alignment, the

      west of Sheboygan County, WI, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Ozaukee County and Sheboygan County are both
      in the state of Wisconsin, USA.

      2. **Understand geographic directions**: West means the direction to the left
      when facing north.

      3. **Research or recall the geography of Wisconsin**: Knowing the general layout
      of Wisconsin counties is necessary. Ozaukee County is known to be located in
      the southeastern part of the state, near Milwaukee. Sheboygan County is also
      in the eastern part of Wisconsin but is situated north of Ozaukee County.

      4. **Compare the locations**: Given that Ozaukee County is southeast and Sheboygan
      County is northeast of each other (with Ozaukee being more south and Sheboygan
      more north), we can deduce their relative positions.

      5. **Conclusion**: If Ozaukee County is more to the south and Sheboygan County
      is more to the north, and considering their relative east-west positions, Ozaukee
      County is not west of Sheboygan County; it''s more to the south.

      1. **Identify the locations**: New Castle County is in the state of Delaware,
      and Accomack County is in the state of Virginia.


      2. **Understand geographic directions**: West means the direction to the left
      on a map when facing north. If one location is west of another, it means the
      first location is to the left (or more towards the setting sun) of the second
      when looking at a map.


      3. **Consider the general geography of the region**: Delaware is generally east
      of Virginia when looking at a map of the eastern United States. However, the
      specific locations of counties within these states can vary significantly.


      4. **Look at the specific counties**: New Castle County, DE, is in the northern

      Delaware (DE), and Accomack County is located in the state of Virginia (VA).


      2. **General geography of the area**: Delaware is generally east of Virginia,
      with the Delaware River and Bay forming part of the border between Delaware
      and the states to its west, including parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania,
      but not directly with Virginia.


      3. **Specific county locations**: New Castle County is in the northern part
      of Delaware, bordering Pennsylvania to the north, New Jersey to the northeast
      (across the Delaware River), and Maryland (specifically Cecil County) to the
      west and southwest. Accomack County is on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, which
      means it is part of the peninsula that includes the Delmarva Peninsula (shared
      by Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia).


      4. **Relative positions**: Given that New Castle County, DE, is part of the
      Delmarva Peninsula, as is Accomack County, VA, we need to consider their positions
      relative to each other. The Delmarva Peninsula stretches north-south, with Delaware
      in the north and Virginia''s Eastern Shore to the south. New Castle County is
      in the northern part of this peninsula, and Accomack County is further south
      within Virginia.


      5. **East-west orientation**: Considering the east-west orientation, since both
      counties are part of the Delmarva Peninsula, the key factor is their north-south
      positioning rather than east-west. However, to directly address the question:
      New Castle County, being in Delaware, is generally east of the areas west of
      the Delmarva Peninsula, which would include parts of Virginia not on the Eastern
      Shore. But in the context of the Delmarva Peninsula itself, "west" would refer
      to the western side of the peninsula, and "east" to the eastern side, with the
      Chesapeake Bay to the west of Accomack County and the Atlantic Ocean to the
      east.


      6. **Conclusion based on geography**: Given the geography and relative positions,
      New Castle County, DE, is not west of Accomack County, VA. Instead, it is generally
      north and possibly slightly east due to the peninsula''s shape and orientation.

      Shore of Virginia, which is the part of Virginia that is separated from the
      rest of the state by the Chesapeake Bay. It is situated on the Delmarva Peninsula,
      which is shared by Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia.

      5. **Relative positions**: Since both counties are on the Delmarva Peninsula,
      their relative east-west positions need to be determined. New Castle County
      is in the northern part of the peninsula, and Accomack County is to the south,
      in Virginia. Given the geography of the Delmarva Peninsula, moving from Delaware

      1. **Identify the locations**: Vilas County is in Wisconsin, and Tazewell County

      2. **General geography of the states**: Wisconsin is generally north of Illinois.

      3. **Specific locations within the states**: Vilas County, WI, is in the northern
      part of Wisconsin, near the Michigan border. Tazewell County, IL, is in the
      central part of Illinois.

      4. **Compare longitudes**: To determine if one is west of the other, we need
      to compare their longitudes. Without exact longitudes, we know that Wisconsin
      is east of Illinois in general terms because Illinois is part of the western
      edge of the Eastern Time Zone, and Wisconsin is fully within the Central Time
      Zone, which would place parts of Wisconsin east of parts of Illinois, depending
      on the specific locations.

      5. **Consider the geography of the Great Lakes region**: The Great Lakes, including
      Lake Michigan, form part of the border between Wisconsin and Illinois (specifically,
      Lake Michigan is to the east of both states). Given Vilas County''s northern
      location in Wisconsin, it is likely to be north and possibly east of Tazewell
      County, IL, rather than west.


      Given these considerations, without needing the precise longitudes, we can infer
      based on the general geography of the region that Vilas County, WI, is not west
      of Tazewell County, IL. It''s more likely north or northeast due to Wisconsin''s

      located west of Platte County, MO, let''s consider the geographical locations
      of both counties.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Andrew County is located in the northwestern
      part of Missouri.

      2. **Compare with Platte County**: Platte County is also in the northwestern
      part of Missouri but is situated closer to Kansas City, which places it more
      to the east when compared to the positioning of Andrew County.

      3. **Determine the relationship**: Given that Andrew County is further northwest
      compared to Platte County, which is more to the east (towards Kansas City),
      Andrew County would indeed be west of Platte County.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is: **YES**'
    5fe064ba-0fca-4b06-85ae-6482f41432bc: 'To determine if Andrew County, MO is located
      west of Platte County, MO, we need to consider the geographical locations of
      both counties within Missouri.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Andrew County is located in the northwestern
      part of Missouri. Platte County is also in the northwestern part of the state
      but is closer to the Kansas City metropolitan area, which is near the western
      border of Missouri but more to the central part when considering the entire
      state''s width from east to west.


      2. **Compare their positions**: Given that both counties are in the northwestern
      part of Missouri, their relative positions need to be considered. Andrew County
      is situated such that it is directly north of Platte County, not directly west
      or east, as both are fairly close to the Missouri River, which forms part of
      the state''s border with Kansas to the west.


      3. **Determine westward position**: Since Andrew County is north of Platte County,
      and considering the layout of Missouri''s counties, being north does not necessarily
      mean being west, especially in this context where the counties are relatively
      close to each other and both are considered part of the northwestern region
      of the state.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the geographic relationship between Andrew County and
      Platte County, with Andrew County being to the north and not in a direct westward
      position relative to Platte County, we can conclude the answer based on their
      spatial arrangement.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$'

      of the state, and Platte County is also in the northwest but closer to Kansas

      and slightly east, it indicates that Andrew County is not directly west of Platte
      County.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Andrew County, MO is located west

      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know the geographical locations

      2. **Compare their positions**: Once we have their locations, we can compare
      their positions relative to each other, specifically focusing on their east-west
      alignment.


      3. **Use geographical references**: Knowing that Missouri is divided into counties,
      each with its unique position within the state, we can use maps or geographical
      data to determine the relative positions of Andrew and Platte counties.


      4. **Apply directional knowledge**: Understanding the cardinal directions (north,
      south, east, west), we can determine if one county is indeed west of the other
      by comparing their longitudinal positions (since east-west alignment is what''s
      in question).


      Given these steps, let''s apply them:


      - Andrew County is located in the northwestern part of Missouri.

      - Platte County is also in the northwestern part of Missouri but is situated
      closer to the Kansas City metropolitan area, which is east of the northwestern
      corner of the state.


      Considering their relative positions:

      - Andrew County is farther north and slightly west compared to Platte County,
      which is more southeast in relation to Andrew County, especially considering
      the layout of counties in northwestern Missouri.


      Therefore, based on their geographical locations within Missouri, Andrew County
      is indeed located west of Platte County.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Caldwell Parish is located in the state of Louisiana
      (LA), and Fillmore County is located in the state of Minnesota (MN).


      2. **General geography of the United States**: Louisiana is located in the southeastern
      part of the United States, while Minnesota is located in the northern central
      part of the country, often considered part of the Midwest.


      3. **Relative positions of Louisiana and Minnesota**: Louisiana is generally
      southeast of Minnesota. This means that Louisiana is to the east and south of
      Minnesota, in a broad geographical sense.


      4. **Specific locations - Caldwell Parish, LA, and Fillmore County, MN**: Without
      needing the exact positions, knowing that Louisiana is to the southeast of Minnesota
      gives us a general idea. However, to accurately determine if Caldwell Parish
      is west of Fillmore County, we consider the general east-west line that would
      separate these two states.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Louisiana (where Caldwell Parish is located) is
      generally to the southeast of Minnesota (where Fillmore County is located),
      and considering the overall geography, Caldwell Parish, LA, is not west of Fillmore
      County, MN. The direction from Minnesota to Louisiana is generally southeast,
      meaning Louisiana is east (and south) of Minnesota, not west.

      2. Next, consider the general geography of the United States. Minnesota is located
      in the northern part of the United States, often considered part of the Midwest,
      while Louisiana is in the southeastern part of the country.

    b6a52c92-d2ad-49fe-829f-4f8a2bf842e2: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Gratiot
      County and Hillsdale County in Michigan.


      2. **Gratiot County Location**: Gratiot County is located in the central part
      of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula.


      3. **Hillsdale County Location**: Hillsdale County is situated in the southern
      part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula.


      4. **Relative Positions**: To determine if Gratiot County is west of Hillsdale
      County, we need to consider their relative positions. Generally, in the United
      States, when moving from east to west, you are heading towards the setting sun.


      5. **Michigan Geography**: Michigan''s geography is such that the western part
      of the state is closer to Lake Michigan, while the eastern part is closer to
      Lake Erie and the Detroit area.


      6. **County Comparison**: Comparing the two counties, Gratiot County is more
      central and slightly north compared to Hillsdale County, which is in the southern
      part of the state.


      7. **Final Determination**: Considering the geographic layout of Michigan and
      the positions of these counties, Gratiot County, being more central and to the
      north of Hillsdale County, is indeed west of Hillsdale County because Hillsdale
      County is located in the southeastern part of the Lower Peninsula.


      Based on these steps, the answer is: **YES**'

      3. **Determine east-west relationship**: To determine if Goodhue County, MN
      is west of Conway County, AR, we need to consider the general east-west alignment
      of these states. Arkansas is generally east of Minnesota when considering their
      overall geographical positions within the United States.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Minnesota is to the northwest of Arkansas, and
      considering the specific locations of Goodhue County, MN, and Conway County,
      AR, Goodhue County would indeed be northwest of Conway County. Since northwest
      includes a western component, we can infer that Goodhue County is indeed west
      of Conway County, considering their relative positions on a map.

    ff4caea9-a9f6-47cc-b45a-ff5d60d4ec30: 'To determine if McDonald County, MO is
      located west of Jackson County, MO, we need to consider the geographical location
      of both counties within the state of Missouri.


      1. **Identify the locations**: McDonald County is located in the southwestern
      part of Missouri, near the borders with Oklahoma and Arkansas. Jackson County,
      on the other hand, is situated in the western part of Missouri but is more central-west,
      containing Kansas City, a major city in the state.


      2. **Compare their positions**: Given that McDonald County is in the southwest
      and Jackson County is more to the central-west but still considered west within
      the state, we must determine their relative positions to each other.


      3. **Determine the direction**: If McDonald County is southwest and Jackson
      County is central-west, then McDonald County would actually be south of Jackson
      County rather than strictly west. However, the question asks if McDonald County
      is located west of Jackson County, not strictly west but in a general directional
      sense considering their positions in the state.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Jackson County is more central-west and McDonald
      County is southwest, McDonald County is not west of Jackson County in a geographical
      sense but rather more to the south.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$'

      locations of Lynchburg City and Amherst County in Virginia.


      1. **Identify Locations**: Lynchburg City is an independent city located in
      the central part of Virginia. Amherst County is also situated in central Virginia,
      surrounding but not including Lynchburg City.


      2. **Relative Positions**: Knowing that both are in central Virginia, we need
      to determine their relative positions. Lynchburg City is essentially nestled
      within the area that would be Amherst County if the city were part of it, but
      since Lynchburg is an independent city, it''s not part of Amherst County.


      3. **Directional Relationship**: To determine if Lynchburg City is west of Amherst
      County, we must consider their geographical relationship. Lynchburg City is
      actually surrounded by Amherst County to some extent, but specifically, it is
      located to the east of the majority of Amherst County, not west. However, parts
      of Amherst County do extend westward of Lynchburg City. The key consideration
      is the primary or central area of each entity in relation to the other.


      Given these considerations, the direct answer to whether Lynchburg City is located
      west of Amherst County, VA, requires understanding that while parts of Amherst
      County may extend in various directions around Lynchburg City, the central or
      main part of Lynchburg City is generally not west of the main part of Amherst
      County but rather more to the east or within the area that would be considered
      Amherst County if Lynchburg were not an independent city.


      Therefore, based on the general geographical relationship and considering the
      central or main parts of these entities: **NO**.'

      1. **Identify Locations**: Lynchburg City is an independent city in the Commonwealth
      of Virginia. Amherst County is also located in Virginia, surrounding but not
      including Lynchburg City.


      2. **Relative Positions**: Knowing that Lynchburg City is not part of Amherst
      County but is surrounded by it gives us a clue about their relative positions.
      However, to determine if Lynchburg City is west of Amherst County, we need to
      consider their geographical layout.


      3. **Geographical Layout**: Amherst County surrounds Lynchburg City on three
      sides (north, east, and south), with the Blue Ridge Mountains and other counties
      to the west of Lynchburg. This indicates that Lynchburg City is actually nestled
      within Amherst County to its east, given the county''s broader geographical
      span.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Lynchburg City is essentially enclosed by Amherst
      County on its eastern, northern, and southern sides, it suggests that Lynchburg
      City cannot be west of Amherst County. Instead, it is more to the east within
      the context of Amherst County''s boundaries.

      County, NJ, and Cape May County, NJ. Hunterdon County is located in the western
      part of New Jersey, while Cape May County is at the southern tip of New Jersey.


      2. **Understand Geographic Directions**: To determine if Hunterdon County is
      west of Cape May County, we must understand the geographic layout of New Jersey.
      The state is generally oriented with its southern part being more easterly (towards
      the Atlantic Ocean) and its western part bordering Pennsylvania.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Cape May County is situated at the southernmost end
      of New Jersey, directly adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean. Given New Jersey''s
      shape, moving west from Cape May County would mean moving inland and towards
      the Pennsylvania border. Hunterdon County is indeed more inland compared to
      Cape May County, which is directly on the coast.


      4. **Determine Direction**: Since Hunterdon County is located more inland and
      is positioned in a way that it is to the northwest of Cape May County when looking
      at a map of New Jersey, we can conclude that Hunterdon County is indeed west
      (and slightly north) of Cape May County.

      2. **Consider their positions**: Maricopa County is where Phoenix, the state
      capital, is located. It''s in the south-central part of Arizona.

      3. **Yavapai County''s position**: Yavapai County is north of Maricopa County,
      as it includes parts of the Prescott National Forest and the city of Prescott,
      which is known to be northwest of Phoenix.

      4. **Determine the direction**: Since Yavapai County is to the northwest of
      Maricopa County, it means that Yavapai County is indeed west (and also north)
      of Maricopa County.


      Given the steps above, the answer to whether Yavapai County, AZ is located west
      of Maricopa County, AZ is: **YES**.'
    944d6b03-7c5a-4174-b1cd-b385b93203a1: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to identify the locations of Yavapai
      County and Maricopa County in Arizona.

      2. **Determine geographical positions**: Understand the geographical layout
      of Arizona to place these counties in relation to each other.

      3. **Compare positions**: Compare the positions of Yavapai County and Maricopa
      County to determine if Yavapai County is west of Maricopa County.


      Now, let''s apply these steps:

      - Yavapai County is located in the central part of Arizona.

      - Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, the capital city of Arizona, is also
      in the central part of Arizona but is situated more to the south and slightly
      to the east of Yavapai County.

      - Given their positions, Yavapai County is generally north and slightly west
      of Maricopa County, but the question asks specifically if Yavapai County is
      west of Maricopa County.


      Considering the geography, while Yavapai County is more to the north, it is
      not entirely west of Maricopa County. However, parts of Yavapai County might
      extend further west than the western boundary of Maricopa County, but overall,
      Yavapai County is more north than west in relation to Maricopa County.


      Given the question''s framing and the general geographical relationship, the
      answer leans towards the fact that Yavapai County is not directly west of Maricopa
      County but rather north and slightly west in some areas. However, the direct
      answer to the question based on the primary geographical relationship (north-south)
      rather than the east-west axis would be:


      NO'
    ac2ee7bf-6a58-438c-9144-d0f0b6959ab0: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps needed to determine if Yavapai County, AZ is located west of Maricopa
      County, AZ.


      1. **Identify the locations of both counties**: Yavapai County and Maricopa
      County are both located in the state of Arizona.


      2. **Determine their relative positions**: To understand if Yavapai County is
      west of Maricopa County, we need to consider their geographical locations within
      Arizona. Maricopa County is where the state capital, Phoenix, is located, which
      is in the south-central part of Arizona.


      3. **Specific location of Yavapai County**: Yavapai County is situated in the
      central part of Arizona but is north of Maricopa County. It includes cities
      like Prescott, which is known for being the former capital of Arizona.


      4. **Compare their longitudinal positions (east-west orientation)**: Since both
      counties are in the central part of Arizona, we need to compare their longitudinal
      positions. Maricopa County, being in the south-central part, is relatively central
      in terms of east-west positioning within the state. Yavapai County, being north
      of Maricopa, would generally be at a similar longitude but could be slightly
      to the west or east depending on the specific areas within the counties.


      5. **Conclusion based on geographical data**: Given that Yavapai County is primarily
      north of Maricopa County and considering Arizona''s geography, Yavapai County
      is not distinctly west of Maricopa County. The counties'' positions relative
      to each other are more north-south than east-west.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Yavapai County, AZ is located west of Maricopa
      County, AZ is: **NO**.'

      1. **Identify the locations**: Yavapai County and Maricopa County are both located
      in the state of Arizona, USA.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: West means the direction to the left
      when facing north. So, if Yavapai County is west of Maricopa County, it should
      be to the left (or more towards the west) when looking at a map of Arizona.


      3. **Consider the map of Arizona**: Arizona''s map shows that Maricopa County,
      where Phoenix (the capital of Arizona) is located, is more central in the southern
      part of the state. Yavapai County is located north of Maricopa County.


      4. **Determine the relative positions**: Knowing that Yavapai County is north
      of Maricopa County doesn''t directly answer the question since north and south
      are perpendicular to east and west. However, considering Arizona''s geography,
      moving north from Maricopa County would generally mean moving away from the
      eastern part of the state towards a more western or northwestern part, depending
      on the specific location.


      5. **Specific locations of Yavapai and Maricopa Counties**: Yavapai County is
      situated northwest of Maricopa County. The northwest direction implies both
      north and west of Maricopa County.

      \ Dakota is located in the northern United States, part of the Midwest or Great\
      \ Plains region. Oklahoma is situated to the south, also in the Great Plains\
      \ but further southeast.\n3. **Relative positions of SD and OK**: South Dakota\
      \ is north and somewhat west of Oklahoma. However, the exact positions of the\
      \ counties within these states also depend on their specific locations.\n4.\
      \ **County locations**:\n   - **Hand County, SD**: It is in the central part\
      \ of South Dakota.\n   - **Custer County, OK**: It is in western Oklahoma.\n\
      5. **Comparison**: Given that Hand County, SD, is in the central part of South\
      \ Dakota and Custer County, OK, is in western Oklahoma, we must consider the\
      \ general westward position of South Dakota relative to Oklahoma. However, since\
      \ Custer County is in western Oklahoma, and Hand County is central in South\
      \ Dakota, the key factor is how far west Custer County extends compared to Hand\
      \ County's east-west position in South Dakota.\n6. **Geographical reference**:\
      \ Knowing that the Great Plains stretch across both states and that South Dakota\
      \ is generally to the north and slightly west of Oklahoma, it's crucial to understand\
      \ that \"west\" in this context might not directly apply due to the states'\
      \ overall positions. However, given the central positioning of Hand County within\
      \ South Dakota and considering the geography, Hand County would still be north\
      \ and could be either east or west of Custer County, OK, depending on the exact\
      \ longitudes.\n7. **Final determination**: Given that Hand County, SD, is more\
      \ north than Custer County, OK, and considering the general geography, to determine\
      \ if it's west, we need to think about the longitude. Custer County, OK, is\
      \ at a longitude that is more west than many parts of South Dakota, but since\
      \ Hand County is central, it might not extend as far west as western Oklahoma.\n\
      \nGiven the steps above and without exact longitude comparisons, the general\
      \ geography suggests that while South Dakota is north of Oklahoma, the westernmost\
      \ part of Oklahoma (where Custer County is located) could indeed be west of\
      \ the central part of South Dakota (where Hand County is located). Thus, considering\
      \ the longitude and general geography:\n\nThe answer is: NO"
    eb80069d-eed2-4092-8e9a-dc6bf14124ce: "To answer this question, let's break down\
      \ the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations\
      \ of Hand County, SD, and Custer County, OK. Hand County is located in the state\
      \ of South Dakota, and Custer County is located in the state of Oklahoma.\n\n\
      2. **Understand Geographic Relations**: Next, we need to understand the general\
      \ geographic layout of the United States. South Dakota is located in the northern\
      \ part of the United States, considered part of the Midwest or the Great Plains\
      \ region. Oklahoma is located south of South Dakota, more centrally in the U.S.\
      \ but definitely to the south.\n\n3. **Determine Direction**: Given the states'\
      \ positions, South Dakota is north of Oklahoma. However, the question asks about\
      \ the location relative to \"west,\" so we need to consider the east-west orientation\
      \ as well. \n\n4. **Specific County Locations**: Without specific knowledge\
      \ of the exact positions of Hand County, SD, and Custer County, OK, we might\
      \ initially think we need detailed maps. However, understanding that the question\
      \ is about whether one is west of the other helps simplify our approach. We\
      \ know that for Hand County, SD, to be west of Custer County, OK, it would generally\
      \ need to be in a longitude (east-west position) that is to the west of Custer\
      \ County, OK.\n\n5. **State Boundaries and Longitude**: South Dakota and Oklahoma\
      \ are both relatively far apart in terms of longitude and latitude. Oklahoma\
      \ is generally east of South Dakota because South Dakota is part of the region\
      \ that includes the western Great Plains and extends into the Mountain time\
      \ zone, while Oklahoma is in the south-central United States, more to the east.\n\
      \n6. **Conclusion Based on State Positions**: Given that South Dakota as a whole\
      \ is generally west of Oklahoma, it's reasonable to deduce that Hand County,\
      \ SD, would be west of Custer County, OK, without needing the exact county boundaries\
      \ or longitudes.\n\nTherefore, considering the general geography of the United\

      1. **Identify the locations**: Pemiscot County is in Missouri (MO), and Peoria
      County is in Illinois (IL).

      2. **Understand the geography**: Missouri is located west of Illinois.

      3. **Consider the specific counties**: Since Missouri is west of Illinois, any
      county in Missouri would generally be west of any county in Illinois, assuming
      no extreme eastern or western outliers that might reverse this general trend.

      4. **Specific county locations**: Pemiscot County, MO, is in the southeastern
      part of Missouri, and Peoria County, IL, is in the central part of Illinois.
      Given their positions within their states, Pemiscot County is still west of
      Peoria County due to the overall west-east alignment of the two states.


      Given these considerations, the answer to whether Pemiscot County, MO, is located
      west of Peoria County, IL, is: **YES**.'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Pemiscot County is located in the state of Missouri
      (MO), and Peoria County is located in the state of Illinois (IL).


      2. **Understand the geography of the United States**: Missouri is located west
      of Illinois. This is a general geographical fact about the positions of these
      two states in the United States.


      3. **Consider the specific locations of the counties**: While Missouri as a
      whole is west of Illinois, the specific locations of Pemiscot County in Missouri
      and Peoria County in Illinois need to be considered. Pemiscot County is in the
      southeastern part of Missouri, and Peoria County is in the central part of Illinois.


      4. **Compare the longitudinal positions**: Even though Pemiscot County is in
      the southeastern part of Missouri, which might suggest it could be relatively
      close to the eastern border of the state, Missouri''s eastern border is the
      Mississippi River, which also forms the western border of Illinois. Given the
      geography, southeastern Missouri is still west of central Illinois.


      Based on these steps, since Pemiscot County, MO is in the state of Missouri,
      which is west of Illinois where Peoria County is located, and considering the
      counties'' positions relative to their respective state borders, the answer
      to whether Pemiscot County, MO is located west of Peoria County, IL is:

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Pemiscot County is located in the state of Missouri
      (MO), and Peoria County is located in the state of Illinois (IL).


      2. **Determine the general geography**: Missouri is located west of Illinois.
      This is a general geographical fact about the positioning of these two states
      in the United States.


      3. **Consider county positions within states**: Since Pemiscot County is in
      Missouri and Peoria County is in Illinois, and Missouri is west of Illinois,
      we need to consider the specific locations of these counties within their respective
      states to understand their relative positions to each other.


      4. **Specific locations of the counties**: Pemiscot County is in the southeastern
      part of Missouri, and Peoria County is in the central part of Illinois. Given
      the general westward position of Missouri relative to Illinois, the fact that
      Pemiscot County is in the southeast of Missouri and Peoria County is in central
      Illinois means we must consider their exact longitudes to determine if Pemiscot
      County is indeed west of Peoria County.


      5. **Longitudinal comparison**: Without exact longitude values, we can reason
      generally. If Pemiscot County, being in the southeast of Missouri, extends eastward
      to a point where it is near or beyond the eastern edge of Missouri, and considering
      Peoria County''s central position in Illinois, there''s a possibility that parts
      of Pemiscot County could be at a similar longitude or even slightly east of
      Peoria County, depending on their exact positions.


      6. **Conclusion based on geography**: Given that Missouri is generally west
      of Illinois, but considering the specific locations within those states (Pemiscot
      County in southeastern Missouri and Peoria County in central Illinois), it''s
      plausible that Pemiscot County could be at a similar longitude or slightly east
      of Peoria County due to its southeastern position in Missouri. However, the
      general trend of Missouri being west of Illinois suggests that, on average,
      points in Missouri would be west of points in Illinois, but the exact positioning
      of these counties within their states can affect this.


      Given these considerations and without exact geographical coordinates, the most
      straightforward geographical reasoning would suggest that Pemiscot County, being
      in Missouri, is generally west of Peoria County in Illinois, considering the
      states'' overall positions. However, the detailed analysis reveals nuances based
      on the counties'' specific locations within their states.

      located west of Waukesha County, WI, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Itawamba County is in Mississippi (MS), and Waukesha
      County is in Wisconsin (WI).


      2. **General geography of the United States**: Mississippi is generally considered
      to be in the southeastern part of the United States, while Wisconsin is in the
      northern part of the Midwest, which is more towards the east and north compared
      to Mississippi.


      3. **Compare longitudes**: Without needing the exact longitudes, we know that
      as you move west in the United States, you are moving towards areas that are
      generally at a higher longitude (if considering the traditional east-west axis
      in a simplified manner). However, in geographical terms, moving west means decreasing
      longitude when considering the prime meridian as a reference. Mississippi has
      a lower longitude (around 88-90 degrees West) compared to Wisconsin (around
      88 degrees West for the western part of the state), but overall, Wisconsin''s
      eastern edge is at a higher longitude than Mississippi''s eastern edge. However,
      for the purpose of comparing east-west positioning in the context of U.S. geography,
      we consider which state is farther to the east or west. Given the general layout
      of the U.S., Mississippi is to the southeast and Wisconsin is to the northeast.


      4. **Conclusion based on geography**: Since Mississippi is southeast and Wisconsin
      is northeast, Mississippi is generally south and slightly west of Wisconsin
      but more directly south than west in a broad geographical comparison.


      Given these considerations, Itawamba County, MS is indeed located south of Waukesha
      County, WI, but the question asks if it is west. Considering the general layout
      and without precise longitudes, Wisconsin is northeast of Mississippi, meaning
      Mississippi (and thus Itawamba County) is more to the south than the west of
      Wisconsin.


      Therefore, considering the broad geographical layout and typical understanding
      of U.S. state positions, the answer to whether Itawamba County, MS is located

      2. **Georgia County Map**: Refer to a map of Georgia''s counties to understand
      their relative positions.


      3. **Gordon County Location**: Gordon County is located in the northwestern
      part of Georgia.


      4. **Paulding County Location**: Paulding County is situated to the west of
      Atlanta and is considered part of the Atlanta metropolitan area, placing it
      more towards the central-west part of Georgia but east of the northwestern counties.


      5. **Comparison**: Considering their positions, Gordon County is more to the
      northwest, and Paulding County is more to the central west but closer to the
      eastern part of the state compared to Gordon County''s position.


      6. **Determine Westward Position**: Given that Gordon County is to the northwest
      and Paulding County is to the central west, Gordon County would indeed be located
      west and slightly north of Paulding County.


      Based on the steps and understanding of their relative positions within Georgia:


      The answer is: **YES**'

      is situated more northward, while Archuleta County is to the south.

      6. **Westward position**: Being "west" of another location means that the location

      \ Mexico.\n   - However, the question is about being \"west\" of Lea County,\

      \ longitude that is around 103\xB0 W as well, but since it's in southeastern\
      \ New Mexico, parts of it might be slightly east of 103\xB0 W.\n\nGiven these\

      \ north and Lea County, NM, is to its south and possibly slightly east due to\
      \ its southeastern position in New Mexico, Slope County is generally north of\
      \ Lea County. However, the question asks if it's west, not north.\n\nGiven the\
      \ similar longitudes and without precise longitudinal data for each county's\

      2. **Recall Texas geography**: Texas is a large state with a variety of landscapes,
      but for this question, we only need to consider the north-central part of the
      state where these counties are located.

      3. **Location of Hood County**: Hood County is situated in the north-central
      part of Texas. It is part of the Granbury, TX Micropolitan Statistical Area.

      4. **Location of Parker County**: Parker County is also in north-central Texas
      and is part of the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX Metropolitan Statistical
      Area. It is located just west of Tarrant County, where the city of Fort Worth
      is situated.

      5. **Compare locations**: Given their positions within the same general area
      of north-central Texas, to determine if Hood County is west of Parker County,
      we must consider their specific geographic positions relative to each other.

      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Vinton County and Licking County in Ohio.


      2. **Understand Geographic Directions**: West means the direction in which the
      sun sets, so for one county to be west of another, it must be positioned in
      such a way that if you move towards the setting sun from the reference county,
      you would reach the other county.


      3. **Ohio Map Reference**: Referencing a map of Ohio or knowledge about the
      state''s geography, we can find the approximate locations of these counties.


      4. **Vinton County Location**: Vinton County is situated in southeastern Ohio.


      5. **Licking County Location**: Licking County is located in central Ohio, more
      towards the eastern part of the central region.


      6. **Comparison**: Given that Vinton County is in southeastern Ohio and Licking
      County is more central but also somewhat eastern, we can infer their relative
      positions. Southeastern Ohio is generally east of central Ohio.


      7. **Conclusion**: Based on their positions within the state, Vinton County,
      being in the southeastern part, would not be west of Licking County, which is
      more central and slightly to the east of Vinton County''s general location.

      North Carolina. Scotland County is located in the southern part of North Carolina,

      2. **Determine the relative positions**: Knowing that North Carolina is generally

      2. **Understand geographical directions**: West means the direction to the left
      when facing north. So, if Breckinridge County, KY is west of Rutherford County,
      TN, it means Breckinridge County must be to the left (or more towards the west)
      when comparing their positions on a map.


      3. **Consider state locations**: Kentucky is generally west of Tennessee, but
      the specific locations of counties within these states can vary significantly.


      4. **Specific county locations**: Breckinridge County, KY is in the central
      part of Kentucky, closer to its western side. Rutherford County, TN is in the
      central part of Tennessee, but more towards the eastern side of the state.


      5. **Compare longitudes**: The longitude of a place is a measure of how far
      west (negative longitude values in the US) it is. The more negative the longitude,
      the further west a location is. Breckinridge County, KY has a longitude around
      -86.4 degrees west, and Rutherford County, TN has a longitude around -86.4 to
      -86.5 degrees west. Given these values are close, the specific locations within

      1. **Identify the locations of Breckinridge County, KY, and Rutherford County,
      TN**: Breckinridge County is located in the state of Kentucky, and Rutherford
      County is located in the state of Tennessee.


      2. **Understand the geographical layout of these states**: Kentucky is located
      west of Tennessee is not accurate in the context of these specific counties,
      as parts of Kentucky can be east of parts of Tennessee due to the irregular
      shapes of the states. However, generally speaking, Kentucky is north of Tennessee.


      3. **Determine the specific locations of these counties within their states**:
      Breckinridge County, KY, is in the north-central part of Kentucky. Rutherford
      County, TN, is in the central part of Tennessee.


      4. **Compare their relative positions**: Considering the general geography,
      Breckinridge County, KY, would be more north than west of Rutherford County,
      TN, because Kentucky is generally north of Tennessee. However, the question
      asks if Breckinridge County is west of Rutherford County.


      Given these steps, we can conclude based on the geographical positions:


      - Breckinridge County, KY, is north of Rutherford County, TN, but when considering
      east-west positioning, it''s essential to note that parts of Kentucky can extend
      westward beyond the easternmost parts of Tennessee. However, for these specific
      counties, Breckinridge County, KY, is not significantly west of Rutherford County,
      TN; it''s more accurately described as being north.


      Therefore, considering the direct question of whether Breckinridge County, KY,
      is located west of Rutherford County, TN, the answer would be **NO**, as it
      is more accurately described as being north rather than west.'

      1. **Identify the locations**: Ramsey County is located in the state of Minnesota
      (MN), and Natchitoches Parish is in the state of Louisiana (LA).


      2. **Understand geographic terms**: A county and a parish are both administrative
      divisions. In the United States, counties are found in most states, while parishes
      are exclusively used in Louisiana, reflecting its historical and cultural background.


      3. **Determine the general geographic positions of MN and LA**: Minnesota is
      in the northern United States, considered part of both the Midwest and the Western
      United States, depending on the context. Louisiana is in the southeastern United

      4. **Consider the relative east-west positions**: Generally, Louisiana (and
      thus Natchitoches Parish) is east of Minnesota (and thus Ramsey County). This
      is because as you move from the east coast of the United States towards the
      west, you would pass through states like Louisiana before reaching states like
      Minnesota.

      2. **Determine the general geographical positions of MN and LA**: Minnesota
      is situated in the northern United States, near the Canadian border, and is
      considered part of the Midwest region. Louisiana, on the other hand, is located

      3. **Consider the east-west positioning**: Generally, as you move from east
      to west in the United States, you would first encounter states along the Atlantic

      2. **Understand the geography**: Mississippi County, AR is located in the eastern
      part of Arkansas, near the Mississippi River, which forms the border between
      Arkansas and Mississippi to the east, and also borders Tennessee to the north
      and Missouri to the north but on the opposite side of the river.

      3. **Consider the states'' positions**: Arkansas is located west of the Mississippi

      of the Mississippi River but east of the majority of Arkansas and certainly
      east of Missouri, considering the overall geography.

      4. **Specific county locations**: Dunklin County, MO is in the southeastern
      part of Missouri. Given Missouri''s position relative to Arkansas and the fact
      that Dunklin County is in the southeast, it is closer to the Mississippi River
      and the border with Arkansas than the western parts of Missouri.

      5. **Direct comparison**: Since Mississippi County, AR is directly on the eastern

      1. **Identify the General Location**: First, we need to identify the general
      location of both counties within Michigan. Mackinac County is known to be located
      in the eastern part of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, given its proximity
      to the Mackinac Bridge, which connects the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of Michigan.


      2. **Kalkaska County Location**: Next, we need to determine the location of
      Kalkaska County. Kalkaska County is situated in the northern part of the Lower
      Peninsula of Michigan.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Since Kalkaska County is in the Lower Peninsula and
      Mackinac County is in the Upper Peninsula, and considering the general geography
      of Michigan, the Lower Peninsula extends westward from the eastern part of the
      state where the Upper Peninsula is located.


      4. **Determine Direction**: Given the above points, if we consider moving from
      Mackinac County (Upper Peninsula, more to the east) towards Kalkaska County
      (Lower Peninsula, more to the west relative to the Upper Peninsula), we are
      generally moving westward.

      separate these two peninsulas.

      3. **Locate Mackinac County**: Mackinac County is located in the Upper Peninsula

      2. **Location of St. Mary Parish**: St. Mary Parish is located in the southern
      part of Louisiana. It is one of the parishes that borders the Gulf of Mexico.


      3. **Location of West Feliciana Parish**: West Feliciana Parish is located in

      4. **Compare Locations**: To determine if St. Mary Parish is west of West Feliciana

      \ directly adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico.\n   - West Feliciana Parish is more\
      \ inland and to the north of Baton Rouge, which places it to the north and slightly\
      \ east of St. Mary Parish.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the relative positions,\
      \ St. Mary Parish is generally south of West Feliciana Parish. However, the\
      \ question is about whether St. Mary Parish is located west of West Feliciana\
      \ Parish.\n\nConsidering Louisiana's geography:\n- East and west distinctions\
      \ in Louisiana are less about absolute directional positioning and more about\
      \ relative positioning within the state.\n- St. Mary Parish, being south and\
      \ near the Gulf, and West Feliciana Parish being more north and inland, does\
      \ not directly answer the west/east question without considering their longitudinal\
      \ positions.\n\nHowever, knowing that Louisiana's parishes are laid out in a\
      \ way that their positions can be determined by their longitudinal and latitudinal\
      \ coordinates:\n- St. Mary Parish has a longitude that is roughly around 91.5\xB0\
      \ W.\n- West Feliciana Parish has a longitude that is roughly around 91.3\xB0\
      \ W to 91.4\xB0 W, depending on the specific location within the parish.\n\n\
      Given these longitudes, St. Mary Parish is actually west of West Feliciana Parish\
      \ because its longitude values are more western (larger numbers indicate a more\
      \ western position in the Western Hemisphere).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\
      \ **YES**"
