      eastern India. It is in the southern part of India.


      3. Colby is a city located in Clark County, Wisconsin, in the north-central
      part of the United States.


      4. These locations are on different continents - India and North America.


      5. More specifically, Koraput is in southern India, while Colby is in northern
      Wisconsin.


      6. The question is asking if Koraput is south of Colby.


      7. Since Koraput is actually located much further north of Colby (being on a
      different continent), the answer is:


      NO'

      1. First, I need to locate Lohardaga district

      - Lohardaga is a district in Jharkhand state, India

      - It is located in eastern India


      2. Next, I need to locate Zawiercie

      - Zawiercie is a town in southern Poland

      - It is located in the southern part of Poland


      3. Comparing their geographical locations

      - Lohardaga is in eastern India

      - Zawiercie is in southern Poland

      - These are in completely different continents (Asia and Europe)


      4. Considering their relative positions

      - They are not even in the same part of the world

      - It would not make sense to say one is "south" of the other


      5. Conclusion: I cannot definitively say that Lohardaga is south of Zawiercie.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'
