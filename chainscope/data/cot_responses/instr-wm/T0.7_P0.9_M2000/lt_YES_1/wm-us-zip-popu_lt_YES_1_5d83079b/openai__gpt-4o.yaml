      is less populous than 60487 in Illinois, we need to look up the population for
      each of these zip codes. Generally, this would involve checking the most recent
      census data or estimates for these areas.


      1. **Zip Code 75230, TX**: This is a zip code in Dallas, Texas. The area is
      known for being an affluent neighborhood, which typically means it might have
      a moderately high population density, depending on the area size.


      2. **Zip Code 60487, IL**: This is a zip code in Tinley Park, Illinois, a suburban
      area near Chicago. Tinley Park is a well-developed suburban area, which can
      also have a significant population.


      Without the specific population numbers from recent datasets, it''s challenging
      to definitively say which is more populous. However, based on general knowledge
      about these areas:


      - Dallas is a major city, and zip code 75230 includes parts of the city that
      are both residential and commercial.

      - Tinley Park is a suburban area, which may have a smaller population compared
      to a major urban area.


      Given these considerations, it''s likely that 75230, TX is more populous than
      60487, IL, but without exact numbers, this is speculative.

      in Washington, DC is less populous than 60187 in Wheaton, Illinois, we need
      to consider the following steps:


      1. **Research Population Data**: We need up-to-date population data for both
      zip codes. This information is generally available from sources like the U.S.
      Census Bureau or local data aggregators.


      2. **Compare Population Numbers**: Once we have the population figures for 20008
      and 60187, we can directly compare them.


      Given the available data up to 2023, it is known that:

      - 20008 is a zip code in Washington, DC, which includes neighborhoods like Cleveland
      Park and Woodley Park. These areas are generally residential and can have a
      moderate population density.

      - 60187 is in Wheaton, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, and suburban areas can
      vary greatly in population depending on their size and density.


      Without specific numbers at this moment, I can''t provide a concrete answer.
      However, historically, urban zip codes in Washington, DC might have smaller
      populations compared to suburban areas like those in Wheaton, IL, which often
      encompass larger residential areas.


      If we assume typical population trends, suburban areas might be less densely
      populated per square mile than urban ones, but can have a larger overall population
      if the area is extensive.


      **Conclusion**: While I can''t provide a definitive YES or NO without current
      data, historically, 60187 in Wheaton, IL might have a larger population than
      20008 in Washington, DC. However, this is a general assumption and should be
      verified with actual population figures for an accurate answer.'

      This involves accessing demographic data from a reliable source such as the
      U.S. Census Bureau or another database that provides population statistics for
      U.S. zip codes.


      Here are the steps to follow for reasoning through this:


      1. **Identify the Location**: Both 95826 and 95833 are zip codes located in
      Sacramento, California.


      2. **Gather Population Data**: Check the most recent population statistics for
      each zip code. This can usually be found through census data, city data websites,
      or demographic profiling services.


      3. **Compare the Populations**: Once the population figures for both zip codes
      are obtained, compare them to determine which one has a larger or smaller population.


      Without access to the current population data for these specific zip codes,
      I cannot definitively answer the question. However, if you have the data or
      can access it, you can use the steps above to reach a conclusion.

      to have lower population densities compared to urban areas, though this can
      also vary.


      3. **Comparative Analysis**: Detroit''s zip code 48213 is part of an urban area,
      which generally suggests a higher population density compared to a suburban
      area like 10567 in Cortlandt Manor, NY. However, confirming this requires specific

      Florida is less populous than 77498 in Texas, we need to consider the population
      of each zip code. Here are the steps to determine the answer:


      1. **Research Population for 33176, FL**: Look up the population statistics
      for the zip code 33176, which is located in Miami, Florida. This area includes
      neighborhoods such as Kendall.


      2. **Research Population for 77498, TX**: Look up the population statistics
      for the zip code 77498, which is located in Sugar Land, Texas. This area is
      part of the Houston metropolitan area.


      3. **Compare the Populations**: Once we have the population data for both zip
      codes, we can directly compare them to see which one is more populous.


      Since I cannot access real-time databases or conduct live research, you would
      need to obtain the latest population figures from a reliable source such as
      the U.S. Census Bureau or local demographic reports. However, I can provide
      a general understanding based on typical population sizes:


      - The Miami area is densely populated, and zip code 33176 is a well-established
      suburban area with a significant population.

      - Sugar Land, part of the Houston metro area, is also densely populated, and
      77498 is known to be a rapidly growing and populous area.


      Typically, both areas are known for relatively high populations, but specific
      numbers would be needed for an accurate comparison. You would need to verify
      the current population statistics for a definitive answer.


      Without the latest data, I cannot conclusively say YES or NO. Please refer to
      an updated demographic source for the most accurate comparison.'

      populations based on the academic year, but such areas can still have significant
      population numbers due to student residency.


      2. **Zip Code 74554, OK**: This zip code corresponds to Stigler, Oklahoma. Stigler
      is a small town in Oklahoma. Generally, small towns tend to have smaller populations
      compared to university areas, especially if the latter includes a large university
      campus.


      Based on typical characteristics, university areas like 47405 often have higher
      populations due to students and university staff compared to small towns such
