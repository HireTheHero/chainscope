    9dc3d2d9-5bd3-4383-aadc-2b79fe1327a0: 'Step 1: Identify the locations of the ZIP
      codes.

      - **50012, IA** is located in Ames, Iowa, and is associated with Iowa State
      University.

      - **20778, MD** is located in West River, Maryland, a more rural area in Anne
      Arundel County.


      Step 2: Consider population density.

      - Ames, IA, is home to Iowa State University, which means **50012 likely has
      a significant student population**.

      - West River, MD, is a smaller, less dense community.


      Step 3: Compare estimated populations.

      - **50012 (Ames, IA)** includes university housing and students, meaning it
      has a relatively high population.

      - **20778 (West River, MD)** is a small, rural area with a smaller population.


      Conclusion:

      - Since Ames, IA (50012) has a university and a much larger population base
      than West River, MD (20778), **50012 is more populous**.


      Final Answer: **NO** (50012, IA is NOT less populous than 20778, MD).'
