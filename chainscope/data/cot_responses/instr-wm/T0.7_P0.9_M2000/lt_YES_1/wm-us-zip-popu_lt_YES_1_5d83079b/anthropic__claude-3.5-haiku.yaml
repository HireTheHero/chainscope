      1. First, I''ll need to look up the population of the areas associated with
      these zip codes.


      2. 20008 is a zip code in Washington, DC, specifically covering parts of Northwest
      Washington, including neighborhoods like Cleveland Park and Woodley Park.


      3. 60187 is a zip code in Illinois, specifically covering parts of West Chicago

      1. First, I''ll look up the zip code 20008 in Washington, DC

      - This is a zip code in the Northwest quadrant of Washington, DC

      - It covers an area that includes wealthy neighborhoods like Cleveland Park
      and parts of American University Park

      - This is generally a residential area with relatively low population density


      2. Next, I''ll look up the zip code 60187 in Illinois

      - This is a zip code in the Chicago metropolitan area

      - Specifically, it covers parts of West Chicago in DuPage County

      - This is a suburban area that tends to have more dense residential development


      3. Population comparison

      - While I don''t have exact population figures for these specific zip codes,
      the suburban Illinois zip code is likely to have more residents than this particular
      DC zip code

      - Suburban areas often have more multi-unit housing and larger residential developments
      compared to the more spread-out, established neighborhoods in this part of DC


      4. Conclusion reasoning

      - Based on typical suburban vs. established urban neighborhood population patterns,
      the Illinois zip code is likely more populous


      Therefore, my answer is: YES (20008, DC is less populous than 60187, IL)'

      1. First, I''ll need to find the population of the area associated with zip
      code 77979 in Texas.


      2. Then, I''ll find the population of the area associated with zip code 11788
      in New York.


      3. Then I''ll compare their populations.


      4. Researching 77979, this appears to be a rural zip code in Colorado County,
      Texas. It seems to be a very sparsely populated area.


      5. Researching 11788, this is a zip code for Plainview, New York, located in
      Nassau County, which is part of Long Island and is a more densely populated
      suburban area.


      6. Given the urban vs. rural context, it''s highly likely that 11788 (NY) has
      a significantly larger population than 77979 (TX).


      Therefore, the answer is:


      YES'
