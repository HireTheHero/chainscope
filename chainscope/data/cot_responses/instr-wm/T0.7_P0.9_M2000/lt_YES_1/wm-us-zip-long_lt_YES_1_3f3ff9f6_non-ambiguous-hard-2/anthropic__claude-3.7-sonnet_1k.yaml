      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - Indiana (IN) is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New Jersey (NJ) is located on the East Coast of the United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, Indiana is definitely west of New Jersey.
      The United States generally has states arranged so that lower numbers are in
      the eastern part of the country and higher numbers in the western part.


      The zip codes themselves (46016 vs 08734) don''t tell us about the relative
      geographic positions directly - what matters is that one is in Indiana and one
      is in New Jersey.


      Since Indiana is west of New Jersey, 46016, IN is west of 08734, NJ.</think>To
      determine if 46016, IN is located west of 08734, NJ, I need to identify the

      - 46016 is in Indiana (IN)

      - 08734 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Recall the geographical positions of these states

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      - The eastern United States includes the East Coast, where New Jersey is located

      - The Midwest, including Indiana, is located west of the East Coast states


      Step 4: Make the determination

      - Since Indiana is geographically west of New Jersey, any location in Indiana
      (including 46016) would be west of any location in New Jersey (including 08734)


      YES, 46016, IN is located west of 08734, NJ.'

      The United States generally follows a pattern where smaller zip codes are in
      the eastern part of the country, and larger zip codes are in the western part.
      However, I shouldn''t rely solely on the zip code numbers themselves, as they
      don''t perfectly correlate with east-west positioning.


      I need to specifically determine:

      1. Where Indiana is located relative to New Jersey on the US map

      2. Whether this specific Indiana zip code is west of this specific New Jersey
      zip code


      The United States is arranged such that:

      - New Jersey is on the East Coast

      - Indiana is in the Midwest, significantly west of New Jersey


      Given the geography of the United States, any location in Indiana would be west
      of any location in New Jersey.


      Therefore, 46016, IN (which is in Indiana) is west of 08734, NJ (which is in
      New Jersey).</think># Is 46016, IN located west of 08734, NJ?


      I need to determine the geographic locations of these zip codes and compare

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 46016 is in Indiana (IN)

      - 08734 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Indiana is significantly west of New Jersey on the US map

      - All of Indiana is west of all of New Jersey


      Therefore, 46016, IN is definitely located west of 08734, NJ.


      YES'

      by step.


      The question asks if 67037, KS (Kansas) is located west of 55404, MN (Minnesota).


      To determine this, I need to know the relative geographic positions of these
      locations. In the United States, states that are "west" of others have lower
      longitude values (since longitude decreases as you move west in the Northern
      Hemisphere).


      First, let''s establish the states:

      - 67037 is in Kansas (KS)

      - 55404 is in Minnesota (MN)


      In terms of the general geography of the United States:

      - Kansas is located in the central part of the country

      - Minnesota is located in the upper Midwest


      Kansas is generally west and south of Minnesota. If you look at a map of the
      United States, Kansas is to the west of Minnesota. So, geographically speaking,
      locations in Kansas would typically be west of locations in Minnesota.


      The specific zip codes might matter for locations very close to state borders,
      but Kansas and Minnesota don''t share a border - Iowa and Missouri lie between
      them. The entire state of Kansas is west of Minnesota.


      So, 67037, KS is indeed west of 55404, MN.</think>I need to determine if 67037,
      KS is west of 55404, MN by comparing their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their general locations.

      - 67037 is in Kansas (KS)

      - 55404 is in Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Kansas is located in the central United States, while Minnesota is in the upper
      Midwest region.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Looking at a US map, Kansas is positioned to the west and somewhat south of
      Minnesota. The entire state of Kansas lies west of Minnesota, with Iowa and
      Missouri between them.


      Step 4: Make the determination based on state positions.

      Since 67037 is in Kansas, and 55404 is in Minnesota, and Kansas is entirely
      west of Minnesota, the zip code 67037 must be west of 55404.

      First, let''s identify the states:

      - 67037 is in Kansas (KS)

      - 55404 is in Minnesota (MN)


      In the United States, Kansas is generally west of Minnesota. Minnesota borders

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 49337 is in Michigan (MI)

      - 28607 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Let me think about the geographical locations of Michigan and North
      Carolina in the United States.

      - Michigan is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region

      - North Carolina is on the East Coast


      Step 3: When comparing east-west positions in the US, we need to consider longitudes.
      Places with smaller longitude values (more negative numbers in the Western Hemisphere)
      are further west.


      Step 4: Generally speaking, Michigan is west of North Carolina. Almost all of
      Michigan is west of almost all of North Carolina. Michigan is closer to the
      central part of the US, while North Carolina is on the eastern seaboard.


      Therefore, 49337, MI should be west of 28607, NC.</think>I need to determine

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States

      - North Carolina is located on the East Coast


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      - Michigan is generally located to the west of North Carolina

      - On a map of the United States, Michigan sits to the northwest of North Carolina

      - All of Michigan is west of all of North Carolina in terms of longitude


      Step 4: Conclusion about the specific zip codes

      - Since 49337 is in Michigan and 28607 is in North Carolina, and Michigan is

      The question asks if 76001, TX is located west of 45449, OH.


      In the United States, Texas is generally located west of Ohio. Texas is in the

      zip codes, but based on the general geography of the United States, Texas is
      west of Ohio.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of
      these two zip codes by considering their geographical locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 76001 is in Texas (TX)

      - 45449 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states

      - Texas is located in the southern/southwestern part of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/eastern part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      On a map of the United States, Texas is positioned to the west of Ohio. The
      entire state of Texas is west of the entire state of Ohio.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      Since 76001 is in Texas and 45449 is in Ohio, and Texas is west of Ohio, it
      follows that 76001, TX is west of 45449, OH.

      figure out the geographical locations of these two zip codes, and then determine

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 76001, TX is a zip code in Texas

      - 45449, OH is a zip code in Ohio


      Now, to determine if one is west of the other, I need to consider their relative
      positions on a map of the United States.


      Texas is located in the southwestern part of the United States, while Ohio is
      in the eastern part of the Midwest region.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Texas is significantly west of Ohio

      - All of Texas is west of all of Ohio

      - Therefore, any zip code in Texas (including 76001) would be west of any zip
      code in Ohio (including 45449)


      So 76001, TX would be located west of 45449, OH.</think>I''ll solve this step
      by step:


      Step 1: Identify the states for each zip code.

      - 76001 is in Texas (TX)

      - 45449 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of these states.

      - Texas is located in the southern central/southwestern United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/eastern part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - On a map of the United States, Texas is positioned significantly to the west
      of Ohio

      - All of Texas lies west of Ohio''s longitude


      Step 4: Since the zip code 76001 is in Texas, and 45449 is in Ohio, the Texas
      zip code must be west of the Ohio zip code.

      2) Let me think about the general geographic positions of these states:

      - Texas is in the southwestern part of the United States

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/eastern part of the United States

      - Kentucky (KY) is located in the east-central United States, but importantly,
      it is west of Pennsylvania


      Since Kentucky is west of Pennsylvania, any location in Kentucky would be west

      On a map of the United States, Kentucky is positioned to the west of Pennsylvania.
      The entire state of Kentucky lies west of Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Since the zip code 42431 is in Kentucky, and the zip code 18951 is in

      55904 is a zip code in Minnesota (MN).

      32579 is a zip code in Florida (FL).


      Generally speaking, Minnesota is located in the northern midwest part of the
      United States, while Florida is in the southeastern part. When comparing east-west
      positions (longitude):


      - Minnesota is generally west of Florida on a map of the United States.

      - Florida is on the eastern side of the country, extending into the Gulf of

      - Minnesota is more centrally located in the northern part of the country.

      - Minnesota is located in the upper Midwest region of the United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States

      - On a map of the US, Minnesota is positioned significantly west of Florida


      ## Step 3: Compare the specific zip codes

      While specific zip codes might vary in precise longitude within their states,
      the entire state of Minnesota lies west of Florida. Therefore, any Minnesota

      Specifically, I need to determine if 55904, MN is west of 32579, FL.


      The United States is oriented such that western locations have lower longitudes

      32579 is in Florida (FL). Florida is in the southeastern United States.


      Looking at a map of the US, Minnesota is generally west of Florida. The entirety

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes.

      - Minnesota is positioned significantly west of Florida on the U.S. map

      - All of Minnesota is geographically west of all of Florida

      Minnesota is in the northern part of the central United States, while Florida
      is in the southeastern corner of the United States.


      Step 3: Think about east-west positioning specifically.

      Minnesota is located in the Upper Midwest region of the United States, while
      Florida is in the southeastern corner of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning (longitude).

      Minnesota as a whole is significantly west of Florida. On a map of the United
      States, Minnesota is positioned much further to the west than Florida, which
      lies along the eastern seaboard.


      Step 4: Even accounting for specific locations within these states, the entire

      of 32579, FL, I need to find the locations of these zip codes and compare their
      longitudes.


      55904 is a zip code in Minnesota (MN).

      32579 is a zip code in Florida (FL).


      In the United States, locations further west have more negative longitudes (or
      larger negative numbers). So I need to see which location has the more western
      (more negative) longitude.


      Just from general US geography knowledge:

      - Minnesota is in the northern central part of the United States

      - Florida is in the southeastern part of the United States


      Generally speaking, Minnesota is west of Florida. But I need to be more precise
      about these specific zip codes.


      55904 is likely around Rochester, Minnesota, which is in the southeastern part
      of Minnesota.

      32579 is somewhere in Florida, likely in the northern part (panhandle) based
      on the zip code pattern.


      Even though 55904 is in the southeastern part of Minnesota, Minnesota as a whole
      is significantly west of Florida. The easternmost parts of Minnesota are still

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 55904 is in Minnesota (MN), which is in the north-central United States

      - 32579 is in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United States


      ## Step 2: Consider relative geographic positions

      - Minnesota is generally located west of Florida in the continental United States

      - Even the easternmost parts of Minnesota are typically west of the westernmost
      parts of Florida (the panhandle)


      ## Step 3: Specific zip code locations

      - 55904 is in Rochester, Minnesota, in the southeastern part of the state

      - 32579 is likely in the Florida panhandle (northwestern Florida)

      - Even though both are in the eastern parts of their respective states, Minnesota''s

      Let''s break this down:

      1. 17202 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      2. 11563 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      I need to determine which one is further west. Generally speaking, Pennsylvania
      is west of New York, but I need to be precise with these specific zip codes.


      17202 is likely in central or southern Pennsylvania, as PA zip codes generally

      compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 17202 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA), specifically in the Chambersburg
      area in the south-central part of the state.

      - 11563 is a zip code in New York (NY), located in Lynbrook on Long Island in
      the southeastern part of New York State.


      Step 2: Consider their relative geographical positions.

      - Pennsylvania is generally west of New York State.

      - More specifically, south-central Pennsylvania (where 17202 is) is west of
      Long Island (where 11563 is).

      - Long Island is at the far eastern portion of New York State, while Chambersburg
      is in the central region of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Draw the conclusion based on their coordinates.

      When comparing these specific locations, Chambersburg, PA (17202) is significantly
      west of Lynbrook, NY (11563) on Long Island.


      YES, 17202, PA is located west of 11563, NY.'

      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Identify the approximate geographical locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative east-west positioning


      In the US, zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the
      eastern part of the country and higher numbers are in the western part. However,
      this is not precise enough for comparing specific zip codes, especially when
      they''re in different states.


      For PA and NY, Pennsylvania is generally west of New York State. However, since
      PA is below NY, some eastern parts of PA could be east of western parts of NY.


      Specifically:

      - Zip codes starting with 172xx in PA are likely in the central/south-central
      part of Pennsylvania

      - Zip codes starting with 115xx in NY are likely in the eastern part of New
      York, possibly Long Island area


      Given that 115xx is in the eastern part of NY (likely Long Island), and 172xx
      is in central PA, it''s highly likely that 17202, PA is west of 11563, NY.</think>#
      Is 17202, PA located west of 11563, NY?


      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to understand the general locations of these zip codes.


      2) Zip code 17202 is in Pennsylvania (PA). Looking at its prefix (172), this
      would place it in the south-central region of Pennsylvania, likely in or near
      Chambersburg.


      3) Zip code 11563 is in New York (NY). The prefix 115 indicates it''s in Long
      Island, specifically in the Nassau County area.


      4) Geographically, Long Island is located on the far eastern side of New York
      state, extending into the Atlantic Ocean.


      5) Pennsylvania is positioned west of New York state, and particularly, any
      location in central Pennsylvania would be significantly west of Long Island.


      6) Therefore, Chambersburg, PA (17202) is definitely west of any Long Island
      location (11563).

      We need to determine if zip code 78229 in Texas (TX) is located west of zip
      code 46567 in Indiana (IN).


      In the United States, locations that are west have a larger longitude (going
      from west to east, longitude increases). Wait, that''s not right. In the US,
      locations that are west have a smaller (more negative) longitude, since longitude
      increases as you go eastward.


      So I need to determine:

      1. The approximate longitude of 78229, TX

      2. The approximate longitude of 46567, IN

      3. Compare them to see which is further west (has a smaller longitude value)


      Generally, Texas is located to the west of Indiana in the United States. Texas
      is in the south-central part of the US, while Indiana is in the Midwest/Great
      Lakes region. So it''s likely that a zip code in Texas would be west of a zip
      code in Indiana, but let''s think about where specifically these zip codes might
      be.


      Zip code 78229 is in TX. I believe this is in the San Antonio area, which is
      in central/south Texas.


      Zip code 46567 is in IN. I''m not sure exactly where in Indiana this is, but
      Indiana as a whole is much further east than Texas.

      77340 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      30342 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)


      Generally speaking, Texas is west of Georgia in the United States. But let me
      be more precise about these specific zip codes.


      77340 appears to be in Huntsville, Texas, which is in eastern Texas.

      30342 appears to be in Atlanta, Georgia, which is in the northern part of Georgia.


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - Places further west have smaller (more negative) longitude values

      - Places further east have larger (less negative or positive) longitude values
      for the western hemisphere


      Since Texas is west of Georgia in the United States, and these zip codes don''t
      appear to be unusual outliers, 77340 TX should be west of 30342 GA.


      So the answer would be YES, 77340 TX is located west of 30342 GA.</think>I need
      to determine whether the Texas zip code is west of the Georgia zip code by comparing
      their geographical positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 77340 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      - 30342 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - On a map of the US, Texas is positioned to the west of Georgia


      Step 3: More specifically, 77340 is in Huntsville, Texas (in the eastern part
      of Texas), while 30342 is in the Atlanta area of Georgia.


      Step 4: Even though 77340 is in eastern Texas, the entire state of Texas lies
      west of Georgia on the map of the United States. The westernmost point of Georgia
      is still east of the easternmost point of Texas.


      Therefore, YES, 77340, TX is located west of 30342, GA.'

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 77340, TX: This is in Texas

      - 30342, GA: This is in Georgia


      Now I need to think about the geographic positions of these states in the US:

      - Texas is in the southwestern part of the United States

      - Georgia is in the southeastern part of the United States


      When comparing east-west positioning (longitude), Texas is generally west of
      Georgia. The entire state of Texas is west of Georgia.

      30342.


      To be sure, I should think about specific locations within these states. 77340
      appears to be in the eastern part of Texas (Huntsville area), while 30342 would
      be in the Atlanta area of Georgia. Even eastern Texas is still west of Georgia

      - Texas is located in the southwestern United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes (east-west positioning).

      - All of Texas is west of Georgia on the US map

      - Even the easternmost parts of Texas are still west of the westernmost parts
      of Georgia


      Step 4: Specifically, 77340 is in Huntsville, TX (eastern Texas), and 30342
      is in Atlanta, GA area, but the geographic fact remains that eastern Texas is
      still west of Georgia.

      Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts in the United States.
      But I should verify this with the specific zip codes.


      18218 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA).

      01908 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA).


      Since Pennsylvania is located west of Massachusetts on the US map, it''s very
      likely that any location in Pennsylvania would be west of a location in Massachusetts.


      To confirm: Pennsylvania borders New York to its east, while Massachusetts is
      even further east than New York. So geographically, Pennsylvania is definitely
      west of Massachusetts.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Pennsylvania is located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, while
      Massachusetts is in the New England region in the northeastern part of the country.


      Step 3: Determine relative east-west positioning.

      On a map of the United States, Pennsylvania is positioned to the west of Massachusetts.
      The entire state of Pennsylvania lies west of Massachusetts.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 18218 is in Pennsylvania and 01908 is in Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania
      is west of Massachusetts, it follows that 18218, PA must be west of 01908, MA.

      On a US map, Pennsylvania is positioned to the west of Massachusetts. All of
      Pennsylvania lies west of Massachusetts.


      Step 4: Apply this relationship to the specific zip codes.

      Since 18218 is in Pennsylvania and 01908 is in Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania

      First, let''s identify what states these are in:

      - 18218, PA is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 01908, MA is in Massachusetts (MA)


      Geographically in the United States:

      - Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts

      - Massachusetts is on the east coast

      - Pennsylvania is inland from the east coast, to the west of Massachusetts

      - 18218 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 01908 is in Massachusetts (MA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic position of these states

      Pennsylvania is located west of Massachusetts on the US map. Massachusetts is
      on the eastern seaboard, while Pennsylvania is inland from the east coast.


      ## Step 3: Consider zip code patterns

      US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the eastern

      code 22407 in Virginia is west of zip code 11239 in New York.


      To solve this, I need to determine the approximate locations of these zip codes:


      1. 22407 is in Virginia (VA)

      2. 11239 is in New York (NY)


      In the US, Virginia is generally located south of New York, but I need to determine
      if 22407 is west of 11239.


      Let me think about the general numbering pattern of zip codes. The first digit
      of US zip codes tends to increase as you move east to west:

      - Zip codes starting with 0 are in the Northeast (New England)

      - Zip codes starting with 1 are in the Northeast (NY, parts of PA, etc.)

      - Zip codes starting with 2 are in the Mid-Atlantic region (VA, MD, DC, NC,
      SC, etc.)


      So since 22407 starts with 2 and 11239 starts with 1, that suggests 22407 would
      be south and potentially west of 11239. But I need to be more specific.


      More precisely:

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 22407 is in Virginia (VA), likely in the Fredericksburg area

      - 11239 is in New York (NY), likely in the New York City area (specifically
      Brooklyn)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia is south and west of New York

      - ZIP codes starting with "1" are generally in the northeastern states

      - ZIP codes starting with "2" typically cover mid-Atlantic states which are
      southwest of the northeast region


      ## Step 3: Make the east-west comparison

      When comparing these specific locations, Fredericksburg, VA (22407) is indeed
      west of Brooklyn, NY (11239). If you look at a map of the eastern United States,
      Virginia is positioned to the west of New York City.

      22407 is a ZIP code in Virginia (VA).

      11239 is a ZIP code in New York (NY).


      In the United States, ZIP codes generally increase as you go from east to west.
      However, this pattern isn''t perfectly reliable for comparing ZIP codes in different
      states, especially when they start with different digits.


      What we do know is:

      - Virginia is a state in the southeastern/mid-Atlantic US

      - New York is a state in the northeastern US


      Generally speaking, New York is east of Virginia, which would mean Virginia
      is west of New York. So just from the states, 22407 (VA) would be west of 11239
      (NY).


      To be more precise:

      - ZIP code 22407 appears to be in the Fredericksburg area of Virginia

      - ZIP code 11239 appears to be in Brooklyn, New York City

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - ZIP code 22407 is in Virginia (VA), specifically in the Fredericksburg area

      - ZIP code 11239 is in New York (NY), specifically in Brooklyn, New York City


      ## Step 2: Determine relative positions

      - Looking at a map of the United States, New York is located in the northeastern
      part of the country

      - Virginia is located south of New York and in the mid-Atlantic region

      - When comparing east-west positioning, Virginia is indeed west of New York

      - Specifically, Fredericksburg, VA is west of Brooklyn, NY


      ## Step 3: Conclusion

      ZIP code 11239 is likely in New York City area.


      Virginia is generally west of New York, so 22407 VA is likely west of 11239
      NY. Since Virginia is southwest of New York, the longitude of 22407 would be

      Step 3: Look more specifically at these zip codes.

      - 22407 is in the Fredericksburg area of Virginia

      - 11239 is in the eastern part of New York City (Brooklyn)


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      When traveling from New York to Virginia, you generally move in a southwestern
      direction. The eastern seaboard of the US runs northeast to southwest. Since

      Generally speaking, Mississippi (MS) is located in the southeastern United States,
      bordering the Gulf of Mexico, while Virginia (VA) is on the eastern seaboard
      of the US.


      When looking at a US map, Mississippi is definitely located west of Virginia.
      Mississippi is in the deep south closer to the Mississippi River (which forms
      its western border), while Virginia is an Atlantic coastal state.


      Since 38611 is a zip code in Mississippi and 24073 is a zip code in Virginia,
      and Mississippi is west of Virginia, it follows that 38611, MS is located west
      of 24073, VA.</think>To determine if 38611, MS is located west of 24073, VA,
      I need to analyze the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 38611 is in Mississippi (MS)

      - 24073 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States along the Mississippi
      River, while Virginia is on the eastern seaboard along the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Mississippi is positioned significantly
      west of Virginia. Mississippi''s eastern border is several states away from
      Virginia.


      Step 4: Consider whether specific zip codes might change this relationship.

      Even though specific zip codes within states can vary in location, the entirety
      of Mississippi is west of the entirety of Virginia, so any zip code in Mississippi
      will be west of any zip code in Virginia.


      YES, 38611, MS is located west of 24073, VA.'

      I''ll approach this by:

      1. Identifying the approximate locations of these ZIP codes

      2. Comparing their relative east-west positions


      Mississippi (MS) is generally located in the south-central part of the United

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 38611 is in Mississippi (MS)

      - 24073 is in Virginia (VA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      Mississippi is located in the south-central United States, bordering the Gulf

      state of Mississippi is west of Virginia, with several states between them (including
      Alabama, Tennessee, and others depending on the path).


      ## Step 4: Verify ZIP code locations

      Since 38611 is in Mississippi and 24073 is in Virginia, and Mississippi is entirely

      1) We have two zip codes: 38611 in Mississippi (MS) and 24073 in Virginia (VA)

      2) The question is asking whether 38611, MS is located west of 24073, VA

      3) To answer this, I need to determine the relative positions of these locations
      on a map


      Looking at the United States geography:

      - Mississippi (MS) is located in the southeastern part of the United States,
      along the Mississippi River

      - Virginia (VA) is located on the eastern coast of the United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, Mississippi is generally located west of
      Virginia. On a map of the United States, if you move from Virginia westward,
      you would eventually reach Mississippi (though not directly - there are other
      states in between like Tennessee, Kentucky, etc.).


      Since the zip code 38611 is in Mississippi and 24073 is in Virginia, and Mississippi

      First, let''s identify what states these are in:

      - 38611 is in Mississippi (MS)

      - 24073 is in Virginia (VA)


      Looking at a mental map of the United States, Mississippi is located in the
      southern part of the central United States, along the Mississippi River. Virginia
      is on the east coast.


      Generally speaking, Mississippi is west of Virginia. The entire state of Mississippi
      is west of the entire state of Virginia.


      To be completely sure, I could determine the exact longitudes of these zip codes.
      Longitude measures east-west position, with negative values being west of the
      prime meridian. Since both states are in the United States, both will have negative
      longitudes, and the more negative longitude is farther west.

      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states

      Mississippi is located in the south-central United States, bordering the Mississippi
      River on its western edge. Virginia is located on the east coast of the United
      States.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-east axis

      Looking at a map of the United States, Mississippi is entirely west of Virginia.
      The easternmost point of Mississippi is still west of the westernmost point
      of Virginia.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      Since 38611 is in Mississippi and 24073 is in Virginia, and Mississippi is west
      of Virginia, it follows that 38611, MS must be west of 24073, VA.

      38611 is a zip code in Mississippi (MS)

      24073 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)


      Geographically speaking, the state of Mississippi is located to the west of
      Virginia in the United States. Mississippi is in the southeastern United States,
      bordering the Gulf of Mexico, while Virginia is on the eastern seaboard.


      If we think about the general layout of US states:

      - Virginia is on the east coast

      - Mississippi is much further west, closer to the middle of the country but
      still considered southeastern


      Since Mississippi as a state is west of Virginia as a state, any location in
      Mississippi (including zip code 38611) would be west of any location in Virginia

      In the US, zip codes generally follow a pattern where the first digit represents
      a broad geographic region. Let me recall how these regions are organized:


      - First digit 0: Northeast (New England, NY, NJ)

      - First digit 1: Northeast/Mid-Atlantic (PA, DE, MD, etc.)

      - First digit 2: South Atlantic (VA, NC, SC, etc.)

      - First digit 3: Southeast (AL, MS, TN, etc.)

      - First digit 4: Midwest/Great Lakes (MI, IN, OH, KY, etc.)

      - First digit 5: Central/Midwest (IA, MN, WI, IL, etc.)

      - First digit 6: Central/Midwest (IL, MO, KS, etc.)

      - First digit 7: Central/South Central (TX, OK, AR, LA)

      - First digit 8: Mountain (MT, ID, WY, CO, etc.)

      - First digit 9: West Coast and Alaska/Hawaii (CA, WA, OR, AK, HI)


      So 79331 starts with 7, which indicates it''s in the Central/South Central region,
      specifically in Texas (TX) as noted in the question.

      60137 starts with 6, which indicates it''s in the Central/Midwest region, specifically

      of 60137, IL, I need to find the geographic locations of these zip codes and
      compare their longitudes.


      In the United States, locations further west have more negative longitude values
      (or higher western longitude values), since longitude is measured in degrees
      east or west of the prime meridian.


      Let me think about these zip codes:

      - 79331 is in Texas (TX)

      - 60137 is in Illinois (IL)


      Generally speaking, Texas is west of Illinois in the United States. But I should
      be more precise about the specific zip codes.


      Texas is in the south-central part of the United States, while Illinois is in
      the Midwest. Geographically, Texas is indeed west of Illinois.


      Since 79331 is in Texas and 60137 is in Illinois, and Texas is west of Illinois,
      79331, TX should be west of 60137, IL.


      To be even more certain, I know that:

      - Texas zip codes generally start with 75-79

      - Illinois zip codes generally start with 60-62


      The longitude lines run north-south, and as you move west across the US, the
      zip codes generally increase in their first digits. However, this isn''t perfectly
      consistent. But given that Texas is solidly west of Illinois geographically,
      I can be confident that 79331, TX is west of 60137, IL.</think># Is 79331, TX
      located west of 60137, IL?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 79331 is in Texas (TX)

      - 60137 is in Illinois (IL)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geography of the United States

      Texas is located in the south-central region of the US, while Illinois is in
      the Midwest region. Looking at a US map, Texas is positioned west of Illinois.


      ## Step 3: Verify with zip code geography

      - Texas zip codes generally begin with 75-79

      - Illinois zip codes generally begin with 60-62

      While zip codes aren''t perfectly aligned with longitude, these states are far
      enough apart that any zip code in Texas would be west of any zip code in Illinois.


      ## Conclusion

      YES, 79331, TX is located west of 60137, IL.'

      1. Identify the states and locations of these ZIP codes

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west)


      I know that:

      - 79331 is in Texas (TX)

      - 60137 is in Illinois (IL)


      In the United States, Texas is located to the southwest of Illinois. Generally
      speaking, Texas is west of Illinois.


      To be more specific about these particular ZIP codes:

      - 79331 is likely in western or central Texas

      - 60137 is likely in northern Illinois


      The first digit of ZIP codes roughly corresponds to geographic regions from
      east to west:

      - 0, 1 = Northeast

      - 2, 3 = Mid-Atlantic and Southeast

      97527 is a zip code in Oregon (OR)

      91748 is a zip code in California (CA)


      Let me think about the general geography:

      - Oregon is a state on the west coast of the US, north of California

      - California is also on the west coast, but extends further east than the Oregon
      coastline


      Without exact coordinates, I know that:

      - Oregon is generally north of California

      - Both states border the Pacific Ocean

      - California extends further east than Oregon does


      However, to determine which specific zip code is further west, I need to consider
      their positions within their states:

      - 97527 is likely in western or central Oregon

      - 91748 is likely in the Los Angeles area of southern California, which is not
      on the immediate coast


      Based on my knowledge of US geography, zip codes in Oregon (97xxx) are generally
      in the western part of the state, while zip codes in the 91xxx range are typically
      in the greater Los Angeles area, which is somewhat inland from the coast.


      97527 appears to be in Grants Pass, Oregon, which is in the southwestern part
      of Oregon.

      91748 appears to be in the City of Industry/Rowland Heights area, which is in
      eastern Los Angeles County - relatively far inland.


      Given this information, 97527 in Oregon is almost certainly west of 91748 in
      California, as the Oregon location is closer to the Pacific coast while the

      - 97527 is a zip code in Grants Pass, Oregon

      - 91748 is a zip code in the City of Industry/Rowland Heights area in eastern
      Los Angeles County, California


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship.

      - While California is south of Oregon, the question is about which location
      is further west (longitude), not north/south (latitude)

      - Oregon''s western border is the Pacific Ocean

      - The City of Industry area (91748) is located inland in the eastern part of
      the Los Angeles metropolitan area, quite far from the coast


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      Pacific coast

      - City of Industry, CA (91748) is significantly inland from the Pacific coast
      in Southern California

      In the United States, zip codes generally follow patterns where states in the
      west have higher first digits than states in the east. Oklahoma (OK) and Mississippi
      (MS) are both in the southern part of the US, but Oklahoma is more western than

      Specifically:

      - 73142 is in Oklahoma, which is in the south-central US

      - 39530 is in Mississippi, which is in the southeastern US


      Looking at their geographic locations:

      - Oklahoma borders Texas to its south, New Mexico to its west, and Arkansas
      to its east

      - Mississippi borders Louisiana to its west, Alabama to its east, and the Gulf

      First, I need to understand the geographical orientation of these two states.
      The United States is oriented such that west is to the left on a map, and east
      is to the right.


      Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States. Mississippi is located
      in the southeastern United States.


      In terms of their relative positions, Oklahoma is generally west of Mississippi.
      Oklahoma borders Texas to its south, Arkansas to its east, Missouri to its northeast,

      1. 38834 is a zip code in MS (Mississippi)

      2. 08628 is a zip code in NJ (New Jersey)


      The question is asking if 38834, MS is located west of 08628, NJ.


      To determine this, I need to consider the geographical locations of Mississippi
      and New Jersey in the United States.


      Mississippi is located in the southern part of the central United States, bordering
      the Gulf of Mexico.

      New Jersey is located on the eastern coast of the United States.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Mississippi is indeed west of New Jersey.
      The entire state of Mississippi is west of New Jersey.


      Therefore, any zip code in Mississippi (including 38834) would be west of any
      zip code in New Jersey (including 08628).</think># Is 38834, MS located west
      of 08628, NJ?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two zip codes.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) 38834 is a zip code in Mississippi (MS)

      2) 08628 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      3) In the United States, Mississippi is located in the southeastern region

      4) New Jersey is located on the eastern coast of the United States

      5) Looking at a map of the US, Mississippi is clearly west of New Jersey


      Since all locations in Mississippi (including zip code 38834) are west of all
      locations in New Jersey (including zip code 08628), I can provide a definitive

      with zip code 08628 in New Jersey (NJ).


      To determine this, I need to think about the geographic positions of these states
      within the United States.


      Mississippi (MS) is located in the southeastern United States, bordering the
      Gulf of Mexico to the south, Alabama to the east, Tennessee to the north, Arkansas
      to the northwest, and Louisiana to the west.


      New Jersey (NJ) is located in the northeastern United States, on the Atlantic
      coast.


      In terms of geographic orientation within the continental United States, states
      in the east have lower longitude values than states in the west. Since Mississippi
      is significantly west of New Jersey, any location in Mississippi will be west
      of any location in New Jersey.


      Therefore, zip code 38834 in MS is indeed west of zip code 08628 in NJ.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step:

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States

      - New Jersey is located in the northeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - On a map of the United States, Mississippi is positioned significantly to
      the west of New Jersey

      - All locations in Mississippi will be west of all locations in New Jersey


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on the states'' positions.

      - Since 38834 is in Mississippi, and 08628 is in New Jersey, the Mississippi
      zip code must be west of the New Jersey zip code

      the conclusion that 67218 is west of 30354.


      So to answer whether 67218, KS is located west of 30354, GA - yes, it is.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step by determining the relative east-west positions of these
      two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 67218 is in Kansas (KS)

      - 30354 is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these states

      - Kansas is located in the central United States (Midwest/Great Plains region)

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes (east-west positions)

      - Kansas is significantly west of Georgia on the US map

      - The entire state of Kansas lies west of the entire state of Georgia


      Step 4: Consider the zip code numbering patterns

      - Zip codes beginning with 6 (like 67218) are generally in the central US

      - Zip codes beginning with 3 (like 30354) are generally in the southeastern
      US

      - This pattern confirms our geographic understanding

      is west of 30354, GA (Georgia), I need to compare their geographic locations.
      In the United States, states that are further west have higher longitude values
      (when using negative numbers as is conventional for the Western Hemisphere).


      Let me consider the general locations of these states:

      - Kansas (KS) is in the central United States

      - Georgia (GA) is in the southeastern United States


      Kansas is generally west of Georgia in the United States. The entire state of
      Kansas is west of the entire state of Georgia.


      Now, let''s be more specific about the zip codes:

      - 67218 is a zip code in Kansas

      - 30354 is a zip code in Georgia


      Since Kansas is entirely west of Georgia, any location in Kansas (including
      zip code 67218) would be west of any location in Georgia (including zip code
      30354).


      So my answer is YES, 67218, KS is located west of 30354, GA.


      Wait, I made a mistake above. Longitude works the opposite way in the Western
      Hemisphere. Places further west have more negative longitude values (or lower

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 67218 is in Kansas (KS)

      - 30354 is in Georgia (GA)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these states

      - Kansas is located in the central United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis

      The United States is oriented so that states further west are positioned to
      the left on a standard map. Kansas is significantly west of Georgia in terms
      of longitude.


      ## Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      Since 67218 is in Kansas and 30354 is in Georgia, and Kansas is entirely west
      of Georgia, it follows that any zip code in Kansas (including 67218) is west
      of any zip code in Georgia (including 30354).

      relative positions of two ZIP codes:

      1. 91352, CA (California)

      2. 88048, NM (New Mexico)


      The question specifically asks if the California ZIP code is located west of
      the New Mexico ZIP code.


      To determine this, I need to think about the geographical positions of California
      and New Mexico within the United States:


      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States, but it''s east of
      California


      Looking at the geographical layout of the US, California is entirely west of
      New Mexico. The entire state of California is west of the entire state of New
      Mexico.


      Therefore, any ZIP code in California (including 91352) would be west of any
      ZIP code in New Mexico (including 88048).


      So, 91352 in California is indeed west of 88048 in New Mexico.</think>I need
      to determine the relative east-west positions of these two ZIP codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 91352 is in California (CA)

      - 88048 is in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States, but east of California

      - The entire state of California is west of New Mexico


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific ZIP codes.

      - Since 91352 is in California, and 88048 is in New Mexico, and California is
      west of New Mexico, ZIP code 91352 must be west of ZIP code 88048.

      To determine this, I need to think about the geographical positions of California
      and New Mexico in the United States:


      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New Mexico is an inland state, located in the southwestern United States

      - California is generally west of New Mexico


      Since 91352 is in California (CA) and 88048 is in New Mexico (NM), and California

      1. 24486 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      2. 08221 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      3. I need to determine if the VA location is west of the NJ location


      Geographically in the United States:

      - Virginia is located to the south and west of New Jersey

      - States on the East Coast from north to south are roughly: Maine, New Hampshire,
      Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland,
      Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida

      - So generally Virginia is southwest of New Jersey


      For zip codes specifically:

      - Lower zip codes in the US tend to be in the northeast

      - Higher zip codes tend to be further south and west

      - 08221 (NJ) is a lower number than 24486 (VA), which is consistent with VA
      being southwest of NJ


      Based on the general geography of US states, Virginia is west of New Jersey.
      The specific zip codes don''t change this geographic relationship. Therefore,
      24486, VA would be located west of 08221, NJ.</think>I need to determine if

      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 24486 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 08221 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Virginia is also on the East Coast, but is positioned southwest of New Jersey


      Step 3: Compare the relative east-west positioning.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, Virginia is positioned to the
      west of New Jersey

      - All of Virginia lies west of most or all of New Jersey


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      - Since all of Virginia is west of New Jersey, any location in Virginia (including
      zip code 24486) would be west of any location in New Jersey (including zip code
      08221)


      YES - 24486, VA is located west of 08221, NJ.'

      First, let me identify these locations:

      - 24486 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      - 08221 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)


      Now, I need to think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Virginia is a state in the mid-Atlantic region, west of New Jersey

      - New Jersey is on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Generally speaking, Virginia is west of New Jersey


      Since Virginia is generally west of New Jersey, it''s very likely that any location
      in Virginia (including 24486) would be west of any location in New Jersey (including
      08221).


      This is because the entire state of Virginia lies west of New Jersey on a map
      of the United States. The eastern border of Virginia is the Atlantic Ocean,
      and New Jersey is also along the Atlantic Coast, but New Jersey is further east
      than Virginia.</think># Step-by-step reasoning

      - 08221 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Virginia is located in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States

      - New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Looking at a map of the United States, Virginia is positioned to the west
      of New Jersey

      - The entire state of Virginia lies west of New Jersey geographically

      - Even the easternmost parts of Virginia would be west of the westernmost parts
      of New Jersey


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 24486 is in Virginia and 08221 is in New Jersey, the Virginia zip code
      must be west of the New Jersey zip code

      To be more precise:

      1. Virginia is located in the mid-Atlantic region, south of Maryland and west

      2. New Jersey is located in the northeastern United States, east of Pennsylvania
      and south of New York.

      (Missouri) is located west of 48624, MI (Michigan).


      To answer this, I need to understand the relative locations of these two places.
      In the US, locations farther west have a higher longitude (in the negative direction,
      since the US is in the western hemisphere).


      Let me think about the general locations of Missouri and Michigan:

      - Missouri is in the Midwest/central US

      - Michigan is in the Great Lakes region in the north-central/northeastern part
      of the US


      Generally speaking, Missouri is west of Michigan. But to be more precise, let''s
      consider these specific zip codes.


      US zip codes have some geographic correlation - generally lower numbered zip
      codes are in the eastern US and higher numbers are further west, though there
      are many exceptions to this pattern.


      Here:

      - 63670 is a zip code in Missouri

      - 48624 is a zip code in Michigan


      The fact that the Missouri zip code (63670) has a higher first digit (6) than
      the Michigan zip code (48624) with first digit (4) offers some support for Missouri
      being west of Michigan, as this aligns with the general west-to-east pattern
      of zip codes.


      Based on the general geography of the United States, Missouri is indeed west
      of Michigan. Therefore, 63670, MO is west of 48624, MI.</think>To determine
      if 63670, MO is located west of 48624, MI, I need to consider the geographic
      locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 63670 is in Missouri (MO)

      - 48624 is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Missouri is located in the central United States, while Michigan is in the Great
      Lakes region in the north-central/northeastern part of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      Looking at a US map, Missouri is positioned to the west of Michigan. Even though
      specific zip codes might be in different parts of their respective states, the
      entirety of Missouri lies west of Michigan.


      Step 4: Verify with general zip code patterns.

      US zip codes tend to follow a pattern where lower numbers are assigned to the
      eastern US and higher numbers to the western regions. The Missouri zip code
      (63xxx) has a higher first digit than the Michigan zip code (48xxx), which supports
      the west-east relationship.

      - 48624, MI refers to a zip code in Michigan (MI)


      The question is asking whether the location in Missouri is west of the location

      - Michigan is in the upper Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Looking at a US map, Missouri is indeed west of Michigan. The entire state of

      - Nebraska (NE) is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Florida (FL) is located in the southeastern part of the United States


      Just based on states, Nebraska is definitely west of Florida. Nebraska is roughly
      in the middle of the country while Florida is on the eastern coast.


      The specific zip codes might refer to locations within these states, but the
      entire state of Nebraska is west of the entire state of Florida, so any location
      in Nebraska (including 68152) would be west of any location in Florida (including

      and compare their positions on a map.


      First, I''ll identify the states:

      - 77388 is in Texas (TX)

      - 62207 is in Illinois (IL)


      Generally speaking, Texas is located west of Illinois in the United States.
      But I should confirm the specific locations of these zip codes.


      77388 appears to be a zip code in the Spring area, which is near Houston in
      southeast Texas.

      62207 appears to be a zip code in the East St. Louis area in southwest Illinois.


      US geography reminder: When we compare "west of", we''re comparing longitude
      values. A lower (more negative) longitude number means further west in the US.


      Texas is indeed west of Illinois on the map of the United States. Even though
      77388 is in eastern Texas and 62207 is in western Illinois, the entire state
      of Texas is still west of Illinois.


      So yes, 77388, TX is west of 62207, IL.


      Actually, let me double-check this. While Texas is generally west of Illinois,
      I need to be careful about the specific locations. Houston area (where 77388
      is) is in east Texas, while East St. Louis (where 62207 is) is in western Illinois.


      Let me think about US geography more carefully. Texas extends further east than
      some might initially think, and its eastern border is actually not that far
      west of Illinois''s western border.


      However, even eastern Texas should still be west of western Illinois. The Mississippi
      River roughly forms Illinois''s western border, and Texas is entirely west of
      the Mississippi.


      So my answer is still yes.</think>I need to determine whether 77388, TX is located
      west of 62207, IL by comparing their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 77388 is in Spring, Texas, which is in the Houston area (southeastern Texas)

      - 62207 is in East St. Louis, Illinois, which is in southwestern Illinois


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and Illinois.

      - Texas is located southwest of Illinois on the US map

      - Even though 77388 is in eastern Texas and 62207 is in western Illinois, we
      need to compare their absolute positions


      Step 3: Think about longitude (east-west positioning).

      - All of Texas, including its easternmost parts, lies west of Illinois

      - The Mississippi River roughly forms Illinois''s western border, and all of
      Texas is west of the Mississippi


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Even though 77388 is in eastern Texas, it''s still west of any point in Illinois,
      including 62207


      YES, 77388, TX is located west of 62207, IL.'

      \ New England (including NH) jutting out eastward, while the Mid-Atlantic states\
      \ (including MD) are positioned more to the west relative to New England.\n\n\
      Step 3: To be more precise, I should consider the longitude (east-west position)\

      of 03303, NH, I need to figure out the locations of these zip codes and compare
      their longitude.


      First, let me identify these locations:

      - 21209 is a zip code in Maryland (MD)

      - 03303 is a zip code in New Hampshire (NH)


      Broadly speaking, on a US map:

      - Maryland is in the Mid-Atlantic region

      - New Hampshire is in New England (Northeast)


      Generally, Maryland is to the west of New Hampshire. The eastern United States
      has New England states (including NH) on the Atlantic coast, and as you move
      westward, you encounter the Mid-Atlantic states including Maryland.


      So geographically, Maryland is southwest of New Hampshire. Since the question
      is specifically about "west" (not southwest), I need to be precise about the
      longitude.


      Maryland is generally positioned west of New Hampshire on the map, which means
      it has a lower longitude value (longitude decreases as you move west in the
      US). So a zip code in Maryland would typically be west of a zip code in New
      Hampshire.</think># Is 21209, MD located west of 03303, NH?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 21209 is in Maryland (MD)

      - 03303 is in New Hampshire (NH)


      ## Step 2: Determine their geographic positions

      - Maryland is located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the US

      - New Hampshire is located in the New England region (Northeast)


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-east axis

      - New Hampshire lies along the eastern coast of the US

      - Maryland is positioned to the west of New Hampshire


      ## Step 4: Verify relative longitude

      - States in New England (including NH) are further east than Mid-Atlantic states

      - Maryland''s longitude is generally west of New Hampshire''s longitude

      - Therefore, a zip code in MD would be west of a zip code in NH


      YES'

      1. 21209 is a zip code in Maryland (MD)

      2. 03303 is a zip code in New Hampshire (NH)


      I need to determine if 21209, MD is west of 03303, NH.


      To answer this, I need to compare the geographical locations:


      Maryland (MD) is a state on the east coast of the United States, below Pennsylvania
      and to the west of Delaware.


      New Hampshire (NH) is a state in the New England region of the northeastern
      United States.


      In terms of east-west positioning in the United States:

      - New Hampshire is further east than Maryland

      - Maryland is further west than New Hampshire


      This means that 21209, MD (a zip code in Maryland) is located west of 03303,

      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states

      Maryland is located on the mid-Atlantic coast, while New Hampshire is in the
      northeastern United States in the New England region.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      Looking at a US map, New Hampshire is positioned significantly further east
      than Maryland. The entire state of Maryland is west of New Hampshire''s longitude.


      Step 4: Since the zip codes are in their respective states, their relative positions
      follow the same pattern as the states themselves.


      YES, 21209, MD is located west of 03303, NH.'

      2. Determine their relative east-west positioning


      The United States is generally oriented with the east coast on the right (east)
      and the west coast on the left (west). States on the east coast include Maine,
      New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey,

      Maryland (MD) is a state on the east coast, south of Pennsylvania.

      New Hampshire (NH) is also on the east coast, but further north, located between
      Maine and Vermont.


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New Hampshire is in the northeastern United States

      - Maryland is in the mid-Atlantic region


      If we look at a map of the US, Maryland is indeed located to the west of New
      Hampshire, even though both are eastern states. That''s because the eastern
      coastline of the US curves, and New Hampshire is further to the northeast while

      ## Step 2: Determine geographical positions

      - New Hampshire is located in the northeastern United States

      - Maryland is located in the mid-Atlantic region


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      Looking at a US map, although both states are on the eastern seaboard, Maryland
      sits farther west than New Hampshire. This is because the US east coast curves
      - New Hampshire is in the northeast corner while Maryland is more centrally

      Maryland is typically west of New Hampshire in terms of their general geographic
      positions. Maryland is closer to the middle of the East Coast, while New Hampshire
      is in the Northeast corner of the country.


      To be more precise about these specific zip codes:

      - 21209 is in Baltimore, Maryland

      - 03303 is in Bow, New Hampshire


      The eastern United States follows a general pattern where locations further
      west have higher longitude values. Since Maryland is west of New Hampshire on

      States.

      - New Hampshire (NH) is located in the New England region in the northeastern
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions.

      - New Hampshire is positioned in the far northeastern part of the country.

      - Maryland is positioned further south and west of the New England states.


      Step 3: Apply geographic knowledge.

      - On a map of the United States, Maryland is positioned to the west of New Hampshire.

      Let me break this down:

      1. 45342 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)

      2. 11768 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Generally speaking, Ohio is located west of New York in the United States. The
      continental US has states arranged roughly with eastern states (like NY) on
      the east coast and moving westward through mid-western states (like OH) and
      further west.


      To be more precise:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York is in the Northeast region of the United States


      Looking at a US map, Ohio is definitely west of New York. So any location in
      Ohio would be west of any location in New York.


      Therefore, zip code 45342 in Ohio would be west of zip code 11768 in New York.</think>I

      zip code (11768).


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 45342 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 11768 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Understand the geographical relationship between these states.

      Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while New York is
      located in the Northeast.


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship.

      On a map of the United States, Ohio is positioned to the west of New York. The
      entire state of Ohio lies west of the entire state of New York.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 45342 is in Ohio and 11768 is in New York, and Ohio is west of New York,
      it follows that 45342 must be west of 11768.

      (Ohio) is located west of 11768, NY (New York).


      In the United States, locations that are west of each other can be determined
      by their relative geographic positions. Generally, states that are more westward
      have lower longitude values (since longitude increases as you go east in the
      US).


      Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while New York is
      located in the Northeast. Geographically, Ohio is west of New York.


      To be more specific:

      - 45342 is a zip code in Ohio (likely in the Miamisburg area)

      - 11768 is a zip code in New York (likely in the Long Island area)

      - 45342 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 11768 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states in the US.

      Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while New York is
      in the Northeast region.


      Step 3: Compare their geographic positions.

      Looking at a US map, Ohio is positioned to the west of New York. All of Ohio
      is west of all of New York.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 45342 is in Ohio and 11768 is in New York, and Ohio is west of New York,
      it follows that 45342, OH must be west of 11768, NY.

      In the United States, locations further west have larger longitude values (more
      negative, since the US is in the western hemisphere). So I need to determine
      if the longitude of 45342, OH is more westerly (more negative longitude) than
      11768, NY.


      Let me reason through this based on general geographic knowledge:


      1. Ohio is a midwestern state, located west of New York state.

      2. New York is on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      3. All of Ohio is west of all of New York.


      Therefore, any location in Ohio (including zip code 45342) would be west of
      any location in New York (including zip code 11768).


      So my answer would be YES, 45342, OH is located west of 11768, NY.


      Wait, I need to check my understanding of longitude. In the western hemisphere,
      longitude values are negative, and more western locations have more negative
      values (further from the prime meridian). So Ohio, being west of New York, would
      have a more negative longitude value.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      I need to determine if the zip code 45342 in Ohio is located west of zip code
      11768 in New York.


      Step 1: Let me consider the geographic positions of Ohio and New York states.

      - Ohio is a Midwestern state

      - New York is an Eastern seaboard state


      Step 2: Looking at a US map, Ohio is entirely west of New York. All points in
      Ohio are west of all points in New York.


      Step 3: Since zip code 45342 is in Ohio and zip code 11768 is in New York, the
      Ohio zip code must be west of the New York zip code.

      11768 is a zip code in New York (NY). New York is in the Northeast region of
      the United States.


      In terms of geography, states that are further west have a lower longitude (in
      the western hemisphere). The United States spans from east to west, with the
      East Coast (including New York) being the easternmost part and the West Coast
      being the westernmost part. The Midwest region, including Ohio, is between the
      East Coast and the West Coast.


      Ohio is generally west of New York. So a zip code in Ohio would be west of a

      is located west of 30575, GA (Georgia), I need to know the relative positions
      of these states in the US.


      The United States is generally oriented such that west is to the left on a map,
      and east is to the right. So I need to determine which state is further west.


      Nebraska (NE) is located in the Midwest region of the United States. It''s roughly
      in the middle of the country, but definitely in the western half.


      Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States, on the Atlantic coast.


      Geographically, Nebraska is definitely west of Georgia. All of Nebraska is west
      of all of Georgia.


      Since 68147 is in Nebraska and 30575 is in Georgia, it follows that 68147, NE
      is west of 30575, GA.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of these

      Step 2: Consider the geographic locations of these states.

      - Nebraska is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Georgia is located in the Southeast region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Nebraska is positioned significantly west of Georgia on the US map

      - All of Nebraska lies west of all of Georgia


      Step 4: Since the zip codes are in these respective states, their relative positions
      follow the same pattern. The Nebraska zip code must be west of the Georgia zip
      code.


      YES, 68147, NE is located west of 30575, GA.'

      to determine the geographical locations of two zip codes and compare their positions
      from east to west.


      Given:

      - 73801, OK (a zip code in Oklahoma)

      - 39367, MS (a zip code in Mississippi)


      First, let me consider the general locations of these states:

      - Oklahoma (OK) is in the south-central part of the US

      - Mississippi (MS) is in the southeastern US


      Generally, Oklahoma is west of Mississippi. On a map of the US, if you move
      from Mississippi toward the west, you''ll reach Oklahoma (though there''s Arkansas
      and possibly parts of Texas in between).


      So geographically speaking, any location in Oklahoma would typically be west
      of any location in Mississippi.


      Therefore, zip code 73801 in Oklahoma should be west of zip code 39367 in Mississippi.</think>#
      Is 73801, OK located west of 39367, MS?


      Let me determine this by examining the geographical positions of these zip codes:


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 73801 is in Oklahoma (OK)

      - 39367 is in Mississippi (MS)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States

      - Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States


      ## Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      Looking at a map of the United States, Oklahoma is positioned to the west of
      Mississippi. The entire state of Oklahoma lies west of the entire state of Mississippi,
      with Arkansas and parts of Texas between them.


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Since Oklahoma is entirely west of Mississippi, any location in Oklahoma (including
      zip code 73801) must be west of any location in Mississippi (including zip code
      39367).


      YES'

      to determine the geographical locations of these two zip codes and figure out
      if one is west of the other.


      73801 is a zip code in Oklahoma (OK)

      39367 is a zip code in Mississippi (MS)


      Now I need to think about their relative positions. The United States is generally
      organized with states in the following west-to-east arrangement:

      - West Coast states (CA, OR, WA)

      - Mountain states (ID, MT, WY, NV, UT, CO, AZ, NM)

      - Plains states (ND, SD, NE, KS, OK, TX)

      - Midwest states (MN, IA, MO, AR, LA, WI, IL, IN, MI, OH)

      - Southern states (KY, TN, MS, AL, GA, FL)

      - Eastern states (ME, NH, VT, NY, MA, RI, CT, PA, NJ, DE, MD, WV, VA, NC, SC)


      Oklahoma (OK) is in the Plains region, while Mississippi (MS) is in the Southern
      region. On a US map, Oklahoma is located to the west of Mississippi. So generally,
      any location in Oklahoma would be west of any location in Mississippi.


      Therefore, 73801, OK is located west of 39367, MS.</think>I need to determine
      if the Oklahoma zip code is west of the Mississippi zip code.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these zip codes are located.

      - 73801 is in Oklahoma (OK)

      - 39367 is in Mississippi (MS)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Oklahoma is located in the south-central region of the United States, while
      Mississippi is in the southeastern region.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      Looking at a US map, Oklahoma is positioned to the west of Mississippi. The
      eastern border of Oklahoma is still west of the western border of Mississippi.


      Step 4: Since the zip codes are within these states, their relative positions
      follow the same pattern.

      Since Oklahoma is west of Mississippi, any location in Oklahoma (including 73801)
      would be west of any location in Mississippi (including 39367).

      The zip codes are:

      - 75033, TX (Texas)

      - 72023, AR (Arkansas)


      First, let''s recall the relative positions of Texas and Arkansas in the US:

      - Texas is generally west of Arkansas

      - Arkansas borders the eastern part of Texas


      To be more precise, I need to think about these specific zip codes.


      ZIP code 75033 is in Texas. I believe it''s in the eastern part of Texas, possibly
      in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.

      ZIP code 72023 is in Arkansas. I''m not sure exactly where in Arkansas.


      Since Texas is generally west of Arkansas, it''s likely that 75033, TX is west
      of 72023, AR. But I should be careful because eastern parts of Texas could be
      at similar longitudes to western parts of Arkansas.


      However, since Texas extends much further west than Arkansas, and 75033 is likely
      in the eastern part of Texas (near Dallas), it''s probably still west of most
      places in Arkansas, including 72023.


      So my reasoning suggests that yes, 75033, TX is located west of 72023, AR. But
      this is based on general knowledge of US geography rather than precise coordinates
      of these zip codes.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine if 75033, TX is located west of 72023, AR, I need to establish
      the geographical relationship between these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 75033 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      - 72023 is a zip code in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      - Texas is located to the west of Arkansas on the US map

      - Arkansas borders the eastern portion of Texas


      Step 3: Examine these specific zip codes.

      - 75033 is in Frisco, Texas, which is in the northeastern part of Texas (Dallas-Fort
      Worth metro area)

      - 72023 is in Arkansas, which is entirely east of the Dallas-Fort Worth area


      Step 4: Compare longitudes.

      - Even though 75033 is in eastern Texas, all of Texas (including its easternmost
      parts) is still west of all of Arkansas

      - Arkansas''s western border is east of the Dallas-Fort Worth area where Frisco
      is located

      - 72023, AR (a zip code in Arkansas)


      To determine which is west of the other, I need to know their relative positions.
      In the US, Texas is generally located west of Arkansas. Arkansas is directly
      east of Texas on the map.


      Since 75033 is in Texas, and 72023 is in Arkansas, and Texas is west of Arkansas,
      the location with zip code 75033 (in Texas) would be west of the location with
      zip code 72023 (in Arkansas).</think>To determine if 75033, TX is located west
      of 72023, AR, I need to consider the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 75033 is in Texas (TX)

      - 72023 is in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      Looking at a U.S. map, Texas is positioned to the west of Arkansas. Arkansas
      borders the eastern edge of Texas.


      Step 3: While specific zip codes might have unusual arrangements in border areas,
      these zip codes are not in border regions.

      - 75033 is in the Dallas-Fort Worth area of Texas

      - 72023 is in central Arkansas


      Step 4: Since Texas is west of Arkansas, and these specific zip codes follow

      75033 is a zip code in Texas (TX). Let me think about where in Texas this might
      be. Texas is generally west of Arkansas, but I need to determine the specific
      locations.


      72023 is a zip code in Arkansas (AR).


      In the US, zip codes generally follow some geographic patterns. ZIP codes start
      with lower numbers in the northeast and increase as you go south and west. But
      I shouldn''t rely on just the numbers, as there can be exceptions.


      Texas (75033) - This is likely in eastern or northeastern Texas, based on the
      first digit "7".

      Arkansas (72023) - This is likely in central or southern Arkansas, based on
      the first digit "7".


      Since both start with 7, they are likely in relatively close longitudinal regions.
      However, Texas is generally west of Arkansas, so it''s likely that 75033, TX
      is west of 72023, AR.


      But to be more precise, I would need to know the exact locations. Let me think
      about what I know about these states:


      - Arkansas is directly east of Oklahoma and north of Louisiana

      - Texas is south of Oklahoma and west of Louisiana and Arkansas


      Given this geographic arrangement, and that 75033 is in Texas while 72023 is
      in Arkansas, it''s very likely that 75033, TX is west of 72023, AR. However,
      if 75033 is in far eastern Texas and 72023 is in far western Arkansas, the answer
      could potentially be different.


      But based on the general geographic positions of the states, I''ll conclude
      that 75033, TX is west of 72023, AR.</think># Is 75033, TX located west of 72023,
      AR?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) First, I need to identify the states: 75033 is in Texas (TX) and 72023 is
      in Arkansas (AR).


      2) Looking at US geography, Arkansas is located directly east of Oklahoma and
      north of Louisiana.


      3) Texas is located south of Oklahoma and west of Arkansas (though they share
      a border on Arkansas''s southwest corner and Texas''s northeast corner).


      4) Zip code 75033 is in Frisco, Texas, which is in the northeastern part of
      Texas, near Dallas.


      5) Zip code 72023 is in Carlisle, Arkansas, which is in central Arkansas.


      6) Even though 75033 is in eastern Texas, Texas as a whole is positioned west
      of Arkansas on the map.


      7) Looking at the specific locations, Frisco, TX (75033) is still west of Carlisle,
      AR (72023).

      In the United States, locations further west have higher longitude values (going
      from east to west). So I need to determine which location is further west.


      Let me think about the rough geography of these states:

      - Connecticut (CT) is in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina (NC) is in the southeastern United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, North Carolina is generally west of Connecticut.
      If you look at a US map, Connecticut is on the Atlantic coast in New England,
      while North Carolina is further down the Atlantic coast and extends further
      inland (west).


      So geographically, it''s very likely that a location in North Carolina would
      be west of a location in Connecticut. This is consistent with the general pattern
      of ZIP codes in the US, where lower numbers tend to be in the northeast, and
      higher numbers tend to be as you move south and west.


      Given that 28403 (NC) has a higher first digit than 06250 (CT), this also suggests
      NC is west of CT.</think>To determine if 28403, NC is west of 06250, CT, I need

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 28403 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 06250 is in Connecticut (CT)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic layout of these states.

      - Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Determine east-west positioning.

      - While both states are on the eastern seaboard, North Carolina is actually
      located south and slightly west of Connecticut.

      - The US postal ZIP code system generally assigns lower numbers to the northeast
      and higher numbers as you move south and west (which is consistent with 06xxx
      for CT vs 28xxx for NC).


      Step 4: Compare the specific locations.

      - Any location in North Carolina, including zip code 28403, would be west of
      any location in Connecticut, including zip code 06250.

      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - On a map of the United States, Connecticut lies to the northeast

      - North Carolina lies to the southeast

      - When comparing east-west positioning only, Connecticut is further east than
      North Carolina


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      First, let me identify the ZIP codes:

      - 28403, NC (North Carolina)

      - 06250, CT (Connecticut)


      To determine if one is west of the other, I need to consider their relative
      positions on the map of the United States.


      The United States generally has ZIP codes that increase from east to west, but
      they''re not perfectly ordered that way. However, I know that:


      North Carolina (NC) is located on the east coast of the United States, but further
      south than Connecticut.

      Connecticut (CT) is located in the northeastern United States, also on the east
      coast.


      In terms of east-west positioning, North Carolina is generally south and slightly
      west of Connecticut. The eastern seaboard of the US curves, so locations further
      south tend to be slightly further west.


      Let me think about the general geographic arrangement:

      - Connecticut is in New England, in the northeast

      - North Carolina is in the Southeast

      - North Carolina is located on the southeastern coast of the United States


      Step 3: Consider the east-west relationship.

      Although both states are on the eastern side of the US, North Carolina is positioned
      to the southwest of Connecticut. The eastern coastline of the US curves, so

      In the United States, generally:

      - Connecticut is far in the northeast

      - North Carolina is in the southeast, but importantly, it''s also southwest
      of Connecticut


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), North Carolina is indeed west
      of Connecticut. This is because as you move down the east coast from north to

      Connecticut (CT) is in the northeastern United States, specifically in the New
      England region.

      North Carolina (NC) is in the southeastern United States, along the Atlantic
      coast.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions.

      While both states are on the eastern side of the US, Connecticut is positioned
      further northeast, while North Carolina is southeast of Connecticut.


      Step 3: Analyze east-west positioning.

      As you move south along the eastern seaboard, the coastline curves westward.
      This means North Carolina is actually west of Connecticut in terms of longitude,
      despite both being "East Coast" states.

    ce3b4057-3f68-41fe-8bdb-4e9d02c0c6d4: '<think>This question is asking me to compare
      the geographical locations of two ZIP codes and determine if one is west of
      the other.


      Let me break this down:

      1. 28403 is a ZIP code in North Carolina (NC)

      2. 06250 is a ZIP code in Connecticut (CT)


      To determine if one location is west of another, I need to compare their longitudes.
      Western locations have higher negative longitude values in the US (since the
      US is in the Western hemisphere).


      I don''t have the exact longitude coordinates for these ZIP codes, but I can
      reason about this based on the general geography of US states:


      North Carolina (NC) is located on the East Coast of the United States, but it
      is south and west of Connecticut (CT). Connecticut is in the Northeast (New
      England region), while North Carolina is in the Southeast.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Connecticut is in the far northeastern part of the country

      - North Carolina is further south and somewhat west of Connecticut


      So yes, North Carolina would be west of Connecticut, though it''s also significantly
      south.


      Therefore, 28403, NC would be west of 06250, CT.</think># Determining if 28403,
      NC is west of 06250, CT


      I need to identify the locations of these zip codes and compare their geographic
      positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 28403 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 06250 is in Connecticut (CT)


      ## Step 2: Determine relative positions of these states

      North Carolina is located on the southeastern coast of the United States, while
      Connecticut is located in the northeastern region (New England).


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      When looking at a map of the United States:

      - Connecticut is positioned further east along the Atlantic coast

      - North Carolina is positioned to the south AND west of Connecticut


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Since North Carolina is geographically west of Connecticut, zip code 28403 in
      NC is indeed west of zip code 06250 in CT.

      to find the geographical locations of two zip codes and determine if one is
      west of the other.


      The zip codes are:

      - 33330, FL (Florida)

      - 06712, CT (Connecticut)


      I need to determine if the Florida zip code is west of the Connecticut zip code.


      First, let''s consider the general geographical locations of Florida and Connecticut
      in the United States:

      - Florida is in the southeastern United States

      - Connecticut is in the northeastern United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, Florida is generally southwest of Connecticut.
      This means that most locations in Florida would be west of locations in Connecticut.


      To be more precise about these specific zip codes:

      - 33330 is a zip code in Florida, likely in the southern part of the state

      - 06712 is a zip code in Connecticut


      Since the entire state of Florida is west of Connecticut on the east-west axis
      (Florida''s easternmost point is still west of Connecticut''s westernmost point),
      any zip code in Florida (including 33330) would be west of any zip code in Connecticut
      (including 06712).


      So yes, 33330, FL is located west of 06712, CT.</think>I''ll solve this step
      by step, comparing the geographical locations of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 33330 is in Florida (FL)

      - 06712 is in Connecticut (CT)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states

      - Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Consider their east-west positioning specifically

      - While Florida is south of Connecticut, we need to determine if it''s also
      west

      - Connecticut is positioned along the Atlantic coast in New England

      - Florida extends much further west than Connecticut


      Step 4: Compare their longitudinal positions

      - All of Florida lies west of Connecticut on a map of the United States

      - Even the easternmost point of Florida is west of the westernmost point of
      Connecticut


      Therefore, any location in Florida (including zip code 33330) is west of any
      location in Connecticut (including zip code 06712).

      To solve this problem, I need to:

      1. Determine the geographic locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their longitudes (east-west positioning)


      Let me think about the general geographic positioning of Florida and Connecticut
      in the United States:

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States

      - Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States


      In terms of east-west positioning (longitude):

      - Florida is generally west of Connecticut, as Connecticut is on the eastern
      seaboard and Florida is further west and south


      So just from state-level geography, I would expect that a zip code in Florida
      would be west of a zip code in Connecticut. But let me be more specific about
      these particular zip codes.


      33330 is a zip code in Florida, likely in the southern part of the state.

      06712 is a zip code in Connecticut.


      Since the entire state of Florida is west of the entire state of Connecticut

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 33330 is a zip code in Florida (FL)

      - 06712 is a zip code in Connecticut (CT)


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic positions

      - Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States


      ## Step 3: Compare longitudes

      While both states are on the eastern side of the US, Connecticut sits much further
      east along the Atlantic coast than Florida.


      Florida, even though it''s south of Connecticut, is positioned westward relative
      to Connecticut on a map of the United States.


      ## Step 4: Make the determination

      Any location in Florida (including zip code 33330) would be west of any location
      in Connecticut (including zip code 06712) because the entire state of Florida
      lies west of the entire state of Connecticut.

      locations of these two zip codes and then determine if 33330, FL is west of
      06712, CT.


      Zip code 33330 is in Florida (FL). Florida is a state in the southeastern United
      States, on the Atlantic coast.


      Zip code 06712 is in Connecticut (CT). Connecticut is a state in the northeastern
      United States, also on the Atlantic coast.


      Geographically, the United States is oriented such that west is to the left
      on a map, and east is to the right. Florida is further south than Connecticut,
      but the question is specifically asking about east-west orientation.


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Connecticut is in the Northeast

      - Florida is in the Southeast


      The continental US generally has states arranged where the further east you
      go, the higher the longitude (in degrees east). Connecticut is one of the easternmost
      states, while Florida is more centrally located on the east-west axis.

      - 33330 is in Florida (FL)

      - 06712 is in Connecticut (CT)


      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of these states on the US map.

      - Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Connecticut is positioned on the far eastern seaboard of the US

      - Florida, while also on the eastern side of the US, is positioned further west
      than Connecticut


      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison.

      When comparing locations in the US, those with a more westerly position will
      have a lower longitude value than those further east. Connecticut is further
      east than Florida on the US map.


      YES, 33330, FL is located west of 06712, CT.'

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes (33330, FL and 06712, CT)

      2. Determine their relative east-west positions


      Let me think about this. Zip code 33330 is in Florida (FL), and zip code 06712
      is in Connecticut (CT).


      In the United States, Florida is in the southeastern part of the country, while
      Connecticut is in the northeastern part of the country. When looking at a map
      of the US:

      - Connecticut is on the east coast, in New England

      - Florida is also on the east coast, but much further south


      In terms of east-west positioning, both states are on the eastern side of the
      US, but Connecticut is generally east of Florida. That is, Florida extends further
      to the west than Connecticut does.


      So the real question is whether this specific zip code in Florida (33330) is
      west of this specific zip code in Connecticut (06712).


      Since Connecticut is a relatively small state far to the northeast, and Florida
      is a wider state that extends further west, it''s very likely that a location
      in Florida would be west of a location in Connecticut. This is because the entire
      state of Florida is generally west of the entire state of Connecticut.


      Therefore, zip code 33330 in Florida is almost certainly west of zip code 06712
      in Connecticut.</think># Is 33330, FL located west of 06712, CT?


      I need to determine the east-west positioning of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 33330 is in Florida (FL)

      - 06712 is in Connecticut (CT)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      While both states are on the eastern side of the country, Connecticut is positioned
      much further east than Florida. The entire state of Connecticut lies east of

      Step 1: Let''s recall the general geography of the United States. Florida (FL)
      is located in the southeastern part of the United States, while Connecticut
      (CT) is in the northeastern part.


      Step 2: In terms of east-west positioning, states on the East Coast generally

      also somewhat further west than Connecticut.


      Step 3: To be more precise, let''s think about the specific locations. Zip code
      33330 is in Florida, and zip code 06712 is in Connecticut. But I need to know
      their specific locations within those states.


      Step 4: Generally speaking, Connecticut is entirely east of Florida on a map
      of the United States. This is because Connecticut is in the Northeast, while
      Florida is in the Southeast and extends westward as well.


      Step 5: Therefore, any location in Florida, including zip code 33330, would

      To solve this question, I need to determine the geographical positions of these

      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) First, I need to consider the states: Florida (FL) is in the southeastern

      2) When comparing east-west positions (longitude), the entire state of Connecticut

      \ are located:\n- 33330 is a zip code in Florida (FL)\n- 06712 is a zip code\
      \ in Connecticut (CT)\n\nIn the United States, states on the East Coast include\
      \ Connecticut, while Florida is in the southeastern part of the country. Connecticut\
      \ is in the northeast region, while Florida extends south from the southeastern\
      \ United States.\n\nWhen considering the east-west positioning (longitude),\
      \ I need to determine if Florida's longitude at that zip code is further west\
      \ (has a higher negative longitude value) than Connecticut's.\n\nGenerally speaking,\
      \ Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States, while Florida is\
      \ in the southeastern United States. The entire state of Florida is west of\
      \ Connecticut on a map of the US.\n\nSo 33330, FL should be west of 06712, CT.\
      \ Let me double check this reasoning by considering the general positions of\
      \ the states:\n\nConnecticut is approximately around 73\xB0W longitude (western\
      \ Connecticut) to 71\xB0W longitude (eastern Connecticut).\nFlorida ranges from\
      \ about 80\xB0W to 87\xB0W longitude.\n\nSince Florida's longitude range (80\xB0\
      W to 87\xB0W) has larger negative values than Connecticut's longitude range\
      \ (71\xB0W to 73\xB0W), Florida is west of Connecticut.\n\nTherefore, 33330,\

      \ in the northeastern United States\n- Florida is located in the southeastern\
      \ United States\n\n## Step 3: Compare longitudes\nThe longitude determines east-west\
      \ positioning. Looking at the geographic positions:\n- Connecticut lies roughly\
      \ between 71\xB0W and 73\xB0W longitude\n- Florida lies roughly between 80\xB0\
      W and 87\xB0W longitude\n\nSince Florida's longitude values are larger negative\
      \ numbers than Connecticut's, Florida is positioned west of Connecticut on the\
      \ map.\n\n## Step 4: Conclusion for specific zip codes\nSince 33330 is in Florida\
      \ and 06712 is in Connecticut, and all of Florida is west of all of Connecticut,\
      \ the zip code in Florida must be west of the zip code in Connecticut.\n\nYES"

      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - Ohio (OH) is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Connecticut (CT) is located in the Northeast region of the United States,
      specifically in New England


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      Looking at the zip codes:

      - 06076 (Connecticut): starts with 0


      This numbering pattern confirms what we know about geography - Connecticut has
      a lower first digit (0) which corresponds to its more eastern location, while
      Ohio has a higher first digit (4) corresponding to its more western location.

      I need to determine the geographical relationship between these two zip codes.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1) First, I''ll identify the states: 45371 is in Ohio (OH) and 06076 is in Connecticut
      (CT)

      2) Looking at US geography, Connecticut is located in New England in the northeastern
      part of the United States

      3) Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      4) When looking at a US map from east to west, Connecticut is significantly
      east of Ohio

      5) Therefore, any location in Ohio (including zip code 45371) would be west
      of any location in Connecticut (including zip code 06076)

      Let me identify these locations:

      - 60087 is a zip code in Illinois (IL)

      - 43952 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)

      to determine if the zip code 40109 in Kentucky (KY) is located west of zip code
      05677 in Vermont (VT).


      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - Vermont (VT) is located in the northeastern United States, in the New England
      region

      - Kentucky (KY) is located in the southeastern/east-central United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Vermont is on the eastern side of the United States, bordering New Hampshire
      and near the Atlantic coast

      - Kentucky is more centrally located, west of Vermont


      The longitudinal positioning is what matters here:

      - Areas further west have higher longitude numbers (when using negative numbers
      for western hemisphere)

      - Or lower longitude numbers if using the convention of west being negative
      numbers


      Since Kentucky is west of Vermont in the United States, zip code 40109 in KY
      would be west of zip code 05677 in VT.</think>I need to determine if the Kentucky
      zip code is west of the Vermont zip code by considering their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' locations within the US.

      - Vermont (VT) is located in the northeastern United States, specifically in
      the New England region.

      - Kentucky (KY) is located in the east-central/southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider their east-west positioning relative to each other.

      - Vermont sits on the far eastern edge of the country, bordering New Hampshire
      and near the Atlantic coast.

      - Kentucky is positioned much more centrally in the country.


      Step 3: Apply directional knowledge.

      - In the US, states further west have lower longitude values.

      - Vermont is one of the easternmost states in the continental US.

      - Kentucky is significantly west of Vermont.


      Therefore, zip code 40109 in Kentucky is indeed located west of zip code 05677
      in Vermont.

      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Vermont (VT) is in the northeastern part of the US, bordering Canada

      - Kentucky (KY) is in the eastern central part of the US


      Generally speaking, Kentucky is west of Vermont. But I should verify this more
      precisely by thinking about the relative east-west positioning.


      Vermont is one of the easternmost states in the US, located in New England.

      Kentucky is more centrally located, but still in the eastern half of the US.


      In terms of longitude, Vermont is further east than Kentucky, which means Kentucky
      is west of Vermont.


      Therefore, 40109, KY should be west of 05677, VT.</think># Determining if 40109,
      KY is west of 05677, VT


      I''ll solve this by comparing the geographic locations of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 40109 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 05677 is in Vermont (VT)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Vermont is located in the northeastern part of the United States (New England
      region)

      - Kentucky is located in the east-central part of the United States


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positions

      Looking at a US map, Kentucky is clearly west of Vermont. Vermont borders New
      Hampshire and New York on its eastern and western sides, while Kentucky is much
      further west in the country.


      ## Step 4: Conclude based on state positions

      Since Kentucky is west of Vermont geographically, zip code 40109 in Kentucky
      must be west of zip code 05677 in Vermont.

      3) 05677 is a zip code in Vermont (VT)


      4) Now I need to determine which one is further west. In the US, states in the
      eastern part of the country have lower longitude values (closer to 0), while
      western states have higher longitude values (more negative numbers since we''re
      west of the prime meridian).


      5) Kentucky is located in the east-central part of the United States, while
      Vermont is located in the northeastern part of the United States.


      6) Since Kentucky is more centrally located and Vermont is in the far northeast,
      Kentucky would be west of Vermont.

      - Vermont is one of the easternmost states in the continental US, bordering
      New Hampshire and Canada

      - Kentucky is significantly further west in the country, positioned between
      the Midwest and the Southeast


      ## Step 3: Determine the relative positions

      Looking at a US map, Kentucky is clearly west of Vermont. Any zip code in Kentucky
      (including 40109) would be west of any zip code in Vermont (including 05677).

      In the US, states that are located more westerly have larger longitude values
      (when using negative numbers, they have smaller absolute values). Let me think
      about the general geographic locations of Kentucky and Vermont:


      - Vermont (VT) is in the northeastern United States, bordering Canada and New
      York

      - Kentucky (KY) is in the south-central United States


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Kentucky is definitely west of Vermont. Vermont
      is on the east coast (though not directly on the ocean), while Kentucky is more
      toward the central part of the country.


      Since both zip codes are in their respective states, and Kentucky as a whole
      is west of Vermont as a whole, it''s very likely that zip code 40109 in KY is
      west of zip code 05677 in VT.


      To be completely sure, I would need to look up the exact longitudes of these

      confidently say that any location in Kentucky would be west of any location
      in Vermont.</think>To determine if 40109, KY is located west of 05677, VT, I
      need to consider the geographic positions of these states and their zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the general locations of Kentucky and Vermont in the United
      States.

      - Vermont (VT) is located in the northeastern United States, along the eastern
      seaboard.

      - Kentucky (KY) is located in the south-central part of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the relative east-west positioning.

      - States in the eastern part of the US have smaller longitude values (when using
      negative numbers, they have larger absolute values).

      - States further west have larger longitude values (smaller absolute values
      when negative).


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - Vermont is one of the easternmost states in the continental US.

      - Kentucky is significantly west of Vermont, positioned much more centrally
      in the country.


      Since any location in Kentucky would be west of any location in Vermont based

      The specific zip codes (44012 and 07052) don''t change this general geographical
      relationship - Ohio is always west of New Jersey.


      So 44012, OH (which is in Ohio) must be west of 07052, NJ (which is in New Jersey).</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step:

      - 44012 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 07052 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Ohio is significantly west of New Jersey on the US map

      - All of Ohio is west of all of New Jersey


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      - Since 44012 is in Ohio, and 07052 is in New Jersey, the geographical relationship
      between the states applies to these zip codes as well


      YES, 44012, OH is located west of 07052, NJ.'

      First, I need to identify the two zip codes:

      - 44012, OH (Ohio)

      - 07052, NJ (New Jersey)


      To determine which is further west, I need to think about the geographical positions
      of Ohio and New Jersey in the United States.


      The United States is generally oriented with the west coast on the left side
      of the map and the east coast on the right side. States that are more to the
      left (west) have a lower longitude value than states that are more to the right
      (east).


      Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while New Jersey
      is on the East Coast.


      Specifically:

      - Ohio is bordered by Pennsylvania to its east

      - New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast, east of Pennsylvania


      Since Ohio is west of Pennsylvania, and New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania,
      it follows that Ohio is west of New Jersey.


      Therefore, zip code 44012 in Ohio would be west of zip code 07052 in New Jersey.</think>To
      determine if 44012, OH is located west of 07052, NJ, I need to compare the geographical
      locations of Ohio and New Jersey.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 44012 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 07052 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      - The United States spans from west to east, with the Pacific coast being the
      westernmost part and the Atlantic coast being the easternmost part

      - Ohio is located much further inland from the Atlantic Ocean than New Jersey

      - New Jersey borders the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side

      - Ohio is actually several states west of New Jersey (Pennsylvania sits between
      them)


      Therefore, Ohio is definitively west of New Jersey, which means zip code 44012,
      OH is west of zip code 07052, NJ.


      YES'

      is west of 07052, NJ (New Jersey), I need to think about the geographic locations
      of these states and zip codes.


      In the United States, states generally become more western as you move from
      right to left on a map. New Jersey is on the eastern coast, while Ohio is more
      inland and to the west.


      Specifically:

      - New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast, in the northeastern part of the United
      States

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region, west of Pennsylvania which borders New Jersey


      So in terms of states, Ohio is definitely west of New Jersey.


      Now, the specific zip codes might matter if they were in adjacent states and
      near the borders, but Ohio and New Jersey don''t share a border. There are entire
      states between them (Pennsylvania at minimum).


      Given that 44012 is in Ohio and 07052 is in New Jersey, and Ohio as a whole
      is west of New Jersey, zip code 44012 must be west of zip code 07052.</think>I
      need to determine if a location in Ohio is west of a location in New Jersey
      by comparing their geographic positions.

      - 44012 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 07052 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Ohio is entirely west of New Jersey (with Pennsylvania in between them)


      Step 3: Since all of Ohio is west of all of New Jersey geographically, any zip
      code in Ohio (including 44012) must be west of any zip code in New Jersey (including
      07052).

      Let me determine the approximate locations:


      33901, FL:

      This is a zip code in Florida. Florida is located in the southeastern part of
      the United States.

      Specifically, 33901 is in Fort Myers, Florida, which is on the southwest coast
      of Florida.


      10973, NY:

      This is a zip code in New York state. New York is located in the northeastern
      part of the United States.

      10973 appears to be in the southeastern part of New York state.


      Now, to determine if 33901, FL is west of 10973, NY, I need to compare their
      longitudes.


      The United States generally has lower (more negative) longitudes as you go west.
      The east coast is around -70 to -80 degrees longitude, while the west coast
      is around -120 to -130 degrees longitude.


      Florida is south of New York, but it''s also generally west of New York. Fort
      Myers, FL would be significantly west of any location in New York state.


      So 33901, FL (Fort Myers) should be west of 10973, NY.</think>To answer whether
      33901, FL is located west of 10973, NY, I need to determine the geographical

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 33901 is a zip code in Fort Myers, Florida, located in the southwestern part
      of Florida.

      - 10973 is a zip code in New York state, located in the southeastern part of
      New York.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on the map.

      - New York state is positioned in the northeastern United States.

      - Florida extends southward from the southeastern United States.

      - When looking at a map of the US, Florida is positioned southeast of New York.


      Step 3: Consider longitude specifically (east-west positioning).

      - Despite Florida being "southeastern" relative to New York, the western parts
      of Florida still lie west of New York.

      - Fort Myers (33901) is on Florida''s west coast, putting it well west of any
      location in New York state.

      to determine whether the zip code 75025, TX is located west of 55043, MN.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 75025 is in Texas (TX)

      - 55043 is in Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: I need to recall the relative geographic positions of Texas and Minnesota
      in the United States.

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States

      - Minnesota is located in the northern Midwest


      Step 3: When considering east-west positioning:

      - Texas is generally located west of the Mississippi River but east of states
      like New Mexico and Arizona

      - Minnesota is also west of the Mississippi River in its eastern portions, but
      is definitely east of Texas


      Step 4: If we look at a map of the US, Texas is positioned to the southwest
      of Minnesota. This means that Texas is both south and west of Minnesota.


      Therefore, a location in Texas (75025) would be west of a location in Minnesota
      (55043).</think>I need to determine the east-west relationship between these
      two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 75025 is in Texas (TX)

      - 55043 is in Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States

      - Minnesota is located in the upper Midwest


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      Looking at a US map, Texas is positioned to the southwest of Minnesota. When
      considering longitude (east-west positioning), Texas is generally west of Minnesota.


      Step 4: Verify with more specificity.

      - 75025 is in Plano, Texas, in the eastern part of Texas

      - 55043 is in Lakeland, Minnesota, in the eastern part of Minnesota

      - Even though both are in the eastern portions of their respective states, Texas
      as a whole is west of Minnesota


      YES'
    8cb96506-733d-44ec-9da7-5e0b5b700170: '<think>To determine if 75025, TX is located
      west of 55043, MN, I need to identify the locations of these zip codes and compare
      their geographical positions, specifically their longitudes.


      75025 is a zip code in Texas (TX). It''s in Plano, which is in the Dallas-Fort
      Worth metropolitan area in north Texas.


      55043 is a zip code in Minnesota (MN). I believe it''s in the eastern part of
      Minnesota.


      To determine which is further west, I need to consider the general geography
      of the United States:

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the US

      - Minnesota is located in the upper Midwest


      Generally speaking, Minnesota is east of Texas. The western edge of Minnesota
      is approximately at the longitude of central Texas, and the eastern edge of
      Minnesota is even further east.


      Since 75025 is in the Dallas area (north-central Texas) and 55043 is in Minnesota,
      it''s almost certain that the Texas zip code is west of the Minnesota one.


      West corresponds to a higher negative longitude value (or lower positive longitude
      value) in the northern hemisphere. Since the US is entirely in the northern
      hemisphere, Texas (being further west) would have a higher negative longitude
      than Minnesota.


      So my answer is that 75025, TX is indeed west of 55043, MN.</think>I need to
      determine if 75025, TX is west of 55043, MN by examining their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 75025 is a ZIP code in Plano, Texas, which is in the Dallas-Fort Worth area
      in north-central Texas.

      - 55043 is a ZIP code in Minnesota, located in the upper Midwest region.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Texas is positioned in the south-central part of the US.

      - Minnesota is located in the upper Midwest, significantly east of Texas.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Even though Minnesota is north of Texas, when comparing east-west positioning,
      Texas is clearly west of Minnesota.

      - The entire state of Minnesota lies east of the longitude of the Dallas-Fort
      Worth area.


      YES, 75025, TX is located west of 55043, MN.'

      Let me break it down:


      45439 is in Ohio (OH)

      23834 is in Virginia (VA)

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region

      - Virginia is on the East Coast


      If we think about this geographically, Ohio is to the west of Virginia in terms

      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Looking at a map of the US, Ohio is entirely west of Virginia. The eastern border
      of Ohio doesn''t extend as far east as the western border of Virginia.

      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis

      - The United States generally follows a pattern where states to the west have
      higher first digits in their zip codes

      - Illinois zip codes typically start with 6, while New Jersey zip codes start
      with 0

      - On a map, Illinois is clearly west of New Jersey


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on geographic reality

      - Since Illinois is physically located to the west of New Jersey, any location
      in Illinois (including 60060) would be west of any location in New Jersey (including
      07092)

      To determine which is west of the other, I need to know the relative positions
      of Illinois and New Jersey in the United States.


      The United States has Illinois in the Midwest region and New Jersey on the East
      Coast. Geographically:

      - Illinois is located in the central part of the United States

      - New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard


      Looking at the map of the United States, Illinois is definitely west of New
      Jersey. The entire state of Illinois is west of New Jersey.


      Since 60060 is in Illinois and 07092 is in New Jersey, and Illinois is west
      of New Jersey, then 60060 is west of 07092.</think>To determine if 60060, IL

      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions

      - Looking at a US map, Illinois is significantly west of New Jersey

      - The entire state of Illinois lies west of New Jersey


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion

      Since 60060 is in Illinois, and 07092 is in New Jersey, and Illinois is west
      of New Jersey, it follows that 60060 is west of 07092.

      1. Identify where these zip codes are located

      2. Determine their relative east-west positions


      Let me work through this:


      60060 is a zip code in Illinois (IL). Illinois is in the Midwest region of the
      United States.

      07092 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ). New Jersey is on the East Coast of the
      United States.


      In terms of geography, Illinois is definitely west of New Jersey. The United
      States generally runs with lower numbers on the East Coast and higher numbers
      as you go west, which is also reflected in these zip codes (07xxx vs 60xxx).


      So if 60060 is in Illinois and 07092 is in New Jersey, then 60060 is located
      west of 07092.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of
      these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 60060 is a zip code in Illinois (IL)

      - 07092 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Looking at a map of the United States, Illinois is clearly west of New Jersey

      - All of Illinois is geographically west of all of New Jersey


      Step 4: Conclusion.

      Since 60060 is in Illinois and 07092 is in New Jersey, and Illinois is west
      of New Jersey, the zip code 60060 must be west of 07092.

      U.S. geography to answer this question.


      I need to determine if zip code 60060 in Illinois is west of zip code 07092
      in New Jersey.


      First, I''ll recall the general geographic position of these two states:

      - Illinois (IL) is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New Jersey (NJ) is on the East Coast of the United States


      In terms of relative position, Illinois is definitely west of New Jersey when
      looking at a map of the United States. The entire state of Illinois is west
      of the entire state of New Jersey.


      So any location in Illinois (including zip code 60060) would be west of any
      location in New Jersey (including zip code 07092).


      Therefore, yes, 60060, IL is located west of 07092, NJ.</think>To determine
      if 60060, IL is located west of 07092, NJ, I need to think about the geographic
      positions of these states and their zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 60060 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 07092 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Consider their relative positions.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, Illinois is substantially west
      of New Jersey

      - All of Illinois is west of all of New Jersey


      Step 4: Make the conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      - Since 60060 is in Illinois and 07092 is in New Jersey, and Illinois is entirely
      west of New Jersey, it follows that zip code 60060 must be west of zip code
      07092

      in Illinois (60060) is located west of a ZIP code in New Jersey (07092).


      Let me break this down:

      - 60060 is a ZIP code in Illinois (IL)

      - 07092 is a ZIP code in New Jersey (NJ)


      The question is asking about their relative positions - specifically whether
      the Illinois location is west of the New Jersey location.


      In the United States, Illinois (IL) is located in the Midwest region, while
      New Jersey (NJ) is located on the East Coast. Generally speaking, Illinois is
      west of New Jersey.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - New Jersey is on the East Coast, bordering the Atlantic Ocean

      - Illinois is in the Midwest, bordering the Mississippi River on its western
      edge

      - To travel from New Jersey to Illinois, you would generally travel westward


      Since Illinois is west of New Jersey, ZIP code 60060 in Illinois would be west
      of ZIP code 07092 in New Jersey.</think>To determine if 60060, IL is located
      west of 07092, NJ, I need to consider the geographic locations of these states.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 60060 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 07092 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-east axis

      - Illinois is significantly west of New Jersey

      - All of Illinois is west of all of New Jersey


      Step 4: Therefore, any location in Illinois (including ZIP code 60060) would
      be west of any location in New Jersey (including ZIP code 07092)

      if the zip code 60060 in Illinois (IL) is located west of the zip code 07092
      in New Jersey (NJ).


      To solve this, I need to determine the geographical locations of these zip codes
      and compare them.


      The United States generally has zip codes that increase from east to west. However,
      this is not a strict rule for determining relative positions. Instead, I should
      think about the actual states:


      Illinois (IL) is in the Midwest region of the United States.

      New Jersey (NJ) is on the East Coast of the United States.


      Looking at a map of the United States, Illinois is definitely located west of
      New Jersey. All of Illinois is west of all of New Jersey.


      So regardless of the specific locations of these zip codes within their respective
      states, 60060 in Illinois must be west of 07092 in New Jersey.</think>I need
      to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these zip codes are located.

      - 60060 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 07092 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical positions of these states.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-east axis.

      - Illinois is considerably west of New Jersey on the U.S. map

      - Any location in Illinois would be west of any location in New Jersey


      Therefore, zip code 60060 in Illinois is indeed located west of zip code 07092
      in New Jersey.

      First, let me identify where these zip codes are located:

      - 32129 is a zip code in Florida (FL)

      - 10162 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Generally speaking, Florida is located south and west of New York. The entire
      state of Florida is west of New York when comparing their longitudes.


      If I think about the geographic layout of the United States:

      - New York is in the northeastern part of the country

      - Florida is in the southeastern part of the country


      Looking at the longitude (which measures east-west position), Florida is indeed
      west of New York. The easternmost parts of Florida are still generally west
      of the westernmost parts of New York.


      So 32129, FL would be west of 10162, NY.</think>To answer whether 32129, FL
      is located west of 10162, NY, I need to determine the geographical positions
      of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 32129 is a zip code in Florida (FL)

      - 10162 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positioning of these states.

      Florida is located in the southeastern United States, while New York is in the
      northeastern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis (longitude).

      When looking at a map of the United States, Florida lies significantly west
      of New York. Even the easternmost points of Florida are generally west of the
      westernmost points of New York.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 32129 is in Florida and 10162 is in New York, the Florida zip code would
      be west of the New York zip code.

      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - 32129, FL is in Florida (FL)

      - 10162, NY is in New York (NY)


      In the United States, states are positioned such that:

      - Florida is in the southeastern part of the country

      - New York is in the northeastern part of the country


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - Florida is generally west of New York when comparing locations on the same
      latitude

      - All of Florida is west of all of New York in terms of longitude


      So if we''re asking whether 32129, FL is west of 10162, NY, the answer should
      be YES, because Florida is west of New York on a map of the United States.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 32129 is in Florida (FL)

      - 10162 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions (longitude).

      - Even though Florida is south of New York, the relevant question is about east-west
      positioning

      - On a US map, Florida is positioned to the west of New York

      - All of Florida lies west of New York''s longitude


      Step 4: Verify the specific zip codes.

      - While specific zip codes within states can have different relative positions,
      Florida and New York are far enough apart that any Florida zip code will be
      west of any New York zip code

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 32129, FL is a zip code in Florida

      - 10162, NY is a zip code in New York


      Step 2: Think about the relative geographic positions of Florida and New York
      in the United States.

      The United States has Florida in the southeastern part of the country, while
      New York is in the northeastern part.


      Step 3: Consider compass directions.

      When we say "west of," we''re talking about positions on the east-west axis.
      The further west something is, the closer it is to the Pacific Ocean. The further
      east something is, the closer it is to the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 4: Compare Florida and New York on this east-west axis.

      Florida is generally south of New York, but the question is about east-west
      positioning. Looking at a map of the US:

      - Florida extends further west than New York

      - New York is further east than Florida


      Therefore, 32129, FL (in Florida) would be west of 10162, NY (in New York).</think>To
      determine if 32129, FL is located west of 10162, NY, I need to consider the
      geographic positions of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 32129 is in Florida (FL)

      - 10162 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Florida and New York.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - While Florida is south of New York, when considering just the east-west axis:

      - Florida is generally positioned further west than New York

      - New York is closer to the eastern seaboard


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on general state positions.

      Since Florida is positioned west of New York on the US map (looking at longitude),
      a zip code in Florida (32129) would be west of a zip code in New York (10162).

      First, let''s identify:

      - 32129 is a zip code in Florida (FL)

      - 10162 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      In the United States, states on the east coast include (from north to south):
      Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New
      Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,
      and Florida.


      Florida is south of New York, but the question is asking about east/west positioning,
      not north/south.


      In terms of east/west positioning:

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States


      Generally speaking, Florida is further west than New York. The mainland United
      States tends to have lower longitude numbers (more negative) as you move west.


      So 32129, FL should be west of 10162, NY.</think>I need to determine the relative
      east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these zip codes are located.

      - 32129 is in Florida (FL)

      - 10162 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      While Florida is south of New York, on the east-west axis, Florida actually
      extends further west than New York. The eastern coast of the US curves inward
      as you move south from New York to Florida, placing Florida generally west of
      New York.


      Step 4: Specifically for these zip codes:

      - 32129 (FL) is in east-central Florida

      - 10162 (NY) is in New York City, on the eastern edge of New York state

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions.

      - While Florida is south of New York, we need to determine if it''s west (has
      a more westerly longitude)

      - Looking at the geography of the US, Florida is indeed positioned west of New
      York on the map

      - Any point in Florida would have a larger negative longitude value than a point
      in New York


      Step 4: Specifically for these ZIP codes:

      - 32129 (FL) would follow Florida''s general longitudinal position

      - 10162 (NY) would follow New York''s general longitudinal position


      YES - 32129, FL is located west of 10162, NY.'

      by step to determine if zip code 32129 in Florida is located west of zip code
      10162 in New York.


      Step 1: I need to determine the general locations of these zip codes within
      their states.

      - 32129 is in Florida (FL)

      - 10162 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Let me consider the general geography of these states.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States


      Step 3: Looking at a map of the United States, Florida is positioned significantly
      to the west of New York, especially when comparing locations on the same latitude.


      Step 4: When we talk about east and west in US geography, we''re referring to
      longitude lines. Something with a more western longitude (a smaller number if
      using east longitude, or a larger negative number if using west longitude) is
      west of something with a more eastern longitude.


      Step 5: While specific zip codes might be in different parts of their respective
      states, the entirety of Florida is west of New York when comparing locations
      at similar latitudes. Even the easternmost point of Florida would be west of
      the westernmost point of New York.


      So yes, 32129, FL is located west of 10162, NY.</think>I need to determine if
      the Florida zip code is west of the New York zip code by analyzing their geographic
      positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their general locations.

      - 32129 is in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United States

      - 10162 is in New York (NY), which is in the northeastern United States


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      - Florida lies significantly to the west of New York on the US map

      - The entirety of Florida is west of New York when comparing locations at similar
      latitudes


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - While zip codes can be in different parts of their states, Florida as a whole
      state is positioned west of New York

      - Even the easternmost point of Florida would generally be west of New York


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on geographic positioning.

      - Any location in Florida (including 32129) would be west of any location in
      New York (including 10162)


      YES, 32129, FL is located west of 10162, NY.'

      negative in the Western Hemisphere).


      First, let me identify these locations:

      - 34994 is a zip code in Florida (FL)

      - 08620 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)


      Florida is in the southeastern United States, while New Jersey is in the northeastern
      United States. Generally speaking, Florida is south of New Jersey, but I need
      to determine if it''s west of it.


      Wait, that''s not quite right. Longitude increases as you go eastward. In the
      Western Hemisphere (which includes the United States), longitudes are negative
      numbers, so a more negative number (or a smaller number when considering the
      absolute values) indicates a location further west.


      So I need to determine:

      - Is the longitude of 34994, FL more negative (further west) than the longitude
      of 08620, NJ?


      Florida is generally south and somewhat west of New Jersey, so it''s likely
      that 34994, FL is indeed west of 08620, NJ. But let me think about the general
      geography:


      New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast in the northeast

      Florida is a peninsula extending south from the southeast


      Looking at a mental map, Florida is certainly south of New Jersey, but it''s
      also somewhat west. The eastern coast of Florida would be more west than the
      eastern coast of New Jersey because the US Atlantic coastline angles southwest
      from New England down to Florida.


      So yes, 34994, FL (which is in Florida) would be west of 08620, NJ (which is
      in New Jersey).</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 34994 is a zip code in Stuart, Florida (FL)

      - 08620 is a zip code in Hamilton, New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      Florida is located in the southeastern United States, while New Jersey is in
      the northeastern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      The east coast of the United States follows a northeastern to southwestern diagonal.
      This means that locations further south along the Atlantic coast are generally
      also further west.


      Step 4: Make the specific comparison.

      New Jersey (including Hamilton) is positioned along the northeastern Atlantic
      coast, while Florida (including Stuart) is positioned significantly further
      southwest.

      - 34994 is a zip code in Florida (FL)\n- 08620 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)\n\
      \nFlorida is generally located in the southeastern United States, while New\
      \ Jersey is in the northeastern United States. Looking at a map of the US, Florida\
      \ is indeed to the south of New Jersey, but the question is specifically about\
      \ east/west positioning.\n\nGenerally speaking:\n- The East Coast of the US\

      \ they're both on the East Coast\n- Florida extends further west than most of\
      \ the East Coast states, including New Jersey\n\nWithout the exact coordinates,\
      \ I know that Florida is generally west of New Jersey when comparing their longitude.\
      \ So 34994, FL is likely west of 08620, NJ.\n\nLet me confirm my reasoning:\
      \ Florida is indeed west of New Jersey on a map. Both states are on the East\
      \ Coast, but Florida extends further west. Therefore, a zip code in Florida\
      \ (34994) would be west of a zip code in New Jersey (08620).</think># Is 34994,\

      \ positions\n- New Jersey is located on the northeastern coast of the United\

      \ is certainly south of New Jersey, I need to determine east/west positioning\n\
      \n## Step 3: Compare longitudinal positions\n- The east coast of the US curves\
      \ slightly, with Florida positioned to the west of New Jersey\n- New Jersey\
      \ is approximately around 74-75\xB0 W longitude\n- Florida's east coast (including\
      \ Stuart) is approximately around 80\xB0 W longitude\n- A larger westerly longitude\
      \ number means further west\n\n## Conclusion\nYES - 34994, FL is located west\

      2. 08620 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      3. To determine which is west of the other, I need to know the relative positions

      and New Jersey) is on the right side.


      Florida is a southeastern state, located along the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic
      Ocean. New Jersey is a northeastern state, also on the Atlantic coast.


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), Florida is generally to the west
      of New Jersey. The continental United States has states arranged roughly from
      west to east, and Florida is further to the south and west compared to New Jersey.

      I need to consider the geographic locations of these zip codes. In the United

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative east-west positioning

      3. Conclude if 74105, OK is west of 32603, FL


      First, let me identify these zip codes:

      - 74105 is in Oklahoma (OK)

      - 32603 is in Florida (FL)


      In the United States, Oklahoma is significantly west of Florida. Florida is
      in the southeastern part of the country, while Oklahoma is in the south-central
      region.


      On a map of the US:

      - Florida is on the far eastern side, bordering the Atlantic Ocean

      - Oklahoma is much further west, closer to the center of the country


      Therefore, any location in Oklahoma would be west of any location in Florida.

      - 74105 is in Oklahoma (OK)

      - 32603 is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these states.

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central region of the United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Oklahoma is significantly west of Florida on the US map

      - Florida borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast

      - Oklahoma is closer to the central part of the country


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on geographic positioning.

      Since any location in Oklahoma would be west of any location in Florida, zip
      code 74105 in Oklahoma must be west of zip code 32603 in Florida.

      (FL).


      To determine this, I need to consider the relative geographic positions of these
      two zip codes.


      The United States broadly follows a pattern where locations further west have
      higher longitude numbers (more negative, since the US is in the western hemisphere).
      States in the western part of the US are generally west of states in the eastern
      part.


      Oklahoma is a state in the central part of the United States, while Florida
      is in the southeastern corner of the United States.


      Geographically speaking, Oklahoma is clearly west of Florida. Any location in
      Oklahoma would be west of any location in Florida.


      Since 74105 is in Oklahoma (OK) and 32603 is in Florida (FL), it follows that
      74105 in OK is west of 32603 in FL.</think>To determine if 74105, OK is located
      west of 32603, FL, I need to consider the geographic positions of these ZIP

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 74105 is in Oklahoma (OK)

      - 32603 is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Oklahoma is located in the central part of the United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern corner of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - All of Oklahoma is west of all of Florida on a map of the United States

      - The entire state of Oklahoma has a longitude that is west of Florida''s longitude


      Step 4: Since the ZIP code 74105 is in Oklahoma, and the ZIP code 32603 is in
      Florida, the ZIP code in Oklahoma must be west of the ZIP code in Florida.

      In the United States, states that are further west have higher longitude values

      Oklahoma is definitely west of Florida on a map of the United States. Oklahoma
      borders Texas to its south and Kansas to its north, and is considerably west
      of the Mississippi River. Florida is on the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic
      Ocean in the southeastern corner of the United States.

      On a map of the United States, Oklahoma lies significantly west of Florida.
      Oklahoma is west of the Mississippi River, while Florida is on the far eastern

      Let me analyze these zip codes:

      - 15139 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 07432 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)


      In the US, zip codes are generally organized such that:

      Pennsylvania is generally west of New Jersey in terms of geographic location.
      Pennsylvania borders New Jersey on New Jersey''s western side.


      Additionally, the zip code numbering system generally follows west-to-east patterns,

      - 0 is the first digit for NJ, which covers areas in the northeast

      - 1 is the first digit for PA, which is generally west of NJ


      Additionally, I know that Pennsylvania is geographically located west of New
      Jersey in the United States. The entire state of PA is west of NJ.


      So zip code 15139 in PA would be west of zip code 07432 in NJ.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify what states these zip codes are in.

      - 15139 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 07432 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Pennsylvania is located west of New Jersey

      - New Jersey borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast

      - Pennsylvania is inland and positioned to the west of New Jersey


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      - The first digit of zip codes generally follows a west-to-east pattern

      - 0 and 1 are both eastern regions, but the "1" prefix (15139) covers an area
      west of the "0" prefix (07432)


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since 15139 is in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania is entirely west of New Jersey
      where 07432 is located, the first zip code must be west of the second.

      west of 07432, NJ, I need to:


      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative positions (east-west relationship)


      Let me analyze:


      Zip code 15139 is in Pennsylvania (PA). Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey.

      Zip code 07432 is in New Jersey (NJ). New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania.


      Generally speaking, Pennsylvania zip codes (which start with 15xxx) are west
      of New Jersey zip codes (which start with 07xxx).


      More specifically:

      - PA zip codes that start with 15xxx are typically in western Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh
      area)

      - NJ zip codes that start with 07xxx are typically in northern New Jersey


      So based on the state locations and the zip code patterns, 15139, PA would be
      west of 07432, NJ.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positioning
      of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their general positions.

      - 15139 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 07432 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Pennsylvania is located west of New Jersey on the US map.


      Step 3: Look more specifically at the zip codes.

      - The 151xx zip codes are typically in western Pennsylvania (around the Pittsburgh
      area)

      - The 074xx zip codes are in northern New Jersey


      Step 4: Combine this information to determine the answer.

      Since Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey, and specifically zip code 15139 is
      in western PA while 07432 is in NJ, the Pennsylvania location must be west of
      the New Jersey location.


      YES, 15139, PA is located west of 07432, NJ.'

      if the location with zip code 15139 in Pennsylvania (PA) is located west of
      the location with zip code 07432 in New Jersey (NJ).


      To solve this problem:


      1. I need to identify the general locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their relative east-west positions


      First, US zip codes are organized somewhat geographically, with the first digits
      generally indicating region. The first digit "1" typically covers northeastern
      states (including PA) and "0" covers areas in the northeast including NJ.


      But more specifically:

      - 15139 is in Pennsylvania, which is generally west of New Jersey

      - 07432 is in New Jersey, which is generally east of Pennsylvania


      Pennsylvania borders New Jersey on New Jersey''s western side. Pennsylvania
      is unambiguously west of New Jersey geographically.


      Since 15139 is in PA and 07432 is in NJ, the PA location must be west of the
      NJ location.</think># Is 15139, PA located west of 07432, NJ?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two zip codes.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) First, I''ll identify the states: 15139 is in Pennsylvania (PA) and 07432
      is in New Jersey (NJ).


      2) Looking at the geographic relationship between these states: Pennsylvania
      is located directly west of New Jersey. These states share a border, with NJ
      on the east and PA on the west.


      3) The zip code numbering system in the US generally follows geographic patterns.
      The lower first digit in NJ''s zip code (0) versus PA''s (1) also suggests the
      eastern position of NJ, as east coast zip codes typically start with lower numbers.


      4) Since 15139 is in Pennsylvania and 07432 is in New Jersey, and Pennsylvania
      is west of New Jersey, it follows that the PA location must be west of the NJ
      location.


      Therefore, YES, 15139, PA is located west of 07432, NJ.'

      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative east-west positions


      First, let''s think about the general geography of Pennsylvania and New Jersey:

      - Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey

      - New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast

      - Pennsylvania is inland from New Jersey


      Given the general geography, Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey. So any location
      in Pennsylvania should be west of any location in New Jersey.


      The zip code 15139 is in Pennsylvania (PA), and the zip code 07432 is in New

      Since Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey, it''s reasonable to conclude that
      15139, PA is located west of 07432, NJ.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the states for each zip code.

      - 15139 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 07432 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Pennsylvania borders New Jersey along NJ''s western edge

      - New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast

      - Pennsylvania is inland, to the west of New Jersey


      Step 3: Consider the zip code patterns.

      - Pennsylvania zip codes typically begin with 15-19

      - New Jersey zip codes typically begin with 07-08

      - These codes are consistent with standard geographical distribution


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on state positions.

      Since any location in Pennsylvania is west of any location in New Jersey (as
      Pennsylvania lies entirely west of New Jersey), zip code 15139 in PA must be
      west of zip code 07432 in NJ.

      For US zip codes, we can generally use the first digit to get a rough idea of
      the geographic location:

      - Zip codes starting with 0-1 are in the Northeast

      - Zip codes starting with 3 are typically in the Southeast (including Georgia)

      - 30346 is in Georgia, which is in the southeastern United States

      - 10918 is in New York, which is in the northeastern United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Georgia is generally west of New York

      - Zip code 30346 (GA) starts with "3" indicating Southeast region

      - Zip code 10918 (NY) starts with "1" indicating Northeast region

      30346 is a zip code in Georgia (GA).

      10918 is a zip code in New York (NY).


      Generally speaking, Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, while
      New York is in the northeastern United States. When comparing east-west positioning
      (longitude), Georgia is typically west of New York.


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - The East Coast runs roughly north-south with states like Maine, New Hampshire,
      Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, etc.

      - Moving westward from the East Coast, you reach states like Pennsylvania, Ohio,
      etc.

      - Further west you get to states like Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, etc. in the
      southeast.


      Wait, that''s not right. Let me correct this. Georgia is actually southeast
      of New York. When comparing purely east-west positioning:

      - New York is further east than Georgia

      - This means Georgia is west of New York


      So 30346, GA should be west of 10918, NY.</think>To determine if 30346, GA is
      located west of 10918, NY, I need to consider the geographic positions of these
      zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 30346 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 10918 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions (longitude).

      - When looking at a US map, Georgia is positioned to the west of New York

      - All of Georgia is west of all of New York in terms of longitude


      Step 4: Since the zip codes 30346 and 10918 are in Georgia and New York respectively,
      the same east-west relationship applies to them.


      YES, 30346, GA is located west of 10918, NY.'

      positions of two US zip codes to determine if one is west of the other.


      Let me break this down:

      1. 30346 is a zip code in GA (Georgia)

      2. 10918 is a zip code in NY (New York)


      To determine which one is west of the other, I need to know the general locations
      of these states:


      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States.

      New York is located in the northeastern United States.


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Georgia is south of New York, but also west
      of it. The eastern seaboard of the US curves, with NY being further east than
      GA.


      So generally speaking, any location in Georgia would be west of any location
      in New York.


      Therefore 30346, GA should be west of 10918, NY.</think>I need to determine
      if the zip code in Georgia is west of the zip code in New York.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions on the US map.

      Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States.

      New York (NY) is located in the northeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic orientation of these states.

      While Georgia is south of New York, it''s also important to note that the US
      eastern coastline curves. New York extends farther east than Georgia does.


      Step 3: Compare the general longitude of the states.

      Georgia''s longitude range is generally west of New York''s longitude range.
      Even the easternmost parts of Georgia are typically west of most of New York
      state.


      Step 4: Consider the specific zip codes.

      Without looking up the exact coordinates, we can reasonably conclude that a
      zip code in Georgia (30346) would be west of a zip code in New York (10918)
      based on the states'' relative positions.

      (Georgia) is located west of 01430, MA (Massachusetts).


      In the US, states that are more to the west have higher longitude values. The
      continental US roughly spans from around 67 degrees west longitude (Maine) to
      about 124 degrees west longitude (Washington state).


      To answer this question, I need to know the relative positions of Georgia and
      Massachusetts:


      - Massachusetts is a northeastern state, located on the east coast

      - Georgia is a southeastern state, also on the east coast but further south


      In terms of east-west positioning, Georgia is generally west of Massachusetts.
      The eastern coast of the US curves, with Massachusetts jutting out eastward
      more than Georgia does.


      Let me check more specifically about these zip codes:

      - 31636 is a zip code in Georgia

      - 01430 is a zip code in Massachusetts


      Without looking up the exact longitude coordinates, I can use general geographic
      knowledge: Massachusetts is in the far northeast of the contiguous US, while
      Georgia is in the southeast. On a map of the US, Georgia would be to the west
      of Massachusetts.


      So yes, 31636, GA would be located west of 01430, MA.</think># Is 31636, GA
      located west of 01430, MA?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two zip codes.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) 31636 is a zip code in Georgia (GA), which is a southeastern state.

      2) 01430 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA), which is a northeastern state.

      3) In the United States, the east coast curves - with the northeastern states
      (including Massachusetts) jutting out further east than the southeastern states
      (including Georgia).

      4) When comparing east-west positions (longitude), Massachusetts is further
      east than Georgia.

      5) Therefore, Georgia is west of Massachusetts.

      6) Since 31636 is in Georgia and 01430 is in Massachusetts, the Georgia zip
      code must be west of the Massachusetts zip code.


      YES'

      determine if 31636, GA (Georgia) is located west of 01430, MA (Massachusetts).


      In the United States, locations that are west of other locations have a greater
      longitude (more specifically, they are at a more negative longitude since the
      US is in the western hemisphere).


      However, I don''t have the exact longitudes of these zip codes memorized. But
      I do know the general geographical positions of the states:

      - Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Massachusetts (MA) is located in the northeastern United States


      On a map of the US, Georgia is positioned to the south and west of Massachusetts.
      So generally speaking, locations in Georgia would be west of locations in Massachusetts.

      - 01430 is in Massachusetts (MA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - While Georgia is south of Massachusetts, it''s also positioned to the west
      of Massachusetts on a map of the United States.

      - All of Georgia is west of all of Massachusetts in terms of longitude.


      Step 4: Conclude based on the states'' positions.

      - Since any location in Georgia (including zip code 31636) is west of any location
      in Massachusetts (including zip code 01430), the answer is clear.

      31636 in Georgia (GA) is located west of the zip code 01430 in Massachusetts
      (MA).


      To do this, I need to understand the relative locations of these states in the
      US. The US mainland roughly has states arranged from east coast (Atlantic Ocean)
      to west coast (Pacific Ocean).


      Massachusetts (MA) is on the east coast of the US, in the northeastern region
      known as New England.


      Georgia (GA) is also on the east coast but in the southeastern region of the
      US.


      If I''m thinking about the map of the United States:

      - Massachusetts is further north and east

      - Georgia is further south


      When comparing east-west positions, we need to consider longitude. States that
      are further east have higher longitude values (when expressed as negative numbers,
      they have smaller absolute values).


      Massachusetts is on the northeastern coast, which is further east than Georgia,
      which is on the southeastern coast.


      Since Georgia is west of Massachusetts, zip code 31636 in GA would be west of
      zip code 01430 in MA.</think>To determine if 31636, GA is located west of 01430,
      MA, I need to consider the geographic positions of Georgia and Massachusetts.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the states.

      - Massachusetts (MA) is located in the northeastern United States on the Atlantic
      coast.

      - Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States, also on the Atlantic
      coast but further south.


      Step 2: Consider the east-west relationship between these states.

      - When looking at a map of the US, Massachusetts is positioned in the far northeast.

      - Georgia is positioned not only south but also west of Massachusetts.


      Step 3: Verify the relative longitude.

      - All of Georgia lies west of Massachusetts on a map.

      - Even the easternmost point of Georgia is west of the westernmost point of
      Massachusetts.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 31636 is in Georgia, and 01430 is in Massachusetts, the Georgia zip
      code must be west of the Massachusetts zip code.

      31636 is a zip code in Georgia (GA).

      01430 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA).


      Looking at the geographic positions of these states in the US:

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States.

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Georgia is generally west of Massachusetts.
      The eastern coast of the US runs in a roughly northeast-southwest direction,
      with New England (including Massachusetts) being in the northeast, and the southeastern
      states (including Georgia) being further southwest.


      So in terms of longitude, a location in Georgia would typically be west of a
      location in Massachusetts. This means that 31636, GA is likely west of 01430,
      MA.</think>I need to determine if 31636, GA is west of 01430, MA by comparing

      - 01430 is in Massachusetts (MA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Despite Georgia being "southeastern" and Massachusetts being "northeastern,"
      when comparing east-west positioning (longitude), Georgia lies to the west of
      Massachusetts.

      - The entire state of Georgia is west of Massachusetts on a map of the United
      States.


      Step 4: Conclude about the specific zip codes.

      if one US zip code (28107 in North Carolina) is located west of another zip
      code (08080 in New Jersey).


      To answer this, I need to reason about the relative positions of these two locations
      in the United States.


      First, I know that North Carolina (NC) and New Jersey (NJ) are two different
      states on the East Coast of the United States.


      Geographically, New Jersey is located in the northeastern United States, while
      North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States, but also extends
      further west than New Jersey.


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), states that are further west
      have a higher longitude value when using western hemisphere coordinates (which
      are negative numbers, but larger absolute values mean further west).


      North Carolina is generally southwest of New Jersey. This means that locations
      in North Carolina are typically both south and west of locations in New Jersey.


      Without knowing the exact coordinates of these specific zip codes, I can rely
      on the general geographical relationship between the two states. Since 28107
      is in North Carolina and 08080 is in New Jersey, and North Carolina is west
      of New Jersey, it is very likely that 28107, NC is indeed west of 08080, NJ.


      Therefore, my answer would be YES.</think># Is 28107, NC located west of 08080,

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 28107 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 08080 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - North Carolina is also on the eastern seaboard, but is positioned southwest
      of New Jersey


      ## Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      - Generally, any location in North Carolina will be west of any location in
      New Jersey

      - This is because the entire state of North Carolina is positioned west of New
      Jersey on a map


      ## Conclusion

      Since 28107 is in North Carolina and 08080 is in New Jersey, and North Carolina
      is west of New Jersey, zip code 28107 must be west of zip code 08080.

      of 08080, NJ, I need to find their relative geographic positions.


      First, let me identify these locations:

      - 28107 is a ZIP code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 08080 is a ZIP code in New Jersey (NJ)


      Now, I need to consider their relative positions on a map of the United States.
      Looking at the geographical layout of the US:


      North Carolina is located on the east coast of the United States, but it is
      south and west of New Jersey. New Jersey is also on the east coast, but further
      northeast than North Carolina.


      Since we''re specifically asking about east-west positioning (not north-south),
      I need to determine if North Carolina''s ZIP code 28107 is west of New Jersey''s
      ZIP code 08080.


      Generally speaking, any location in North Carolina would be west of any location
      in New Jersey because North Carolina is positioned west of New Jersey on the
      map. This is because the east coast of the US curves, with New Jersey being

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 28107 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 08080 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      North Carolina and New Jersey are both on the eastern seaboard of the United
      States. However, due to the curvature of the coastline, New Jersey is positioned
      further to the northeast, while North Carolina is further to the southwest.


      ## Step 3: Compare longitude (east-west position)

      When comparing east-west positions, we''re looking at longitude. New Jersey
      is further east than North Carolina on a map of the United States. This means
      North Carolina is west of New Jersey.


      ## Step 4: Apply to specific ZIP codes

      Since 28107 is in North Carolina and 08080 is in New Jersey, the ZIP code in
      North Carolina would be west of the ZIP code in New Jersey.


      Therefore, YES, 28107, NC is located west of 08080, NJ.'

      1. Understand that US zip codes have geographical correspondence

      2. Determine the locations of these zip codes

      3. Compare their east-west positions


      Let me think about the states first:

      - NC is North Carolina, which is on the east coast, but south of New Jersey

      - NJ is New Jersey, which is on the east coast


      In terms of east-west positioning, generally:

      - States on the east coast align roughly north-south

      - However, the coastline isn''t perfectly straight

      - Generally speaking, North Carolina is slightly west of New Jersey because
      the US eastern coastline curves


      Now for the specific zip codes:

      - 28107 appears to be a North Carolina zip code

      - 08080 appears to be a New Jersey zip code


      Based on the general geography of the US east coast, locations in North Carolina
      tend to be west of locations in New Jersey. This is because the eastern coastline
      of the US curves, with New Jersey jutting out more to the east than North Carolina.

      - 28107 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 08080 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geography of the US east coast

      The US eastern coastline curves from northeast to southwest. New Jersey is located
      in the northeast part of the east coast, while North Carolina is further south
      along the coast.


      ## Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions

      Due to the curvature of the coastline, locations in North Carolina generally
      lie to the west of locations in New Jersey. The Atlantic Ocean coastline in
      New Jersey is further east than the coastline in North Carolina.

      New Jersey is located in the northeastern part.


      Geographically, North Carolina is south of New Jersey, but the question is specifically
      about east-west positioning.


      I know that North Carolina is generally west of New Jersey. The entire state

      The United States generally has states arranged with the East Coast on the right
      (eastern side) and the West Coast on the left (western side) when looking at

      North Carolina (NC) is a state located on the East Coast of the United States,
      but it is south of New Jersey.

      New Jersey (NJ) is also a state located on the East Coast of the United States.


      When considering east-west positioning (longitude):

      - New Jersey is positioned further east

      - North Carolina is positioned further west


      So any location in North Carolina would generally be west of any location in

      50703, IA is west of 49453, MI, I need to determine the relative geographic
      positions of these two zip codes.


      Let me break this down:

      1. 50703 is in Iowa (IA)

      2. 49453 is in Michigan (MI)


      First, I know that Iowa is generally west of Michigan in the United States.
      Iowa is in the Midwest, bordering the Mississippi River on its eastern edge,
      while Michigan is further east, bordering the Great Lakes.


      If we look at the general geographic layout of US states, we''d see:

      - Iowa is positioned in the middle of the country

      - Michigan is positioned more to the east


      Since these are specific zip codes, I should be more precise, but the state
      locations already give us a strong indication. Iowa is entirely west of Michigan,
      so any location in Iowa would be west of any location in Michigan.


      Therefore, 50703, IA is indeed west of 49453, MI.</think># Reasoning step by
      step


      To determine if 50703, IA is west of 49453, MI, I need to consider the geographic
      locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 50703 is in Iowa (IA)

      - 49453 is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Michigan is also in the Midwest, but positioned further east


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Iowa shares its eastern border with Illinois and Wisconsin

      - Michigan is east of both Illinois and Wisconsin

      - Therefore, Iowa is entirely west of Michigan on a map of the United States


      Step 4: Since all points in Iowa are west of all points in Michigan, any zip
      code in Iowa (including 50703) must be west of any zip code in Michigan (including
      49453).

      To solve this, I need to know the relative positions of these two zip codes,
      or more generally, the relative positions of Iowa and Michigan.


      In the US, states generally follow a west-to-east ordering as follows (focusing
      on the Midwest region):

      - Iowa is in the Midwest, bordering the Mississippi River on its east side

      - Michigan is also in the Midwest, but it''s further east than Iowa, bordering
      the Great Lakes


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Iowa is west of Illinois, which is west of Indiana, which is west of Michigan

      - So Iowa is definitely west of Michigan


      Since 50703 is in Iowa (IA) and 49453 is in Michigan (MI), and Iowa is west

      1. 99207 is a ZIP code in Washington state (WA)

      2. 82609 is a ZIP code in Wyoming state (WY)

      3. Geographically, Washington state is located on the Pacific coast of the United
      States

      4. Wyoming is an inland state, located to the east of Washington

      5. Washington state is entirely west of Wyoming state on the map

      6. Therefore, any location in Washington (including 99207) must be west of any
      location in Wyoming (including 82609)


      YES, 99207, WA is located west of 82609, WY.'
    2331d153-5ed2-4b60-a161-d89b9b69dd33: '<think>I need to determine if zip code
      99207 in Washington (WA) is located west of zip code 82609 in Wyoming (WY).


      Since we''re looking at zip codes in the United States, I''ll use geographic
      knowledge about these states:


      1. Washington state is located on the Pacific coast in the northwestern United
      States.

      2. Wyoming is a landlocked state in the western United States, but it''s east
      of Washington.


      In terms of geography, Washington state is entirely west of Wyoming. Any location
      in Washington would be west of any location in Wyoming.


      Therefore, zip code 99207 in Washington would be west of zip code 82609 in Wyoming.</think>To
      determine if 99207, WA is located west of 82609, WY, I need to analyze their
      geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 99207 is in Washington state (WA)

      - 82609 is in Wyoming state (WY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Washington is located on the Pacific coast in the northwestern United States

      - Wyoming is a landlocked state in the western United States, but positioned
      east of Washington


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Washington state is entirely west of Wyoming state on the US map

      - All locations in Washington are west of all locations in Wyoming


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on state positions.

      Since 99207 is in Washington and 82609 is in Wyoming, and Washington is completely
      west of Wyoming, the zip code 99207 must be west of 82609.


      YES'

      if 99207, WA is located west of 82609, WY.


      To figure this out, I need to understand the geography of these zip codes:

      - 99207 is a zip code in Washington state (WA)

      - 82609 is a zip code in Wyoming state (WY)


      US states are positioned such that:

      - Washington state is on the west coast of the United States

      - Wyoming is an inland state, located east of Washington


      So in general, any location in Washington would be west of any location in Wyoming,
      because Washington as a whole state is west of Wyoming.


      Therefore, 99207, WA would be located west of 82609, WY.</think>I need to determine
      if 99207, WA is located west of 82609, WY by examining their geographical positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 99207 is in Washington state (WA)

      - 82609 is in Wyoming state (WY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic locations of these states.

      Washington state is located on the Pacific coast in the northwestern United
      States, while Wyoming is an inland state in the western United States.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Washington is positioned entirely to the west of Wyoming on a map of the United
      States. The easternmost part of Washington is still west of the westernmost
      part of Wyoming.


      Step 4: Since zip code 99207 is in Washington and zip code 82609 is in Wyoming,
      the geographic relationship between the states determines the relationship between
      these specific zip codes.

      In the US, locations in the western part of the country are generally west of
      locations in the eastern part. Let me think about the relative positions of
      Michigan and New Jersey:


      Michigan is in the Midwest region of the United States, bordering the Great
      Lakes.

      New Jersey is on the East Coast of the United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean.


      Generally speaking, Michigan is west of New Jersey. But let''s be more specific
      about these particular zip codes.


      Zip codes in the US have some geographical organization. The first digit often
      indicates a broad region, with lower numbers generally being in the eastern
      US and higher numbers in the western parts.


      48085 starts with 4, which typically covers parts of the Midwest (including
      Michigan).

      08750 starts with 0, which typically covers the northeastern states (including
      New Jersey).


      Based on the zip code structure alone, a zip code starting with 4 would be west
      of a zip code starting with 0.


      Additionally, I know that Michigan as a state is geographically west of New
      Jersey, regardless of the specific locations within those states.


      So, based on both the geographical positions of the states and the zip code
      structure, 48085, MI would be west of 08750, NJ.</think>To determine if 48085,
      MI is west of 08750, NJ, I need to compare the geographical locations of these
      zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 48085 is in Michigan (MI)

      - 08750 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      - Michigan is significantly west of New Jersey on the US map

      - All of Michigan is west of all of New Jersey geographically


      Step 4: Although specific zip codes can be in different parts of their respective
      states, the entire state of Michigan lies west of the entire state of New Jersey,
      so any location in Michigan must be west of any location in New Jersey.

      First, let me identify these locations:

      - 48085 is a ZIP code in Michigan (MI)

      - 08750 is a ZIP code in New Jersey (NJ)


      Now, I need to think about the relative positions of Michigan and New Jersey
      in the United States:


      The United States is oriented such that when looking at a standard map:

      - West is to the left

      - East is to the right


      Michigan is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while New Jersey
      is located on the East Coast.


      Michigan is west of New Jersey, meaning it''s situated more toward the left
      side of the map of the United States than New Jersey.


      Since 48085 is in Michigan and 08750 is in New Jersey, and Michigan is west
      of New Jersey, it follows that 48085, MI is west of 08750, NJ.</think># Is 48085,

      Michigan is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while New Jersey
      is on the East Coast.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis

      On a map of the United States, Michigan is positioned to the west of New Jersey.
      The entire state of Michigan lies west of New Jersey.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific ZIP codes

      Since 48085 is in Michigan and 08750 is in New Jersey, and Michigan is west
      of New Jersey, it follows that 48085 must be west of 08750.

      - 03784 is in New Hampshire (NH)


      Step 2: Think about the general geographic positions of these states in the
      US.

      - New York is in the northeastern US, but west of New Hampshire

      - New Hampshire is on the eastern coast, in New England


      Step 3: More specifically:

      - New York extends from the Atlantic coast westward to the Great Lakes

      - New Hampshire is on the Atlantic coast, east of New York


      Step 4: Since zip codes generally follow geographic patterns, a zip code in
      NY (14206) should be west of a zip code in NH (03784), assuming they''re both

      Let me double check if 14206 is in a western part of NY or an eastern part,
      and if 03784 is in a western part of NH or an eastern part, as this could affect
      the final answer.


      Actually, without specific city information, I can rely on the general fact

      New York state is located to the west of New Hampshire. The entire state of
      New Hampshire lies east of New York on the U.S. map.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 14206 is in NY and 03784 is in NH, and NY is west of NH, it follows that

      1) 14206 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      I need to determine their relative positions. In the US, New York is located
      to the west of New Hampshire. New Hampshire is in New England, on the east coast,
      while New York is to its west.


      Let me verify this by thinking about the general geography:

      - New Hampshire borders Maine to the east, Massachusetts to the south, Vermont
      to the west, and Canada to the north.

      - New York is west of Vermont, which is west of New Hampshire.


      So generally, New York state is west of New Hampshire state. Now I should check

      14206 appears to be in the Buffalo area of New York, which is in the western

      1) First, I need to identify the states: 14206 is in New York (NY) and 03784
      is in New Hampshire (NH).


      2) Looking at US geography, New York State is located to the west of New Hampshire.
      New Hampshire is in New England on the eastern seaboard, while New York is positioned

      3) More specifically, 14206 is a zip code for an area in Buffalo, NY, which

      to determine if the zip code 58501 in North Dakota (ND) is located west of the
      zip code 77362 in Texas (TX).


      In the US, zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the
      east and higher numbers are in the west. However, this pattern isn''t perfect
      for comparing across different states, so I should check the actual locations.


      Let me think about the geographic positions of North Dakota and Texas:

      - North Dakota is a northern state that borders Canada

      - Texas is a southern state that borders Mexico

      - In terms of east-west positioning, North Dakota is generally west of Texas


      To be more precise about these specific zip codes:

      - 58501 appears to be in central North Dakota (possibly near Bismarck)

      - 77362 appears to be in eastern Texas


      The entire state of North Dakota is west of most of Texas. Even the easternmost
      part of North Dakota is likely to be west of the easternmost part of Texas.
      Since 77362 is in eastern Texas, and 58501 is in North Dakota, it''s very likely

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Zip code 58501 is in North Dakota (ND), likely in the Bismarck area

      - Zip code 77362 is in Texas (TX), likely in the eastern part of Texas


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions

      - North Dakota is a northern state that borders Canada

      - Texas is a southern state that borders Mexico

      - Looking at a map of the US, North Dakota is positioned significantly to the
      west of eastern Texas


      ## Step 3: Compare the general longitude patterns

      - Zip codes in the western states generally have lower first digits (5 for ND
      versus 7 for TX)

      - The entire state of North Dakota is west of the eastern portion of Texas where
      77362 would be located


      Based on this analysis, 58501 in North Dakota is indeed west of 77362 in Texas.

      - 58501 is in North Dakota (ND), likely in the Bismarck area (central North
      Dakota)

      - 77362 is in Texas (TX), likely in the eastern part of Texas (possibly near

      Even though Texas extends quite far westward, zip code 77362 is in eastern Texas,
      while 58501 is in central North Dakota. On a map, if you drew a line directly

      to determine if the zip code 76210 in Texas is located west of zip code 61611
      in Illinois.


      First, let me recall the general geographic relationship between Texas and Illinois:

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the United States

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Generally speaking, Texas is west of Illinois


      Now, let''s consider the specific zip codes:

      - 76210 is in Texas (TX)

      - 61611 is in Illinois (IL)


      Since Texas as a whole is west of Illinois, it''s very likely that any location
      in Texas would be west of any location in Illinois. There might be some extreme
      eastern parts of Texas that could be at a similar longitude to western parts
      of Illinois, but this is unlikely.


      Given that:

      1. Texas is generally west of Illinois on a map of the United States

      2. The zip code 76210 is in Texas

      3. The zip code 61611 is in Illinois


      It''s reasonable to conclude that zip code 76210 in Texas is west of zip code
      61611 in Illinois.</think>I need to determine if 76210, TX is west of 61611,
      IL by comparing their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 76210 is in Texas (TX)

      - 61611 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - When looking at a US map, Texas is positioned to the west of Illinois


      Step 3: Consider specific locations within these states.

      - Even the easternmost parts of Texas are generally west of the westernmost
      parts of Illinois

      - The specific zip codes don''t change this general east-west relationship between
      the states


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on geographic positioning.

      Since Texas is west of Illinois, and 76210 is in Texas while 61611 is in Illinois,
      the zip code 76210 must be west of 61611.

      1. Identify the locations of both zip codes

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west)


      76210 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      61611 is a zip code in Illinois (IL)


      In terms of US geography:

      - Texas is located in the southern central part of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Texas is generally west of Illinois on a map of the United States

      - The continental US has states roughly arranged from west (Pacific coast) to
      east (Atlantic coast)

      - Texas is significantly further west than Illinois


      More specifically:

      - Texas is typically in the Central and Mountain time zones

      - Illinois is in the Central time zone

      - States further west have "earlier" time zones


      Therefore, since 76210 is in Texas, and 61611 is in Illinois, and Texas is west
      of Illinois, 76210 is west of 61611.</think># Is 76210, TX located west of 61611,

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 76210 is in Texas (TX)

      - 61611 is in Illinois (IL)


      ## Step 2: Determine relative positions

      - Looking at a US map, Texas is located in the south-central part of the United
      States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region

      - When comparing east-west positioning, Texas is generally west of Illinois

      - This is also reflected in time zones: both states are primarily in the Central
      Time Zone, but Texas extends into the Mountain Time Zone on its western edge


      ## Step 3: Conclusion

      Since 76210 is in Texas, and Texas is west of Illinois (where 61611 is located),
      the zip code 76210 is west of 61611.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 76210 is in Texas (TX)

      - 61611 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Determine the general geographic relationship of Texas and Illinois.

      Texas is located to the south and west of Illinois in the United States. Illinois
      is in the Midwest, while Texas is in the South/Southwest.


      Step 3: To be more precise, let''s consider the specific locations of these
      zip codes.

      - 76210 appears to be in the Denton area of Texas, which is in the northern
      part of Texas

      - 61611 appears to be in the Peoria area of Illinois, which is in the central
      part of Illinois


      Step 4: Consider east-west positioning.

      Even though 76210 is in northern Texas, Texas as a whole lies significantly
      west of Illinois. The westernmost point of Illinois is still east of the easternmost
      point of Texas.

      - 76210 is in Texas (TX)

      - 61611 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Texas and Illinois.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Texas is positioned significantly west of Illinois on the US map

      - Even the easternmost parts of Texas are generally west of Illinois

      - Specifically, 76210 (Denton area, TX) is west of 61611 (Peoria area, IL)

      76210 in Texas is located west of the zip code 61611 in Illinois.


      Step 1: Let me think about the US geography. Texas is located southwest of Illinois.
      So generally, locations in Texas would be west of locations in Illinois.


      Step 2: But to be precise, I should consider the specific zip codes. Let me
      think about the approximate locations:

      - 76210 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      - 61611 is a zip code in Illinois (IL)


      Step 3: In the US, longitude decreases as you go west. So a location is west
      of another if it has a smaller longitude value.


      Step 4: While I don''t know the exact longitude values for these specific zip
      codes, I know that Texas is entirely west of Illinois. All of Texas is west

      I need to figure out if the Missouri zip code is west of the Kentucky zip code.


      Looking at the geography of the United States:

      - Missouri is generally west of Kentucky

      - The states border is roughly along the Mississippi River

      - Missouri is in the central US while Kentucky is in the eastern part of the
      central US


      Just based on the states, Missouri would be west of Kentucky. But to be more
      precise, I should consider the specific zip codes within these states.


      Zip code 64701 is in Missouri, and zip code 40175 is in Kentucky. In the US,
      zip codes generally follow geographic patterns where lower numbers tend to be
      in the eastern part of the country and higher numbers in the western part.


      Given that the Missouri zip code (64701) has a higher number than the Kentucky
      zip code (40175), and Missouri itself is west of Kentucky, it''s very likely

      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 64701 is in Missouri (MO)

      - 40175 is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Missouri is located west of Kentucky in the United States

      - Kentucky is in the eastern part of the central US, while Missouri is further
      west in the central US


      Step 3: Verify with zip code patterns.

      - US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the eastern
      regions and higher numbers in western regions

      - The Missouri zip code (64701) is higher than the Kentucky zip code (40175),
      which aligns with the general east-west pattern


      Since Missouri is west of Kentucky geographically and the zip code pattern supports
      this eastern-western relationship, zip code 64701, MO is indeed west of 40175,
      KY.

      1. Identify where these zip codes are located

      2. Determine their relative positions east/west


      For zip code 33990 in Florida:

      Florida is in the southeastern United States. Specifically, 33990 appears to
      be in Florida, likely somewhere in the southern part of the state.


      For zip code 10927 in New York:

      New York is in the northeastern United States. 10927 is somewhere in New York
      state.


      When comparing east/west positions in the United States:

      - States on the east coast (like New York) are generally east of states that
      are more inland or on the Gulf Coast (like Florida)

      - However, the specific longitudes of these zip codes matter


      Generally speaking, all of Florida is west of all of New York, because the U.S.
      eastern seaboard runs northeast to southwest. So even though both are "east
      coast" states, Florida is further west than New York.


      So 33990, FL should be west of 10927, NY.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:

      - 33990 is in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United States.

      - 10927 is in New York (NY), which is in the northeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic orientation of the eastern United States.

      The U.S. eastern seaboard runs in a northeast to southwest direction. This means
      that even though both NY and FL are considered "east coast" states, Florida
      is positioned further west than New York.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes.

      Florida''s eastern coast is approximately between 80-82 degrees west longitude.

      New York is approximately between 73-79 degrees west longitude.

      Even the easternmost parts of Florida tend to be further west than the westernmost
      parts of New York.


      Step 4: Specific zip codes

      33990 is in Cape Coral, FL (southwest Florida), placing it clearly west of 10927,

      west of 10927, NY, I need to:


      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative east-west positions


      For US zip codes:

      - Generally, lower first digits indicate eastern states (0, 1 for Northeast)

      - Higher first digits indicate western areas (9 for West Coast, 8 for Mountain
      West)


      33990 starts with "3", which typically covers southeastern states including
      Florida

      10927 starts with "1", which typically covers the northeastern states including
      New York


      Looking at the geographic position of Florida (FL) and New York (NY):

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States


      When comparing east-west positioning (longitude):

      - Florida extends further west than New York

      - New York is definitely east of Florida on a map


      Since the zip code 33990 is in Florida, and 10927 is in New York, and Florida
      is west of New York, the answer would be YES - 33990, FL is located west of
      10927, NY.


      Wait, let me double-check this. Looking at a US map:

      - The entirety of Florida is west of the entirety of New York State (Florida
      is further west in longitude)

      - So any location in Florida would be west of any location in New York</think>#
      Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine if 33990, FL is located west of 10927, NY, I need to identify the
      locations and compare their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 33990 is a zip code in Florida (FL)

      - 10927 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Determine their relative east-west positions.

      - Geographic positions are measured by longitude (east-west position)

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - The entire state of Florida lies west of New York on a map


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Since 33990 is in Florida and 10927 is in New York, their relative positions
      follow their states'' positions

      - Any point in Florida will be west of any point in New York

      of 10927, NY, I need to find the locations of these ZIP codes and compare their
      longitudes.


      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - 33990 is a ZIP code in Florida (FL)

      - 10927 is a ZIP code in New York (NY)


      In the United States, locations that are further west have a larger negative
      longitude value (or smaller positive longitude value if measured in positive
      numbers going westward).


      Florida is in the southeastern United States, while New York is in the northeastern
      United States. Generally speaking, Florida is further south than New York, but
      the question is about east/west positioning.


      Florida is generally east of states like Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi,
      but west of nothing except for the Atlantic Ocean. New York is west of the New
      England states but east of the rest of the country.


      Based on general geography of the US, New York is further east than Florida,
      which means Florida (including ZIP code 33990) would be west of New York (including
      ZIP code 10927).


      So 33990, FL should be west of 10927, NY.</think># Is 33990, FL located west

      I need to determine the east-west relationship between these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the general locations

      - 33990 is in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United States

      - 10927 is in New York (NY), which is in the northeastern United States


      ## Step 2: Consider continental geography

      The eastern United States has the Atlantic Ocean as its eastern border. Looking
      at a map of the US, New York is positioned in the northeast, while Florida extends
      south from the southeastern states.


      ## Step 3: Compare longitudinal positions

      When examining US geography, New York is further east than Florida. The state
      of New York is positioned more toward the eastern edge of the country compared
      to Florida.


      ## Step 4: Reach conclusion

      Since 33990, FL is west of 10927, NY in terms of longitude (even though Florida
      is much further south), the answer is:

      33990 is a zip code in Florida (FL)

      10927 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      In the United States, locations are generally positioned with:

      - Eastern states like New York being farther east

      - Florida is generally to the west of New York on the east coast

      - Both are on the east coast, but Florida extends further west than New York
      does

      - 10927 is in New York (NY), which is in the northeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geography of the eastern United States.

      - Both Florida and New York are on the east coast of the US.

      - However, when comparing the longitude (east-west position), Florida is generally
      positioned to the west of New York.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - While the specific zip codes may vary somewhat in their positions within their
      states, the overall geographic relationship between Florida and New York determines
      that a Florida zip code will be west of a New York zip code.

      To determine this, I need to consider the geographic locations of these zip
      codes based on their states.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 29206 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 06438 is in Connecticut (CT)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States

      - South Carolina is located in the southeastern United States


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      When looking at a map of the United States, South Carolina is clearly positioned
      to the west of Connecticut. The entire state of South Carolina lies west of
      Connecticut.


      ## Step 4: Conclude based on state positions

      Since any location in South Carolina (including zip code 29206) would be west
      of any location in Connecticut (including zip code 06438), the answer is clear.

      First, let me identify the states:

      - SC stands for South Carolina

      - CT stands for Connecticut


      Now I need to think about the relative positions of these states. The United
      States is oriented such that western states are to the left on a map, and eastern
      states are to the right.


      In the eastern United States:

      - Connecticut (CT) is located in the Northeast region

      - South Carolina (SC) is located in the Southeast region


      Comparing their east-west positions:

      - Connecticut is on the Atlantic coast in New England

      - South Carolina is also on the Atlantic coast, but much further south


      In terms of longitude (east-west position), South Carolina is generally west
      of Connecticut. The entire state of South Carolina is positioned to the west
      of Connecticut.


      So based on geography, a zip code in South Carolina (29206) would be west of
      a zip code in Connecticut (06438).</think>To determine if 29206, SC is west

      - 06438 is in Connecticut (CT)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States along the Atlantic
      coast.

      - South Carolina is located in the southeastern United States, also along the
      Atlantic coast but much further south.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions (east-west).

      - Connecticut is positioned at approximately 72-73 degrees west longitude.

      - South Carolina is positioned at approximately 78-83 degrees west longitude.


      Step 4: Analyze the result.

      Since higher western longitude numbers indicate locations further west, and
      South Carolina''s longitude range is higher than Connecticut''s, South Carolina
      is west of Connecticut.

      The zip codes are:

      1. 60136, IL (Illinois)

      2. 25701, WV (West Virginia)


      Let me think about the relative positions of Illinois and West Virginia in the
      United States:


      Illinois is in the Midwest region, roughly in the central northern part of the
      country.

      West Virginia is in the Appalachian region, on the eastern side of the US.


      Generally speaking, Illinois is west of West Virginia. However, to be more precise,
      I should consider the specific locations of these zip codes within their states.


      60136 is a zip code in Illinois. Without knowing the exact city, I can say it''s
      somewhere in Illinois, which is generally west of West Virginia.


      25701 is a zip code in West Virginia. Without knowing the exact city, it''s
      somewhere in West Virginia.


      Given the general geography of the United States, and the fact that Illinois
      is west of West Virginia, it''s highly likely that 60136, IL is indeed west
      of 25701, WV. The entire state of Illinois is west of West Virginia, with no
      overlap in longitude.</think>To determine if 60136, IL is west of 25701, WV,
      I need to analyze the geographical positions of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 60136 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 25701 is in West Virginia (WV)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while West Virginia
      is in the Appalachian region in the eastern part of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their general east-west positioning.

      Illinois is entirely west of West Virginia on the map of the United States.
      The easternmost point of Illinois is still west of the westernmost point of
      West Virginia.


      Step 4: Consider the specific zip codes.

      Even without knowing the exact cities, the state boundaries make it clear that
      any location in Illinois (including 60136) would be west of any location in
      West Virginia (including 25701).

      In the US, states that are further west have longer (higher) zip codes, and
      states that are further east have shorter (lower) zip codes.


      Actually, that''s not necessarily true. The first digit of the zip code generally
      indicates a geographical region, but the specific 5-digit codes don''t strictly
      follow an east-to-west pattern.


      Instead, I should think about the geographical locations of South Carolina and
      New Jersey:


      - South Carolina (SC) is located in the southeastern United States, on the Atlantic
      coast.

      - New Jersey (NJ) is also located on the Atlantic coast, but further north.


      To determine which is further west, I need to consider their relative positions:

      - New Jersey is in the northeast

      - South Carolina is in the southeast


      In terms of longitude (east-west position), South Carolina is indeed west of
      New Jersey. If you look at a map of the United States, South Carolina is positioned
      to the west of New Jersey.


      So the answer is YES, 29388, SC is located west of 08062, NJ.


      Wait, I should double-check this. Let me visualize the US map. The East Coast
      runs approximately southwest to northeast. New Jersey is quite far up the coast,
      while South Carolina is further down. Because of the shape of the coastline,
      South Carolina is indeed west of New Jersey.</think># Is 29388, SC located west

      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1) 29388 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)

      2) 08062 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      3) When looking at a US map, South Carolina is located in the southeastern United

      4) New Jersey is located in the northeastern United States

      5) The US eastern coastline runs in a northeastern-to-southwestern direction

      6) Because of this coastal angle, states further south on the Atlantic coast
      tend to be further west

      7) South Carolina is positioned southwest of New Jersey

      8) Therefore, South Carolina (including zip code 29388) is west of New Jersey

    3fe44e06-fbd3-4df5-943e-6e082490ba38: '<think>To answer whether 29388, SC is located
      west of 08062, NJ, I need to determine the relative geographical positions of
      these two zip codes.


      First, let me identify the states:

      - 29388 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 08062 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Now, thinking about the relative positions of these states in the US:

      - South Carolina is on the east coast, but is south of New Jersey

      - New Jersey is also on the east coast, north of South Carolina


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - South Carolina is generally west of New Jersey because the US east coast angles
      such that northern states like NJ are further east than southern states like
      SC.


      To be certain, I should consider that the US east coast curves, with New Jersey
      being more to the northeast compared to South Carolina which is more to the
      southeast. This means that generally speaking, locations in South Carolina tend
      to be west of locations in New Jersey.


      So based on the general geography of these states, 29388, SC should be west
      of 08062, NJ.</think># Is 29388, SC located west of 08062, NJ?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these zip codes by examining their
      states'' locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 29388 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 08062 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions

      - Both states are on the eastern seaboard of the US

      - New Jersey is located in the northeast

      - South Carolina is located in the southeast


      ## Step 3: Analyze east-west positioning

      - The US east coast curves, angling northeast to southwest

      - This means New Jersey is further east than South Carolina

      - All of South Carolina is west of New Jersey''s longitude


      ## Conclusion

      YES, 29388, SC is located west of 08062, NJ.'
    71e35213-9e01-415c-8986-b5ea40652197: '<think>I need to determine if zip code
      29388 in South Carolina (SC) is located west of zip code 08062 in New Jersey
      (NJ).


      In the US, locations in the west generally have longitude coordinates less than
      locations in the east (since longitude increases as you move east).


      The question is asking about the relative east-west positioning of two zip codes
      in different states: SC and NJ.


      Generally speaking:

      - South Carolina is located in the southeastern United States

      - New Jersey is located in the northeastern United States


      If we look at a map of the US, South Carolina is located to the west of New
      Jersey. This is because the eastern seaboard of the US curves, with New Jersey
      being further east than South Carolina.


      So based on the states alone, a zip code in SC would typically be west of a
      zip code in NJ.


      To be completely certain, I would need the exact longitude coordinates of these
      specific zip codes, but the general geographic relationship between these states
      makes it very likely that 29388, SC is indeed west of 08062, NJ.</think>To determine
      if 29388, SC is located west of 08062, NJ, I need to think about the geographical
      positions of South Carolina and New Jersey.


      Step 1: Consider the general locations of the two states.

      - South Carolina is located on the southeastern coast of the United States.

      - New Jersey is located on the northeastern coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the orientation of the US East Coast.

      - The US East Coast curves, running roughly north-south in the Northeast and
      then curving to run more northeast-southwest in the Southeast.

      - Due to this curvature, states in the Northeast (like New Jersey) are generally
      east of states in the Southeast (like South Carolina).


      Step 3: Compare the longitude of these states.

      - New Jersey is positioned further east on the Atlantic coast.

      - South Carolina, while also on the Atlantic coast, is positioned further west
      due to the coastline''s curvature.


      Step 4: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - While specific zip codes might vary somewhat in their exact east-west positioning
      within their states, the overall positioning of SC being west of NJ will apply
      to these zip codes.


      YES, 29388, SC is located west of 08062, NJ.'

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 36107 is in Alabama (AL)

      - 44030 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states in the US.

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States

      - Ohio is located in the midwestern/northeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Alabama is positioned significantly west of Ohio on the US map

      - Ohio borders Pennsylvania to its east, while Alabama is several states to
      the west


      Since Alabama is geographically west of Ohio, and ZIP codes within these states
      maintain that general directional relationship, ZIP code 36107 in Alabama is
      indeed west of ZIP code 44030 in Ohio.

      - 85621 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ)

      - 73505 is a zip code in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, bordering California,

      Carolina is on the East Coast.


      Step 3: Compare longitudinal positions.

      Moving from east to west across the United States, you would encounter South
      Carolina before you reach Illinois. The East Coast states (including South Carolina)
      are east of the Midwest states (including Illinois).


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 60626 is in Illinois and 29405 is in South Carolina, and Illinois is west
      of South Carolina, it follows that zip code 60626 must be west of zip code 29405.

      First, let''s identify the states:

      - 98311 is in Washington state (WA)

      - 85132 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Now, I need to think about the relative locations of these states. The continental
      United States generally follows a pattern where lower zip codes are in the eastern
      part of the country and higher zip codes in the western part.


      Washington state is located in the Pacific Northwest, on the west coast of the
      United States.

      Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, but it''s not on the coast
      - it''s east of California.


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Washington is on the west coast

      - Arizona is inland and east of Washington


      So geographically, Washington state is west of Arizona. Specifically, 98311

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, but it''s inland (not

      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Washington state is on the west coast of the continental US.

      - Arizona is east of California, which is also on the west coast.

      - Therefore, Washington is west of Arizona on the map.


      Step 4: Conclude about the specific zip codes.

      - Since 98311 is in Washington and 85132 is in Arizona, and Washington is west
      of Arizona, it follows that 98311 is west of 85132.

      whether 98311, WA is located west of 85132, AZ.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      98311 is a zip code in Washington state (WA).

      85132 is a zip code in Arizona state (AZ).


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of Washington and Arizona.

      Washington state is located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States,
      bordering the Pacific Ocean on its western edge.

      Arizona is located in the southwestern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      Washington is generally much further west than Arizona on a map of the United
      States. Washington is one of the westernmost states in the continental US (with
      only Oregon and California having parts that extend further west), while Arizona
      is more inland.


      Step 4: Specific zip codes consideration.

      Even though specific zip codes might be in different parts of their respective
      states, the entire state of Washington is west of the entire state of Arizona.
      So any zip code in Washington would be west of any zip code in Arizona.</think>To
      determine if 98311, WA is located west of 85132, AZ, I need to analyze the geographical
      locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 98311 is in Washington state (WA)

      - 85132 is in Arizona state (AZ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - Washington is located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States,
      along the Pacific Ocean

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, inland from the Pacific
      coast


      Step 3: Compare their longitude positions.

      - Washington state is positioned much further west on the map of the United
      States

      - Washington state''s eastern border is still west of Arizona''s western border

      - Therefore, any location in Washington state would be west of any location
      in Arizona


      Step 4: Specific zip code consideration.

      - Even accounting for specific locations within each state, the entirety of
      Washington state lies west of Arizona


      YES, 98311, WA is located west of 85132, AZ.'

      55388 in Minnesota (MN) is west of zip code 15062 in Pennsylvania (PA).


      In the United States, zip codes generally follow a geographical pattern, with
      lower numbers in the east and higher numbers in the west. But I can''t rely
      only on the numeric values, as zip codes aren''t assigned in a perfectly sequential
      geographic pattern.


      Instead, I need to consider the states. Minnesota (MN) is in the Midwest region,
      while Pennsylvania (PA) is in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region. Looking at
      a US map, Minnesota is definitely west of Pennsylvania.


      So any location in Minnesota, including zip code 55388, would be west of any

      Minnesota is located in the upper Midwest region of the United States, while
      Pennsylvania is in the Mid-Atlantic region in the eastern part of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      Looking at the map of the United States, Minnesota is clearly located to the
      west of Pennsylvania. The entire state of Minnesota is west of Pennsylvania.


      Therefore, any location in Minnesota (including zip code 55388) would be west
      of any location in Pennsylvania (including zip code 15062).

      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - Oregon is located north of California

      - Oregon is on the West Coast of the United States

      - California is also on the West Coast of the United States


      When we''re asking about "west of", we''re comparing the longitude (east-west
      position) of these two zip codes.


      For zip codes on the West Coast:

      - Generally, locations in Oregon would be more north than locations in California

      - But being north doesn''t necessarily mean being west. We need to consider
      the specific shape of the coastline.


      The West Coast curves slightly - with California extending further west in some
      parts than Oregon.


      Let me think about these specific zip codes:

      - 97229 is in Oregon, likely in the Portland metro area

      - 90650 is in California, likely in the Los Angeles metro area


      Los Angeles is in Southern California, which is further east than Northern California.
      Portland is in Northern Oregon, which tends to be further east than the Oregon
      coast, but the entire state of Oregon is generally west of Southern California.


      So based on general geography, I believe 97229, OR (Portland area) is west of
      90650, CA (LA area), but I need to be careful - the curvature of the coast could
      affect this.</think># Is 97229, OR located west of 90650, CA?

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 97229 is a zip code in Oregon (OR), likely in the Portland metropolitan area

      - 90650 is a zip code in California (CA), specifically in Norwalk, which is
      in the Los Angeles metropolitan area


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic positioning

      - Oregon is located north of California on the West Coast

      - However, the question is about east-west positioning (longitude), not north-south


      ## Step 3: Analyze coastal geography

      - The Pacific coastline curves inward as it moves south through California

      - Southern California (where Los Angeles/Norwalk is located) is actually further
      east than most of Oregon

      - Portland area in Oregon is closer to the Pacific Ocean longitude-wise than
      the Los Angeles area


      ## Step 4: Conclude based on longitude

      - The Portland area (97229) is indeed further west than the Los Angeles area
      (90650)

      First, let me identify where these zip codes are located:

      - 97229 is a zip code in Oregon (OR)

      - 90650 is a zip code in California (CA)


      Generally speaking, Oregon is north of California, but the question is asking
      about east-west positioning, not north-south.


      If we look at the United States geographically:

      - Oregon is on the west coast of the United States, bordering the Pacific Ocean

      - California is also on the west coast, south of Oregon


      However, California extends further west than Oregon in many places due to the
      shape of the coastline.


      To determine which specific zip code is further west, I need to think about
      their approximate locations:

      - 97229 is likely in the Portland area of Oregon, which is in the northern part
      of the state

      - 90650 appears to be in Southern California (likely in the Los Angeles area)


      Portland is located inland from the coast, while many Southern California zip
      codes are closer to the coast. However, due to the curvature of the coastline,
      Northern California and Oregon are generally further west than Southern California.


      Looking at a mental map, Southern California angles southeast, meaning that
      northern locations (like Oregon) tend to be further west than southern California
      locations.


      So 97229 in Oregon is most likely west of 90650 in California.</think># Determining
      if 97229, OR is west of 90650, CA


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 97229 is in Oregon (OR), specifically in the Portland metropolitan area

      - 90650 is in California (CA), specifically Norwalk in the Los Angeles area


      ## Step 2: Consider the geography

      - Oregon is north of California on the west coast

      - However, the coastline of the western United States curves inward as it goes
      south

      - This means that locations in Southern California (like the LA area) are generally
      further east than locations in Oregon


      ## Step 3: Compare the specific locations

      - Portland area (97229) is in northwest Oregon

      - Norwalk/LA area (90650) is in southern California, which is further east due
      to the coastline curvature

      - Southern California locations generally have more easterly longitudes than
      Oregon locations


      ## Conclusion

      YES, 97229 in Oregon is located west of 90650 in California.'

      The United States follows a general pattern where states in the western part
      of the country have higher first digits in their zip codes than eastern states.
      However, this isn''t entirely reliable, so I''ll need to consider the actual
      geographic locations.


      Let me think about the locations:

      1. 26041 is in West Virginia (WV)

      2. 07070 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Looking at the geography of the United States:

      - New Jersey is on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - West Virginia is inland, to the west of New Jersey


      So geographically, West Virginia is located to the west of New Jersey. Therefore,

      - 07070 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the eastern coast of the United States

      - West Virginia is an inland state that lies to the west of New Jersey


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Looking at a map of the United States, West Virginia is clearly positioned to
      the west of New Jersey. The entire state of West Virginia is west of New Jersey.


      Therefore, zip code 26041 in WV must be located west of zip code 07070 in NJ.

      Jersey zip code, and West Virginia as a state is indeed west of New Jersey,
      the answer would be YES.


      To be even more precise: All points in West Virginia are west of all points
      in New Jersey based on their geographical positions in the United States. So
      a zip code in WV would definitely be west of a zip code in NJ.</think>To determine
      if 26041, WV is located west of 07070, NJ, I need to consider the geographic
      positions of these states and their zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 26041 is in West Virginia (WV)

      - 07070 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - West Virginia is located inland in the Appalachian region


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      - Looking at a map of the United States, West Virginia is positioned to the
      west of New Jersey

      - All locations in West Virginia are west of all locations in New Jersey


      Step 4: Conclude about the specific zip codes

      - Since 26041 is in WV and 07070 is in NJ, the West Virginia zip code must be
      west of the New Jersey zip code


      YES'

      44095 is a zip code in Ohio (OH). Ohio is in the Midwest region of the US.

      19363 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA). Pennsylvania is in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic
      region of the US.


      Looking at a US map, Ohio is generally west of Pennsylvania. The states border
      each other, with Ohio being to the west of Pennsylvania.


      To be more precise:

      - 44095 appears to be around Eastlake, Ohio, which is in the northeastern part
      of Ohio

      - 19363 appears to be around Oxford, Pennsylvania, which is in the southeastern
      part of Pennsylvania


      Even though 44095 is in eastern Ohio and 19363 is in eastern Pennsylvania, Ohio

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Ohio is located west of Pennsylvania in the United States

      - They share a border, with Ohio being on the western side of Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - 44095 corresponds to Eastlake, Ohio, which is in the northeastern part of
      Ohio

      - 19363 corresponds to Oxford, Pennsylvania, which is in the southeastern part

      - ZIP code 19363 is in Pennsylvania


      Since Ohio is west of Pennsylvania, it''s likely that any location in Ohio would
      be west of a location in Pennsylvania. However, I should be careful because
      states have irregular shapes, and border areas might not follow the general
      pattern.


      Let me think about the general geography:

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern US

      - Ohio is in the midwestern US, bordering Pennsylvania to the west


      This strongly suggests that a location in Ohio with zip code 44095 would be
      west of a location in Pennsylvania with zip code 19363, but I should be precise.


      Without specific coordinate data for these zip codes, I''ll have to rely on

      Broadly speaking, Ohio is located west of Pennsylvania in the United States.

      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      Even though specific zip codes within these states could be in different parts
      of each state, the entire state of Ohio is west of the entire state of Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Since 44095 is in Ohio and 19363 is in Pennsylvania, and Ohio is entirely west

      In the United States, states generally follow a west-to-east pattern as follows:

      - Western states (like California, Oregon, Washington) are on the west coast

      - Central states (like Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska) are in the middle

      - Eastern states (like New York, Pennsylvania, etc.) are on the east coast


      Ohio and Pennsylvania are both in the eastern part of the United States, but

      in Pennsylvania. This means that zip code 44095 in Ohio is almost certainly
      west of zip code 19363 in Pennsylvania.


      To be even more precise, I could note that US zip codes tend to increase as

      - 19363 appears to be in southeastern Pennsylvania


      Even though Ohio is generally west of Pennsylvania, I need to be precise about
      these specific locations. I need to check if 44095, OH is indeed west of 19363,
      PA.


      In the U.S. geography, Ohio is directly west of Pennsylvania. Given that 44095
      is in Ohio and 19363 is in Pennsylvania, it''s highly likely that 44095 is west
      of 19363. However, to be absolutely certain, I''d need to know the exact locations

      To do this, I need to know the relative locations of these zip codes, or more
      generally, the relative locations of Oklahoma and Indiana.


      In the United States, states that are further west have lower longitude values.
      Oklahoma is in the central part of the US, while Indiana is in the Midwest,
      more towards the eastern part of the country.


      Oklahoma is generally west of Indiana on a US map. Oklahoma borders Texas, New
      Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, and Arkansas. Indiana borders Michigan,
      Ohio, Kentucky, and Illinois.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States

      - Oklahoma is located in the South Central United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning

      - Oklahoma is positioned significantly west of Indiana on the US map

      - Indiana borders Ohio to the east and Illinois to the west

      - Oklahoma borders Arkansas to the east and the Texas Panhandle to the west

      - The entire state of Oklahoma lies west of Indiana


      Since any location in Oklahoma (including 73701) must be west of any location

      In the US, locations further west have larger longitude values (more negative
      numbers since we''re in the western hemisphere). So I need to compare the longitudes
      of these two zip codes.


      First, let me think about the general geography of Ohio and New York states:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest, while New York is in the Northeast

      - Generally speaking, Ohio is west of New York


      More specifically:

      1. 43160 appears to be a zip code in Ohio (OH)

      2. 12549 appears to be a zip code in New York (NY)


      Since Ohio is generally west of New York, it''s highly likely that 43160, OH
      is west of 12549, NY. But let me be precise about this geographic relationship.


      Ohio is entirely west of New York. The easternmost part of Ohio is still west
      of the westernmost part of New York. Therefore, any location in Ohio (including
      43160) must be west of any location in New York (including 12549).</think>#
      Is 43160, OH located west of 12549, NY?


      To answer this question, I need to consider the geographic locations of these
      zip codes based on their states.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1) 43160 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)

      2) 12549 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      3) Looking at the geographic position of these states, Ohio is located in the
      Midwest region of the United States

      4) New York is located in the Northeast region of the United States

      5) On a map of the United States, Ohio is positioned entirely west of New York

      6) Since the entire state of Ohio lies west of the state of New York, any location
      in Ohio must be west of any location in New York


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      located west of 12549, NY, I need to find the locations of these zip codes and

      In the US, locations that are west have a higher (more negative) longitude value
      than locations that are east. So if 43160, OH has a more negative longitude
      than 12549, NY, then 43160, OH is west of 12549, NY.


      Let me think about where these zip codes are located:


      43160 is in Ohio (OH), which is in the Midwest region of the United States.

      12549 is in New York (NY), which is in the Northeast region of the United States.


      Generally speaking, Ohio is west of New York. Ohio borders Pennsylvania, which
      borders New York, and Ohio is west of Pennsylvania.


      So most likely, 43160, OH is west of 12549, NY. But to be precise, I should
      verify the specific locations of these zip codes.

      - 43160 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 12549 is in New York (NY)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while New York is
      in the Northeast region. On a map of the United States, Ohio is positioned to
      the west of New York.


      ## Step 3: Consider relative positions within states

      Even accounting for different positions within each state (e.g., eastern Ohio
      vs. western New York), the entirety of Ohio is west of the entirety of New York.


      ## Step 4: Make a conclusion

      Since Ohio lies completely west of New York geographically, any zip code in
      Ohio (including 43160) must be west of any zip code in New York (including 12549).

      to determine if 43207, OH (Ohio) is located west of 10598, NY (New York).


      In the United States, states that are further west generally have higher first
      digits in their zip codes, but there are many exceptions to this pattern. So
      I need to think about the actual geographical locations.


      Ohio is a Midwestern state, while New York is an Eastern state. Geographically
      speaking, Ohio is west of New York.


      To be more specific about these particular zip codes:

      - 43207 is a zip code in Columbus, Ohio

      - 10598 is a zip code in Yorktown Heights, New York


      Since Ohio is west of New York, it follows that 43207, OH is west of 10598,
      NY.</think># Is 43207, OH located west of 10598, NY?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 43207 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 10598 is in New York (NY)


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic positions

      Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while New York is
      on the East Coast.


      ## Step 3: Compare relative positions

      When looking at a US map, Ohio is positioned to the west of New York. All of
      Ohio is geographically west of all of New York.


      ## Step 4: Specific zip codes

      Since 43207 (Columbus area in Ohio) is entirely within Ohio, and 10598 (Yorktown
      Heights area in New York) is entirely within New York, the Ohio zip code must
      be west of the New York zip code.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      In the United States, states in the Midwest like Ohio are generally west of
      states in the Northeast like New York. But let me think about this more precisely.


      U.S. zip codes are organized somewhat geographically. The first digit generally
      indicates a broad region:

      - 0 and 1 typically represent the Northeast region

      - 4 typically represents parts of the Midwest including Ohio


      So 10598 starting with "1" is in New York, in the Northeast.

      And 43207 starting with "4" is in Ohio, in the Midwest.


      In terms of geography, Ohio is indeed west of New York state. The entire state
      of Ohio is west of the entire state of New York. Ohio is in the Midwest while
      New York is in the Northeast.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York is located in the Northeast region


      Step 3: Compare their longitude positions.

      - Ohio is entirely west of New York state

      - All locations in Ohio have a longitude further west than locations in New
      York


      Since 43207 is in Ohio and 10598 is in New York, and Ohio is west of New York,
      43207 must be west of 10598.

      I need to determine if the Alabama ZIP code is west of the New Jersey ZIP code.


      First, let''s think about the general geography of the United States:

      US

      - New Jersey (NJ) is located on the East Coast, in the northeastern part of
      the US


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Alabama is located to the west of New Jersey.

      In the US, ZIP codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the
      east and higher numbers are in the west. So just from the numbers, 46222 is
      higher than 19043, which suggests that 46222 is west of 19043.


      But let''s be more precise. The first digit of a ZIP code divides the US into
      10 regions from east to west:

      - 0: Northeast

      - 1: Northeast (NY, PA)

      - 2: Southeast/Mid-Atlantic

      - 3: Southeast

      - 4: Midwest (OH, IN, KY, etc.)

      west of 19043, PA, I need to find the geographical locations of these zip codes.


      46222 is a zip code in Indiana (IN).

      19043 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA).


      The United States is oriented such that, generally speaking, western states
      are to the left (west) of eastern states on a map. Let me think about the relative
      positions of Indiana and Pennsylvania:


      Indiana (IN) is in the Midwest region of the United States.

      Pennsylvania (PA) is in the Northeast region of the United States.


      Geographically, Indiana is west of Pennsylvania. States like Ohio lie between
      Indiana and Pennsylvania.


      Since 46222 is in Indiana, and 19043 is in Pennsylvania, and Indiana is west
      of Pennsylvania, it follows that zip code 46222, IN is west of zip code 19043,
      PA.</think># Determining if 46222, IN is west of 19043, PA


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 46222 is in Indiana (IN)

      - 19043 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Determine geographical positions

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is located in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region

      - On a US map, Indiana is clearly west of Pennsylvania (with Ohio in between
      them)


      ## Step 3: Compare the locations

      Since zip codes follow state boundaries, and Indiana is west of Pennsylvania,
      zip code 46222 (IN) must be west of zip code 19043 (PA).


      # Answer: YES'

      the zip code 46222 in Indiana (IN) is west of the zip code 19043 in Pennsylvania
      (PA).


      To determine this, I need to understand the relative positions of these two
      states and then the specific locations of these zip codes within their states.


      Step 1: Determine the general geographic positions of Indiana and Pennsylvania.

      Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United States, while Pennsylvania is
      in the Northeast. Generally speaking, Indiana is west of Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Check the specific zip codes.

      - 46222 is in Indianapolis, Indiana. Indianapolis is located in central Indiana.

      - 19043 appears to be in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, likely in the Philadelphia
      metropolitan area.


      Step 3: Since Indiana as a whole is west of Pennsylvania, and the zip codes
      are in their respective states, it follows that 46222, IN is west of 19043,
      PA.</think>I need to determine the relative geographic locations of these two

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Pennsylvania
      is in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      On a map of the United States, Indiana is entirely west of Pennsylvania. The
      easternmost point of Indiana is still west of the westernmost point of Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Since the zip codes are within their respective states, zip code 46222
      in Indiana must be west of zip code 19043 in Pennsylvania.

      to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 33715 is a zip code in Florida (FL)

      - 01107 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Examine more specific locations.

      - 33715 is in the St. Petersburg/Gulf Coast area of Florida

      - 01107 is in Springfield, Massachusetts


      Step 4: Compare longitudes (east-west positions).

      - Massachusetts, including Springfield (01107), is positioned along the eastern
      seaboard

      - Florida''s Gulf Coast, including St. Petersburg (33715), extends significantly
      westward


      Since Florida''s western areas (including St. Petersburg) are indeed west of
      Massachusetts, zip code 33715 is west of zip code 01107.

      33715, FL is in Florida. Florida is in the southeastern United States.

      01107, MA is in Massachusetts. Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States.


      Generally speaking, Florida is south of Massachusetts, but I need to determine
      if the specific location in Florida (33715) is west of the specific location
      in Massachusetts (01107).


      Looking at the general geography of the United States:

      - Massachusetts is on the East Coast

      - Florida is also on the East Coast, but extends further west than Massachusetts


      To be more precise:

      - 33715 appears to be in the St. Petersburg/Tampa Bay area of Florida, which
      is on the west coast of Florida

      - 01107 is likely in the Springfield area of Massachusetts, which is in western
      Massachusetts

      33715, FL would be west of 01107, MA.</think># Determining if 33715, FL is west
      of 01107, MA


      To answer this question, I need to identify the locations of these zip codes
      and compare their longitudes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 33715 is a zip code in Florida, specifically in the St. Petersburg area on
      Florida''s Gulf Coast

      - 01107 is a zip code in Massachusetts, specifically in Springfield in western
      Massachusetts


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States along the Atlantic
      coast

      - Florida is in the southeastern United States, with its western portion along
      the Gulf of Mexico


      ## Step 3: Compare the longitudes

      - Western Florida (including the St. Petersburg area) is significantly further
      west than any part of Massachusetts

      - Even though western Massachusetts (where Springfield is located) is the westernmost
      part of that state, it''s still much further east than Florida''s Gulf Coast

      the locations of two US zip codes and determine if one is west of the other.


      The zip codes mentioned are:

      1. 15468, PA (Pennsylvania)

      2. 01810, MA (Massachusetts)


      To determine if one location is west of another, I need to compare their longitudes.
      A location with a more negative longitude in the US is further west.


      Pennsylvania is generally west of Massachusetts in the United States. Pennsylvania
      is in the Mid-Atlantic region, while Massachusetts is in New England on the
      east coast.


      The specific zip codes might not follow the general state positions perfectly,
      but as a general rule:

      - Pennsylvania zip codes (starting with 15xxx) are typically west of

      - Massachusetts zip codes (starting with 01xxx)


      Pennsylvania zip codes in the 154xx range are in the western part of Pennsylvania.

      Massachusetts zip codes in the 018xx range are typically in the northeastern
      part of Massachusetts.


      So based on the general geography of US states and the specific zip code ranges,
      I can conclude that 15468, PA is indeed west of 01810, MA.</think>To determine
      if 15468, PA is west of 01810, MA, I need to analyze the geographic locations
      of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 15468 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 01810 is in Massachusetts (MA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Pennsylvania is located west of Massachusetts in the United States. Pennsylvania
      is in the Mid-Atlantic region, while Massachusetts is in New England on the
      eastern seaboard.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - The 154xx zip code range is in western Pennsylvania

      - The 018xx zip code range is in northeastern Massachusetts


      Step 4: Compare their relative positions.

      Even considering potential variations within each state, any location in western
      Pennsylvania (like 15468) would be significantly west of any location in Massachusetts
      (like 01810).

      In the US, zip codes are organized roughly geographically, but I can''t rely
      solely on the zip code numbers to determine relative east-west positioning.
      Instead, I need to consider the locations of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts
      states.


      Geographically:

      - Massachusetts (MA) is located in the northeastern United States, on the East
      Coast.

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is located southwest of Massachusetts.

      - 15468 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 01810 is in Massachusetts (MA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States, along the Atlantic
      coast.

      - Pennsylvania is located southwest of Massachusetts, more inland from the Atlantic
      coast.


      Step 3: Apply directional analysis.

      - When moving from Massachusetts to Pennsylvania, you generally travel in a
      westward direction.

      - All of Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts on a map of the United States.


      Step 4: Conclude about the specific zip codes.

      - Since 15468 is in Pennsylvania and 01810 is in Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania
      is west of Massachusetts, it follows that 15468, PA must be west of 01810, MA.

      west of 01810, MA, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west)


      For zip code 15468 in Pennsylvania (PA):

      - This is in western Pennsylvania

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern part of the US


      For zip code 01810 in Massachusetts (MA):

      - This is somewhere in Massachusetts

      - Massachusetts is also in the northeastern US, but further east than Pennsylvania


      Since Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts in the United States, and these
      zip codes are in their respective states, zip code 15468 in PA would be west
      of zip code 01810 in MA.


      To confirm: Pennsylvania borders Ohio to its west and New Jersey to its east,
      while Massachusetts is even further east than New Jersey. So any location in
      Pennsylvania will be west of any location in Massachusetts.</think># Is 15468,

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 15468 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 01810 is in Massachusetts (MA)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states

      Pennsylvania is located west of Massachusetts in the United States. Pennsylvania
      is in the Mid-Atlantic region, while Massachusetts is in New England (further
      east).


      ## Step 3: Consider if there could be exceptions

      Even the easternmost part of Pennsylvania is still west of the westernmost part
      of Massachusetts. The entire state of Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts.


      ## Step 4: Reach a conclusion

      Since 15468 is in Pennsylvania and 01810 is in Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania
      is entirely west of Massachusetts, zip code 15468 must be west of zip code 01810.

      27604 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC).

      11572 is a zip code in New York (NY).


      Generally speaking, North Carolina is located south and west of New York state.
      But to be precise, I need to determine the specific locations.


      Zip code 27604 is likely in the Raleigh area of North Carolina, which is in
      the eastern part of the state.

      Zip code 11572 is likely in the Long Island area of New York, which is in the
      southeastern part of the state.


      In the United States, locations further west have lower longitudes. So if 27604
      has a lower longitude than 11572, then 27604 is west of 11572.


      In the US, North Carolina is indeed west of New York, although North Carolina
      is on the east coast as well. So 27604, NC should be west of 11572, NY.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the geographic positions of these
      two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 27604 is a zip code in Raleigh, North Carolina (NC)

      - 11572 is a zip code in Oceanside, New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - While both states are on the east coast, New York is further east than North
      Carolina.

      - All of North Carolina is west of New York''s position on the map.

      In the US, locations further west have higher longitude values (while latitudes
      increase as you go north). So I need to determine the approximate locations
      of these zip codes and compare their positions.


      Zip code 27604 is in NC (North Carolina), which is a state on the east coast
      of the US, but south of New York.


      Zip code 11572 is in NY (New York), which is also on the east coast, but north
      of North Carolina.


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New York is in the northeastern US

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern US


      Looking at US geography, North Carolina is actually slightly west of New York
      when comparing the same latitudes. This is because the US east coast curves,
      with New England (including NY) being further east than the mid-Atlantic and
      southern states.


      So yes, 27604, NC is likely to be west of 11572, NY, despite both being "east
      coast" states.</think>I''ll solve this step by step by determining the relative
      east-west positions of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 27604 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 11572 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the US east coast.

      The eastern US coastline curves, with the New England area (including New York)
      jutting out further east into the Atlantic Ocean than the southern states like
      North Carolina.


      Step 3: More specifically, 27604 is in the Raleigh area of North Carolina, while
      11572 is in Oceanside, Long Island, New York.


      Step 4: Compare longitudes. New York locations, especially those on Long Island
      like Oceanside, are further east than locations in North Carolina. This means
      North Carolina locations have a more westerly position.


      YES, 27604, NC is located west of 11572, NY.'

      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - 27604 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 11572 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Now, to determine east/west positioning, I need to think about the general geography
      of the United States:


      - North Carolina is located on the east coast of the United States, but it is
      south of New York

      - New York is also on the east coast, but further north than North Carolina


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New York is generally to the northeast of North Carolina

      - This means North Carolina is southwest of New York


      So if we''re just considering east-west positioning (longitude), North Carolina
      is indeed west of New York. The entire state of North Carolina is west of New
      York.


      Therefore, zip code 27604 in NC would be west of zip code 11572 in NY.</think>#

      - 27604 is a zip code in Raleigh, North Carolina (NC)

      - 11572 is a zip code in Oceanside, New York (NY)


      ## Step 2: Consider US geography.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States

      - While both states are on the eastern seaboard, North Carolina is southwest
      of New York


      ## Step 3: Compare longitudinal positions.

      - Even though both are eastern states, North Carolina is positioned further
      west than New York when comparing their longitudes

      - All of North Carolina is west of the New York City metro area (where 11572

      First, let me identify these zip codes:

      - 27604 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 11572 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      In the United States, geographical positioning generally follows these patterns:

      - East Coast states like New York are in the eastern part of the country

      - States like North Carolina are located south of New York, but also on the
      East Coast


      Looking at the longitudinal position (east-west):

      - New York is located further east on the US East Coast

      - North Carolina is located to the west and south of New York


      Therefore, 27604 in North Carolina would be located west of 11572 in New York.
      This is because as you move down the East Coast from north to south (NY to NC),
      you also move slightly westward due to the curvature of the coastline.</think>#

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions (east-west).

      - Moving down the East Coast from New York to North Carolina, you travel in
      a southwesterly direction

      - The East Coast curves westward as you move south

      - New York is further east than North Carolina


      Therefore, 27604 in North Carolina is located west of 11572 in New York.

      (OH) in the United States.

      - Texas is located in the southern central part of the United States.

      - Ohio is located in the eastern part of the Midwest region of the United States.


      Generally speaking, Texas is west of Ohio. But I should verify the specific
      zip codes.


      Step 2: Zip code 77045 is in Texas. Texas zip codes generally start with 75-79,
      and 77045 would likely be in the Houston area.


      Step 3: Zip code 44116 is in Ohio. Ohio zip codes generally start with 43-45,

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Ohio is located in the eastern Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes.

      - Texas is significantly west of Ohio on the U.S. map

      - All of Texas is west of all of Ohio


      Step 4: Even without knowing the exact cities for these zip codes, we can conclude
      that any location in Texas (including 77045) would be west of any location in

      Hemisphere) are more westerly than those with larger longitude values. So I
      need to determine if the longitude of 27705, NC is less than the longitude of
      10958, NY.


      Let''s think about the general locations:

      - North Carolina is a southeastern state, located on the Atlantic coast

      - New York is a northeastern state, also on the Atlantic coast, but further
      north


      In the United States, generally speaking, New York is east of North Carolina.
      Looking at a mental map of the US, New York is located northeast of North Carolina.


      Therefore, North Carolina would be southwest of New York, meaning North Carolina
      would have a smaller (more negative) longitude than New York.


      So 27705, NC would be west of 10958, NY.</think>I need to determine the relative
      east-west positions of these two zip codes by analyzing their geographical locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 27705 is a zip code in Durham, North Carolina (NC)

      - 10958 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States along the Atlantic
      coast

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States, also along the Atlantic
      coast


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      When looking at a map of the United States, New York is positioned northeast
      of North Carolina. This means North Carolina is southwest of New York.


      Step 4: Focus specifically on the east-west relationship.

      Since North Carolina is southwest of New York, it is west of New York on the
      east-west axis.

      west of 10958, NY, I need to:


      1. Identify where 27705, NC is located (which city/region in North Carolina)

      2. Identify where 10958, NY is located (which city/region in New York)

      3. Compare their relative east-west positions on a map


      Let me work through this:


      Zip code 27705 is in Durham, North Carolina.

      Zip code 10958 is somewhere in New York state.


      Generally speaking, North Carolina is south of New York, but the question is
      specifically about east-west positioning. The United States has New York in
      the northeast, while North Carolina is in the southeast.


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - New York state is generally to the east of the United States

      - North Carolina is also in the eastern part of the US, but North Carolina is
      typically west of New York


      When comparing locations in New York versus North Carolina, locations in North
      Carolina are typically west of locations in New York because New York is further
      east on the continent.


      So, 27705 in Durham, NC should be west of 10958 in NY.</think>To determine if
      27705, NC is located west of 10958, NY, I need to analyze the geographical positions
      of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 27705 is in Durham, North Carolina

      - 10958 is in New York state (appears to be in Orange County)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical orientation of these states.

      New York is in the northeastern United States, while North Carolina is in the
      southeastern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions specifically.

      When looking at a map of the United States, New York state is positioned further
      east than North Carolina. This is because the eastern coastline of the US curves,
      with New York being further east along this curve.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 27705 (Durham, NC) is in North Carolina, and 10958 is in New York, the
      North Carolina location would be west of the New York location.

      VA is located west of zip code 01364, MA, I need to:


      1. Identify where these zip codes are located

      2. Determine their relative east-west positions


      Let me work through this:


      Zip code 23702 is in Virginia (VA). It''s likely in the eastern part of Virginia,
      possibly near Norfolk or the coast.


      Zip code 01364 is in Massachusetts (MA). This is a New England state in the
      northeastern United States.


      In terms of general geography of the US:

      - Massachusetts is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Virginia is also on the eastern seaboard, but is south of Massachusetts


      When considering east-west positioning, we need to compare their longitudes:

      - Massachusetts is further northeast

      - Virginia is further southeast


      Generally speaking, states on the eastern seaboard are aligned roughly north-south,
      with Massachusetts being north of Virginia. But Massachusetts tends to be slightly
      more eastward compared to Virginia.


      So most likely, 23702 in Virginia would be slightly west of 01364 in Massachusetts,
      as the eastern coast curves in that way. Virginia''s position is typically westward
      compared to Massachusetts.</think># Is 23702, VA located west of 01364, MA?


      Let me solve this step by step:


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 23702 is a ZIP code in Virginia (VA)

      - 01364 is a ZIP code in Massachusetts (MA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geography

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia is located in the mid-Atlantic region, south of Massachusetts


      ## Step 3: Consider east-west positioning

      - The US eastern seaboard curves, with New England (including Massachusetts)
      jutting out further east

      - Virginia lies further west along the coast compared to Massachusetts

      - Generally, locations in Virginia will be west of locations in Massachusetts


      ## Step 4: Specific ZIP codes

      - 23702 is in the Portsmouth area of Virginia

      - 01364 is in western Massachusetts

      - While 01364 is in western Massachusetts, Massachusetts as a whole is still
      east of Virginia''s eastern regions


      YES - 23702, VA is located west of 01364, MA.'

      of zip code 23702 in Virginia (VA) and zip code 01364 in Massachusetts (MA)
      to determine if the Virginia location is west of the Massachusetts location.


      To do this, I''ll need to think about the geographic positions of these states
      and zip codes.


      Virginia (VA) is located on the east coast of the United States, south of Massachusetts.

      Massachusetts (MA) is also on the east coast, but further north than Virginia.


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Virginia is generally south and slightly west of Massachusetts

      - But I need to verify the specific zip codes


      Zip code 23702 is in Virginia. This appears to be in the Portsmouth area of
      Virginia, which is in the eastern part of Virginia near the coast.


      Zip code 01364 is in Massachusetts. This appears to be in western Massachusetts.


      Since Virginia is generally west of Massachusetts in the eastern United States,
      but these specific zip codes might change things (Portsmouth, VA is on the east
      coast while 01364 MA might be in western MA), I need to think about this carefully.


      Actually, while Virginia as a whole extends west of parts of Massachusetts,
      the eastern coastal part of Virginia (where Portsmouth/23702 is) is generally
      going to be EAST of western Massachusetts (where 01364 likely is). The eastern
      US coastline curves, with New England (including MA) being further east than
      the mid-Atlantic states (including VA) as you go south.


      So my reasoning suggests that Portsmouth, VA (23702) is likely EAST of zip code
      01364 in western MA, not west of it.</think># Is 23702, VA located west of 01364,
      MA?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Zip code 23702 is in Portsmouth, Virginia, on the eastern coast of Virginia

      - Zip code 01364 is in Orange, Massachusetts, located in the north-central part
      of Massachusetts


      ## Step 2: Consider the geography of the eastern United States

      - Massachusetts is northeast of Virginia

      - The Atlantic coastline curves, with New England (including Massachusetts)
      jutting out eastward


      ## Step 3: Compare specific locations

      - Portsmouth (23702) is on the far eastern edge of Virginia, near the Atlantic
      Ocean

      - Orange, MA (01364) is inland in Massachusetts, in the central/western portion
      of the state

      - While Virginia is south of Massachusetts, the eastern Virginia coastline is
      actually east of much of central/western Massachusetts due to the coastline''s
      curvature


      ## Step 4: Make the determination

      Looking at their positions on a map, Portsmouth, VA (23702) is east, not west,
      of Orange, MA (01364).

      To be even more precise: Texas is entirely west of Illinois. The easternmost
      point of Texas is still west of the westernmost point of Illinois. So any location

      - Texas is entirely west of Illinois on the map of the United States

      - The easternmost point of Texas is still west of the westernmost point of Illinois

      44627 in Ohio (OH) is located west of zip code 28512 in North Carolina (NC).


      To figure this out, I need to know the geographic locations of these zip codes,
      specifically their longitude coordinates. In the US, locations further west
      have a higher (more negative) longitude value.


      First, let''s think about the general locations:

      - Ohio (OH) is a midwestern state

      - North Carolina (NC) is on the east coast


      Generally speaking, Ohio is west of North Carolina. So my initial guess would
      be that 44627, OH is indeed west of 28512, NC.


      But to be more precise, let me reason through the specific zip codes:


      Ohio zip codes typically start with numbers 43-45, and Ohio is located in the
      Midwest region of the United States.

      North Carolina zip codes typically start with numbers 27-28, and North Carolina
      is on the East Coast.


      Given the general geography of the United States, Ohio is located west of North
      Carolina. So a zip code in Ohio would be west of a zip code in North Carolina.


      So my answer is YES, 44627, OH is located west of 28512, NC.</think># Is 44627,

      - 44627 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 28512 is in North Carolina (NC)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - North Carolina is located on the East Coast of the United States


      ## Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      On a map of the United States, Ohio is positioned to the west of North Carolina.
      The entire state of Ohio lies west of North Carolina.


      ## Step 4: Conclude about the specific zip codes

      Since 44627 is in Ohio and 28512 is in North Carolina, and Ohio is west of North
      Carolina, it follows that 44627, OH is west of 28512, NC.

      - Texas is west of Louisiana (Texas is to the west of Louisiana on the US map)

      - Generally, zip codes in Texas begin with 7 or 8, and zip codes in Louisiana

      Just knowing that Texas is west of Louisiana isn''t enough though, because the

      76008 is in Texas

      From US geography knowledge:

      - Texas is located west of Louisiana (Texas borders Louisiana on Louisiana''s
      western side)

      - In general, zip codes in the US tend to start with lower numbers in the eastern
      parts of the country and increase as you go west


      Looking at the specific zip codes:

      The first digits (7 in both cases) indicate that both are in the south-central
      region of the US. But the second digits (6 for TX and 0 for LA) actually show
      that the Texas zip code has a higher number.


      Since Texas is geographically west of Louisiana, and this specific Texas zip

      be careful.


      Instead, I''ll use the state information which is more reliable. Texas (TX)
      is located west of Louisiana (LA) in the United States. The western border of
      Louisiana meets the eastern border of Texas.


      Since 76008 is in Texas (TX) and 70712 is in Louisiana (LA), and Texas is west

      - 76008 is in Texas (TX)

      - 70712 is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      Texas is located directly west of Louisiana on the US map. Louisiana borders
      the Gulf of Mexico on the south and Texas on the west.


      Step 3: Since all of Texas is west of all of Louisiana geographically, any location
      in Texas (including zip code 76008) would be west of any location in Louisiana

      Generally speaking, Texas is west of Louisiana in the United States. But I need
      to verify this specific pair of zip codes.


      In the US zip code system:

      - Texas zip codes typically start with 75-79

      - Louisiana zip codes typically start with 70-71


      So 76008 is indeed a Texas zip code, and 70712 is indeed a Louisiana zip code.


      Since Texas is directly west of Louisiana geographically, and these zip codes
      are in their respective states, it follows that 76008, TX would be west of 70712,
      LA.


      To be even more precise: all of Texas is west of all of Louisiana. The easternmost
      point of Texas is still west of the westernmost point of Louisiana. So any location
      in Texas (including zip code 76008) must be west of any location in Louisiana

      - 76008 is in Texas (TX)

      - 70712 is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Texas is located directly west of Louisiana on the US map. The entire state
      of Texas is positioned west of Louisiana.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific zip codes.

      Since 76008 is in Texas and 70712 is in Louisiana, and Texas is entirely west
      of Louisiana, it follows that any location in Texas (including zip code 76008)
      must be west of any location in Louisiana (including zip code 70712).

      To answer this, I need to:

      1. Identify where 29067, SC is located

      2. Identify where 10457, NY is located

      3. Determine which is further west


      Let me think about the general geography of these states:

      - SC is South Carolina, which is on the east coast of the US, south of North
      Carolina

      - NY is New York, which is also on the east coast, but further north


      Now, US zip codes generally follow geographical patterns:

      - First digit: Generally follows east-to-west pattern (lower numbers in the
      east)

      - The "2" in 29067 suggests it''s in a mid-Atlantic/southeastern region

      - The "1" in 10457 suggests it''s in the northeast


      Based on the first digits alone, 29067 (starting with "2") would likely be further
      west than 10457 (starting with "1"), because zip codes generally increase from
      east to west.


      However, there are exceptions to this pattern, and the first digit only gives

      - 29067 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 10457 is in New York (NY)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - South Carolina is in the southeastern United States


      ## Step 3: Compare their longitude (east-west position)

      Looking at a US map, South Carolina is positioned significantly west of New
      York. While both are eastern states, South Carolina''s western edge extends
      further west than New York''s.


      ## Step 4: Consider ZIP code patterns

      The first digit of ZIP codes generally increases as you move west across the
      US. The fact that 29067 starts with "2" while 10457 starts with "1" aligns with
      South Carolina being west of New York.


      NO - 29067, SC is not located west of 10457, NY. It is located east of it.


      Wait, I made an error in my analysis. Let me correct this:


      South Carolina is actually located SOUTH and slightly WEST of New York. When

      located west of 10457, NY, I need to determine the locations of these zip codes
      and then check their relative positions east/west of each other.


      First, let me identify the states:

      - 29067 is in SC (South Carolina)

      - 10457 is in NY (New York)


      Generally speaking, South Carolina is south of New York, but I need to determine
      if it''s also west of New York.


      The United States is roughly oriented such that the East Coast runs from northeast
      (Maine) to southwest (Florida). New York is in the northeast, while South Carolina
      is in the southeast.


      When comparing east/west positions specifically:

      - New York is in the northeastern US

      - South Carolina is in the southeastern US


      Both states are on the eastern seaboard, but South Carolina is actually slightly
      to the west of New York because of the shape of the coastline - the East Coast
      curves from northeast to southwest.


      Therefore, 29067, SC would generally be west of 10457, NY.</think>I need to
      determine the east-west relationship between these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 29067 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 10457 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      New York is in the northeastern United States, while South Carolina is in the
      southeastern United States.


      Step 3: Analyze the east-west relationship.

      Although South Carolina is south of New York, the U.S. eastern coastline curves
      from northeast to southwest. This means that South Carolina, despite being on
      the East Coast, actually sits farther west than New York.


      Step 4: Confirm the specific zip codes.

      10457 is in the Bronx, New York, which is in the eastern part of New York State.

      29067 is in South Carolina, which is entirely west of the Bronx.

      to determine if the zip code 29067 in South Carolina is located west of the
      zip code 10457 in New York.


      In the US, zip codes generally follow a pattern where codes in the eastern parts
      of the country start with lower numbers, and codes in the western parts start
      with higher numbers. However, this is not a perfect east-west ordering, so I
      need to consider the states involved.


      Let''s think about the geographical positions:

      - South Carolina (SC) is a southeastern state

      - New York (NY) is a northeastern state


      South Carolina is generally south of New York, but I need to determine if it''s
      also west. Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - New York is in the northeast

      - South Carolina is in the southeast


      While South Carolina is indeed south of New York, it''s also generally west
      of New York. The eastern seaboard of the US curves, with New York being further
      east than South Carolina.


      Therefore, 29067, SC should be west of 10457, NY.</think>I need to determine
      whether the ZIP code in South Carolina is west of the ZIP code in New York.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 29067 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 10457 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - South Carolina is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Examine the east-west relationship.

      - While South Carolina is south of New York, it''s also important to note that
      the eastern coastline of the United States curves.

      - New York is further east along the Atlantic coast compared to South Carolina.

      - South Carolina sits further west in terms of longitude than New York.

      west of 03079, NH, I need to find the geographic locations of these two zip
      codes.


      32095 is a zip code in Florida (FL). Florida is located in the southeastern
      United States.

      03079 is a zip code in New Hampshire (NH). New Hampshire is located in the northeastern
      United States.


      In the United States, locations that are more western have a higher longitude
      (going from east to west). So I need to determine if Florida (specifically zip
      code 32095) is west of New Hampshire (specifically zip code 03079).


      Generally speaking, Florida is south and west of New Hampshire. The entire state
      of Florida is west of the entire state of New Hampshire. This is because New
      Hampshire is in the far northeast of the continental US, while Florida extends
      south from the southeastern US.


      So zip code 32095, FL should be west of zip code 03079, NH.</think>I need to
      determine if 32095, FL is west of 03079, NH by comparing their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 32095 is in Florida (FL)

      - 03079 is in New Hampshire (NH)


      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of these states.

      - New Hampshire is located in the northeastern United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - The entire state of New Hampshire is far to the east on the US map

      - Florida, while southern, is also significantly west of New Hampshire


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - All of Florida lies west of New Hampshire''s longitude

      - Therefore, zip code 32095 (FL) must be west of zip code 03079 (NH)


      YES'
    e4b48b9b-96fa-4725-addf-c13147940484: '<think>To solve this problem, I need to
      determine the geographical locations of these two zip codes and then compare
      their east-west positioning.


      32095, FL is a zip code in Florida (FL).

      03079, NH is a zip code in New Hampshire (NH).


      The United States is oriented such that generally:

      - Eastern states are on the right side of the map

      - Western states are on the left side of the map


      New Hampshire (NH) is located in the northeastern part of the United States,
      specifically in the New England region along the Atlantic coast.


      Florida (FL) is located in the southeastern part of the United States, along
      the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean.


      When comparing east-west positioning, we need to look at longitude. Lower longitude
      numbers in the US correspond to more western locations, while higher longitude
      numbers correspond to more eastern locations.


      In terms of east-west positioning, New Hampshire is further east than Florida.
      This means that a zip code in Florida would generally be west of a zip code
      in New Hampshire.


      Therefore, 32095, FL would be located west of 03079, NH.</think># Is 32095,

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 32095 is in Florida (FL)

      - 03079 is in New Hampshire (NH)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographical positions of these states

      - New Hampshire is located in the northeastern United States (New England region)

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States


      ## Step 3: Compare their longitudes

      - The United States spans from east to west, with eastern states having higher
      longitude values

      - New Hampshire is on the far eastern seaboard of the US

      - Florida is also on the eastern side of the US, but extends further west than
      New Hampshire


      ## Step 4: Make the east-west comparison

      - Any location in Florida will be west of any location in New Hampshire because
      New Hampshire is further east in the country

      zip codes and compare their longitudes. In the US, locations further west have
      more negative longitudes (or larger negative values).


      77008 is a zip code in Texas (TX). Texas is in the southwestern part of the
      United States.

      45801 is a zip code in Ohio (OH). Ohio is in the midwestern/eastern part of
      the United States.


      Generally speaking, Texas is west of Ohio. But let me think more specifically
      about these zip codes:


      77008 is in Houston, Texas. Houston is in the eastern part of Texas.

      45801 is in Lima, Ohio. Lima is in the northwestern part of Ohio.


      Even though 77008 is in the eastern part of Texas, Texas as a whole is significantly
      west of Ohio. So it''s very likely that 77008, TX is west of 45801, OH.


      To be completely sure, we would want to compare the exact longitudes of these

      determine if 77008, TX is west of 45801, OH, I need to analyze the geographic
      locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 77008 is a zip code in Houston, Texas

      - 45801 is a zip code in Lima, Ohio


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positioning of Texas and Ohio within the United
      States.

      - Texas is located in the southern central part of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the eastern part of the Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Texas is significantly west of Ohio on the US map

      - Even though Houston is in eastern Texas, all of Texas is still west of all
      of Ohio


      Step 4: Determine the result.

      - Since 77008 (Houston, TX) is in Texas, and 45801 (Lima, OH) is in Ohio, and
      Texas is west of Ohio, 77008 must be west of 45801.


      YES'

      Texas is generally west of Ohio. Houston, TX is definitely west of any location

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Ohio is located in the eastern part of the Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - When looking at a US map, Texas is clearly positioned to the west of Ohio

      - Houston (77008) specifically is west of any point in Ohio, including Lima

      77008 is a zip code in Houston, Texas.

      45801 is a zip code in Lima, Ohio.


      Now I need to determine which one is further west. In the United States, locations
      further west have longer longitude values (more negative numbers, since the
      US is in the western hemisphere).


      Texas is generally west of Ohio in the United States. The entire state of Ohio
      is east of Texas. Therefore, without even looking up the exact longitude coordinates,
      I can say that 77008, TX (in Houston) is west of 45801, OH (in Lima).


      So the answer is YES, 77008, TX is located west of 45801, OH.


      Actually, I need to correct myself. In the western hemisphere (which includes
      the United States), locations further west have MORE NEGATIVE longitude values,
      not longer values. For example, the west coast of the US has longitudes around
      -120 degrees, while the east coast has longitudes around -75 degrees.

      I''ll approach this by identifying the geographical locations of these zip codes
      and then comparing their relative positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 61801 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 24201 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Think about the general geography of the United States.

      Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States, while Virginia is on
      the East Coast. Generally speaking, states in the Midwest are west of states
      on the East Coast.


      Step 3: More specifically, Illinois is west of Virginia in terms of longitude.
      If you look at a map of the United States, Illinois is clearly to the west of
      Virginia.


      Step 4: Since 61801 is in Illinois and 24201 is in Virginia, and Illinois is
      west of Virginia, it follows that 61801 is west of 24201.


      Therefore, the answer is YES, 61801 (IL) is located west of 24201 (VA).</think>I
      need to determine if zip code 61801 in Illinois is west of zip code 24201 in
      Virginia by comparing their relative geographical positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 61801 is in Urbana, Illinois (IL)

      - 24201 is in Bristol, Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Illinois and Virginia within the
      United States.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region

      - Virginia is located on the East Coast


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Illinois is significantly west of Virginia on the map of the United States

      - States in the Midwest (like Illinois) are generally west of East Coast states
      (like Virginia)


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on geographic position.

      Since 61801 is in Illinois and 24201 is in Virginia, and Illinois is west of
      Virginia, it follows that zip code 61801 must be west of zip code 24201.

      to determine whether 61801, IL (Illinois) is located west of 24201, VA (Virginia).


      In the US, locations that are further west have larger longitudinal values (in
      the negative direction, since US longitudes are all negative). So I need to
      compare the longitudes of these two zip codes.


      61801 is a zip code for Urbana, Illinois. Illinois is in the Midwest region
      of the United States.

      24201 is a zip code for Bristol, Virginia. Virginia is in the Eastern part of
      the United States.


      Based on US geography, Illinois is generally west of Virginia. The entire state
      of Illinois is west of the entire state of Virginia. So the answer should be
      YES, 61801, IL is west of 24201, VA.


      Let me double-check by thinking about the general positions of these states.
      Virginia borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east, while Illinois is in the Midwest
      and borders the Mississippi River on its western border. There are several states
      between Illinois and Virginia (like Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia),
      all of which are east of Illinois and west of Virginia.</think>I need to determine
      whether zip code 61801 in Illinois is located west of zip code 24201 in Virginia.


      Step 1: Let me identify these locations.

      - 61801 is a zip code for Urbana, Illinois

      - 24201 is a zip code for Bristol, Virginia


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Virginia is located on the East Coast


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Virginia borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east

      - Illinois is much further inland, west of states like Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky

      - The entire state of Illinois is west of the entire state of Virginia


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Urbana, Illinois (61801) is in a state that is entirely west of Virginia,
      it must be west of Bristol, Virginia (24201).

      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west)


      31210 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)

      22150 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)


      Geographically, Georgia is located south and west of Virginia in the United
      States. If we look at a US map:

      - Georgia is in the southeastern US

      - Virginia is on the east coast, north of Georgia


      Since Georgia is west of Virginia on the map (Georgia is further inland while
      Virginia is on the eastern seaboard), a zip code in Georgia would generally
      be west of a zip code in Virginia.


      Therefore, 31210, GA should be west of 22150, VA.</think>I need to determine
      if 31210, GA is located west of 22150, VA by examining their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 31210 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 22150 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Determine the general geographic relationship between these states.

      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, while Virginia is on the
      eastern seaboard, northeast of Georgia.


      Step 3: Consider their relative east-west positioning.

      On a US map, Georgia is positioned to the west of Virginia. Virginia borders
      the Atlantic Ocean directly, while Georgia is further inland. When comparing
      states on the same latitude, locations in Georgia will be west of locations
      in Virginia.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      While specific zip codes might have some variation, the overall state positioning
      determines that a zip code in Georgia (31210) would be west of a zip code in
      Virginia (22150).

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 31210 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 22150 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      Georgia is located west of Virginia on the US map. Georgia is in the southeastern
      US, while Virginia is on the east coast. Going from Virginia to Georgia, you
      would generally travel westward (and also southward).

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 31210 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 22150 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - Virginia is located on the east coast, northeast of Georgia


      Step 3: Determine the specific locations.

      - 31210 is in the Macon area of Georgia

      - 22150 is in the Springfield area of Virginia (near Washington D.C.)

      Louisiana is east of most of Texas.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - 78380 appears to be in the southern part of Texas

      - 70065 appears to be in the southern part of Louisiana


      Step 4: Apply geographic reasoning.

      Even the easternmost parts of Texas are generally west of Louisiana. Since we''re

      of US zip codes, the Texas zip code will be west of the Louisiana one.

      2. Identify where 70065, LA is located

      3. Compare their geographical positions to determine if the TX location is west
      of the LA location


      Let me think about this:


      - 78380 is in Texas (TX)

      - 70065 is in Louisiana (LA)


      Geographically, Texas is located to the west of Louisiana in the United States.
      The entire state of Texas is west of Louisiana.


      Since 78380 is in Texas and 70065 is in Louisiana, we can generally say that
      78380, TX is west of 70065, LA.


      However, I should be careful as zip codes along the border between states could
      potentially violate this general rule. But given the zip code patterns, these
      seem to be well within their respective states:

      - 78xxx zip codes are typically in central/southern Texas

      - 70xxx zip codes are typically in Louisiana


      So the Texas zip code 78380 should indeed be west of the Louisiana zip code
      70065.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic locations

      - 78380 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      - 70065 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Texas is located directly west of Louisiana in the United States. The entire
      state of Texas lies west of Louisiana.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      Both zip codes (78380 and 70065) appear to be well within their respective states,
      not just at border areas where this relationship might be complicated.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on state positions.

      Since 78380 is in Texas and 70065 is in Louisiana, and Texas is west of Louisiana,
      the zip code in Texas must be west of the zip code in Louisiana.

      78380 is a zip code in Texas (TX).

      70065 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA).


      Generally speaking, Texas is west of Louisiana since Louisiana is on the Gulf
      Coast and Texas is to its west. But I should verify the specific locations of
      these zip codes.


      Let me reason about these specific zip codes:

      - 78380 appears to be a zip code in Texas. Based on my knowledge, zip codes
      in the 783xx range would be in southern Texas.

      - 70065 appears to be a zip code in Louisiana. Zip codes in the 700xx range
      would be in southeastern Louisiana.


      Since Texas is west of Louisiana, and these zip codes appear to be in their
      respective states without any unusual geographic anomalies that would change
      this relationship, I can conclude that 78380, TX is indeed west of 70065, LA.</think>I

      - 78380 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      - 70065 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Looking at a US map, Texas is located to the west of Louisiana. Louisiana borders
      the Gulf of Mexico on the east side, while Texas extends further west.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - 78380 is in southern Texas (zip codes in the 783xx range are typically in
      southern Texas)

      - 70065 is in southeastern Louisiana (zip codes in the 700xx range are in southeastern
      Louisiana)


      Step 4: Determine the east-west relationship.

      Since Texas lies west of Louisiana, and these specific zip codes maintain this
      general state-to-state geographic relationship, zip code 78380 in TX must be
      west of zip code 70065 in LA.

      - 78380 is in Robstown, Texas, in the southern part of the state

      - 70065 is in Kenner, Louisiana, in the southeastern part of that state


      Step 4: Compare their relative positions.

      - Even though these are specific areas within their states, they maintain the

      85255 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ), specifically in the Scottsdale area.

      80130 is a zip code in Colorado (CO), specifically in the Highlands Ranch area.


      Geographically speaking, Arizona is located to the west of Colorado in the United
      States. The entire state of Arizona is west of Colorado, as Arizona borders
      California on the west coast while Colorado is more inland.


      So if we''re comparing the longitude (east-west position):

      - Arizona longitudes are generally more negative (further west) than Colorado
      longitudes

      - 85255 (Scottsdale, AZ) should be west of 80130 (Highlands Ranch, CO)

      west of 80130, CO?


      To answer this question, I need to think about the geographical locations of
      these zip codes and their respective states.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) 85255 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ), specifically in the Scottsdale area.

      2) 80130 is a zip code in Colorado (CO), specifically in the Highlands Ranch

      ## Answer: YES


      85255, AZ is indeed located west of 80130, CO.'

      In the US, zip codes follow some geographical patterns. Let me reason through
      this:


      1) 85255 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ)

      2) 80130 is a zip code in Colorado (CO)


      To determine which is further west, I need to know the relative positions of
      these states:

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States

      - Colorado is located in the western/central United States, but it''s east of
      Arizona


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Arizona shares its eastern border with New
      Mexico, and Colorado is east of both Arizona and Utah. So in general, Arizona
      is west of Colorado.


      Given that 85255 is in Arizona and 80130 is in Colorado, it''s very likely that
      85255 is west of 80130. The specific zip codes could potentially be close to
      state borders, but even then, the geography of these states makes it virtually
      certain that any location in Arizona would be west of any location in Colorado.</think>To
      determine if 85255, AZ is located west of 80130, CO, I need to analyze the geographic

      - 80130 is in Colorado (CO)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Arizona and Colorado

      Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, while Colorado is in the
      Rocky Mountain region. Looking at a map of the United States, Arizona is positioned
      directly to the west of New Mexico, and Colorado is located to the north of
      New Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions

      Arizona''s entire territory is west of Colorado''s territory. The two states
      don''t share a border - New Mexico sits between them. Even the easternmost point
      of Arizona is still west of the westernmost point of Colorado.


      Step 4: Conclude about the specific zip codes

      Since 85255 is in Arizona and 80130 is in Colorado, and all of Arizona is west
      of all of Colorado, it follows that 85255 must be west of 80130.

      1) 85255 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ)

      3) To determine which is west of the other, I need to consider the geographic
      locations of these states


      Looking at a US map:

      - Arizona (AZ) is located in the southwestern United States

      - Colorado (CO) is located in the western/central United States

      - Arizona is located west of Colorado


      So if 85255 is in Arizona and 80130 is in Colorado, then 85255 would be west
      of 80130.


      Let me double-check this reasoning:

      - Arizona borders California, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, and Mexico

      - Colorado borders Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona,
      and Utah

      - Arizona is indeed to the west of Colorado (Colorado''s western border touches

      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States

      - Colorado is located in the western/central United States

      - When looking at a US map, Arizona is positioned to the west of Colorado


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the zip codes.

      - Since 85255 is in Arizona, and 80130 is in Colorado, and Arizona is west of
      Colorado, the zip code in Arizona would be west of the zip code in Colorado.

      85255, AZ is located west of zip code 80130, CO.


      First, I''ll identify the states:

      - 85255 is in Arizona (AZ)

      - 80130 is in Colorado (CO)


      In terms of US geography, Arizona is located to the west of Colorado. The states
      border arrangement from west to east in this region is roughly:

      California -> Nevada/Arizona -> Utah/Colorado


      So Arizona is indeed west of Colorado geographically.


      Now, while zip codes can sometimes be arranged in counterintuitive ways, the
      first digits of zip codes generally follow a west-to-east pattern in the US:

      - Zip codes beginning with 8 are in the Mountain time zone states

      - Zip codes beginning with 9 are in the Pacific time zone states (farthest west)


      Since 85255 begins with 8, it''s in the Mountain time zone (like Colorado),
      but Arizona is indeed west of Colorado.


      In this case, the specific zip codes align with the general geographical relationship
      of their states. Arizona (85255) is west of Colorado (80130).</think>To determine
      if 85255, AZ is located west of 80130, CO, I need to analyze the geographical

      - 85255 is in Arizona (AZ)

      - 80130 is in Colorado (CO)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Arizona is located to the west of Colorado on the US map. These two states are
      not adjacent (New Mexico sits between them), but Arizona is definitely westward
      of Colorado.


      Step 3: Verify if these specific zip codes follow the general state relationship.

      While zip codes sometimes can have counterintuitive arrangements, in this case
      the zip codes do follow the general state positions. 85255 (Scottsdale area
      in Arizona) is indeed west of 80130 (Highlands Ranch area in Colorado).

      Let me think about US geography:

      - Arizona (AZ) is located in the southwestern United States

      - Colorado (CO) is located in the Rocky Mountain region of the western United
      States

      - In general, Arizona is west of Colorado


      Let me also think about the zip code numbering system. In the US postal system:

      - Lower zip code numbers tend to be in the eastern parts of the country

      - Higher zip code numbers tend to be in the western parts

      - But this is a general trend with many exceptions, not an absolute rule


      Looking at the specific zip codes:

      - 85255 is in Arizona

      - 80130 is in Colorado


      Since Arizona is generally west of Colorado, and the natural geographic boundary

      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Arizona shares its eastern border with New Mexico

      - Colorado is located east of Utah and Arizona

      - On a map of the United States, Arizona is clearly west of Colorado

      if 24354, VA is located west of 28457, NC.


      Step 1: I need to understand the geographic locations of these zip codes.

      - 24354 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      - 28457 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: In general, US zip codes tend to follow patterns where lower numbers
      are often in the eastern parts of the country and higher numbers toward the
      west, but this isn''t always reliable for close comparisons. Let me think about
      the states instead.


      Step 3: Virginia (VA) is generally located north of North Carolina (NC). However,
      the question is asking about east/west positioning, not north/south.


      Step 4: Virginia is positioned to the north and somewhat to the west of North
      Carolina, especially in its western portions. But I need to be more specific
      about these particular zip codes.


      I don''t have the exact coordinates of these specific zip codes in my knowledge.
      To give a definitive answer, I would need to know the precise locations of these
      zip codes.


      Since I don''t have the exact locations, I''ll make an educated guess based
      on zip code patterns. The 243xx zip codes in Virginia are typically in the southwestern
      part of Virginia, while 284xx zip codes in North Carolina are generally in the
      central or western parts of North Carolina.</think># Is 24354, VA located west
      of 28457, NC?


      I need to determine the geographic locations of these zip codes and compare
      their east-west positioning.


      ## Step 1: Identify the regions

      - 24354 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 28457 is in North Carolina (NC)


      ## Step 2: Analyze zip code patterns

      - ZIP codes in the US generally follow a pattern where codes increase as you
      move west to east

      - Lower numbered ZIP codes (like 24xxx) tend to be west of higher numbered ones
      (like 28xxx)


      ## Step 3: Verify state positioning

      - Looking at the specific regions, the 243xx ZIP codes are typically in southwestern
      Virginia

      - The 284xx ZIP codes are generally in central/western North Carolina


      ## Step 4: Make geographic comparison

      - Since 24354 (VA) has a lower ZIP code number than 28457 (NC), and considering
      ZIP codes generally increase from west to east, the Virginia location is likely
      west of the North Carolina location

      - Additionally, southwestern Virginia is indeed west of most of North Carolina

      - 24354 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      - 28457 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: I need to determine the relative positions of these locations on a map
      to see which one is further west.


      Let me try to recall the general geography of Virginia and North Carolina. Virginia
      is north of North Carolina. The western parts of both states extend into the
      Appalachian Mountains.


      For specific zip codes, I would normally need to look up the exact locations.
      But I can reason about some general patterns in zip codes.


      In the US postal system, zip codes generally increase from east to west, but
      there are many exceptions and regional patterns. The first digit of zip codes
      ranges from 0 in the northeast to 9 in the west. Both of these zip codes start
      with 2, which places them in the eastern part of the US.


      More specifically:

      - Zip codes starting with 24xxx are typically in western/southwestern Virginia

      - Zip codes starting with 28xxx are typically in central/western North Carolina


      Without knowing the exact locations, I can''t be completely certain. However,
      Virginia is generally west of North Carolina in their western portions (the
      state boundary angles northwest), so a western Virginia zip code is likely to
      be west of a North Carolina zip code.</think># Determining if 24354, VA is west
      of 28457, NC


      I need to determine the geographical locations of these zip codes and compare
      their east-west positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 24354 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      - 28457 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)


      ## Step 2: Analyze zip code patterns

      In the US postal system, zip codes are assigned with some geographical patterns:

      - Zip codes beginning with 24xxx are typically in western/southwestern Virginia

      - Zip codes beginning with 28xxx are typically in western/central North Carolina


      ## Step 3: Consider state geography

      Looking at the state boundaries, Virginia is north of North Carolina. However,
      in the western portions of these states, the Virginia-North Carolina border
      runs at an angle where western Virginia extends westward of parts of western
      North Carolina.


      ## Step 4: Compare specific locations

      24354 corresponds to Marion, VA, which is in the southwestern part of Virginia.

      28457 corresponds to an area near Salisbury, NC, which is in the central part
      of North Carolina.


      When plotting these on a map, Marion, VA (24354) is indeed west of the area
      covered by 28457 in NC.

      longitude value than the NC zip code, then it''s located west.


      Let me think about the general geography of Virginia and North Carolina. Virginia
      is generally north of North Carolina, but parts of western Virginia extend west
      of parts of North Carolina. So this is not immediately obvious from just the
      states.


      I need to determine the specific locations of these zip codes. I know that:

      - 24354 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 28457 is in North Carolina (NC)


      The first digits of ZIP codes generally follow geographical patterns, with lower
      numbers in the northeast and higher numbers in the southwest, but I need to
      be precise here.


      ZIP code 24xxx would be in the western part of Virginia.

      ZIP code 28xxx would be in the western/central part of North Carolina.


      Based on ZIP code numbering patterns, 24xxx would likely be northwest of 28xxx,
      which would place 24354, VA to the west of 28457, NC. However, I should be careful
      about making this determination just based on ZIP code patterns.


      Without being able to look up the exact coordinates, I''ll have to use my knowledge
      of US geography and ZIP code distribution. ZIP codes starting with 24 are generally
      in the western part of Virginia, while ZIP codes starting with 28 are generally
      in the central to western parts of North Carolina. Given that Virginia is north
      of North Carolina, and western Virginia extends further west than much of North

      1. 24354, VA is a zip code in Virginia (VA state)

      2. 28457, NC is a zip code in North Carolina (NC state)


      I need to determine their relative east-west positions. In the United States,
      generally:

      - States on the east coast tend to be arranged with Virginia (VA) north of North
      Carolina (NC)

      - But the question is asking about the east-west relationship, not north-south


      Virginia is generally to the north and west of North Carolina. Looking at a
      map of the eastern United States:

      - Virginia''s western regions extend farther west than North Carolina

      - The western parts of Virginia border Kentucky and Tennessee

      - North Carolina is more eastward-oriented along the Atlantic coast


      Given that 24354 is in Virginia, and specifically this seems to be in the western
      part of Virginia (lower zip codes in Virginia tend to be in the western regions),
      it''s likely this is in western VA.


      The zip code 28457 in North Carolina would be in a central or eastern part of
      North Carolina.

      - 28457 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Analyze the geographical arrangement of these states.

      Virginia is located north of North Carolina. However, the western portion of
      Virginia extends further west than North Carolina does.


      Step 3: Examine the zip code patterns.

      - Lower zip codes in Virginia (like 24xxx) are typically in the western and
      southwestern regions of the state

      - 24354 specifically is in the southwestern part of Virginia (likely near the
      border with Tennessee/Kentucky)

      - North Carolina zip codes starting with 284xx are generally in the central
      or eastern parts of North Carolina


      Step 4: Compare the east-west positions.

      The southwestern portion of Virginia (where 24354 is located) is indeed west
      of the central/eastern portions of North Carolina (where 28457 is located).

      To solve this problem, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west)


      Let me reason through this:


      ZIP code 24354 is in Virginia (VA).

      ZIP code 28457 is in North Carolina (NC).


      Generally speaking, Virginia is north of North Carolina. But the question is
      asking about east/west positioning, not north/south.


      Virginia is generally to the north and east of North Carolina, with western
      Virginia bordering eastern Tennessee and northeastern North Carolina. However,
      specific zip codes can be different from the general state positioning.


      For these specific zip codes:

      - 24354 (VA) is likely in southwest Virginia based on the numbering pattern
      (ZIP codes in eastern VA typically start with 22 or 23)

      - 28457 (NC) is likely in central or eastern North Carolina (NC ZIP codes often
      start with 27-28 in central/eastern regions)


      Based on typical ZIP code geography patterns, 24354 in VA is likely in the western
      part of Virginia, while 28457 in NC is likely more centrally or eastern located
      in North Carolina.


      This suggests that 24354, VA would be west of 28457, NC.</think># Is 24354,

      - 24354 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      - 28457 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)


      ## Step 2: Analyze ZIP code patterns

      - ZIP codes in the 243xx range are typically in southwestern Virginia

      - ZIP codes in the 284xx range are typically in central to eastern North Carolina


      ## Step 3: Consider the states'' relative positions

      - Virginia is generally north of North Carolina

      - Western Virginia extends further west than most of North Carolina

      - Eastern North Carolina extends further east than most of Virginia


      ## Step 4: Compare these specific ZIP codes

      - 24354 (VA) is in the southwestern region of Virginia

      - 28457 (NC) is in a more central/eastern part of North Carolina


      Based on this analysis of ZIP code geography patterns, 24354 in Virginia is

      1. I need to determine if 24354, VA is located west of 28457, NC.

      2. To do this, I need to figure out where these zip codes are located and compare
      their longitudes (east-west positions).


      First, let me analyze the zip codes:

      - 24354 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 28457 is in North Carolina (NC)


      In general, US zip codes are organized geographically, with lower numbers typically
      in the eastern parts of the country and higher numbers in the western parts.
      However, this is a rough pattern with many exceptions, so I need to be more
      precise.


      Looking at these specific zip codes:

      - Virginia (VA) is generally north of North Carolina (NC)

      - But the question is about east-west positioning, not north-south


      The 20000-series zip codes are typically in the mid-Atlantic region, including
      Virginia

      The 28000-series zip codes are typically in North Carolina


      24354 (VA) is likely in western/southwestern Virginia

      28457 (NC) is likely in central or possibly eastern North Carolina


      Based on my knowledge of US geography, western Virginia is likely west of most
      parts of North Carolina. So 24354, VA is probably west of 28457, NC.


      However, I should note that without looking up the exact locations, this is
      just an educated guess based on zip code patterns.</think># Is 24354, VA located

      I''ll solve this step by step by determining the locations of these zip codes

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 24354 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      - 28457 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Analyze the regional geography.

      - US zip codes generally follow geographical patterns.

      - The 243xx range covers southwestern Virginia.

      - The 284xx range covers central/southern North Carolina.


      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      - Virginia is north of North Carolina.

      - Western/southwestern Virginia (where 24354 is located) extends westward.

      - Zip code 24354 corresponds to the Marion area in southwest Virginia.

      - Zip code 28457 corresponds to an area in central/southern North Carolina.


      Step 4: Compare longitudes.

      - Southwest Virginia is indeed west of central/southern North Carolina.

      - On a map, 24354 (Marion, VA) would be to the west of locations in the 28457
      area of North Carolina.

      To solve this, I''ll need to:

      1. Identify where these zip codes are located in their respective states

      2. Determine if the Texas location is west of the Florida location


      First, let''s think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Texas is located in the southwestern/south-central part of the US

      - Florida is located in the southeastern part of the US

      - In general, Texas is west of Florida


      Now, let''s be more specific:

      75150 is a zip code in Texas. I don''t need to know exactly where in Texas,
      because all of Texas is west of all of Florida on the US map.

      33703 is a zip code in Florida.

      locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Texas is located in the south-central United States, while Florida is in the
      southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Texas and Florida.

      Looking at a US map, the entire state of Texas is positioned west of the entire
      state of Florida. The eastern border of Texas is still significantly west of
      the western border of Florida.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 75150 is in Texas and 33703 is in Florida, and all of Texas is west of
      all of Florida, zip code 75150 must be west of zip code 33703.

    b32a03c4-f480-4272-bb07-f915e37e0bfc: '<think>To determine if 91360, CA is west
      of 84056, UT, I need to find the locations of these zip codes and compare their
      longitudes. Places with more negative longitudes in the US are further west.


      91360 is a zip code in California (CA). Let me recall where in California this
      is. California is on the west coast of the US, and generally California locations
      are west of Utah locations, but I should verify the specific zip codes.


      84056 is a zip code in Utah (UT). Utah is in the western United States, but
      it''s east of California.


      91360 appears to be in Thousand Oaks, California, which is in Southern California
      near Los Angeles.

      84056 appears to be in the Salt Lake City area of Utah.


      Generally speaking, all of California is west of all of Utah, since California
      borders the Pacific Ocean and Utah is an inland state with California to its
      west. So based on state geography alone, 91360 CA should be west of 84056 UT.


      Let me double-check this reasoning: The westernmost point of Utah is still east
      of the easternmost point of California. So any location in California will be
      west of any location in Utah.</think># Is 91360, CA located west of 84056, UT?


      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the states: 91360 is in California (CA) and 84056
      is in Utah (UT).


      2) Looking at US geography, California is located on the Pacific coast, while
      Utah is an inland state.


      3) California is positioned entirely west of Utah on the map. The easternmost
      point of California is still west of the westernmost point of Utah.


      4) More specifically, 91360 is in Thousand Oaks, California (in the southern
      part of the state), and 84056 is in the Salt Lake City area of Utah.


      5) Since all of California is west of all of Utah geographically, any zip code
      in California (including 91360) must be west of any zip code in Utah (including
      84056).


      Therefore, YES, 91360, CA is located west of 84056, UT.'
