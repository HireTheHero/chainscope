      zip code:** 42431 is in Kentucky (KY), which is a state in the eastern US. 18951

      Kentucky.


      2. **Determine the relative east-west positions:**  Kentucky is generally west

      3. **Consider the possibility of exceptions:** While Kentucky is generally west
      of Pennsylvania, the specific zip codes could be close to the border, making
      this less clear-cut.  However, Kentucky as a whole is significantly west of
      Pennsylvania.  It''s highly improbable a zip code in Kentucky would be east

      a zip code in western PA.  We need to confirm the general east/west locations

      2. **General US Geography:** Virginia is generally north of North Carolina.  The

      4. **Without precise coordinates:**  While zip codes give a general location,
      they don''t give precise longitude/latitude.  It''s possible, but unlikely given
      the north/south relationship of the states, that 24354 could be far enough west
      to be west of 28457.


      Therefore, a definitive YES or NO isn''t confidently possible without looking
      up the precise locations of the zip codes. However, based on general US geography,
      the answer is likely NO.


      **Checking the locations (for informational purposes after the reasoning):**

      A quick search shows 24354 (Fries, VA) is at approximately -80.9 longitude and
      28457 (Oak Island, NC) is at approximately -78.1 longitude.  This confirms 24354

      and NC is North Carolina.

      2. **General US Geography:** Virginia is generally north of North Carolina.  The
      border between them runs roughly east-west.

      3. **West vs. East:**  Since Virginia is north of North Carolina, a location
      in Virginia would need to be significantly west of a location in North Carolina
      for it to be "west" in the true sense. A small difference in longitude won''t
      overcome the large difference in latitude.

      4. **Look up Zip Codes (optional but recommended for accuracy):** A quick search
      shows 24354 (Fries, VA) is at approximately -81.04 longitude and 36.71 latitude.  28457
      (Oak Island, NC) is at approximately -78.13 longitude and 33.91 latitude.

      5. **Compare Longitudes:** -81.04 is west of -78.13.

      3. **West/East relationship:**  Since Virginia is north of North Carolina, a
      location in Virginia would need to be significantly *west* of a point in North
      Carolina for it to be considered west.  Just being slightly west might mean
      it''s actually northwest or even basically north.

      4. **Zip code lookup (optional but useful):** A quick search shows 24354 is
      in Meadowview, VA and 28457 is in Oak Island, NC.  Oak Island is on the coast
      of North Carolina. Meadowview, VA is in the southwestern part of Virginia.
