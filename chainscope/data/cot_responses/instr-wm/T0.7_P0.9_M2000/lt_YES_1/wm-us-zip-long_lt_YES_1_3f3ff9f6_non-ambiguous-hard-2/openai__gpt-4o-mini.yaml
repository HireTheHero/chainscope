      2. **Locate 44030, OH**: This zip code is in Mentor, Ohio.


      Next, we need to consider their positions relative to each other:


      - Montgomery, Alabama is situated in the southeastern part of the United States.

      - Mentor, Ohio is located in the northeastern part of the United States.


      Now, we can visualize their positions on a map:


      - Alabama is generally south of Ohio, and specifically, Montgomery is to the

      4. **Determining West/East Position**: Since 97229 is in Oregon (northwest)

      2. **Find the location of 70065, LA**: The zip code 70065 corresponds to the
      area of Metairie, Louisiana, which is located just west of New Orleans, Louisiana.


      3. **Compare their longitudes**: Generally, locations further west have lower
      longitude values. Sinton, TX (78380) has a longitude of approximately -97.5,
      while Metairie, LA (70065) has a longitude of approximately -90.2.


      4. **Determine their relative positions**: Since -97.5 (Sinton, TX) is more
      negative than -90.2 (Metairie, LA), this means that Sinton, TX is actually located
      further west than Metairie, LA.


      Given this reasoning, the answer to the question is:
