      Michigan is located west of zip code 28607 in North Carolina, let''s proceed
      step by step.


      **Step 1: Identify the locations of the zip codes.**


      - Zip Code 49337 corresponds to Newaygo, Michigan.

      - Zip Code 28607 corresponds to Boone, North Carolina.


      **Step 2: Understand the general geography of the states.**


      - Michigan is located in the Midwest region of the United States.

      - North Carolina is on the East Coast of the United States.


      From this, we can already suspect that Michigan is generally west of North Carolina.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes of the two zip codes.**


      Longitude is the geographic coordinate that specifies the east-west position
      of a point on the Earth''s surface.


      - Newaygo, MI (49337) has a longitude of approximately -85.8 degrees.

      - Boone, NC (28607) has a longitude of approximately -81.7 degrees.


      **Step 4: Interpret the longitude values.**


      Longitudes are negative in the Western Hemisphere. A more negative number indicates
      a location further west.


      - -85.8 (49337) is further west than -81.7 (28607).


      **Conclusion:**


      Since 49337 (Newaygo, MI) is at a more westerly longitude than 28607 (Boone,
      NC), we can conclude that 49337 is located west of 28607.

      - ZIP codes in the United States are generally assigned from east to west. Lower
      numbers are in the eastern part of the country, and higher numbers are in the
      west.

      - ZIP code 45449 is in Ohio, which is in the eastern portion of the United States.

      \ is in **Ewing, New Jersey**.\n\n2. **Understand the geography of the states:**\n\
      \   - **Mississippi (MS)** is a southern U.S. state located to the west of the\
      \ Appalachian Mountains.\n   - **New Jersey (NJ)** is located in the northeastern\
      \ part of the United States, along the Atlantic coast.\n\n3. **Compare their\
      \ relative positions:**\n   - Mississippi is generally west of New Jersey. The\
      \ entire state of Mississippi lies west of the entire state of New Jersey.\n\
      \   - Therefore, any location in Mississippi, including Corinth (38834), is\

      step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the ZIP codes.

      - ZIP code 24486 is in Virginia (VA). Specifically, 24486 corresponds to Vesuvius,
      VA, which is in Rockbridge County in western Virginia.

      - ZIP code 08221 is in New Jersey (NJ). Specifically, 08221 corresponds to Northfield,
      NJ, which is in Atlantic County in southern New Jersey, close to the Atlantic
      Ocean.


      Step 2: Understand the geographical layout.

      - Virginia is generally located to the southwest of New Jersey.

      - Western Virginia (where ZIP code 24486 is located) is closer to the Appalachian
      Mountains and clearly lies inland.

      - Southern New Jersey (where ZIP code 08221 is located) is on the east coast
      of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare longitude coordinates (east-west positioning).

      - Longitude increases as you go west in the United States.

      - ZIP code 24486 (Vesuvius, VA) is approximately at longitude -79.27.

      - ZIP code 08221 (Northfield, NJ) is approximately at longitude -74.57.


      Step 4: Interpret the data.

      - Since -79.27 is farther west than -74.57, Vesuvius, VA (24486) is located
      west of Northfield, NJ (08221).

    f3f02888-c020-4100-9140-21c7c57089dd: 'To determine whether ZIP code 70444 (in
      Louisiana) is located west of ZIP code 22936 (in Virginia), we need to follow
      a step-by-step geographic reasoning process.


      **Step 1: Identify the locations of the ZIP codes.**

      - ZIP code 70444 is located in Louisiana, specifically in the southeastern part
      of the state.

      - ZIP code 22936 is located in Virginia, specifically in the central part of
      the state.


      **Step 2: Understand US geography.**

      - Louisiana is located in the southern United States and is generally to the
      west of Virginia.

      - Virginia is on the eastern side of the U.S., along the Atlantic coast, while
      Louisiana is along the Gulf of Mexico, to the southwest of Virginia.


      **Step 3: Use longitude to determine east-west positioning.**

      - ZIP code 70444 (LA) has a longitude approximately around -90.4.

      - ZIP code 22936 (VA) has a longitude approximately around -78.6.


      **Step 4: Compare the longitudes.**

      - The more negative the longitude, the farther west the location is.

      - -90.4 (LA) is west of -78.6 (VA).


      **Conclusion:**

      Since 70444 (LA) is farther west than 22936 (VA), the answer is:


      **YES**'

      - Kentucky is a southeastern U.S. state, while Vermont is in the northeastern
      part of the country.

      - On a map of the U.S., Kentucky is generally located to the west of Vermont.


      Step 3: Confirm using longitude.

      - The longitude of ZIP code 40109 (KY) is approximately -85.7 degrees.

      - The longitude of ZIP code 05677 (VT) is approximately -72.7 degrees.

      - ZIP code 97229 is in northwest Oregon, specifically in the Portland metropolitan
      area.

      - ZIP code 90650 is in southeast Los Angeles County, California, specifically
      in the city of Norwalk or surrounding areas.


      **Step 2: Determine the longitudinal coordinates of each ZIP code.**

      - 97229 (Portland, OR area): Longitude approximately -122.8

      - 90650 (Los Angeles, CA area): Longitude approximately -118.1


      **Step 3: Understand how longitude works.**

      - The further west you go, the more negative the longitude becomes.

      - So, a longitude of -122.8 is west of a longitude of -118.1

      - Zip code 26041 is in West Virginia (WV), specifically in the northern part
      of the state.

      - Zip code 07070 is in New Jersey (NJ), specifically in the northeastern part
      of the state, in the town of Rutherford.

      - 07070 (Rutherford, NJ) is located just west of New York City.


      Step 4: Use longitude to assess "west of" status.

      - Longitude measures east-west position. A location with a more negative (or

      Ohio is located west of ZIP code 19363 in Pennsylvania, we need to analyze their
      geographical positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the ZIP codes.

      - ZIP code 44095 is in Willowick, Ohio, which is located in the northeastern
      part of Ohio, near Lake Erie and close to Cleveland.

      - ZIP code 19363 is in Oxford, Pennsylvania, which is located in the southeastern
      part of Pennsylvania, not far from the Maryland border.


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of Ohio and Pennsylvania.

      - Ohio is to the west of Pennsylvania. Therefore, generally, most locations
      in Ohio will be west of locations in Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Willowick, OH (44095) is in northeastern Ohio, which is still west of southeastern
      Pennsylvania.

      - Oxford, PA (19363) is in southeastern Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Use longitude for precise comparison.

      - Willowick, OH (44095) is approximately at longitude -81.47.

      - Oxford, PA (19363) is approximately at longitude -75.99.


      Since -81.47 < -75.99, this confirms that 44095 is farther west (more negative
      longitude) than 19363.


      Final Answer: YES.'

      to determine whether ZIP code 15468 in Pennsylvania is located west of ZIP code
      01810 in Massachusetts.


      Step 1: Understand ZIP code numbering in the US.

      - ZIP codes in the US generally increase from east to west. That means lower
      ZIP codes are typically in the eastern states, and higher ZIP codes are found
      further west.


      Step 2: Identify the locations of the two ZIP codes.

      - ZIP code 01810 is located in Andover, Massachusetts. This is in the northeastern
      United States.

      - ZIP code 15468 is located in New Salem, Pennsylvania, which is in the southwestern
      part of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Compare the geographic positions.

      - Massachusetts is located to the northeast of Pennsylvania.

      - Andover, MA is near the eastern edge of Massachusetts.

      - New Salem, PA is in the southwestern part of Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Determine relative positions.

      - Since Pennsylvania is generally west of Massachusetts, and specifically, southwestern
      Pennsylvania (New Salem) is west of northeastern Massachusetts (Andover), ZIP
      code 15468 is geographically west of 01810.
