      region of the United States, while Mississippi is in the Southeastern region.


      3. **Compare the states'' positions**: Oklahoma is generally west of Mississippi,
      but we need to confirm this by looking at specific locations.


      4. **Identify specific locations**: 73142 is in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and
      39530 is in Biloxi, Mississippi.


      5. **Compare the specific locations**: Oklahoma City is located further west
      than Biloxi, which means that 73142 is indeed located west of 39530.
