      4. Looking at the specific locations:

      - New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast

      - Denton, TX is in the northern part of Texas

      - East Peoria, IL is in central Illinois

      - Looking at a map, any point in Texas is west of any point in Illinois


      4. Therefore, since 76210 (Denton, TX) is in Texas, and 61611 (East Peoria,
      IL) is in Illinois, the Texas location must be west of the Illinois location.

      1) First, let me identify these locations:

      - 98311 is in Bremerton, Washington (WA)

      - 85132 is in Florence, Arizona (AZ)


      2) Thinking about their general locations:

      - Washington state is on the Pacific coast in the northwest US

      - Arizona is in the southwest US, but inland


      3) Looking at relative positions:

      - Washington is definitely west of Arizona

      - Bremerton, WA is on the western side of Washington state

      - Florence, AZ is in central Arizona


      4) Therefore, since 98311 (Bremerton, WA) is in western Washington, and 85132
      (Florence, AZ) is in central Arizona, the Washington location must be west of
      the Arizona location.

    dfeb881d-5c4f-4124-bb51-d8a87fcc4f9b: "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1) 48069\
      \ is in Michigan (MI)\n   - Specifically, it's in Pleasant Ridge, MI\n\n2) 11218\
      \ is in New York (NY)\n   - Specifically, it's in Brooklyn, NY\n\n3) Looking\
      \ at a US map:\n   - Michigan is in the Midwest\n   - New York is on the East\
      \ Coast\n   - Michigan is clearly west of New York\n\n4) Therefore, since 48069\
      \ (MI) is in Michigan and 11218 (NY) is in New York, and Michigan is west of\
      \ New York...\n\nYES"
