    2d73ff22-26de-4b6b-8fe8-49aa96db4947: "Here's the thinking process to answer the\
      \ question:\n\n1.  **Identify the goal:** Determine if one US zip code (46016,\
      \ IN) is geographically located *west* of another US zip code (08734, NJ).\n\
      \n2.  **Recognize the key information needed:** To compare the relative west-east\
      \ positions of two locations, we need their longitudinal coordinates. Zip codes\
      \ themselves don't directly give longitude, but they correspond to specific\
      \ geographic areas.\n\n3.  **Determine the locations:**\n    *   46016 is a\
      \ zip code in Indiana (IN).\n    *   08734 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ).\n\
      \n4.  **Recall/Research the general geographical location of Indiana and New\
      \ Jersey:**\n    *   Indiana is generally considered part of the Midwest or\
      \ East North Central region.\n    *   New Jersey is located on the East Coast,\
      \ part of the Mid-Atlantic region.\n\n5.  **Relate the general locations to\
      \ longitude:**\n    *   The further west a location is in the US, the higher\
      \ its longitude value (when using negative values for West, which is standard,\
      \ e.g., -85\xB0 for Indiana, -74\xB0 for New Jersey). Alternatively, using positive\
      \ values from the Prime Meridian, the higher the degree, the further east it\
      \ is. For comparing *within* the US, we know that locations further west have\
      \ smaller degrees West longitude (e.g., 85\xB0 W is west of 74\xB0 W).\n   \
      \ *   Since Indiana is generally west of New Jersey, locations within Indiana\
      \ will generally have longitudes further west (i.e., larger absolute negative\
      \ values, or smaller positive values if measuring from the Prime Meridian eastward).\n\
      \n6.  **Consider if there are exceptions:** While Indiana is generally west\
      \ of New Jersey, could specific points within those zip codes reverse this?\
      \ It's highly unlikely given the significant distance and the general west-to-east\
      \ progression across the US. New Jersey is firmly on the Atlantic coast, while\
      \ Indiana is well inland. There's no geographical overlap or unusual shape that\
      \ would place a point in eastern Indiana east of a point in western New Jersey.\
      \ The entire state of Indiana lies west of the entire state of New Jersey.\n\
      \n7.  **Formalize the comparison (optional but confirms the intuition):** Look\
      \ up the approximate coordinates for the zip codes or the states.\n    *   Indiana's\
      \ approximate center longitude is around 86\xB0 West.\n    *   New Jersey's\
      \ approximate center longitude is around 74\xB0 West.\n    *   Since 86\xB0\
      \ W is west of 74\xB0 W, Indiana is west of New Jersey.\n\n8.  **Apply this\
      \ to the specific zip codes:** Since 46016 is in Indiana and 08734 is in New\
      \ Jersey, and Indiana is geographically west of New Jersey, a point in 46016\
      \ must be west of a point in 08734.\n\n9.  **Formulate the final answer:** The\
      \ reasoning confirms that Indiana is west of New Jersey. Therefore, a zip code\
      \ in Indiana is west of a zip code in New Jersey.\n\n10. **Provide the YES/NO\
      \ answer:** Based on the reasoning, the answer is YES.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking\
      \ summary:**\n1. Identify the zip codes and their states: 46016 (Indiana) and\
      \ 08734 (New Jersey).\n2. Determine the general geographical location of Indiana\
      \ and New Jersey within the US. Indiana is in the Midwest/East North Central;\
      \ New Jersey is on the East Coast.\n3. Recognize that location on the East Coast\
      \ (NJ) is generally east of a location further inland (IN). West-east position\
      \ is determined by longitude.\n4. Conclude that Indiana is geographically located\
      \ west of New Jersey.\n5. Apply this conclusion to the specific zip codes: A\
      \ location within Indiana must be west of a location within New Jersey.\n\n\
      **Final Answer Derivation:** Since 46016 is in Indiana and 08734 is in New Jersey,\

      3. **Visualize the relative positions of the states:** Kansas is located south
      of Minnesota in the central United States.

      4. **Consider the general north-south and east-west orientation:** Since Kansas
      is south of Minnesota, a location in Kansas is generally going to be further
      west than a location directly south of it in Minnesota, due to the curvature
      of the Earth and the general alignment of the states. However, this is a simplification.

      5. **Consider the specific locations within the states (optional but helpful
      for confirmation):** 67037 is near Clearwater, Kansas. 55404 is in Minneapolis,
      Minnesota. Looking at a map, Minneapolis is significantly further east than

      \ if something is west of something else, we need to compare their longitudes.\
      \ A location further west will have a more negative (or less positive, depending\
      \ on the scale) longitude value than a location further east.\n\n4.  **Find\
      \ the Location Information for Zip Code 49337, MI:**\n    *   Need to find the\
      \ city/town associated with 49337, MI. A quick search reveals it's primarily\

    adbf9549-44a4-4016-8a81-1e56c840d13f: 'Step 1: Identify the locations associated
      with the zip codes.

      22407 is a zip code in Virginia (VA).

      11239 is a zip code in New York (NY).


      Step 2: Determine the general geographical relationship between Virginia and
      New York.

      Virginia is located south of New York.


      Step 3: Consider whether a location in Virginia could be west of a location
      in New York, despite the general north-south relationship.

      While New York is generally north of Virginia, the states are not perfectly
      aligned vertically. The westernmost point of New York is further west than the
      easternmost point of Virginia. However, the question asks about specific zip
      codes.


      Step 4: Approximate the locations of the specific zip codes.

      22407 is located in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, near Fredericksburg. This
      area is in the eastern half of Virginia.

      11239 is located in Brooklyn, New York City. This area is in the southeastern
      part of New York State.


      Step 5: Compare the longitudinal positions of the two locations.

      Spotsylvania County, VA is located around 77.5 degrees West longitude.

      Brooklyn, NY is located around 73.9 degrees West longitude.


      Step 6: Determine which location is further west based on the longitude.

      A higher West longitude number means the location is further west.

      77.5 is greater than 73.9.


      Step 7: Conclude the relative positions.

      Since 22407, VA has a higher West longitude (77.5) than 11239, NY (73.9), 22407,
      VA is located west of 11239, NY.

      2. **Consider the states:** Oregon is geographically located north of California.
      This doesn''t directly tell us about east-west position, but it''s a starting
      point.


      3. **Consider the zip codes:** While zip codes don''t directly correspond to
      longitude, the general pattern of US zip codes is that they increase as you
      move from east to west. Lower zip codes tend to be in the eastern part of the
      US, and higher zip codes tend to be in the western part.


      4. **Compare the zip codes:** 97527 is a higher number than 91748.


      5. **Apply the zip code pattern:** Based on the general pattern, a higher zip
      code suggests a location further west than a lower zip code within the western
      part of the US.


      6. **Confirm with state locations:** Since both states are on the west coast,
      the higher zip code in Oregon is consistent with it being further west than

      \ Determine the general location associated with each zip code/state. 80237\
      \ is in Colorado, specifically the Denver area. 76114 is in Texas, specifically\
      \ the Fort Worth area.\n3. Compare the geographical position of Colorado relative\
      \ to Texas. Colorado is located significantly west of Texas.\n4. Specifically\
      \ compare Denver and Fort Worth. Denver is located at a longitude of approximately\
      \ 105\xB0 West, while Fort Worth is located at a longitude of approximately\
      \ 97\xB0 West.\n5. A location further west has a higher (more negative) longitude\
      \ value. 105 is greater than 97 (in terms of absolute value, meaning further\
      \ from the Prime Meridian), and since both are West, -105 is less than -97,\
      \ meaning it is further west.\n6. Therefore, 80237, CO (Denver) is geographically\
      \ west of 76114, TX (Fort Worth).\n\n**Final Answer is based on this conclusion.**\n\

      24486) is located west of a location in New Jersey (like 08221).


      **NO**


      Wait, let''s re-read the question carefully. "Is 24486, VA located west of 08221,
      NJ?"


      My reasoning: Virginia is generally west of New Jersey.


      Let''s verify with a map or coordinates if possible, but based on general geography:

      Virginia is southwest of New Jersey. Southwest means both south AND west.

      Therefore, Virginia is indeed west of New Jersey.


      So, 24486, VA *is* located west of 08221, NJ.


      Let''s re-evaluate my previous YES/NO. My reasoning led to Virginia being west
      of New Jersey. The question asks if 24486, VA is west of 08221, NJ. If Virginia
      is west of New Jersey, then a location in Virginia is west of a location in
      New Jersey.


      My final conclusion from the reasoning is that yes, Virginia is west of New
      Jersey. The question asks if 24486, VA is west of 08221, NJ.


      If Virginia is west of New Jersey, then 24486, VA is west of 08221, NJ.


      Let''s re-check the general positions. New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast,
      north of Delaware. Virginia is south and west of Delaware, on the Atlantic coast
      but extending much further inland to the Appalachians. Yes, Virginia is generally
      west of New Jersey.


      Therefore, 24486, VA is located west of 08221, NJ.


      My previous answer was NO, which contradicts my reasoning. Let''s correct the
      final answer based on the reasoning.


      Reasoning confirms that Virginia is west of New Jersey. Thus, 24486, VA is west
      of 08221, NJ.


      Final Answer should be YES.


      The final answer is $\boxed{Yes}$.'

      5. **Reason about the specific zip codes:** While zip codes can be small areas,
      the general location of the states provides a strong indication of the relative
      east-west position. It is highly unlikely that a location in Virginia would
      be east of a location in New Jersey, given their state-level positioning.

      \ the Zip Codes within the States:** While zip codes can represent specific\
      \ areas within a state, the states themselves have distinct geographical positions.\
      \ Missouri is significantly further west than Michigan. Even the easternmost\
      \ parts of Missouri are generally west of the westernmost parts of Michigan\

      trend, not a strict rule for *all* individual zip codes, but it gives a preliminary
      idea. 22xxx is in the eastern part of the US; 70xxx is in the southern/central
      part, further west than the east coast.

      \ question:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks if the location\
      \ represented by zip code 75025, TX is geographically west of the location represented\
      \ by zip code 55043, MN. The final answer must be YES or NO.\n\n2.  **Identify\

      \ 55043, MN\n    *   The comparison is based on relative *west* position.\n\n\
      3.  **Determine the Necessary Data:** To compare the geographical positions,\
      \ I need to know the approximate locations of these zip codes. Zip codes are\
      \ geographical areas, so I need to find the general location (like city or region)\
      \ associated with each.\n\n4.  **Find the Location for 75025, TX:** A quick\
      \ search or internal knowledge base lookup reveals that 75025 is a zip code\
      \ for Plano, Texas.\n\n5.  **Find the Location for 55043, MN:** Similarly, a\
      \ search or lookup for 55043, MN reveals it's a zip code for Lakeville, Minnesota.\n\
      \n6.  **Compare the Locations Geographically:** Now I need to compare the relative\
      \ positions of Plano, TX and Lakeville, MN.\n    *   Plano, TX is in the northern\
      \ part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex in North Texas.\n    *   Lakeville,\
      \ MN is south of Minneapolis-St. Paul in southeastern Minnesota.\n\n7.  **Visualize\
      \ or Use Geographic Knowledge:**\n    *   Imagine a map of the United States.\n\
      \    *   Locate Texas (southern US).\n    *   Locate Minnesota (northern US).\n\
      \    *   Consider the north-south and east-west positions. Texas is clearly\
      \ south of Minnesota.\n    *   Now consider the east-west position. Texas, particularly\
      \ North Texas, is generally further west than Minnesota, particularly southeastern\
      \ Minnesota, when looking at the central part of the US. Texas is in the Central\
      \ Time Zone, while Minnesota is also in the Central Time Zone, but Texas is\
      \ on the western edge of that zone relative to Minnesota. A common reference\
      \ point is the Prime Meridian (0 degrees longitude) or the US-Canada border\

      \    *   Lakeville, MN is roughly around 93.2\xB0 W longitude.\n5.  **Analyze\
      \ the comparison:** Since 96.7\xB0 W is a larger West longitude value than 93.2\xB0\

      comparing the location of zip code 32129 (Florida) and zip code 10162 (New York).

      2.  **Determine the general location within the US:** Florida is a southeastern
      state. New York is a northeastern state.

      3.  **Consider the geographical orientation:** The United States is wider east-to-west
      than it is tall north-to-south in this general area.

      4.  **Compare the longitudes:** States in the eastern part of the US have longitudes
      that are less negative (closer to 0) than states further west. Florida is generally
      located west of the main body of New York state (though Long Island and the
      very eastern tip of Florida might complicate a precise point-to-point comparison
      without exact coordinates, the *bulk* of Florida is west of the *bulk* of New
      York).

      5.  **Focus on the specific zip codes:** 32129 is in Port Orange, Florida (near
      Daytona Beach). Its approximate longitude is around -80.9 degrees. 10162 is
      in New York City (Manhattan). Its approximate longitude is around -73.9 degrees.

      6.  **Compare the longitudes:** -80.9 is a more negative number than -73.9.
      On a map, more negative longitudes are further west.

      7.  **Conclusion:** -80.9 (Florida) is West of -73.9 (New York).

      32129 is in Florida (FL). 10162 is in New York (NY).

      2.  **Determine the general geographical relationship of Florida and New York:**
      New York is located significantly to the northeast of Florida.

      3.  **Consider the concept of "west of":** A location is "west of" another if
      its longitude is further west (closer to -180 degrees or further from 0 degrees).

      4.  **Estimate or know the general longitudes:** Florida is in the southeastern
      US, with longitudes roughly between -80 and -87 degrees. New York City (where
      10162 is located) is on the east coast, with a longitude around -74 degrees.

      5.  **Compare the longitudes:** -80 to -87 degrees (Florida) are further west
      than -74 degrees (New York).

      6.  **Conclusion:** Since Florida''s longitudes are further west than New York
      City''s longitude, 32129 (FL) is located west of 10162 (NY).

      \ the question:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants to know if the\
      \ location corresponding to US zip code 97331, OR is west of the location corresponding\
      \ to US zip code 90043, CA. The answer must be a clear YES or NO. I am instructed\
      \ to think step-by-step *before* giving the final answer.\n\n2.  **Identify\
      \ the Core Task:** The task is to compare the longitudinal positions of two\
      \ locations based on their zip codes and states. \"West of\" implies comparing\
      \ longitudes. A point is west of another if its longitude is numerically smaller\
      \ (more negative, since longitudes west of the Prime Meridian are negative).\n\
      \n3.  **Information Needed:** To compare the positions, I need the approximate\
      \ geographic location (specifically, longitude) associated with each zip code.\n\
      \n4.  **Strategy to Get the Location:** I can use my internal knowledge base\
      \ or perform a simulated search for the general location of each zip code.\n\
      \    *   Zip code 97331 is in Oregon (OR).\n    *   Zip code 90043 is in California\
      \ (CA).\n\n5.  **Determine Approximate Locations:**\n    *   Where is 97331,\
      \ OR? A quick check reveals this zip code is for Corvallis, Oregon. Corvallis\
      \ is in the Willamette Valley, roughly in the central-western part of Oregon.\
      \ It's inland, but not far from the coast. Its longitude is roughly around 123\
      \ degrees West.\n    *   Where is 90043, CA? A quick check reveals this zip\
      \ code is in Los Angeles, California. Los Angeles is in Southern California,\
      \ on the coast. Its longitude is roughly around 118 degrees West.\n\n6.  **Compare\
      \ the Longitudes:**\n    *   Corvallis, OR (97331): Approx. 123 degrees West\
      \ (or -123 degrees longitude).\n    *   Los Angeles, CA (90043): Approx. 118\
      \ degrees West (or -118 degrees longitude).\n\n7.  **Apply the \"West of\" Rule:**\
      \ A location is west of another if its longitude is smaller (more negative).\n\
      \    *   Is -123 less than -118? Yes, -123 is a smaller number than -118.\n\n\
      8.  **Formulate the Conclusion:** Since the longitude of 97331 (-123\xB0) is\
      \ smaller (more negative) than the longitude of 90043 (-118\xB0), 97331 is located\
      \ west of 90043.\n\n9.  **Final Answer Format:** The request requires a clear\
      \ YES or NO answer *after* the reasoning.\n\n10. **Construct the Step-by-Step\
      \ Reasoning:** Describe the process:\n    *   Identify the zip codes and states.\n\

      \    *   Find or estimate the longitudes of these locations.\n    *   Compare\
      \ the longitudes.\n    *   State the conclusion based on the comparison and\
      \ the definition of \"west of\".\n\n11. **Provide the YES/NO Answer:** Based\
      \ on the conclusion, the answer is YES.\n\n**(Self-Correction/Refinement):**\
      \ The question asks about *locations* associated with the zip codes, not the\
      \ numerical values of the zip codes themselves. My focus on the geographic coordinates\
      \ (specifically longitude) is correct. The precision of the longitude doesn't\
      \ need to be exact to the decimal; a general understanding of the cities' relative\
      \ positions is sufficient for this comparison, as they are quite far apart longitudinally.\n\
      \nOkay, planning complete. I will now generate the response following these\
      \ steps.Okay, let's break this down:\n\n1.  **Identify the locations:** We are\
      \ comparing the location associated with zip code 97331, OR, and the location\
      \ associated with zip code 90043, CA.\n2.  **Determine the general area for\
      \ each zip code:**\n    *   97331 is in Corvallis, Oregon. Corvallis is located\
      \ in the Willamette Valley, roughly in the western part of Oregon, inland from\
      \ the coast.\n    *   90043 is in Los Angeles, California. Los Angeles is located\
      \ in Southern California, on the Pacific coast.\n3.  **Compare their positions\
      \ geographically:** Oregon state is located north of California state. However,\
      \ \"west of\" refers to longitudinal position. Corvallis, OR is located further\
      \ west (closer to the Pacific coast relative to the central part of the continent)\
      \ than Los Angeles, CA, when comparing their longitudes.\n4.  **Confirm with\
      \ approximate longitudes:**\n    *   Corvallis, OR (97331) is roughly around\
      \ 123\xB0 West longitude.\n    *   Los Angeles, CA (90043) is roughly around\
      \ 118\xB0 West longitude.\n5.  **Apply the rule:** Locations with a numerically\
      \ smaller (more negative) longitude are further west. -123 is smaller than -118.\n\
      \nTherefore, the location of 97331, OR is west of the location of 90043, CA.\n\

      \ the data needed:** To determine relative geographic location (east/west),\
      \ we need the approximate longitude of the locations represented by these zip\
      \ codes. Latitude tells us north/south, but longitude tells us east/west.\n\n\
      3.  **Find the locations:**\n    *   15139 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA).\

      if 30346, GA is located west of 10918, NY:


      1.  **Understand the question:** The question asks about the *relative* East-West
      location of two specific US zip codes.

      2.  **Identify the key information:** We have two zip codes: 30346 (associated
      with Georgia) and 10918 (associated with New York).

      3.  **Determine the general location of each state:** Georgia (GA) is a state
      in the southeastern United States. New York (NY) is a state in the northeastern
      United States.

      4.  **Consider the general geographical relationship between the states:** Based
      on their positions within the US, Georgia is generally located *south* and *west*
      of New York.

      5.  **Refine the location based on zip codes (optional but helpful):** While
      not strictly necessary for this high-level comparison, knowing that 30346 is
      in a suburban area of Atlanta, GA, and 10918 is in a suburban area north of
      New York City, NY, reinforces the general state-level relationship.

      6.  **Compare their longitudinal positions:** Since we are comparing East-West
      location, the key is longitude. States in the eastern US have higher (more Westerly)
      longitudes than states further east. Georgia is further west than New York.

      7.  **Formulate the comparison:** If Georgia is generally west of New York,
      then a location within Georgia (like 30346) will be west of a location within
      New York (like 10918).


      Therefore, 30346, GA is located west of 10918, NY.


      The answer is clearly YES.

      \ the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The question asks if a\
      \ specific Georgia zip code (30346) is located *west* of a specific New York\
      \ zip code (10918).\n\n2.  **Understand the key concept:** \"West of\" implies\
      \ a comparison of longitude. Locations further west have lower (more negative)\
      \ longitudinal values (or higher values in the Western Hemisphere, which is\
      \ where both GA and NY are, but the comparison is relative).\n\n3.  **Determine\
      \ the locations:**\n    *   30346 is in Georgia (GA).\n    *   10918 is in New\
      \ York (NY).\n\n4.  **Determine the relative geographical positions of Georgia\
      \ and New York:**\n    *   Georgia is in the southeastern United States.\n \
      \   *   New York is in the northeastern United States.\n\n5.  **Compare the\
      \ relative longitudes:**\n    *   Looking at a map of the US, Georgia is clearly\
      \ situated *west* of New York. While New York stretches west to the Great Lakes,\
      \ its main population centers (including the area where 10918 likely is, near\
      \ NYC or the Hudson Valley) are significantly further east than Georgia. Even\
      \ the westernmost parts of NY are roughly aligned latitudinally with the *eastern*\
      \ parts of Georgia, or slightly west, but the core of Georgia is much further\
      \ west than the core of NY.\n\n6.  **Confirm with specific zip code locations\
      \ (optional but good for verification):**\n    *   30346 is in the Atlanta,\
      \ GA area. Atlanta's approximate longitude is around 84.4\xB0 W.\n    *   10918\
      \ is in Cochecton, NY, near the Pennsylvania border, west of the Hudson River.\
      \ Cochecton's approximate longitude is around 75.0\xB0 W.\n\n7.  **Compare the\
      \ longitudes:** 84.4\xB0 W is a larger number (further west in the Western Hemisphere\
      \ system) than 75.0\xB0 W.\n\n8.  **Formulate the conclusion:** Since the longitude\
      \ of 30346 (Atlanta, GA area) is significantly further west than the longitude\
      \ of 10918 (Cochecton, NY), 30346 is located west of 10918.\n\n9.  **Final Answer\
      \ Format:** The question requires a simple YES or NO.\n\n*   Step 1: Identify\
      \ the locations: 30346 (Georgia) and 10918 (New York).\n*   Step 2: Understand\
      \ the comparison: \"West of\" requires comparing longitude.\n*   Step 3: Determine\
      \ the general geographic relationship: Georgia is generally west of New York\
      \ on a US map.\n*   Step 4: (Optional but confirms) Compare approximate longitudes:\
      \ Atlanta (GA) is around 84\xB0W, Cochecton (NY) is around 75\xB0W.\n*   Step\
      \ 5: Conclude: 84\xB0W is further west than 75\xB0W. Therefore, 30346 is west\

      \ New Jersey.\n\n4.  **Refine the Knowledge (Consider Zip Codes Specifically):**\
      \ While general state locations are helpful, the question is about specific\
      \ zip codes. However, zip codes are geographically contiguous within a state.\
      \ The specific zip code within Michigan (48085) will be somewhere within Michigan.\
      \ The specific zip code within New Jersey (08750) will be somewhere within New\
      \ Jersey. The *entirety* of Michigan is geographically west of the *entirety*\
      \ of New Jersey. Therefore, any point within Michigan will be west of any point\
      \ within New Jersey.\n\n5.  **Visualize or Confirm:**\n    *   Mentally picture\
      \ a map of the US. Locate where Michigan is (north-central US, surrounded by\
      \ the Great Lakes). Locate where New Jersey is (East Coast, south of New York).\n\
      \    *   Alternatively, if access to a map or geographic data were necessary\
      \ (which it isn't for this general case), I could look up the approximate locations\
      \ of these zip codes or states by latitude and longitude. Michigan's longitude\
      \ would be much further west (more negative, or closer to -90 degrees) than\
      \ New Jersey's longitude (closer to -74 degrees).\n\n6.  **Apply the \"West\
      \ Of\" Concept:** \"West of\" means having a lower longitude value (more negative)\
      \ than the reference point. Since Michigan is geographically west of New Jersey,\
      \ any specific location within Michigan will have a lower longitude than any\
      \ specific location within New Jersey.\n\n7.  **Formulate the Answer:**\n  \
      \  *   Start with the locations: 48085 is in Michigan (MI), 08750 is in New\
      \ Jersey (NJ).\n    *   Compare the states' relative positions: Michigan is\
      \ located geographically west of New Jersey.\n    *   Extend this to the specific\
      \ zip codes: Because Michigan is west of New Jersey, any point in Michigan (like\
      \ the area covered by 48085) will be west of any point in New Jersey (like the\
      \ area covered by 08750).\n    *   Therefore, 48085, MI is located west of 08750,\
      \ NJ.\n\n8.  **Determine the YES/NO:** The conclusion is \"yes, it is west.\"\
      \n\n9.  **Final Answer Structure:** State the step-by-step reasoning first,\
      \ then give the final YES/NO answer clearly.\n\n*Step 1: Identify the states.*\
      \ Zip code 48085 is in Michigan (MI). Zip code 08750 is in New Jersey (NJ).\n\
      *Step 2: Recall or determine the relative geographic positions of the two states.*\
      \ Michigan is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, while New Jersey is\
      \ located on the East Coast of the United States.\n*Step 3: Compare the longitudes.*\
      \ Geographically, the entire state of Michigan lies significantly further west\
      \ than the entire state of New Jersey. Locations in Michigan have more westerly\
      \ longitudes (closer to -90 degrees) compared to locations in New Jersey (closer\
      \ to -74 degrees).\n*Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.* Since the\
      \ areas covered by these zip codes are within their respective states, any point\
      \ within the 48085 zip code area in Michigan will be geographically west of\
      \ any point within the 08750 zip code area in New Jersey.\n\nYES"

    e46e9117-630a-463a-99a7-20c8d7a0712f: '1.  **Identify the locations:** The question
      asks about the relative location of 58501, ND and 77362, TX.

      2.  **Determine the states:** 58501 is in North Dakota (ND). 77362 is in Texas
      (TX).

      3.  **Visualize/Recall geography:** Think about the relative positions of North
      Dakota and Texas on a map of the United States. North Dakota is in the northern
      part of the central US, and Texas is in the southern part of the central US.

      4.  **Consider East/West:** Since North Dakota is generally north of Texas,
      we need to consider their East-West positions. North Dakota is further *west*
      than the *eastern* part of Texas, but it''s not necessarily west of *all* of
      Texas. However, the question specifically asks about *58501* (Bismarck, ND area)
      and *77362* (Porter, TX area). Both locations are relatively central within
      their respective states East-West.

      5.  **Compare longitudes (conceptual or approximate):** North Dakota is significantly
      further *north* than Texas. While both states span a range of longitudes, North
      Dakota''s western edge extends further west than the western edge of Texas,
      and its eastern edge is roughly aligned with or slightly west of the central
      part of Texas. The Bismarck area (58501) is in central North Dakota. The Porter
      area (77362) is in eastern Texas.

      6.  **Conclusion based on relative location:** North Dakota, as a state, lies
      generally to the northwest of Texas. The specific locations, Bismarck area (central
      ND) and Porter area (eastern TX), confirm this. Bismarck is further west than
      Porter.


      **Answer:** YES'
    ff1c0219-940b-4e7c-ac20-76eb0c6254ff: '1.  **Identify the locations:** We need
      to compare the locations of 58501 (Bismarck, North Dakota) and 77362 (Spring,
      Texas).

      2.  **Determine relative east/west positions:** To know if ND is west of TX,
      we need to understand the general geographical relationship between North Dakota
      and Texas. North Dakota is in the upper Midwest, while Texas is in the South-Central
      US.

      3.  **Visualize or recall US geography:** North Dakota is significantly further
      north than Texas. More importantly, North Dakota is generally located to the
      *north-west* of Texas. Texas is located to the *south-east* of North Dakota.

      4.  **Compare longitudes (implicit):** While we don''t need the exact longitudes,
      the general east/west position is the key. North Dakota lies further west than
      most of the populated areas of Texas. The 100th meridian runs roughly through
      the middle of both states, but North Dakota extends further west relative to
      Texas. Specifically, Bismarck (58501) is around 100.7 degrees West longitude,
      while Spring (77362) is around 95.3 degrees West longitude. A higher West longitude
      means a location is further west.

      5.  **Formulate the comparison:** Is Bismarck, ND (approx. 100.7 W) located
      west of Spring, TX (approx. 95.3 W)? Yes, 100.7 is a higher West longitude than
      95.3.

      \ if 64701, MO is west of 40175, KY:\n\n1.  **Identify the locations:** We are\
      \ comparing two locations based on their zip codes: 64701, MO and 40175, KY.\n\
      2.  **Determine the states:** The states are Missouri (MO) and Kentucky (KY).\n\
      3.  **Consider the relative geographical positions of the states:** Missouri\
      \ is located generally west of Kentucky in the United States.\n4.  **Consider\
      \ the specific zip codes within the states:** While the general position of\
      \ the states is a strong indicator, we should briefly consider if the specific\
      \ zip codes put them in unusual positions within their states. 64701 is the\
      \ zip code for Clinton, MO, which is in the western half of Missouri. 40175\
      \ is a zip code in Shepherdsville, KY, which is in the central part of Kentucky.\n\
      5.  **Compare the longitudes:** To be definitively west, a location must have\
      \ a smaller longitude value (closer to the Prime Meridian, which is 0 degrees\
      \ longitude, or a larger negative longitude value if using negative numbers\
      \ for the Western Hemisphere). Missouri is located at a longitude roughly between\
      \ 89\xB0 and 95\xB0 West. Kentucky is located at a longitude roughly between\
      \ 82\xB0 and 89\xB0 West.\n6.  **Conclude the relative position:** Since Missouri's\
      \ longitudes are generally further west (larger negative numbers or larger positive\
      \ numbers if measuring from the Prime Meridian westward) than Kentucky's longitudes,\
      \ a location in Missouri is likely west of a location in Kentucky. Specifically,\
      \ Clinton, MO (64701) is around 93.7\xB0 West longitude, while Shepherdsville,\
      \ KY (40175) is around 85.7\xB0 West longitude. 93.7\xB0 West is further west\
      \ than 85.7\xB0 West.\n\nTherefore, 64701, MO is located west of 40175, KY.\n\

      \ specifically the Goshen area.\n2.  To determine if one location is west of\
      \ another, compare their longitudes.\n3.  Look up the approximate longitude\
      \ for each location. 33990, FL is located around 82\xB0 West longitude. 10927,\
      \ NY is located around 74\xB0 West longitude.\n4.  On a map, locations with\
      \ a higher degree of West longitude are geographically further west.\n5.  Comparing\
      \ the longitudes, 82\xB0 West is a higher number than 74\xB0 West.\n6.  Therefore,\
      \ the location at 82\xB0 West (33990, FL) is west of the location at 74\xB0\
      \ West (10927, NY).\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:** The reasoning concludes\
      \ that 33990, FL is west of 10927, NY. The question asks for a YES/NO answer\

    376c9c40-2c48-4ee7-8260-a638910e7338: 'Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the locations:** We are comparing 36107, AL and 44030, OH.

      2.  **Determine the general geographic relationship of the states:** Alabama
      (AL) is in the Southeastern US. Ohio (OH) is in the Midwestern US.

      3.  **Consider the typical east-west position of the states:** In general, states
      in the Southeast are further west than states in the Midwest when looking at
      the center of the country. Alabama is west of Ohio.

      4.  **Confirm the state locations:** Alabama''s longitude is generally around
      -85 to -88 degrees. Ohio''s longitude is generally around -80 to -84 degrees.
      Longitudes become more negative as you move west.

      5.  **Compare the longitudes:** Since -85 to -88 (Alabama) are more negative
      than -80 to -84 (Ohio), Alabama is further west than Ohio.

      6.  **Relate the zip codes to their states:** Zip code 36107 is in Alabama.
      Zip code 44030 is in Ohio.

      7.  **Conclusion:** Since Alabama is located west of Ohio, any location within
      Alabama (like 36107) will be located west of any location within Ohio (like
      44030), assuming we''re talking about the general geographic position of the

      - 32095 is in Florida (FL).

      - 03079 is in New Hampshire (NH).


      Step 2: Determine the general geographical location of Florida within the United
      States. Florida is a southeastern state.


      Step 3: Determine the general geographical location of New Hampshire within
      the United States. New Hampshire is a northeastern state.


      Step 4: Compare the relative east-west positions of the southeastern and northeastern
      regions of the United States. The southeastern region is generally located to
      the west of the northeastern region.


      Step 5: Specifically consider the longitudes of Florida and New Hampshire. Florida''s
      longitude is roughly between 80 and 87 degrees West. New Hampshire''s longitude
      is roughly between 70 and 72 degrees West. A higher West longitude indicates
      a location further west.


      Step 6: Compare the longitude ranges. All of Florida''s longitude range (80-87
      West) is further west than all of New Hampshire''s longitude range (70-72 West).


      Step 7: Conclude whether 32095, FL is located west of 03079, NH based on their

      2.  **Determine the primary location attribute for comparison:** Zip codes themselves
      don''t directly give longitude/latitude. However, the state abbreviations (TX

      US. Virginia (VA) is in the Mid-Atlantic/southeastern US.

      3.  **Consider the overall east/west arrangement:** Generally, states along
      the Atlantic coast (like Virginia) are further east than states further inland
      (like Georgia). While there are variations within states, the overall trend
      is that Virginia is east of Georgia.

      4.  **Visualize or mentally map the locations:** Virginia is located north and
      east of Georgia.

      5.  **Determine relative longitude:** Since Virginia is generally east of Georgia,
      any location in Georgia is likely west of any location in Virginia, especially
      considering their relative positions on a US map.

      6.  **Formulate the comparison:** The question asks if 31210, GA is west of

      28457 is Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina.


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographical positions of Virginia and North
      Carolina.

      Virginia is located north of North Carolina.


      Step 3: Determine the relative geographical positions of Ivanhoe, VA and Ocean
      Isle Beach, NC.

      Ocean Isle Beach, NC is on the Atlantic coast.

      Ivanhoe, VA is in southwestern Virginia, far from the coast and closer to the
      Appalachian Mountains.


      Step 4: Compare the longitudes of the two locations. While knowing the exact
      longitudes isn''t strictly necessary with general geographical knowledge, it
      confirms the relative east-west positions. Ivanhoe, VA is approximately at longitude
      -80.9 degrees. Ocean Isle Beach, NC is approximately at longitude -78.5 degrees.
      A smaller negative longitude value means a location is further east.


      Step 5: Based on the geographical positions and longitudes, determine if Ivanhoe,
      VA (24354) is west of Ocean Isle Beach, NC (28457). Ivanhoe is significantly

      3.  **Consider the geographical relationship between the states:** Texas is
      geographically west of Florida.

      4.  **Consider if specific zip codes could contradict the general state relationship:**
      While it''s *possible* for a very eastern point in Texas to be slightly east
      of a very western point in Florida (though unlikely given their locations),
      the vast majority of Texas is significantly west of Florida. Zip codes generally
      represent areas within a state.

      5.  **Form a conclusion based on the states'' relative positions:** Given that
      Texas is west of Florida, a zip code in Texas is highly likely to be west of
      a zip code in Florida. There is no common geographical quirk that would make
      a specific point in Texas east of a specific point in Florida.

      2.  **Identify the Key Information Needed:** To determine relative east-west\
      \ location, I need to compare the longitudes of the two locations represented\
      \ by these zip codes.\n\n3.  **Recall/Determine the Locations:**\n    *   48069\
      \ is in Michigan (MI).\n    *   11218 is in New York (NY).\n\n4.  **Recall/Determine\
      \ Relative Positions of States:** Michigan is generally located west of New\
      \ York.\n\n5.  **Consider the Specific Zip Codes:** While the states have a\
      \ general relative position, specific zip codes could potentially be in the\
      \ easternmost part of one state or the westernmost part of the other, potentially\
      \ altering the general state-level comparison. Therefore, I need a more precise\
      \ way to compare their locations, which means finding their approximate longitudes.\n\
      \n6.  **Find Approximate Longitudes:**\n    *   I need to look up the approximate\
      \ geographic location (specifically, the longitude) for each zip code.\n   \
      \ *   Searching for \"longitude of 48069 MI\" yields results indicating it's\
      \ around -82.9\xB0 to -83.0\xB0 West longitude.\n    *   Searching for \"longitude\
      \ of 11218 NY\" yields results indicating it's around -73.9\xB0 to -74.0\xB0\
      \ West longitude.\n\n7.  **Compare the Longitudes:**\n    *   Longitude of 48069\
      \ (MI) is approximately -82.9\xB0 W.\n    *   Longitude of 11218 (NY) is approximately\
      \ -73.9\xB0 W.\n\n8.  **Interpret the Comparison:**\n    *   On a standard map\
      \ or coordinate system, locations further *west* have *more negative* (or larger\
      \ absolute value negative) longitudes in the Western Hemisphere.\n    *   -82.9\xB0\

      \ 48069, MI is geographically west of the location represented by 11218, NY.\n\
      \n10. **Final Answer Format:** The question requires a simple YES or NO. Based\
      \ on the conclusion in step 9, the answer is YES.\n\n**Self-Correction/Refinement:**\
      \ The initial thought about the states' general positions was a good starting\
      \ point, but recognizing the need for specific zip code locations (longitudes)\
      \ was crucial for an accurate answer. Comparing the negative values of the longitudes\

      comparing 48069, MI and 11218, NY.

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** Michigan (MI) is in the
      Midwest/Great Lakes region. New York (NY) is on the East Coast.

      3.  **Determine the general direction relationship between the states:** The
      East Coast is generally east of the Midwest.

      4.  **Consider edge cases/exceptions:** While states have varying shapes, the
      vast majority of Michigan is west of the vast majority of New York. Peninsulas
      or extreme corners of states are unlikely to reverse this overall relationship.
      Zip codes generally correspond to geographic areas within a state.

      5.  **Conclusion based on relative state locations:** Since Michigan is overwhelmingly
      located west of New York, a location within Michigan (48069) is almost certainly
      west of a location within New York (11218).
