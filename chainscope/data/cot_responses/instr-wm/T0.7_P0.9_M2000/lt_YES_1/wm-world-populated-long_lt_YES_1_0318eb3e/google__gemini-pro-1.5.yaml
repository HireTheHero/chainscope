      the Jersey Shore, generally south of New York City.


      3. **Relative positions:**  Cornwall, being north of NYC and Little Silver being
      south of NYC means Cornwall is broadly north of Little Silver. Locations directly
      north of a point are not west of that point.


      4. **West implies a longitudinal difference:** For Cornwall to be west of Little
      Silver, it would need to be significantly further west longitudinally.  While
      the Hudson Valley *is* west of the Jersey Shore, the north/south difference
      between these towns is much more significant than any east/west difference.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.

      in this area.  While there are some bays and inlets, the overall direction doesn''t
      dramatically change enough to make a northern suburb like Berowra Heights be
      west of a southern suburb like Sans Souci.

    ce216c89-0968-4bf7-be9c-7db8a55116c3: '1. **General Location Knowledge:** San
      Benito County is in the central coast region of California, generally south
      of the San Francisco Bay Area. Grass Valley is in the Sierra Nevada foothills,
      generally northeast of Sacramento.


      2. **West vs. East:**  Thinking about the general locations, San Benito County
      is significantly *south* of Grass Valley, but also somewhat to the *west*.


      3. **Relative Position:**  Visualizing a map of California, San Benito County
      lies distinctly west of Grass Valley.

      Benito County is in Central California, generally south and slightly east of
      the San Francisco Bay Area. Grass Valley is in the Sierra Nevada foothills,
      generally northeast of Sacramento.


      2. **Relative Positions:**  Thinking about the map of California, the Sierra
      Nevada mountain range (where Grass Valley is) runs roughly North-South.  Anything
      significantly west of the Sierras would be closer to the coast. San Benito County
      is closer to the coast than Grass Valley.


      3. **Westward Direction:** San Benito County lies significantly west of the
      Sierra Nevada and therefore west of Grass Valley.
