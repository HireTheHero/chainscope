      1) First, let me mentally locate these places:

      - Cornwall, NY is in the Hudson Valley region of New York State

      - Little Silver, NJ is near the New Jersey coast, close to Red Bank


      2) To determine which is further west:

      - Cornwall, NY is along the Hudson River

      - Little Silver, NJ is along the Atlantic coast


      3) Since the Hudson River runs north-south and is inland from the Atlantic coast,
      and New Jersey''s coast runs north-south:

      - Places along the Hudson River are generally west of places on the NJ coast


      4) Therefore, Cornwall, NY (being on the Hudson) must be west of Little Silver,
      NJ (being on the NJ coast)

      Since Booysens is northwest of Mnquma Local Municipality, it cannot be west
      of it.


      Answer: NO'
    dbe5acc9-69a6-4ec4-bf1b-051f49e897cf: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let me identify the locations:

      - Booysens is in Pretoria, which is in Gauteng Province, South Africa

      - Mnquma Local Municipality is in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa


      2) Looking at their relative positions:

      - Pretoria (including Booysens) is in the northeastern part of South Africa

      - The Eastern Cape Province (where Mnquma is) is in the southeastern part of
      South Africa


      3) When comparing their positions:

      - Booysens, Pretoria is actually EAST of Mnquma Local Municipality


      Therefore: NO, Booysens, Pretoria is not located west of Mnquma Local Municipality.'

      1. Mati is located in Greece, specifically on the eastern coast of mainland
      Greece near Athens.


      2. Belovo is located in Bulgaria, in the western part of the country.


      3. When comparing locations in Greece and Bulgaria:

      - Bulgaria is generally east of Greece

      - Greece is generally west of Bulgaria


      4. Since Mati is on the eastern coast of Greece, and Belovo is in western Bulgaria,
      the distance between them is smaller than between central parts of both countries,
      but the basic east-west relationship remains the same.


      5. Looking at a map, Mati is still clearly west of Belovo, as any point in mainland
      Greece is west of any point in Bulgaria.


      Answer: YES (Mati, Greece is located west of Belovo, Bulgaria)'

      1. First, I need to locate both places:

      - Richmond is in Queensland (QLD), Australia

      - Boundary Bend is in Victoria (VIC), Australia


      2. Consider their relative positions:

      - Queensland is in the northeastern part of Australia

      - Victoria is in the southeastern part of Australia


      3. When looking at two points where one is in QLD and one is in VIC:

      - The QLD location will always be north of the VIC location

      - The QLD location will typically be east of the VIC location, since QLD is
      on the east coast


      4. Richmond, QLD is in northwestern Queensland

      - However, even western QLD locations are generally still east of Victorian
      locations due to Queensland''s position on the east coast


      5. Boundary Bend is in northwestern Victoria

      - Being in Victoria puts it significantly west of the main QLD coastal region


      6. Comparing their longitudes:

      - Richmond, QLD is closer to the east coast

      - Boundary Bend, VIC is closer to the South Australian border


      Therefore: NO, Richmond, Queensland is not west of Boundary Bend, Victoria.
      It is east of it.

      1) First, I need to identify these locations:

      - Prestine is a village in Lombardy, Italy

      - Carthage (municipality) is in Tunisia, North Africa


      2) Looking at their relative positions:

      - Prestine is in northern Italy

      - Carthage is on the Mediterranean coast of Tunisia


      3) Comparing their positions on a west-east axis:

      - Italy is located to the east of Tunisia

      - Therefore, Prestine is east of Carthage


      4) Since Prestine is EAST of Carthage, it cannot be west of it.
