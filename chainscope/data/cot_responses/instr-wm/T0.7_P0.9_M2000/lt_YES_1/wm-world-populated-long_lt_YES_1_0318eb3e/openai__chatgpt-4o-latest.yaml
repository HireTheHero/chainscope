      4. To determine direction, note that Iran is much farther east compared to Madagascar.

      5. Since Rudbar (Iran) is geographically east of Toamasina (Madagascar), it
      is incorrect to say Rudbar is west of Toamasina.

      3. To determine the relative positions, note that the Mid North region is generally
      north of Adelaide, while the Fleurieu Peninsula is south of Adelaide.

      4. Since Laura is north of Adelaide and Carrickalinga is south of Adelaide,
      Laura is also further inland compared to Carrickalinga.

      5. Looking at the general longitudinal positioning, Laura is indeed further
      east than Carrickalinga.


      Thus, the answer is: **NO**.'
