      2. **Location of Barajamda**: Barajamda is a village in the Gumla district of

      3. **Comparing Locations**: Since Bhaktapur District is in Nepal and Barajamda
      is in India, they are in different countries. Nepal and India are separated
      by international borders, which are typically drawn to separate countries and
      are not simply a matter of north-south or east-west orientation within a country.


      4. **Geographical Orientation**: Given the geographical layout, Nepal is generally
      to the north of India, with the Himalayan Mountains forming the boundary between
      the two countries. The Kathmandu Valley, where Bhaktapur District is located,
      is in the central part of Nepal.

      the geographical layout, Bhaktapur District (in Nepal) cannot be west of Barajamda

      1. **Identify the locations**: Sankarapuram and Pullambadi are two places I
      need to locate on a map.

      2. **Determine their geographical positions**: After finding their locations,
      I need to figure out which one is located west of the other.

      district, and Pullambadi is located in the Salem district. Both districts are

      America.


      However, considering the question specifically asks about Hopkinton, New Hampshire,
      a town in the eastern United States, I must determine if El Quisco is west of
      Hopkinton, New Hampshire.


      Since El Quisco is in Chile, and Chile is west of the United States, and Hopkinton,
      New Hampshire is in the eastern United States, El Quisco is indeed west of Hopkinton,
      New Hampshire.

      step.


      1. **Location of Billesley, West Midlands**: Billesley is a village in the West
      Midlands county of England, UK. It is situated in the administrative county
      of Worcestershire.

      4. **Administrative Boundaries**: The boundary between Worcestershire and Warwickshire
      generally runs north to south, with Worcestershire being to the west of Warwickshire
      in this context. However, the specific locations of Billesley and Bidford-on-Avon

      challenging to determine the exact relationship between their geographical positions.
      However, considering general maps and the administrative divisions, it seems
      that Billesley, being in the north of Worcestershire and Bidford-on-Avon in
      the south of Warwickshire, Billesley would indeed be west of Bidford-on-Avon

      step.


      To answer this question, we need to know the geographical locations of Nalwa
      and Barwala, Hisar.


      1. Barwala is a town in Hisar district of Haryana, India.

      2. Hisar is a district in Haryana, India.

      3. Haryana is a state in northern India.

      4. India is a country in South Asia.

      5. Nalwa is a village in the Hisar district of Haryana, India.


      Now, considering the geographical locations of Nalwa and Barwala, Hisar:


      * Nalwa is in the Hisar district.

      * Barwala is also in the Hisar district.


      Since both Nalwa and Barwala are located in the same district (Hisar), we need
      to consider the geographical layout of the district.


      Unfortunately, I couldn''t find specific information about the relative locations
      of Nalwa and Barwala within the Hisar district. However, since they are in the
      same district, it''s likely that one is north or south of the other, but without
      more specific information, we can''t determine which one is west of the other.


      However, considering that Hisar district is generally located in the northwestern
      part of Haryana, and Nalwa and Barwala are in the same district, it''s possible
      that Nalwa might be located west of Barwala. But, this is an assumption based
      on the general geographical location of Hisar district.


      Therefore, based on my analysis and the available information, I would say:


      **NO**

      without more specific information about the relative locations of Nalwa and
      Barwala within the Hisar district.'

      to know their general geographical locations.


      2. **Identifying the locations**: Nalwa and Barwala, Hisar are both in the state
      of Haryana, India. This is a crucial piece of information to narrow down the
      possibilities.


      3. **Determining the direction**: Given that Nalwa and Barwala, Hisar are in
      Haryana, and assuming both are within the state, the direction (west or east)
      of one relative to the other would depend on their specific locations within
      Haryana.


      4. **Considering the naming conventions and geographical layout**: In Haryana,
      places are often named based on their geographical features or the local dialects.
      The naming conventions might give a hint about the location, but without precise
      coordinates or a map, it''s challenging to determine the exact relationship

      of islands in the Mediterranean Sea.


      Anghiari is a town in Tuscany, Italy, located in the province of Arezzo.


      Now, let''s consider the geography of Italy: Sicily is an island located off
      the southern coast of Italy, while Tuscany is a region on the central Italian
      mainland. Since Sicily is an island, it is located south of the Italian mainland.


      Therefore, Marettimo (Sicily) is south of Anghiari (Tuscany), which means Marettimo

      1. First, I need to identify the locations of both Laura and Carrickalinga.
      Laura is a town in the Flinders Ranges region of South Australia, while Carrickalinga
      is a locality in the Fleurieu Peninsula, also in South Australia.

      2. Next, I need to determine the general geographic orientation of the two locations.
      The Flinders Ranges are located in the north-east of South Australia, while
      the Fleurieu Peninsula is located in the south of the state, near the coast.

      3. Since the Fleurieu Peninsula is south of the Flinders Ranges, and Laura is
      located in the Flinders Ranges, I can infer that Laura is generally north of
      the Fleurieu Peninsula.

      4. Since Carrickalinga is located on the Fleurieu Peninsula, which is south
      of Laura, I can conclude that Laura is west of Carrickalinga.
