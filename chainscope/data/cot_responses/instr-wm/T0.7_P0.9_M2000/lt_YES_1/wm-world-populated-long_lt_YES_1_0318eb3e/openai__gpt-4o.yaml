      - Budgam is located in Jammu and Kashmir, which is to the north of Haryana where
      Mandi Dabwali is situated.

      - In terms of the east-west direction, Jammu and Kashmir, including Budgam,
      is generally positioned to the west of most places in Haryana.


      Therefore, yes, Budgam is located to the west of Mandi Dabwali.

      To compare their longitudinal positions:


      - The approximate longitude of Budgam is around 74.5 degrees East.

      - The approximate longitude of Mandi Dabwali is around 74.7 degrees East.


      Since Budgam is at approximately 74.5 degrees East and Mandi Dabwali is at approximately

    d3e4e0d2-07ea-4e0f-bc2e-517054e768b5: 'To determine whether Berowra Heights is
      located west of Sans Souci, we need to consider their geographical locations
      in New South Wales, Australia.


      1. **Locate Berowra Heights**: Berowra Heights is a suburb located to the north
      of Sydney, New South Wales. It is part of the Upper North Shore area.


      2. **Locate Sans Souci**: Sans Souci is a suburb located to the south of Sydney,
      near Botany Bay.


      3. **Compare the longitudinal positions**: Since Berowra Heights is north of
      Sydney and Sans Souci is south, we need to compare their positions relative
      to each other in terms of east-west direction.


      4. **Geographical orientation**: Given that Sydney is positioned such that its
      northern suburbs (like Berowra Heights) are generally located to the west of
      its southern suburbs (like Sans Souci), Berowra Heights would be to the west
      of Sans Souci.


      Based on these steps, the answer is YES, Berowra Heights is located west of
      Sans Souci.'
