    4c345cab-5b63-4b24-9c1b-3972c2d5a948: 'To answer whether Sarmada is located west
      of Loiyangalani, we need to follow several steps to understand the geographical
      relationship between the two locations.


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify where Sarmada and
      Loiyangalani are. Sarmada is a town in Syria, while Loiyangalani is a town in
      Kenya.


      2. **Understand the geographical direction**: West refers to the direction of
      the setting sun, or in a more precise geographical context, it means a location
      is situated to the left when facing north.


      3. **Compare locations**: Without specific geographical coordinates or a detailed
      map, determining the exact orientation of one place relative to another can
      be challenging. However, knowing that both are in different countries helps
      narrow it down.


      4. **Research or recall specific locations**: Sarmada is located in the Idlib
      Governorate of Syria, which is in the northwest of the country. Loiyangalani
      is situated in the Marsabit County of Kenya, which is in the northern part of
      the country.


      5. **Determine the relative positions**: Considering the positions, Sarmada
      in Syria is more to the west compared to Loiyangalani in Kenya. This means that
      Sarmada would likely be west of Loiyangalani, not the other way around.


      Given these steps, the answer to whether Sarmada is located west of Loiyangalani
      is **YES**'

    98c54235-179e-45c9-9039-b67b4c6821ca: 'To determine whether Burslem is located
      west of Levenshulme, we need to understand the geographical relationship between
      the two locations. Here''s a step-by-step breakdown:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to know where Burslem and Levenshulme
      are. Burslem is a town in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England. Levenshulme
      is a suburb of Manchester, Greater Manchester, England.


      2. **Understand Geographic Directions**: West refers to the direction towards
      the setting sun, or in a more precise geographical context, it means a location
      is situated to the left when facing north.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Without specific geographical coordinates or a detailed
      map, determining the exact orientation of one place relative to another can
      be challenging. However, knowing that both are in England helps narrow it down.


      4. **Research or recall specific locations in England**: Burslem is known to
      be in Staffordshire, which is in the West Midlands region of England. Levenshulme
      is a suburb of Manchester, which is in the northwestern part of England, specifically
      in the Greater Manchester area.


      5. **Determine the relative positions**: Generally, the West Midlands region,
      where Burslem is located, is situated more to the west compared to the Greater
      Manchester area, where Levenshulme is located.


      Given these steps, the answer to whether Burslem is located west of Levenshulme
      is **YES**'

      is located west of Barajamda, let''s break down the steps of reasoning:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know where Bhaktapur District
      and Barajamda are. Bhaktapur District is in Nepal, and Barajamda is in India.


      2. **Understand the general geography**: Nepal and India share a long border,
      with Nepal lying to the north of India. This means that any location in Nepal
      would generally be north of any location in India.


      3. **Consider specific locations**: Without precise coordinates or a detailed
      map, determining the exact orientation of one place relative to another can
      be challenging. However, knowing that Bhaktapur District is in Nepal and Barajamda
      is in India, we can make some inferences.


      4. **Determine the relative positions**: Since Nepal is north of India, it''s
      unlikely that any district in Nepal would be west of a location in India. Instead,
      it''s more likely that Bhaktapur District would be north or northeast of Barajamda.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the general geography and the positions of Nepal and
      India, it''s highly probable that Bhaktapur District is not located west of
      Barajamda.

      of Horndean, let''s break down the reasoning into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know where Skipwith and Horndean
      are. Skipwith is a village in North Yorkshire, England, and Horndean is a village
      in Hampshire, England.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: West refers to the direction towards
      the setting sun, or in a more precise geographical context, it means a location
      is situated to the left when facing north.


      3. **Compare locations**: Without specific geographical coordinates or a detailed
      map, determining the exact orientation of one place relative to another can
      be challenging. However, knowing that both are in England helps narrow it down.


      4. **Research or recall specific locations in England**: North Yorkshire, where
      Skipwith is located, is in the northern part of England. Hampshire, where Horndean
      is located, is in the southern part of England.


      5. **Determine the relative positions**: Generally, places in northern England
      are considered north and possibly east of places in southern England. This means
      that if Skipwith is in North Yorkshire and Horndean is in Hampshire, Skipwith
      would likely be north and possibly east of Horndean, not west.

      is located west of Botley, Hampshire, we need to understand the geographical
      locations of both places and then compare their positions.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Potto,
      North Yorkshire, and Botley, Hampshire. Potto is a village in the Hambleton
      district of North Yorkshire, England. Botley is a village in the Eastleigh district
      of Hampshire, England.


      2. **Geographical Orientation**: Next, we need to understand the geographical
      orientation of these places relative to each other. England is part of the United
      Kingdom, which is located in northwestern Europe. Within England, North Yorkshire
      is in the north, and Hampshire is in the south.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Potto, North Yorkshire, is situated in the northern
      part of England, relatively close to the eastern coast. Botley, Hampshire, is
      located in the southern part of England, near the coast.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Considering the positions, Potto is in the north,
      while Botley is in the south. However, to determine whether Potto is west of

      west of Bebeji, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know where Varallo Sesia and
      Bebeji are located. Varallo Sesia is a town in the province of Vercelli, Piedmont,
      Italy. Bebeji is a town in the Kano State, Nigeria.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: West refers to the direction towards
      the setting sun, or in a more precise geographical context, it means a location
      is situated to the left when facing north.


      3. **Compare locations**: Without specific geographical coordinates or a detailed
      map, determining the exact orientation of one place relative to another can
      be challenging. However, knowing that Varallo Sesia is in Italy and Bebeji is
      in Nigeria helps narrow it down.


      4. **Research or recall specific locations in Italy and Nigeria**: Italy is
      located in Southern Europe, while Nigeria is in West Africa. This means that
      Nigeria is situated more to the west compared to Italy.


      5. **Determine the relative positions**: Since Bebeji is in Nigeria and Varallo
      Sesia is in Italy, and Nigeria is generally west of Italy, it''s likely that
      Bebeji is west of Varallo Sesia, not the other way around.


      Given these steps, the answer to whether Varallo Sesia is located west of Bebeji
      is: **NO**'

      \   - Maharashtra, where Bhivpuri is located, is in the western part of India.\n\
      \   - Punjab, where Sahiwal District is located, is in the eastern part of Pakistan,\

      \ on the specific locations within these regions.\n\n3. **Consider Specific\
      \ Locations Within Regions**:\n   - Without exact coordinates, we consider the\
      \ general layout. Maharashtra is in the west, and Punjab is more central but\
      \ to the north. This suggests that Punjab (and thus Sahiwal District) could\
      \ be northwest of Maharashtra (and thus Bhivpuri).\n\n4. **Conclusion Based\

      to the northern part of the island, which includes areas such as Woodlands,
      Yishun, and Sembawang.


      2. **Understand the general layout of Singapore**: Singapore is an island city-state
      in Southeast Asia. The island is roughly rectangular in shape, with the northern
      part being broader than the southern part.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Hougang is situated in the northeastern part of
      Singapore, which is relatively central to the island. The North Region, on the
      other hand, encompasses the northernmost areas of Singapore.


      4. **Directional comparison**: Considering the general layout of Singapore,
      the northeastern part of the island (where Hougang is located) is generally
      east of the northernmost areas (the North Region).


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the above steps, Hougang is not located west of
      the North Region in Singapore but rather east or northeast, depending on the
      specific areas within the North Region.

    4f4da389-2371-4f9e-aa74-9f3b6943a503: 'To answer whether Big Island, Virginia
      is located west of Confluence, Pennsylvania, we need to follow several steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Big Island, Virginia, and Confluence, Pennsylvania. Big Island is a town in
      Bedford County, Virginia, while Confluence is a borough in Somerset County,
      Pennsylvania.


      2. **Understand Geographic Directions**: West refers to the direction towards
      the setting sun, or in a more precise geographical context, it means a location
      is situated to the left when facing north.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Without specific geographical coordinates or a detailed
      map, determining the exact orientation of one place relative to another can
      be challenging. However, knowing that both are in the United States helps narrow
      it down.


      4. **Research or recall specific locations in the U.S.**: Big Island, Virginia,
      is known to be in the Appalachian Mountains region of Virginia. Confluence,
      Pennsylvania, is located in the southwestern part of Pennsylvania, near the
      borders of Maryland and West Virginia.


      5. **Determine the relative positions**: Generally, Virginia is located south
      of Pennsylvania, and the Appalachian Mountains run through both states. Based
      on their positions within their respective states, Big Island is likely to be
      south of Confluence.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given the general positions of the states and the locations
      of the towns, it''s unlikely that Big Island, Virginia, is west of Confluence,
      Pennsylvania. It''s more likely to be south or southeast of Confluence.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Big Island, Virginia, is located

    047d1ba5-fd48-4fbd-aafd-de336c98209a: 'To answer whether Stepan is located west
      of Coligny, North West, we need to follow several steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      places. Stepan is a small town in Russia, while Coligny is a town in North West
      Province, South Africa.


      2. **Understand Geographical Directions**: West refers to the direction towards
      the setting sun. In a map, it''s usually to the left when the map is oriented
      with north at the top.


      3. **Determine Relative Positions**: To determine if one place is west of another,
      we need to compare their positions on a map. Russia and South Africa are on
      different continents, with Russia being in Europe and Asia, and South Africa
      being in Africa.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Looking at a world map, Russia is located in the northern
      hemisphere, while South Africa is in the southern hemisphere. Coligny, North
      West, is situated on the western side of South Africa, while Stepan, Russia,
      is located in the central part of Russia, which is further east.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given their positions, Stepan, Russia, is not located west
      of Coligny, North West, South Africa. Instead, Stepan is located east of Coligny.

      the steps to determine the relative positions of Colo and Collins in Iowa.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Colo
      and Collins. Colo is a city in Story County, Iowa, while Collins is also a city
      in Story County, Iowa. Both are in the same county, which is important for this
      comparison.


      2. **Understand Cardinal Directions**: To determine if one place is west of
      another, we need to understand cardinal directions. West is the direction towards
      the setting sun, or in a more precise geographical context, it means a location
      is situated to the left when facing north.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Without specific geographical coordinates or a detailed
      map, determining the exact orientation of one place relative to another can
      be challenging. However, knowing that both are in the same county helps narrow
      it down.


      4. **Research or Recall Specific Locations in Story County, Iowa**: A quick
      search or recalling the general layout of Story County, Iowa, would be helpful.
      If you have a map of the county, you can visually see the relative positions
      of Colo and Collins.


      5. **Determine the Relative Positions**: Based on the research or recall, it''s
      possible to determine that Collins is situated more to the west of Colo within
      Story County.

      locations and compare them.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Pugwash and Bedford. Pugwash is a village located in Cumberland County, Nova
      Scotia, Canada. Bedford is a suburban community of Halifax, Nova Scotia.


      2. **Geographical Orientation**: Next, we need to understand the geographical
      orientation of these places relative to each other. Nova Scotia is a province
      located on the eastern coast of Canada.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Pugwash is situated in the northern part of Nova
      Scotia, closer to the Bay of Fundy. Bedford is located in the Halifax Regional
      Municipality, which is in the central part of Nova Scotia, closer to the Atlantic
      Ocean.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Considering the positions, Pugwash is more towards
      the north and west of Nova Scotia, while Bedford is more towards the central
      and southern part of the province.


      5. **East-West Relationship**: Given the relative positions, Pugwash would be
      considered west of Bedford when comparing their locations within Nova Scotia.

      the geographical relationship between Berowra Heights and Sans Souci in New
      South Wales, Australia.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations. Berowra
      Heights is a suburb of Sydney, located in the north of the city. Sans Souci
      is also a suburb of Sydney, located in the south.


      2. **Geographical Orientation**: Next, we need to understand the geographical
      orientation of Sydney. Sydney is situated on the east coast of Australia, with
      the Pacific Ocean to the east and the Blue Mountains to the west.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Berowra Heights is in the north of Sydney, while
      Sans Souci is in the south, closer to the coast.

    c2986025-5d30-4614-9361-aedde3d94414: 'To answer whether Sankarapuram is located
      west of Pullambadi, I''ll break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know where Sankarapuram and
      Pullambadi are. Both are towns in India, with Sankarapuram in Tamil Nadu and
      Pullambadi in Tamil Nadu as well.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: West refers to the direction towards
      the setting sun, or in a more precise geographical context, it means a location
      is situated to the left when facing north.


      3. **Compare locations**: Without specific geographical coordinates or a detailed
      map, determining the exact orientation of one place relative to another can
      be challenging. However, knowing that both are in Tamil Nadu helps narrow it
      down.


      4. **Research or recall specific locations in Tamil Nadu**: Sankarapuram is
      known to be in the Kallakurichi district of Tamil Nadu. Pullambadi, on the other
      hand, is a town in the Tiruchirappalli district of Tamil Nadu.


      5. **Determine the relative positions**: Generally, the Kallakurichi district
      is located more to the north and west compared to the Tiruchirappalli district
      in Tamil Nadu. This means that if Sankarapuram is in Kallakurichi and considering
      Pullambadi is in Tiruchirappalli, Sankarapuram would likely be north and west
      of Pullambadi.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Sankarapuram is located west of

      the setting sun, or in a more precise geographical context, it means a location
      is situated to the left when facing north.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Without specific geographical coordinates or a detailed
      map, determining the exact orientation of one place relative to another can
      be challenging. However, knowing that Dera Ghazi Khan is in Pakistan and Visavadar
      is in India helps narrow it down.


      4. **Research or Recall Specific Locations**: Dera Ghazi Khan is known to be
      in the Punjab province of Pakistan, and Visavadar is in the Junagadh district
      of Gujarat, India.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Billesley is a suburb in Birmingham, England,
      which is part of the West Midlands region. Bidford-on-Avon is a village in the
      county of Warwickshire, also in England.


      2. **Understand the geographical orientation**: West refers to the direction
      towards the setting sun, or in a more precise geographical context, it means
      a location is situated to the left when facing north.


      3. **Consider the general layout of England**: England is an island nation,
      with Wales to the west, Scotland to the north, and the English Channel to the
      south. Birmingham, where Billesley is located, is in the West Midlands region,
      which is in the central-western part of England.


      4. **Compare the relative positions of Birmingham and Bidford-on-Avon**: Bidford-on-Avon
      is located in Warwickshire, which is slightly to the south of the West Midlands
      region. This suggests that Bidford-on-Avon might be slightly east of Billesley,

      2. **Understand Geographic Directions**: West refers to the direction towards
      the setting sun, or in a more precise geographical context, it means a location
      is situated to the left when facing north.


      3. **Compare Locations**: To determine the relative positions of Nalwa and Barwala,
      Hisar, we need to consider their locations within the Hisar district. Both are
      within the same district, which means they are relatively close to each other.


      4. **Research or Recall Specific Locations**: Without specific geographical
      coordinates or a detailed map, determining the exact orientation of one place
      relative to another can be challenging. However, knowing that both are in the
      same district helps narrow it down.


      5. **Determine Relative Positions**: Given that both Nalwa and Barwala are in
      the Hisar district of Haryana, we can assume that they are relatively close
      to each other. Without specific coordinates, it''s difficult to determine if
      Nalwa is precisely west of Barwala, but we can say that it''s likely not significantly
      west.

    928ad547-f8b5-427a-bc8b-4f322f98a520: 'To answer whether Prestine is located west
      of Carthage, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Prestine is a village in the province of Brescia,
      Lombardy, Italy. Carthage is a city in Tunisia, North Africa.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: West refers to the direction towards
      the setting sun, or in a more precise geographical context, it means a location
      is situated to the left when facing north.


      3. **Compare locations**: Without specific geographical coordinates or a detailed
      map, determining the exact orientation of one place relative to another can
      be challenging. However, knowing that Prestine is in Italy and Carthage is in
      Tunisia helps narrow it down.


      4. **Research or recall specific locations**: Italy is located in southern Europe,
      and Tunisia is located in northern Africa. Italy is situated to the north of
      Tunisia, across the Mediterranean Sea.


      5. **Determine the relative positions**: Given that Italy is to the north of
      Tunisia, and considering that Prestine is in Italy, it''s likely that Prestine
      is situated to the north or northwest of Carthage in Tunisia.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Prestine is located west of Carthage
      is **NO**'

    63ee465b-b8b2-4054-8684-976b7798cc72: 'To answer whether Little Skellig is located
      west of Montserrado County, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to know where Little Skellig and Montserrado
      County are. Little Skellig is a small uninhabited island off the coast of County
      Kerry in Ireland. Montserrado County is one of the 15 counties of Liberia, located
      on the western coast of Africa.


      2. **Understand Geographic Directions**: West refers to the direction towards
      the setting sun, or in a more precise geographical context, it means a location
      is situated to the left when facing north.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Without specific geographical coordinates or a detailed
      map, determining the exact orientation of one place relative to another can
      be challenging. However, knowing that Little Skellig is off the coast of Ireland
      and Montserrado County is in Liberia, we can make some assumptions.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Ireland is located in the northwestern part of Europe,
      while Liberia is on the western coast of Africa. Generally, Africa is south
      and east of Europe. This means that if Little Skellig is off the coast of Ireland,
      it would likely be northwest of Montserrado County in Liberia.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the general geographical positions of Ireland and Liberia,
      Little Skellig, being off the coast of Ireland, would likely be northwest of
      Montserrado County in Liberia. Therefore, Little Skellig is not located west
      of Montserrado County but rather northeast.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Lushoto is a town in the Tanga Region of Tanzania,
      while Sarrin is a town in Syria.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: West refers to the direction towards
      the setting sun, or in a more precise geographical context, it means a location
      is situated to the left when facing north.


      3. **Compare locations**: Without specific geographical coordinates or a detailed
      map, determining the exact orientation of one place relative to another can
      be challenging. However, knowing that both are in different countries helps
      narrow it down.


      4. **Research or recall specific locations in Africa and the Middle East**:
      Lushoto is known to be in the northeastern part of Tanzania, while Sarrin is
      located in the northeastern part of Syria.


      5. **Determine the relative positions**: Generally, Syria is located to the
      north of Tanzania. This means that if Lushoto is in the northeastern part of
      Tanzania and Sarrin is in the northeastern part of Syria, Lushoto would likely
      be south or southeast of Sarrin, not west.

      and Pyinmana is a town in the Naypyidaw Union Territory of Myanmar.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: West refers to the direction towards
      the setting sun, or in a more precise geographical context, it means a location
      is situated to the left when facing north.


      3. **Compare locations**: Without specific geographical coordinates or a detailed
      map, determining the exact orientation of one place relative to another can
      be challenging. However, knowing that both are in Myanmar helps narrow it down.


      4. **Research or recall specific locations in Myanmar**: Thingangyun Township

      part of Myanmar. Pyinmana, on the other hand, is located in the central part

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to know where Muddenahalli and Sikandrabad
      are. Muddenahalli is a village in the Indian state of Karnataka. Sikandrabad
      is a city in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: West refers to the direction towards
      the setting sun, or in a more precise geographical context, it means a location
      is situated to the left when facing north.


      3. **Compare locations**: Without specific geographical coordinates or a detailed
      map, determining the exact orientation of one place relative to another can
      be challenging. However, knowing that both are in India helps narrow it down.


      4. **Research or recall specific locations in India**: Muddenahalli is known
      to be in the Chikkaballapur district of Karnataka, located in the southern part
      of India. Sikandrabad is a city in the Bulandshahr district of Uttar Pradesh,
      located in the northern part of India.


      5. **Determine the relative positions**: Generally, Karnataka, where Muddenahalli
      is located, is more to the south compared to Uttar Pradesh, where Sikandrabad
      is located. This means that if Muddenahalli is in Karnataka and considering
      Sikandrabad is in Uttar Pradesh, Muddenahalli would likely be south of Sikandrabad,
      not west.

      \ already gives us a clue that Muddenahalli (in Karnataka) might be west of\
      \ Sikandrabad (in Uttar Pradesh).\n\n4. **Examine the specific locations of\
      \ Muddenahalli and Sikandrabad**: Muddenahalli is located at approximately 13.3\xB0\
      N latitude and 77.7\xB0E longitude. Sikandrabad is located at around 28.5\xB0\
      N latitude and 77.7\xB0E longitude. Both places have approximately the same\
      \ longitude, which means they are roughly on the same vertical line on the map.\n\
      \n5. **Compare the latitudes**: Since they have the same longitude, we need\
      \ to compare their latitudes to determine their relative positions. Muddenahalli\
      \ has a lower latitude than Sikandrabad, which means it is located south of\
      \ Sikandrabad.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the above steps, we can conclude\
      \ that Muddenahalli is located south of Sikandrabad, not west. Therefore, the\
      \ answer to the question is: **NO**"
