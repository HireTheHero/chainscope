      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Sarmada is located in Syria.

      - Loiyangalani is located in Kenya.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on a map or globe.

      - Syria is situated in the Middle East, north of Africa, closer to the Mediterranean
      Sea.

      - Kenya is located in East Africa, further south and east relative to Syria.


      Step 3: Determine relative longitudinal positions (East-West comparison).

      - Kenya, particularly Loiyangalani, is located in East Africa, which is generally
      further east.

      - Syria, including Sarmada, is located further west compared to East African
      locations.


      Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that Sarmada, in Syria, is located west of
      Loiyangalani, Kenya.

      \nStep 2: Examine their approximate longitude:\n- California lies along the\
      \ west coast of the United States, generally between longitudes 114\xB0 W and\
      \ 124\xB0 W.\n- British Columbia is located north of California, along Canada's\
      \ west coast. However, British Columbia extends westward further than most of\
      \ California, especially the coast, with longitude roughly between 114\xB0 W\
      \ (east) and about 139\xB0 W (west).\n\nStep 3: Check specifics of these locations:\n\
      - Crest, California is located near San Diego County, at approximately 116.868\xB0\
      \ W longitude.\n- Riondel, British Columbia is located near Kootenay Lake, at\
      \ approximately 116.855\xB0 W longitude.\n\nStep 4: Compare exact longitudes:\n\
      - Crest, CA: about 116.868\xB0 W\n- Riondel, BC: about 116.855\xB0 W\nSince\
      \ longitude numbers increase as we move west, a higher number means more to\
      \ the west. Thus, Crest, CA (116.868\xB0 W) is slightly further west than Riondel,\
      \ BC (116.855\xB0 W).\n\nTherefore, the answer is: YES"

      \ the approximate locations of both places:\n   - Crest, California, is located\
      \ in California, United States. California is situated along the western coast\
      \ of the United States.\n   - Riondel, British Columbia, is located in British\
      \ Columbia, Canada. British Columbia is on the west coast of Canada, but Riondel\
      \ itself is situated inland, in southeastern British Columbia, near Kootenay\
      \ Lake.\n\n2. Check their approximate longitude:\n   - Crest, California is\
      \ in Southern California near San Diego, close to the west coast of the United\
      \ States, around longitude 117\xB0W.\n   - Riondel, British Columbia is inland\

      Step 2: Identify the location of Forbes.

      Forbes is located in New South Wales, Australia, inland and west of Sydney.


      Step 3: Consider the relative positions geographically.

      Tasmania, including Flinders Island where Whitemark is located, lies to the
      south-east of mainland Australia. Forbes, NSW, is inland and situated in the
      eastern part of mainland Australia.


      Step 4: Evaluate relative longitude (east-west position).

      Since Tasmania and Flinders Island lie generally further east compared to inland
      areas of mainland Australia, Forbes will clearly be further west than Whitemark.


      Therefore, Whitemark is located east of Forbes, not west.

      1. Richmond is located in Queensland, a state in the northeast part of Australia.
      However, Queensland is quite large and extends significantly westward, so the
      location of Richmond within Queensland matters. Richmond, Queensland, is located
      inland in northwestern Queensland.


      2. Boundary Bend is located in Victoria, a state in southeastern Australia.
      Boundary Bend is situated near the Murray River region in northern Victoria.


      3. Given that Richmond, Queensland, is located inland in northwestern Queensland,
      and Boundary Bend, Victoria, is located in the southeastern part of Australia,
      we must consider their relative longitudinal positions.


      4. Generally, northwestern Queensland locations (such as Richmond) tend to be

      southeast of Latakia, we can infer that Qatrat al-Rihan is located to the north
      and west of Ein Jorjin.


      Thus, Qatrat al-Rihan is indeed located west of Ein Jorjin.

      3. Tunisia is located in North Africa, southeast of Italy.

      eastward from Italy in longitude.

      - Zaporizhzhia Oblast is located in southeastern Ukraine.

      - Beitunia is located in the West Bank, near Ramallah, in the Palestinian territories.


      Step 2: Compare the relative longitude of these two regions.

      - Ukraine, including Zaporizhzhia Oblast, lies generally north of the Black
      Sea and east of central Europe. Zaporizhzhia Oblast specifically is in southeastern
      Ukraine, relatively far east in Europe.

      - The West Bank (Palestinian territories), including Beitunia, is located closer
      to the eastern Mediterranean Sea, significantly to the southwest of Ukraine.


      Step 3: Considering the longitude of these areas:

      - Zaporizhzhia Oblast, being in eastern Ukraine, is significantly east of central
      Europe.

      - Beitunia, located in the West Bank, is closer to the Mediterranean Sea, which
