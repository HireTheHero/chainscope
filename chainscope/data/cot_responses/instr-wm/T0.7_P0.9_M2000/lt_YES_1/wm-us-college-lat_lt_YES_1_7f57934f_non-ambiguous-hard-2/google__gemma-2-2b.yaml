      \ Southern University - Armstrong Campus, GA is located south of Furman University,\
      \ SC. To answer this question, you need to consider the geographical location\
      \ of these two universities.\n\nFirst, let's define the term \"south.\" In general,\
      \ \"south\" refers to the direction opposite to \"north.\" Therefore, if Georgia\
      \ Southern University - Armstrong Campus, GA is located south of Furman University,\
      \ SC, it means that Furman University is located north of Georgia Southern University\
      \ - Armstrong Campus, GA.\n\nTo determine the location of these universities,\
      \ you can use online maps or other resources. For example, you can use Google\
      \ Maps or Bing Maps to find the location of both universities. Once you have\
      \ the locations of these universities, you can determine if they are located\
      \ south of each other.\n\nIf you find that Furman University is located north\
      \ of Georgia Southern University - Armstrong Campus, GA, then the answer to\
      \ the question is \"no.\" If you find that they are located south of each other,\
      \ then the answer is \"yes.\"\n\nIt is important to note that this question\
      \ is based on the assumption that the terms \"south\" and \"north\" have their\
      \ usual meanings. If the context of the question suggests otherwise, then the\
      \ answer may be different.\n\nIn summary, to answer the question, you need to\
      \ consider the geographical locations of Georgia Southern University - Armstrong\
      \ Campus, GA and Furman University and determine if they are located south of\
      \ each other. If they are, then the answer is \"yes,\" and if they are not,\

      of Louisiana at Lafayette, LA is located south of Frederick S. Pardee RAND Graduate
      School, CA. To answer this question, we need to consider the geographical location
      of both institutions.


      University of Louisiana at Lafayette, LA is located in Lafayette, Louisiana,
      which is in the southeastern United States. Frederick S. Pardee RAND Graduate
      School, CA is located in Santa Monica, California, which is in the southwestern
      United States.

      Lafayette, LA is not located south of Frederick S. Pardee RAND Graduate School,
      CA. Lafayette, Louisiana, is located in the southeastern United States, while
      Santa Monica, California, is located in the southwestern United States. Therefore,

      In summary, we can answer the question "Is University of Louisiana at Lafayette,
      LA located south of Frederick S. Pardee RAND Graduate School, CA?" with a clear
      "no" because the institutions are located in different geographical regions
      of the United States.

      the terms "south" and "college."


      First, let''s consider the definition of "south." The word "south" is used to
      describe a direction that is opposite to the direction of the sun''s movement,
      and is usually defined as the direction that is to the west of the north.


      Now, let''s consider the definition of "college." A college is an institution
      of higher education that provides academic programs and services to students.


      So, based on this information, we can conclude that National Paralegal College,
      AZ is located south of Waynesburg University, PA.


      This is because the word "south" is used to describe a direction that is opposite
      to the direction of the sun''s movement, which is the direction that is to the
      west of the north.


      In this case, the direction that is to the west of the north is the direction

      Pierce University, located in New Hampshire, is located south of the University
      of Wisconsin-Marathon County, located in Wisconsin.


      Here are the steps of reasoning:


      1. Identify the locations:


      * Franklin Pierce University is located in New Hampshire, which is in the northeastern
      United States.

      * The University of Wisconsin-Marathon County is located in Wisconsin, which
      is in the upper Midwest region of the United States.


      2. Determine the direction:


      * Wisconsin is located north of New Hampshire.

      * Therefore, the University of Wisconsin-Marathon County is located north of
      Franklin Pierce University.


      3. Understand the question:


      * The question is asking whether Franklin Pierce University is located south
      of the University of Wisconsin-Marathon County.

      * Since Wisconsin is north of New Hampshire, it follows that Franklin Pierce
      University is located south of the University of Wisconsin-Marathon County.


      Therefore, the answer to this question is YES, Franklin Pierce University is
      located south of the University of Wisconsin-Marathon County.

      approach to determine whether University of North Carolina Wilmington, NC is
      located south of Indiana University of Pennsylvania, PA.

      To do this, we need to consider the locations of these two universities in relation
      to the equator.

      The equator is a line of latitude that divides the Earth into two equal halves,
      with the northern hemisphere above it and the southern hemisphere below it.

      If we assume that the equator is located at 0 degrees latitude, then we can
      determine whether a location is north or south of the equator by measuring its
      latitude from 0 degrees to the north or south.

      In this case, we know that the latitude of University of North Carolina Wilmington,
      NC is 34.1 degrees north, and the latitude of Indiana University of Pennsylvania,
      PA is 40.9 degrees north.

      Therefore, University of North Carolina Wilmington, NC is located north of Indiana
      University of Pennsylvania, PA.

      I cannot provide a direct answer to this question because I do not have access
      to any external sources or geographical information. However, I can provide
      some steps to help you answer the question.


      First, you should identify the location of Antioch University Santa Barbara,
      CA. You can do this by looking at the school''s website or by searching for
      information online.


      Next, you should identify the location of Colorado Mesa University, CO. Again,
      you can do this by looking at the school''s website or by searching for information
      online.


      Once you have identified the locations of both schools, you can compare their
      locations to determine if they are located south of each other. If they are,
      then the answer is yes. If they are not, then the answer is no.


      Remember, the answer to this question will depend on the specific locations
      of both schools. You may need to do some research to determine their exact locations.

      give a general answer.


      To determine if two colleges are located in the same or different geographic
      regions, you would need to consider their locations on a map or other geographical
      reference. You would need to compare the latitude and longitude coordinates
      of each college to see if they are in the same or different hemispheres.


      For example, if you know the latitude and longitude coordinates of Antioch University
      Santa Barbara, CA, and Colorado Mesa University, CO, you can use a map or a
      map tool to determine if they are in the same or different geographic regions.
      If they are in the same hemisphere, but not in the same latitude or longitude
      range, they are in different geographic regions.


      If you need more information about how to use maps or map tools to determine
      if two colleges are in the same or different geographic regions, you can consult
      a geography textbook or a website that provides information on geographic regions
      and coordinates.

      south of Wayland Baptist University, TX. So, we need to think about the location

      Firstly, let''s look at the location of the University of New Orleans, LA. It
      is located in New Orleans, Louisiana, which is in the southeastern part of the

      Based on this information, we can conclude that the University of New Orleans,

      The question is about the locations of University of North Carolina at Pembroke
      and Webb Institute.


      To answer the question, you need to understand the concept of latitude and longitude,
      which is a system of measuring the position of places on the Earth''s surface.


      The question asks about the location of University of North Carolina at Pembroke,
      which is in North Carolina, and Webb Institute, which is in New York.


      To determine whether these two locations are south of each other, you need to
      look at their latitudes and longitudes.


      Latitude is measured in degrees north or south of the equator, with 0 degrees
      at the equator.


      Longitude is measured in degrees east or west of the prime meridian, with 0
      degrees at the prime meridian.


      To find the latitude and longitude of a location, you can use a map or online
      tool that provides this information.


      Once you have the latitudes and longitudes of both University of North Carolina
      at Pembroke and Webb Institute, you can determine whether they are south of
      each other by comparing their positions.


      If the latitude of Webb Institute is greater than the latitude of University
      of North Carolina at Pembroke, then Webb Institute is south of University of
      North Carolina at Pembroke.


      If the latitude of University of North Carolina at Pembroke is greater than
      the latitude of Webb Institute, then Webb Institute is north of University of
      North Carolina at Pembroke.


      If the latitudes of both locations are equal, then they are at the same latitude
      and cannot be determined to be south of each other.


      If the longitudes of both locations are equal, then they are at the same longitude
      and cannot be determined to be south of each other.


      In this case, the answer is YES. University of North Carolina at Pembroke is
      located in North Carolina, which is south of New York, which is south of Webb
      Institute.

      I can provide some general information about the relationship between colleges
      and their locations.


      Generally speaking, colleges are located in different regions of the United
      States based on their mission, purpose, and the needs of the communities they
      serve. For example, some colleges are located in urban areas to serve students
      from diverse backgrounds, while others are located in rural areas to serve students
      from small towns.


      In terms of their geographical locations, colleges can be found in different
      regions of the country, including the Northeast, Midwest, South, and West. The
      location of a college can also vary based on its specific program offerings
      and academic focus. For example, some colleges may specialize in STEM fields
      and be located in urban areas with high concentrations of STEM students, while
      others may be located in rural areas to serve students who are passionate about
      the arts or humanities.


      It''s important to note that the location of a college can also have a significant
      impact on the educational experience for students. For example, students who
      attend colleges located in urban areas may have access to a wider range of cultural
      and social activities, while students who attend colleges located in rural areas
      may have more opportunities to engage in outdoor activities and get involved
      in community service projects.


      Overall, the location of a college can vary depending on a variety of factors,
      including the mission of the college, the needs of the community it serves,
      and the preferences of the students who attend the college.'

      Now we have narrowed down our search to colleges located in the continental

      Next, we can eliminate any colleges located in the states of Arizona, California,
      Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and
