      in Pennsylvania is located south of Saint Martin''s University in Washington.


      First, let me identify where each university is located:


      1. Gannon University is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is in the eastern part of
      the United States.

      2. Saint Martin''s University is in Washington state (WA), which is in the northwestern
      part of the United States.


      In terms of latitude:

      - Washington state is in the northern part of the contiguous United States,
      bordering Canada.

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern part of the United States, but it''s significantly
      south of Washington state.


      Since Washington state is much further north than Pennsylvania, Saint Martin''s
      University (in WA) would be north of Gannon University (in PA).


      So if Saint Martin''s is north of Gannon, then Gannon is south of Saint Martin''s.</think>To
      determine if Gannon University in Pennsylvania is located south of Saint Martin''s
      University in Washington, I need to consider the geographic positions of these
      two states.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Gannon University is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is in the eastern United
      States.

      - Saint Martin''s University is in Washington state (WA), which is in the northwestern
      United States.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      - Washington state is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous U.S.,
      bordering Canada.

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeast, but is significantly further south than
      Washington state.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on north-south positioning.

      Since Washington state is further north than Pennsylvania, Saint Martin''s University
      would be north of Gannon University, which means Gannon University is south
      of Saint Martin''s University.

      Gannon University is located in Erie, Pennsylvania (PA). Pennsylvania is in
      the northeastern United States.


      Saint Martin''s University is located in Lacey, Washington (WA). Washington
      state is in the northwestern United States.


      Now I need to compare their latitudes to determine which is further south:


      In the United States, northern states are at higher latitudes, and southern
      states are at lower latitudes.


      Washington state is in the far northwest of the contiguous United States, bordering
      Canada. It''s one of the northernmost states.


      Pennsylvania is in the northeast, but it''s significantly further south than
      Washington state.


      Therefore, Gannon University in Pennsylvania would be south of Saint Martin''s
      University in Washington.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine

      Step 2: Compare the geographic positions of these states.

      - Washington state is in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Washington state is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US

      - Pennsylvania is considerably further south than Washington


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on north-south positioning.

      Since Pennsylvania is south of Washington state, Gannon University (PA) is located
      south of Saint Martin''s University (WA).

      - Benedictine University is in Illinois (IL)


      To be more specific:

      - Thomas More University is in Crestview Hills, Kentucky

      - Benedictine University is in Lisle, Illinois


      Now I need to think about their relative positions on a north-south axis.


      Illinois is generally north of Kentucky. Illinois borders Kentucky, with Illinois
      being to the north and Kentucky to the south.


      More specifically:

      - Lisle, Illinois is in the northern part of Illinois, near Chicago

      - Crestview Hills, Kentucky is in the northern part of Kentucky, near Cincinnati,
      Ohio


      So geographically, Thomas More University in Kentucky would be south of Benedictine
      University in Illinois, since Kentucky is south of Illinois.

      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Illinois is located north of Kentucky. The states share a border, with Illinois
      positioned above Kentucky on a map.


      Step 3: Consider specific locations within these states.

      - Thomas More University is in Crestview Hills, KY, in the northern part of
      Kentucky near Cincinnati.

      - Benedictine University is in Lisle, IL, in the northern part of Illinois near
      Chicago.


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      Even though Thomas More is in northern Kentucky, the entire state of Kentucky
      is still south of where Benedictine is located in northern Illinois.

      Let me first identify where these colleges are located:


      1. Widener University, DE - This university is in Delaware. Specifically, my
      knowledge indicates Widener University has its main campus in Chester, Pennsylvania,
      but they also have a campus in Wilmington, Delaware.


      2. Mildred Elley, NY - This is a college in New York state. They have campuses
      in Albany, NY and NYC (New York City).


      Now I need to determine which is further south:

      - Delaware is south of New York state

      - Wilmington, DE (where Widener''s Delaware campus is) is definitely south of

      - Widener University''s Delaware campus is located in Wilmington, Delaware.

      - Mildred Elley has campuses in New York state, specifically in Albany and New
      York City.


      Step 2: Compare the geographic positions.

      University''s Delaware location is indeed south of Mildred Elley''s New York

      Virginia is located south of Pennsylvania, with Maryland in between them.

      Shenandoah University is located in Winchester, Virginia (VA).


      Mercyhurst University is located in Erie, Pennsylvania (PA).


      Generally speaking, Virginia is located south of Pennsylvania in the United
      States. Pennsylvania borders New York to the north and Maryland to the south,
      while Virginia is south of Maryland.


      To be more specific:

      - Pennsylvania is a northern state, bordering the Great Lakes (Erie).

      - Virginia is a mid-Atlantic state, significantly south of Pennsylvania.


      So geographically, Virginia is south of Pennsylvania, which means Shenandoah

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Pennsylvania is a northern state, located north of Maryland

      - Virginia is located south of Maryland and Pennsylvania

      - Erie, PA is in the far northwestern part of Pennsylvania

      - Winchester, VA is in the northern part of Virginia

      First, let me note their states:

      - Shenandoah University is in Virginia (VA)

      - Mercyhurst University is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Generally speaking, Virginia is south of Pennsylvania on a map of the United
      States. Pennsylvania shares a border with Maryland to its south, and Virginia
      is south of Maryland. So on a state level, Virginia is definitely south of Pennsylvania.

      - Shenandoah University is in Winchester, Virginia, in the northern part of
      the state

      - Mercyhurst University is in Erie, Pennsylvania, in the northwestern part of

      3) Geographically, Pennsylvania is north of Virginia

      4) Erie, PA is in the northwestern part of Pennsylvania, near Lake Erie

      5) Winchester, VA is in the northern Shenandoah Valley region of Virginia

      6) Even though Winchester is in northern Virginia, the entire state of Virginia
      lies south of Pennsylvania


      Since Virginia is entirely south of Pennsylvania on the map, and Shenandoah
      University is in Virginia while Mercyhurst University is in Pennsylvania, I
      can conclude that Shenandoah University is indeed south of Mercyhurst University.

      part of SC.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Georgia and South Carolina.

      - South Carolina is located on the east coast of the US.

      - Georgia is positioned directly south of South Carolina.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations within these states.

      - Savannah, GA is in the eastern coastal region of Georgia.

      - Greenville, SC is in the northwestern part of South Carolina.

      - Even though Savannah is in the eastern part of Georgia, the entire state of
      Georgia is south of South Carolina.


      Step 4: Make the geographical comparison.

      - Since the Armstrong Campus is in Georgia (a southern state relative to SC)
      and Furman is in South Carolina (a northern state relative to GA), the Armstrong
      Campus must be south of Furman University.

      3. Determine which one is located more south


      Let me think about the geographical locations:


      Mississippi (MS) is a state in the southern United States. It borders Tennessee
      to the north.

      Tennessee (TN) is north of Mississippi.


      Since the University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry is in

      of Dentistry would be south of Bethel University.


      To be more specific:

      - University of Mississippi Medical Center is in Jackson, Mississippi

      - Bethel University is in McKenzie, Tennessee


      Since Jackson, Mississippi is south of McKenzie, Tennessee (because Mississippi

      - Tennessee is a state that borders Mississippi to the north

      - Mississippi is located directly south of Tennessee


      Step 3: Apply this state-level geographic relationship to the universities.

      - Since the University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry is
      in Mississippi

      - And Bethel University is in Tennessee

      - And Mississippi is south of Tennessee


      Therefore, University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry, MS

      to determine the geographical locations of these two educational institutions:


      1. Columbus Technical College in Georgia (GA)

      2. St. Andrews University in North Carolina (NC)


      I need to find out if Columbus Technical College is located south of St. Andrews
      University.


      Let me start by recalling their locations:


      Columbus Technical College is in Columbus, Georgia. Columbus is a city located
      in western Georgia near the Alabama border.


      St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, North Carolina. Laurinburg is located
      in southeastern North Carolina.


      Geographically speaking, Georgia is generally south of North Carolina. North
      Carolina borders South Carolina to its south, and South Carolina borders Georgia
      to its south.


      So in terms of states, Georgia is south of North Carolina.


      Now, I need to be more specific about the cities:


      Columbus, GA is in the western part of Georgia, near the Alabama border.

      Laurinburg, NC (where St. Andrews University is located) is in the southeastern
      part of North Carolina.


      Given that Georgia is south of North Carolina, and considering the specific
      locations within their respective states, Columbus Technical College in Columbus,
      GA would be south of St. Andrews University in Laurinburg, NC.</think>I need
      to determine the relative geographic positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Columbus Technical College is in Columbus, Georgia (GA)

      - St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the states'' geographic relationship.

      - North Carolina is located north of South Carolina

      - South Carolina is located north of Georgia

      - Therefore, Georgia is south of North Carolina


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities within these states.

      - Columbus is in western Georgia, near the Alabama border

      - Laurinburg is in southeastern North Carolina

      - Even though they''re in different parts of their respective states (east vs.
      west), the north-south relationship of the states themselves determines their
      relative positions


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Georgia is south of North Carolina, Columbus Technical College (GA) is
      south of St. Andrews University (NC).

      College in Georgia is located south of St. Andrews University in North Carolina,
      I need to identify the geographic locations of both institutions.


      1. Columbus Technical College is located in Columbus, Georgia (GA).

      2. St. Andrews University is located in Laurinburg, North Carolina (NC).


      Now I need to determine which one is further south. In the United States:

      - Georgia is a southern state that borders Florida

      - North Carolina is also a southern state, but is north of Georgia


      Generally speaking, Georgia is south of North Carolina. But to be more precise:


      Columbus, GA is in the western part of Georgia, near the Alabama border.

      Laurinburg, NC is in the southern part of North Carolina.


      Even though Laurinburg is in southern NC, Georgia as a state is entirely south
      of North Carolina. Columbus would therefore be south of Laurinburg.


      So Columbus Technical College in Georgia would be south of St. Andrews University
      in North Carolina.</think>I need to determine the relative geographic positions

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      Step 2: Compare the geographic positions.

      - Georgia is a state that borders Florida to the south

      - North Carolina is also a southern state, but is positioned entirely north
      of Georgia

      - Even though Laurinburg is in southern North Carolina, it''s still in North
      Carolina, which is north of Georgia

      - Columbus is in western Georgia, but still within Georgia


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on state positions.

      Since Georgia is geographically south of North Carolina, and Columbus is in
      Georgia while Laurinburg is in North Carolina, Columbus Technical College is
      south of St. Andrews University.

    bfd41baf-66a5-4c01-a878-daee753f0d1a: '<think>Alright, so I need to determine
      if Mount Mercy University in Iowa (IA) is located south of the University of
      Mary in North Dakota (ND).


      To solve this, I need to compare the geographical locations of these two universities.


      First, let''s think about the states:

      - Mount Mercy University is in Iowa (IA).

      - University of Mary is in North Dakota (ND).


      In terms of US geography, North Dakota is located along the northern border
      of the United States (bordering Canada), while Iowa is located further south,
      more towards the middle of the country.


      Generally speaking, North Dakota is north of Iowa. So a university in North
      Dakota would typically be north of a university in Iowa.


      Therefore, Mount Mercy University in Iowa should be south of the University
      of Mary in North Dakota.</think>I need to determine if Mount Mercy University
      in Iowa is located south of University of Mary in North Dakota.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Mount Mercy University is in Iowa (IA).

      - University of Mary is in North Dakota (ND).


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - North Dakota is one of the northernmost states in the US, bordering Canada.

      - Iowa is located further south in the Midwest region.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - North Dakota sits significantly north of Iowa on the map.

      - Any location in Iowa would be south of most locations in North Dakota.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since Mount Mercy University is in Iowa, and University of Mary is in North
      Dakota, Mount Mercy University must be south of University of Mary.


      YES'
    f141dfcd-ef9c-44d7-a5e5-d70b2a9fae02: '<think>I need to determine the relative
      geographical positions of Mount Mercy University in Iowa (IA) and University
      of Mary in North Dakota (ND).


      First, let me think about the states:

      - Iowa (IA) is in the Midwest, roughly in the middle of the continental US

      - North Dakota (ND) is also in the Midwest, but located along the northern border
      of the US with Canada


      In terms of north-south positioning, North Dakota is definitely north of Iowa.
      Iowa is south of North Dakota.


      Now, let''s consider the specific universities:

      - Mount Mercy University is in Iowa (IA)

      - University of Mary is in North Dakota (ND)


      Since North Dakota is north of Iowa, and these universities are in their respective
      states, Mount Mercy University (in Iowa) would be south of University of Mary
      (in North Dakota).


      So the answer appears to be YES - Mount Mercy University, IA is located south
      of University of Mary, ND.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative north-south positions of these two universities by examining their
      locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Mount Mercy University is in Iowa (IA)

      - University of Mary is in North Dakota (ND)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      North Dakota is positioned along the northern border of the United States, adjacent
      to Canada.

      Iowa is positioned in the Midwest, but significantly south of North Dakota.


      Step 3: Consider if there could be any unusual positioning within these states
      that might change the relationship.

      Even accounting for specific locations within each state, the north-south distance
      between North Dakota and Iowa is substantial enough that any university in Iowa
      would be south of any university in North Dakota.


      YES - Mount Mercy University in Iowa is located south of University of Mary
      in North Dakota.'

      Let me think about the relative locations of Iowa and North Dakota in the United
      States:


      - North Dakota (ND) is a northern state that borders Canada

      - Iowa (IA) is in the Midwest, south of Minnesota, which itself is south of
      North Dakota


      The geographic fact is that North Dakota is definitely north of Iowa. So any
      place in Iowa would be south of any place in North Dakota.


      Therefore, Mount Mercy University in Iowa would be located south of University
      of Mary in North Dakota.</think>To answer this question, I need to compare the
      geographic locations of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these universities are located.

      - Mount Mercy University is in Iowa (IA)

      - University of Mary is in North Dakota (ND)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - North Dakota is a northern border state that touches Canada

      - Iowa is located in the Midwest region, significantly south of North Dakota

      - Specifically, Iowa is south of Minnesota, which itself is south of North Dakota


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      Since Iowa is geographically south of North Dakota, any university in Iowa (including
      Mount Mercy) would be south of any university in North Dakota (including University
      of Mary).

      University in Missouri is located south of Bryant University in Rhode Island,
      I need to find the approximate latitude of each university.


      Central Methodist University is in Missouri (MO). Missouri is generally in the
      central part of the United States.


      Bryant University is in Rhode Island (RI). Rhode Island is in the northeastern
      part of the United States.


      Generally speaking, northeastern states like Rhode Island are further north
      than central states like Missouri. So my initial guess would be that Central
      Methodist University is south of Bryant University.


      To be more precise:

      - Rhode Island is one of the northernmost states in the US, located around 41-42
      degrees north latitude

      - Missouri is more central, typically around 36-40 degrees north latitude


      So it''s very likely that Central Methodist University in Missouri is south
      of Bryant University in Rhode Island. But let me think about the exact locations
      to be sure.


      Central Methodist University is in Fayette, Missouri, which should be somewhere
      in the middle of Missouri.

      Bryant University is in Smithfield, Rhode Island, which would be somewhere in
      Rhode Island.


      Given the geographical positions of these states, I''m confident that Central
      Methodist University is south of Bryant University.</think>I need to determine
      the relative north-south positions of these two universities by considering

      - Central Methodist University is in Missouri (MO).

      - Bryant University is in Rhode Island (RI).


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - Rhode Island is located in the northeastern United States.

      - Missouri is located in the central United States, significantly further south
      than the northeastern states.


      Step 3: Compare their approximate latitudes.

      - Rhode Island is typically around 41-42 degrees north latitude.

      - Missouri is typically around 36-40 degrees north latitude.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Missouri is at a lower latitude than Rhode Island, and universities within
      these states would generally follow this pattern, Central Methodist University
      would be south of Bryant University.

      1. University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) is located in Wilmington,
      North Carolina.

      2. Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) is located in Indiana, Pennsylvania.


      Now I need to determine which one is further north (or south).


      North Carolina is a southern state on the east coast of the United States.

      Pennsylvania is a northern state, also on the east coast but further north than
      North Carolina.


      Looking at their relative positions on a map of the US:

      - Pennsylvania is located north of North Carolina

      - Therefore, any city in North Carolina would be south of any city in Pennsylvania
      (with very few possible exceptions for cities right on the borders)

      within Pennsylvania, I can confidently say that University of North Carolina
      Wilmington is located south of Indiana University of Pennsylvania.</think>To

      - Indiana University of Pennsylvania is located in Indiana, Pennsylvania


      Step 2: Compare the geographical positions of Pennsylvania and North Carolina.

      - Pennsylvania is a northern state in the eastern United States

      - North Carolina is a southern state in the eastern United States

      - Pennsylvania lies north of North Carolina on a map


      Step 3: Since both universities are located well within their respective states
      (not near state borders that might create exceptions), the university in North
      Carolina would be south of the university in Pennsylvania.


      YES, University of North Carolina Wilmington is located south of Indiana University

      to determine the geographic locations of two universities and compare them:


      1. University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) in Wilmington, North Carolina

      2. Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) in Pennsylvania


      First, I''ll recall the general geographic positions of these states:

      - North Carolina is a southeastern state on the Atlantic coast

      - Pennsylvania is a northeastern/mid-Atlantic state


      In terms of latitude (north-south position):

      - Pennsylvania is generally north of North Carolina

      - Wilmington, NC is in the southern part of North Carolina (near the coast)

      - Indiana, PA (where IUP is located) is in western Pennsylvania


      The question is asking if UNCW is south of IUP. Since North Carolina is south

      Indiana is in Pennsylvania, UNCW would be south of IUP.</think>I''ll solve this
      by comparing the locations of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of North Carolina Wilmington is located in Wilmington, North Carolina.

      - Indiana University of Pennsylvania is located in Indiana, Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - North Carolina is a southeastern state on the Atlantic coast.

      - Pennsylvania is a northeastern/mid-Atlantic state.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions (latitudes).

      - Pennsylvania is significantly north of North Carolina.

      - Wilmington is in the southern part of North Carolina (near the coast).

      - Indiana, PA is in western Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since North Carolina is entirely south of Pennsylvania on the map, and Wilmington
      is in North Carolina while Indiana is in Pennsylvania, UNC Wilmington must be
      south of Indiana University of Pennsylvania.

      if Whitacre College of Engineering, TX is located south of Ohio Dominican University,
      OH.


      Let''s break this down:

      1) First, I need to identify where Whitacre College of Engineering is in Texas.

      2) Then I need to identify where Ohio Dominican University is in Ohio.

      3) Then I need to determine if the Texas location is south of the Ohio location.


      Texas is generally south of Ohio in the United States. Texas borders Mexico
      to the south and is in the southern part of the US, while Ohio is in the Midwest/Great
      Lakes region, significantly further north.


      Whitacre College of Engineering is part of Texas Tech University, which is located
      in Lubbock, Texas.


      Ohio Dominican University is located in Columbus, Ohio.


      Since Lubbock, Texas is in Texas, and Texas is south of Ohio, Whitacre College
      of Engineering is south of Ohio Dominican University.</think>To answer this
      question, I need to determine the locations of both institutions and compare
      their positions on a north-south axis.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Whitacre College of Engineering is part of Texas Tech University, located
      in Lubbock, Texas.

      - Ohio Dominican University is located in Columbus, Ohio.


      Step 2: Compare the geographical positions of Texas and Ohio.

      - Texas is in the southern United States, bordering Mexico.

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, significantly further north.


      Step 3: Determine the north-south relationship.

      - All locations in Texas are geographically south of all locations in Ohio.

      - Therefore, Lubbock, Texas (where Whitacre College is) must be south of Columbus,
      Ohio (where Ohio Dominican University is).

      PA is located south of Granite State College, NH, I need to figure out the location
      of both universities.


      Bloomsburg University is in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania (PA).

      Granite State College is in New Hampshire (NH).


      In terms of US geography, New Hampshire is in the northeastern part of the United
      States (New England region), while Pennsylvania is south of New England.


      More specifically:

      - New Hampshire borders Maine to the east, Massachusetts to the south, Vermont
      to the west, and Canada to the north.

      - Pennsylvania is further south, bordering New York to the north, New Jersey
      to the east, Delaware and Maryland to the southeast, West Virginia to the southwest,
      and Ohio to the west.


      Since Pennsylvania is generally south of New Hampshire, and Bloomsburg is in
      Pennsylvania while Granite State College is in New Hampshire, Bloomsburg University
      would be south of Granite State College.</think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the geographic locations of both institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both colleges.

      - Bloomsburg University is located in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania (PA)

      - Granite State College is located in New Hampshire (NH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Pennsylvania and New Hampshire.

      - New Hampshire is in the northeastern United States (part of New England)

      - Pennsylvania is located south of the New England states


      Step 3: Verify the specific locations.

      - New Hampshire is positioned north of Pennsylvania on a map

      - This means any location in Pennsylvania would be south of any location in
      New Hampshire


      Therefore, Bloomsburg University in Pennsylvania is indeed located south of
      Granite State College in New Hampshire.

      To answer this, I need to determine the approximate locations of these universities.


      Alcorn State University is in Mississippi (MS), which is generally in the southern
      United States.

      Harding University is in Arkansas (AR), which is also in the southern United

      Let me think about the typical locations within these states:

      - Mississippi borders the Gulf of Mexico to the south, with Arkansas to its
      northwest

      - Arkansas is north of Louisiana and Mississippi


      So generally speaking, locations in Mississippi would be south of locations
      in Arkansas. However, I need to be careful because the specific locations within
      the states matter - a northern Mississippi location could potentially be north
      of a southern Arkansas location.

      Step 3: Be more specific about the university locations within their states.

      - Alcorn State University is in Lorman, MS, in the southwestern part of Mississippi

      - Harding University is in Searcy, AR, in central Arkansas


      Step 4: Compare these specific locations.

      - Since Arkansas is directly north of Mississippi, and these universities are
      not at unusual positions within their states that would reverse this relationship,
      Alcorn State would be south of Harding University.

      2. Determine the location (specifically latitude) of Harding University in Arkansas
      (AR)

      3. Compare the latitudes to see which one is further south (lower latitude number)


      Let me recall the locations:


      Alcorn State University is in Mississippi (MS). Mississippi is in the southern
      United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico. Specifically, Alcorn State is in
      Lorman, Mississippi.


      Harding University is in Arkansas (AR). Arkansas is also in the southern United
      States, but it''s north of Mississippi. Specifically, Harding University is
      in Searcy, Arkansas.


      In general, Mississippi is south of Arkansas. The entire state of Arkansas is
      north of most of Mississippi. Since Alcorn State is in Mississippi and Harding
      is in Arkansas, it''s very likely that Alcorn State is south of Harding University.


      To be more precise:

      - Lorman, MS (where Alcorn State is) is in the southwestern part of Mississippi

      - Searcy, AR (where Harding is) is in the central part of Arkansas


      So yes, Alcorn State University in Mississippi is located south of Harding University

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Alcorn State University is located in Lorman, Mississippi (MS)

      - Harding University is located in Searcy, Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Mississippi and Arkansas.

      - Arkansas is positioned directly north of Mississippi in the United States

      - Mississippi borders the Gulf of Mexico to the south, while Arkansas doesn''t


      Step 3: Think about the specific locations within these states.

      - Lorman, MS (Alcorn State) is in southwestern Mississippi

      - Searcy, AR (Harding) is in central Arkansas


      Since Mississippi is south of Arkansas, and these universities are in standard
      locations within their respective states, Alcorn State University would be further
      south than Harding University.

      State University and Oklahoma City University are located, and then determine
      if Tarleton State is south of Oklahoma City University.


      Tarleton State University is in Texas (TX). More specifically, it''s in Stephenville,
      Texas.


      Oklahoma City University is in Oklahoma (OK). More specifically, it''s in Oklahoma
      City, Oklahoma.


      Oklahoma is directly north of Texas. Generally speaking, locations in Texas
      will be south of locations in Oklahoma.


      Since Tarleton State University is in Texas and Oklahoma City University is
      in Oklahoma, it''s very likely that Tarleton State University is south of Oklahoma
      City University.


      However, let me double-check by thinking about the specific locations within
      their states:

      - Oklahoma City is in the central part of Oklahoma, close to the southern border

      - Stephenville, TX (where Tarleton State is) is in central/north Texas


      Even with Oklahoma City being in the southern part of Oklahoma, Texas locations
      would still be south of Oklahoma locations because the entire state of Texas
      is south of Oklahoma.</think># Is Tarleton State University, TX located south
      of Oklahoma City University, OK?


      I need to determine the relative geographical positions of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Tarleton State University is located in Stephenville, Texas (TX)

      - Oklahoma City University is located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (OK)


      ## Step 2: Consider state geography

      - Oklahoma is directly north of Texas on a map

      - The entire state of Texas lies south of Oklahoma


      ## Step 3: Compare specific locations

      - Oklahoma City is located in the central part of Oklahoma

      - Stephenville, Texas is located in north-central Texas

      - Even though Oklahoma City is in the southern portion of Oklahoma, it is still
      north of the Texas-Oklahoma border


      ## Step 4: Determine relative position

      Since Tarleton State University is in Texas and Oklahoma City University is
      in Oklahoma, and Texas is south of Oklahoma, Tarleton State University must
      be south of Oklahoma City University.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      I need to figure out if Tarleton State is south of Oklahoma City University.


      First, let me think about the general geography. Oklahoma is directly north
      of Texas. So in general, locations in Texas tend to be south of locations in
      Oklahoma.


      Oklahoma City is in central Oklahoma. Oklahoma City University would be in or
      near Oklahoma City.


      Tarleton State University is in Texas, but I need to determine where in Texas.
      Tarleton State University is located in Stephenville, Texas, which is in central/north
      Texas.


      Given that:

      - Oklahoma City University is in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (central Oklahoma)

      - Tarleton State University is in Stephenville, Texas (north-central Texas)

      - Texas is south of Oklahoma


      It''s very likely that Tarleton State University is south of Oklahoma City University,

      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      - Oklahoma is directly north of Texas on a map of the United States.


      Step 2: Locate Oklahoma City University.

      - Oklahoma City University is located in Oklahoma City, which is in the central
      part of Oklahoma.


      Step 3: Locate Tarleton State University.

      - Tarleton State University is located in Stephenville, Texas, which is in north-central
      Texas.


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      - Since Oklahoma is entirely north of Texas, and Oklahoma City is in central

      Tarleton State University is located in Stephenville, Texas. Texas is located

      First, let''s establish their locations:


      Grayson College is located in Denison, Texas, which is in the northern part

      The two institutions are:

      1. Ohio Valley University in West Virginia (WV)

      2. Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs in Ohio (OH)


      First, I need to identify their locations:


      Ohio Valley University is in West Virginia. Based on its name "Ohio Valley,"
      it''s likely near the Ohio River, which forms part of the border between West
      Virginia and Ohio.


      Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs is in Ohio. I believe this is
      part of Cleveland State University, located in Cleveland, Ohio.


      Now, geographically:

      - Cleveland, Ohio is in the northern part of Ohio, close to Lake Erie.

      - West Virginia is entirely south of Ohio.


      Since Ohio Valley University is in West Virginia, and West Virginia is south
      of northern Ohio where Cleveland is located, Ohio Valley University would be
      south of the Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the geographic locations of both institutions
      and compare them.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Ohio Valley University is located in West Virginia (WV).

      - Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs is in Ohio (OH). This is a college
      within Cleveland State University, located in Cleveland, Ohio.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these locations.

      - Cleveland is located in northern Ohio, near Lake Erie.

      - West Virginia is a state that borders Ohio to the southeast.


      Step 3: Compare the north-south positioning.

      - Cleveland, Ohio is quite far north in the state of Ohio.

      - Any location in West Virginia would be south of Cleveland, Ohio.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since Ohio Valley University is in West Virginia, and West Virginia is south
      of Cleveland, Ohio, the university must be south of the Maxine Goodman Levin
      College of Urban Affairs.

      First, I need to know where each state is located:

      - Arkansas (AR) is a state in the south-central region of the United States.

      - Connecticut (CT) is a state in the northeastern region of the United States.


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - Arkansas is located significantly south of Connecticut.

      Reasoning Step by Step


      To determine if UNC Pembroke is south of Webb Institute, I need to locate both
      institutions and compare their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - University of North Carolina at Pembroke is located in Pembroke, North Carolina

      - Webb Institute is located in Glen Cove, New York (on Long Island)


      Step 2: Compare the geographical positions.

      - North Carolina is a southeastern state in the US

      - New York is a northeastern state in the US

      - When looking at a US map, North Carolina is clearly south of New York


      Step 3: Make the final comparison.

      To solve this, I need to consider the geographic locations of these two institutions:


      1. University of North Carolina at Pembroke is in Pembroke, North Carolina

      2. Webb Institute is in New York


      In the United States, North Carolina is a southern state, while New York is
      a northern state. The US states are arranged roughly with northern states being
      farther north (higher latitude) than southern states.


      North Carolina is definitely south of New York on a map of the United States.
      Since the University of North Carolina at Pembroke is in North Carolina, and
      Webb Institute is in New York, the University of North Carolina at Pembroke
      must be south of Webb Institute.</think>To determine if University of North
      Carolina at Pembroke (NC) is located south of Webb Institute (NY), I need to
      consider their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each institution is located.

      - University of North Carolina at Pembroke is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Webb Institute is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the relative geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is a northern state, located in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is a southern state, located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on the north-south axis.

      - All of North Carolina is geographically south of New York

      - Therefore, any location in North Carolina (including Pembroke) would be south
      of any location in New York (including Webb Institute)


      YES, University of North Carolina at Pembroke is located south of Webb Institute.'
    bae678c1-aeda-41ec-8d79-d571b9b720b3: '<think>I need to determine the geographic

      1. The question is asking about the relative geographical positions of two universities:
      Urbana University in Ohio (OH) and Calvin University in Michigan (MI).


      2. Specifically, it asks if Urbana University is located south of Calvin University.


      3. To answer this, I need to know the approximate locations of both universities.


      4. Urbana University is in Urbana, Ohio. Ohio is generally south of Michigan
      in the United States.


      5. Calvin University is in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Michigan is generally north
      of Ohio.


      6. Since Ohio is south of Michigan, and these universities are in their respective
      states, it''s very likely that Urbana University is south of Calvin University.


      Let me confirm: Ohio borders Michigan to the south, so any location in Ohio
      would be south of or at approximately the same latitude as the southern border
      of Michigan. Since Grand Rapids is not at the southern edge of Michigan but
      more centrally located, Urbana University in Ohio would definitely be south
      of Calvin University in Michigan.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Urbana University is located in Urbana, Ohio (OH)

      - Calvin University is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between the states.

      - Michigan is located north of Ohio in the United States

      - Ohio borders Michigan''s southern boundary


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations within these states.

      - Grand Rapids, MI (where Calvin University is located) is in the western part
      of Michigan, well above the Ohio border

      - Urbana, OH is located in west-central Ohio


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the north-south positioning.

      - Since Ohio is south of Michigan, and Urbana is not at the extreme northern
      edge of Ohio, while Grand Rapids is not at the extreme southern edge of Michigan,
      Urbana University must be south of Calvin University.

      6. Calvin University is in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which is in the western part
      of southern Michigan.


      7. Even though Calvin is in southern Michigan, Michigan itself is north of Ohio,

      Therefore, Urbana University in Ohio would be south of Calvin University in
      Michigan.</think># Determining if Urbana University, OH is south of Calvin University,

      2. Looking at their geographic relationship, Michigan is located directly north
      of Ohio in the United States.


      3. Urbana University is specifically located in Urbana, Ohio, which is in the
      west-central part of the state.


      4. Calvin University is in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which is in the western part
      of lower Michigan.


      5. Even though both are in the western portions of their respective states,
      the fact that Ohio itself is entirely south of Michigan means that any location
      in Ohio (including Urbana) would be south of locations in Michigan (including
      Grand Rapids).


      Therefore, YES, Urbana University, OH is located south of Calvin University,
      MI.'

      Let me think about the general geography of Ohio and Michigan:

      - Ohio is generally south of Michigan (Michigan is above/north of Ohio)

      - Ohio borders Lake Erie to the north, and Michigan is north of that

      - Michigan is shaped like a mitten, with the Lower Peninsula south of the Upper

      Ohio.

      Calvin University is in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which is in the southwestern
      part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula.

      - Michigan is generally located north of Ohio

      - Ohio''s northern border touches Lake Erie, while Michigan extends both above
      and below this lake


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Urbana, Ohio is in the west-central part of Ohio

      - Grand Rapids, Michigan is in the southwestern part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula


      Since Ohio is entirely south of Michigan, and Urbana is positioned in central
      Ohio (not at the extreme northern edge), while Grand Rapids is in southern Michigan
      (though not at the extreme southern edge), Urbana University would be south

      Based on the general geography of US states, universities in Ohio would typically
      be south of universities in Michigan, since Ohio is south of Michigan.


      So Urbana University in Ohio should be south of Calvin University in Michigan.


      Let me verify this by thinking about the specific locations within these states.
      Urbana is in central-western Ohio. Grand Rapids is in western Michigan. Since
      Michigan is directly north of Ohio, and these cities aren''t at extreme edges
      of their states that might create exceptions, the general state relationship
      should hold.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative
      geographic positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Urbana University is located in Urbana, Ohio

      - Calvin University is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Ohio and Michigan.

      - Michigan is located north of Ohio in the United States

      - Ohio shares its northern border with Michigan (and Lake Erie)


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations within their states.

      - Urbana is in west-central Ohio

      - Grand Rapids is in western Michigan

      - Even accounting for their specific positions within their states, the state
      boundary relationship is the determining factor here


      Since Ohio is south of Michigan, and Urbana and Grand Rapids are positioned
      such that they maintain this north-south relationship, Urbana University in
      Ohio would be south of Calvin University in Michigan.

      Iowa is generally south of Wisconsin in the United States. Wisconsin borders
      the northern edge of Iowa. So generally speaking, a location in Iowa would likely

      Given the general geography of the US, Marinette, WI is definitely north of

      - Wisconsin is located north of Iowa in the United States

      - Marinette is in the northeastern part of Wisconsin, near the Michigan border

      - Des Moines is in central Iowa

      - Marinette, WI is much further north, situated in the northern part of Wisconsin
