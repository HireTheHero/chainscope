      3. **Compare latitudes**: To determine if one is south of the other, we need
      to compare their latitudes. Generally, Minnesota is at a lower latitude than
      Washington state, meaning it is more to the south.


      4. **Specific locations**: Brown College, being in Minnesota, and Central Washington

      determine the locations of both Thomas More University in Kentucky (KY) and
      Benedictine University in Illinois (IL), and then compare their geographical
      positions.


      1. **Identify the states'' general locations**: Kentucky is located in the eastern
      United States, considered part of both the Southeastern and Midwestern United
      States. Illinois is located in the Midwestern United States.


      2. **Consider the states'' relative positions**: Illinois is north of Kentucky.
      This is because Illinois is part of the northern Midwest, while Kentucky is
      more to the southeast.


      3. **Understand the concept of "south of"**: For one location to be south of
      another, it must be positioned in a way that it is closer to the Earth''s South
      Pole than the other location.


      4. **Apply this understanding to the universities**: Given that Kentucky is
      south of Illinois, any university in Kentucky would generally be south of any
      university in Illinois.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since Thomas More University is in Kentucky and Benedictine
      University is in Illinois, and considering Kentucky''s position relative to
      Illinois, Thomas More University would indeed be south of Benedictine University.

    b0860a09-33d2-4e79-b548-746ee1494114: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of both Arkansas State University (specifically, the one in Paragould,
      AR, if it exists) and Strayer University in Washington, D.C., and then compare
      their geographical positions.


      1. **Identify Arkansas State University in Paragould, AR**: First, we need to
      confirm if there is an Arkansas State University campus in Paragould, AR. Arkansas
      State University has multiple campuses, but the main ones are in Jonesboro,
      Beebe, Mountain Home, Newport, and West Memphis. After checking, it appears
      there might not be a specific campus named "Arkansas State University Paragould"
      but rather Arkansas State University has a campus in nearby Jonesboro, and there''s
      an Arkansas State University-Newport and an Arkansas State University-Beebe,
      among others. However, for simplicity, let''s consider the general location
      of Arkansas in relation to Washington, D.C.


      2. **Identify Strayer University in Washington, D.C.**: Strayer University is
      a private university with multiple locations, including Washington, D.C. Its
      location in D.C. places it in the northeastern part of the United States.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Arkansas is located in the southern United States,
      while Washington, D.C. is located in the northeastern part of the country. Generally,
      Arkansas is south of Washington, D.C.


      Given these steps, since Arkansas (and by extension, any city within it like
      Paragould or the nearest ASU campus) is south of Washington, D.C., the answer
      to whether Arkansas State University (in a location like Paragould, AR, or more
      accurately, its nearest campuses) is south of Strayer University in D.C. is:

      of Georgia (GA), and Western Colorado University is located in the state of
      Colorado (CO).


      2. **Determine the general geographical positions of the states**: Georgia is
      located in the southeastern United States, while Colorado is located in the
      western United States.


      3. **Consider the latitudinal positions**: Generally, states in the southeast
      are at a lower latitude (further south) compared to states in the west, which
      can be at a variety of latitudes depending on their specific location. However,
      Colorado is known for being a relatively northern state in the western United
      States.


      4. **Compare the specific locations**: Georgia is clearly south of Colorado
      in terms of latitude. Western Colorado University, being in western Colorado,
      would still be north of Georgia Military College due to Colorado''s overall
      position relative to Georgia.


      Based on these steps, we can conclude that Georgia Military College, GA is indeed
      located south of Western Colorado University, CO.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      is located in Houghton, Michigan. Houghton is in the western part of Michigan''s
      Upper Peninsula, also near Lake Michigan but much further north than Milwaukee.


      3. **Comparison**: To determine if Mount Mary College is south of Michigan Technological
      University, we need to consider their latitudinal positions. The Upper Peninsula
      of Michigan is significantly north of the southern parts of Wisconsin, especially
      when comparing Houghton, MI, to Milwaukee, WI.


      Given these geographical considerations, since Milwaukee, WI (where Mount Mary
      College is located), is south of Houghton, MI (where Michigan Technological
      University is located), the answer to the question is:


      YES'

      (ND).


      2. **Determine the general geographic positions of the states**: New York is

      located in the northern part of the United States, closer to the center in terms
      of east-west positioning but significantly west and somewhat north of New York.


      3. **Consider the latitudinal relationship**: Since North Dakota is generally
      north of New York, any institution in North Dakota would typically be north
      of institutions in New York.


      Given these considerations, Stony Brook University School of Medicine in New

      This is a general knowledge fact about US geography.


      3. **Specific locations within states**: Without specific city or GPS coordinates,
      we rely on general knowledge that universities are typically named after their
      nearest city or significant geographical feature. Alcorn State University is
      in Lorman, Mississippi, and Harding University is in Searcy, Arkansas. However,
      for this question, the exact city is less relevant than the state, given the
      north-south relationship between Arkansas and Mississippi.


      4. **Comparison**: Since Arkansas is north of Mississippi, any location in Arkansas
      (including Harding University) is generally north of any location in Mississippi
      (including Alcorn State University).


      Based on the steps above, the answer to whether Alcorn State University, MS
      is located south of Harding University, AR is **YES**.'

      1. **Identify the locations**: Adams State University is located in Colorado

      2. **Understand geographic positions**: Colorado is a state in the western United

      3. **Compare latitudes**: Generally, the further south a location is in the
      United States, the lower its latitude. Pennsylvania is typically at a higher
      latitude than Colorado due to its northeastern position.


      4. **Consider specific locations**: Adams State University in Colorado is relatively
      south compared to the northern states but is still much further west than Pennsylvania.
      PennWest Edinboro, being in Pennsylvania, is at a higher latitude (further north)
      than most of Colorado.


      5. **Determine relative positions**: Since Colorado is generally south and west
      of Pennsylvania, but considering the specific question of being "south," the
      critical aspect is the latitude. Pennsylvania, being north of most of the southern
      states, places PennWest Edinboro at a higher latitude than Adams State University.
