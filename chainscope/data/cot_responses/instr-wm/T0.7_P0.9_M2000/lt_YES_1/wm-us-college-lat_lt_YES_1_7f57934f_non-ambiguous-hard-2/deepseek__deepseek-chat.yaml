      the relative locations of Mount Mary College in Wisconsin and Michigan Technological
      University in Michigan.


      1. **Locate Mount Mary College, WI**: Mount Mary College is located in Milwaukee,
      Wisconsin. Milwaukee is in the southeastern part of Wisconsin, near the shores
      of Lake Michigan.


      2. **Locate Michigan Technological University, MI**: Michigan Technological

      \ by step to determine whether Howard Payne University in Texas is located south\
      \ of California State University, San Bernardino, in California.\n\n### Step\
      \ 1: Identify the Locations\n\nFirst, we need to know where these two universities\
      \ are located.\n\n- **Howard Payne University**: This is a private Baptist university\
      \ located in Brownwood, Texas.\n- **California State University, San Bernardino\
      \ (CSUSB)**: This is a public university located in San Bernardino, California.\n\
      \n### Step 2: Find the Geographic Coordinates\n\nNext, let's find the latitude\
      \ and longitude of both locations to compare their positions.\n\n- **Howard\
      \ Payne University, Brownwood, TX**:\n  - Latitude: Approximately 31.7121\xB0\
      \ N\n  - Longitude: Approximately 98.9995\xB0 W\n\n- **California State University,\

      the geographic locations of William Jessup University in California and the
      University of Northern Iowa in Iowa and compare their positions relative to
      each other.


      ### Step 1: Locate William Jessup University, CA

      William Jessup University is located in Rocklin, California. Rocklin is in Northern
      California, near Sacramento.


      ### Step 2: Locate the University of Northern Iowa, IA

      The University of Northern Iowa is located in Cedar Falls, Iowa. Cedar Falls
      is in the northeastern part of Iowa.


      ### Step 3: Compare their geographic positions

      California is west of Iowa. Rocklin, CA, is in Northern California, which is
      still relatively far north in the United States. Cedar Falls, IA, is in the
      Midwest but is located farther north than Rocklin, CA.


      ### Step 4: Determine if William Jessup University, CA is south of the University
      of Northern Iowa, IA

      Rocklin, CA, is located at a lower latitude (more south) than Cedar Falls, IA.
      Therefore, William Jessup University is indeed south of the University of Northern
      Iowa.
