      - University of Scranton is in Scranton, Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states in the US.

      - Kentucky is located in the south-central part of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes (north-south positioning).

      - Kentucky is generally south of Pennsylvania on a map

      - Specifically, Owensboro, KY is in the northern part of Kentucky

      - Scranton, PA is in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania


      Step 4: Even though Owensboro is in northern Kentucky, the entire state of Kentucky
      is south of Pennsylvania in terms of latitude.


      Therefore, Western Kentucky University-Owensboro, KY is located south of University
      of Scranton, PA.

      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) Shenandoah University is located in Winchester, Virginia (VA).

      2) Mercyhurst University is located in Erie, Pennsylvania (PA).

      3) Geographically, Virginia is located south of Pennsylvania in the United States.

      4) More specifically, Winchester, VA is in northern Virginia, but still well
      south of the Pennsylvania border.

      5) Erie, PA is in the northwestern corner of Pennsylvania, near Lake Erie.

      6) Even though Erie is in the northern part of Pennsylvania and Winchester is
      in the northern part of Virginia, any location in Virginia would still be south
      of any location in Pennsylvania due to their relative positions on the map.


      Therefore, YES, Shenandoah University (in Virginia) is located south of Mercyhurst
      University (in Pennsylvania).'

      the southeastern United States.

      - Western Colorado University is in Gunnison, Colorado, which is in the western/central
      part of the United States.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Claflin University is in Orangeburg, South Carolina (SC)

      - Capital University is in Columbus, Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a map of the United States.

      - South Carolina is located in the southeastern United States

      - Ohio is located in the midwestern/northeastern United States

      - On a north-south axis, South Carolina is positioned south of Ohio


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Since Claflin University is in South Carolina (a southern state) and Capital
      University is in Ohio (a more northern state), Claflin University would be located
      south of Capital University.


      YES, Claflin University in South Carolina is located south of Capital University
      in Ohio.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Claflin University is in South Carolina (SC)

      - Capital University is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - South Carolina is a southeastern state along the Atlantic coast

      - Ohio is a midwestern state that borders the Great Lakes region


      Step 3: Compare their relative north-south positions.

      - Ohio is significantly north of South Carolina

      - South Carolina is further south than Ohio on any map of the United States


      Step 4: Since Claflin University is in South Carolina, and Capital University
      is in Ohio, the north-south relationship between the universities follows the
      relationship between their states.


      YES, Claflin University (SC) is located south of Capital University (OH).'

      - University of Wisconsin-Waukesha is in Waukesha, Wisconsin (WI).


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a north-south axis.

      - St. Louis, Missouri is located in the eastern part of Missouri, along the

      - Waukesha, Wisconsin is located in the southeastern part of Wisconsin.

      - Wisconsin is a state that borders the northern part of Illinois, while Missouri
      is south of Illinois.

      - Therefore, Wisconsin is north of Missouri.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and Kansas.

      - Kansas is a state in the central United States.

      - Texas is a state in the south-central United States.

      - Texas is generally south of Kansas on a map.

      - Denison, Texas is in the northern part of Texas, near the Oklahoma border.

      - Even though Denison is in northern Texas, Texas itself is positioned south

      - Urbana University is located in Urbana, Ohio

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Michigan is north of Ohio

      Step 3: More specifically, Urbana, Ohio is in west-central Ohio, while Grand
      Rapids, Michigan is in western Michigan.


      Step 4: On a north-south axis, any location in Ohio would generally be south

      Let me think about this step by step:


      1) Franciscan University of Steubenville is located in Steubenville, Ohio (OH).

      2) Husson University is located in Bangor, Maine (ME).

      3) To determine which is further south, I need to compare their geographic locations.

      4) Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States.

      5) Maine is in the northeastern corner of the United States.

      6) In terms of latitude, Maine is one of the northernmost states in the continental

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions
      of these two universities.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1. Franciscan University of Steubenville is located in Steubenville, Ohio (OH).

      2. Husson University is located in Bangor, Maine (ME).

      3. In the United States, Maine is in the northeastern corner of the country.

      4. Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, significantly south of Maine.

      5. Geographically, Maine is much further north than Ohio.

      6. Therefore, any location in Ohio would be south of a location in Maine.


      Since Steubenville, Ohio is south of Bangor, Maine, Franciscan University of
      Steubenville is located south of Husson University.
