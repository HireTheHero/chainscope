      \ Northcentral University.\n- Northcentral University is located in Arizona.\
      \ Its administrative offices are in San Diego, California, but historically\
      \ and for accreditation purposes, it has been associated with Arizona, particularly\
      \ Prescott and later Scottsdale.\n\nStep 2: Identify the location of California\
      \ State University, Fresno.\n- CSU Fresno is located in Fresno, California,\
      \ in the central part of the state.\n\nStep 3: Compare the latitudes of the\
      \ two locations.\n- Fresno, CA is located at approximately 36.7\xB0 N latitude.\n\
      - Scottsdale, AZ is located at approximately 33.5\xB0 N latitude.\n\nStep 4:\
      \ Interpret the latitude comparison.\n- A lower latitude number indicates a\
      \ more southern position.\n- 33.5\xB0 N (Scottsdale) is south of 36.7\xB0 N\
