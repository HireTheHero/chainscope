      \ of:\n1. Brown College in Minnesota\n2. Central Washington University in Washington\n\
      \nLet me think about the general geography of the United States. Washington\
      \ state is in the northwestern part of the United States, bordering Canada to\
      \ the north and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Minnesota is in the upper Midwest,\
      \ also bordering Canada to the north.\n\nIn terms of latitude (north-south positioning):\n\
      - Washington state is generally located between approximately 45.5\xB0N and\

      \nFor Brown College in Minnesota, I need to determine its specific location.\
      \ I believe there might be a Brown College in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area\
      \ of Minnesota.\n\nBased on general knowledge:\n- Ellensburg, WA is approximately\
      \ at latitude 47\xB0N\n- Minneapolis, MN (assuming Brown College is there) is\
      \ approximately at latitude 45\xB0N\n\nIf Brown College is indeed in the Minneapolis\
      \ area, then it would be located south of Central Washington University, because\
      \ Minneapolis (45\xB0N) is south of Ellensburg (47\xB0N).\n\nHowever, I should\

      \ my knowledge about Brown College in Minnesota to be sure.\n\nActually, I'm\
      \ not completely certain there is a \"Brown College\" in Minnesota. There's\
      \ a well-known Brown University in Rhode Island, but I'm less familiar with\
      \ a Brown College in Minnesota. If there is indeed a Brown College in Minnesota,\
      \ I would need to know its specific location to give a definitive answer.\n\n\

      \ WA, which is at approximately latitude 47\xB0N.\n2. Minnesota extends from\
      \ about 43.5\xB0N to 49.5\xB0N latitude.\n3. If Brown College exists in Minnesota\
      \ and is in the southern part of the state (like the Twin Cities area), it would\
      \ likely be south of Central Washington University.\n4. If Brown College exists\
      \ in Minnesota and is in the northern part of the state, it might be at the\
      \ same latitude or even north of Central Washington University.\n\nWithout knowing\
      \ the exact location of Brown College in Minnesota (or confirming its existence),\
      \ I cannot give a definitive answer.\n\nUpon further reflection, I believe there\
      \ was a \"Brown College\" that was a for-profit institution in the Minneapolis\u2013\
      Saint Paul area, but it may have closed or been renamed. If it was in the Twin\
      \ Cities area, then it would indeed be south of Central Washington University.\n\
      \nGiven the information I have, and assuming Brown College was/is in the Minneapolis\u2013\
      Saint Paul area of Minnesota, the answer would be YES. But I want to emphasize\
      \ that I'm not entirely confident about the existence or current status of Brown\
      \ College in Minnesota.\n\nLet me try to be more precise:\n\n1. Central Washington\
      \ University is in Ellensburg, WA at approximately 47\xB0N latitude.\n2. The\
      \ Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area, where Brown College would likely be if it\

      \ be in Minnesota (MN).\n2. Central Washington University, WA - This is in Washington\
      \ state (WA).\n\nNow, to determine which is further south, I need to know their\
      \ approximate latitudes:\n\nMinnesota is a northern state in the US, located\
      \ in the Upper Midwest.\nWashington state is a northwestern state, bordering\
      \ Canada.\n\nGeographically, Washington state is located on the west coast,\
      \ while Minnesota is in the Midwest. But the question is about which one is\
      \ further south.\n\nWashington state extends from approximately 45.5\xB0N to\
      \ 49\xB0N latitude.\nMinnesota extends from approximately 43.5\xB0N to 49.5\xB0\
      N latitude.\n\nCentral Washington University is specifically located in Ellensburg,\
      \ Washington, which is in the central part of the state. Ellensburg is at approximately\
      \ 47.0\xB0N latitude.\n\nBrown College in Minnesota - I need to find its specific\
      \ location in Minnesota. Let me think about where Brown College might be located\
      \ in Minnesota...\n\nActually, I need to be careful here. I should make sure\
      \ Brown College is a real institution in Minnesota. I'm not immediately familiar\
      \ with a \"Brown College\" in Minnesota, but I do know there are institutions\
      \ like Brown University (in Rhode Island) and others.\n\nIf there is a Brown\
      \ College in Minnesota, I would need to know its specific location to determine\
      \ if it's south of Central Washington University.\n\nFrom my knowledge, there\
      \ was a Brown College in Minnesota, located in the Twin Cities area (Minneapolis-St.\

      \ College is indeed in the Twin Cities area at around 45\xB0N latitude, and\
      \ Central Washington University is in Ellensburg, WA at around 47\xB0N latitude,\
      \ then Brown College would be south of Central Washington University.\n\nHowever,\
      \ I should note that I'm not 100% certain about the exact location of Brown\

      \ University in Washington.\n\nLet me double-check this:\n- Central Washington\
      \ University in Ellensburg, WA: ~47\xB0N\n- Twin Cities (Minneapolis-St. Paul),\
      \ MN: ~45\xB0N\n\nSince 45\xB0N is south of 47\xB0N, if Brown College is in\
      \ the Twin Cities area, then Brown College, MN would be located south of Central\
      \ Washington University, WA.\n\nSo, my answer is YES, Brown College, MN is likely\
      \ located south of Central Washington University, WA.\n\nWait, let me be more\
      \ precise about these locations:\n\nCentral Washington University is located\
      \ in Ellensburg, Washington. Ellensburg's latitude is approximately 46.9967\xB0\
      \ N.\n\nBrown College in Minnesota was located in Mendota Heights, which is\
      \ a suburb of the Twin Cities. Mendota Heights has a latitude of approximately\
      \ 44.8858\xB0 N.\n\nSo:\n- Central Washington University: ~47.0\xB0 N\n- Brown\
      \ College, MN: ~44.9\xB0 N\n\nSince 44.9\xB0 N is south of 47.0\xB0 N, Brown\
      \ College, MN is indeed located south of Central Washington University, WA.\n\
      \nSo my final answer is YES.</think># Reasoning Step by Step\n\nTo determine\
      \ if Brown College, MN is located south of Central Washington University, WA,\

      \ University, WA.\n\nTherefore, the answer is YES, Brown College, MN is located\
      \ south of Central Washington University, WA.\n\nHowever, I should note that\
      \ Brown College in Minnesota closed in 2017. It had campuses in Mendota Heights\
      \ and Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, both of which are in the Minneapolis/St. Paul\

      \ University, WA.\n\nTo answer this, I need to determine the relative north-south\
      \ positions of these two institutions, which means comparing their latitudes.\n\
      \nFirst, let me think about the general geographical positions of Minnesota\
      \ (MN) and Washington (WA) states:\n- Minnesota is in the northern part of the\
      \ central United States, bordering Canada.\n- Washington is in the northwest\

      \ also reaching the 49th parallel.\n\nBut the question is about specific colleges\
      \ in these states, not the states themselves. Let me try to determine the specific\
      \ locations:\n\nCentral Washington University is located in Ellensburg, Washington,\
      \ which is in the central part of Washington state.\n\nFor Brown College in\
      \ Minnesota, I need to be careful because there are multiple institutions with\
      \ similar names. There's Brown University in Rhode Island, but the question\
      \ specifically mentions Brown College in Minnesota. I believe this might be\
      \ referring to Brown College (which might be a community college or technical\
      \ college) in Minnesota.\n\nLet me try to recall their specific latitudes:\n\
      \nCentral Washington University in Ellensburg, WA is approximately at latitude\
      \ 47.0\xB0 N.\n\nFor Brown College in Minnesota, I need to determine its location.\
      \ If it's in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, which is in the central-southern\
      \ part of Minnesota, it would be around latitude 45\xB0 N.\n\nIf Brown College\
      \ is indeed in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, then it would be south of Central\
      \ Washington University because 45\xB0 N is south of 47\xB0 N.\n\nHowever, I\
      \ need to be certain about the location of Brown College in Minnesota to give\
      \ a definitive answer. Let me think about this further.\n\nMinnesota as a state\
      \ extends from about 43.5\xB0 N at its southernmost point to 49\xB0 N at its\
      \ northernmost point. \n\nWashington state extends from about 45.5\xB0 N at\
      \ its southernmost point to 49\xB0 N at its northernmost point.\n\nSo, if Brown\
      \ College is in the southern part of Minnesota, it would definitely be south\
      \ of any location in Washington. If it's in the northern part of Minnesota,\
      \ it might be at a similar latitude to locations in Washington.\n\nBased on\
      \ my knowledge, I believe Brown College (if referring to a technical or community\
      \ college in Minnesota) is likely in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area,\
      \ which is in the southern half of Minnesota. This would place it south of Central\
      \ Washington University.\n\nHowever, I want to ensure I'm thinking of the correct\
      \ institution. There's Brown College in Mendota Heights, Minnesota, which is\
      \ a for-profit institution (now closed, I believe) in the Minneapolis-St. Paul\
      \ area. If this is the Brown College in question, then it would be at roughly\
      \ latitude 44.9\xB0 N.\n\nCentral Washington University in Ellensburg, WA is\
      \ at approximately latitude 47.0\xB0 N.\n\nSince 44.9\xB0 N is south of 47.0\xB0\
      \ N, Brown College in Mendota Heights, Minnesota would be south of Central Washington\
      \ University in Ellensburg, Washington.\n\nSo, my tentative answer is: YES,\
      \ Brown College, MN is located south of Central Washington University, WA.\n\
      \nBut let me double-check:\n\n- Central Washington University is in Ellensburg,\
      \ WA, which is at approximately 47.0\xB0 N latitude.\n- Brown College in Mendota\
      \ Heights, MN (assuming this is the one referred to in the question) is at approximately\
      \ 44.9\xB0 N latitude.\n\nSince 44.9\xB0 N is less than 47.0\xB0 N in terms\
      \ of latitude, and a lower latitude means a more southern location, Brown College,\
      \ MN is indeed south of Central Washington University, WA.\n\nMy answer is YES.\n\
      \nUpdate: Let me check a little more carefully. Looking at the US map:\n\nWashington\
      \ state is in the northwestern corner of the contiguous US. Minnesota is in\
      \ the north-central part of the US. Both states border Canada to the north.\n\

      \ location within Minnesota.\n\n2. Central Washington University, WA - This\
      \ is in Washington state, and the name suggests it's in the central part of\
      \ Washington.\n\nTo determine if Brown College is south of Central Washington\
      \ University, I need to compare their latitudes (north-south positions). A lower\

      - Washington state spans approximately from latitude 45.5\xB0N to 49\xB0N\n\

      \ I need to determine where exactly in Minnesota it is located. \n\nActually,\
      \ I'm not completely certain about a \"Brown College\" in Minnesota. There's\
      \ a Brown University in Rhode Island, but I'm not familiar with a Brown College\
      \ in Minnesota specifically. There was a Brown College with campuses in Minnesota,\
      \ but it might have been renamed or merged with another institution.\n\nLet\
      \ me assume there is a Brown College in Minnesota and think about its likely\
      \ location. Major cities in Minnesota include Minneapolis, St. Paul, Duluth,\
      \ etc. Minneapolis and St. Paul (the Twin Cities) are in the southeastern part\
      \ of Minnesota, around 45\xB0N latitude.\n\nIf Brown College is in the Twin\
      \ Cities area (which is a reasonable assumption for a college, as this is the\
      \ major metropolitan area in Minnesota), then it would be around 45\xB0N latitude.\n\
      \nComparing:\n- Central Washington University (Ellensburg, WA): ~47\xB0N\n-\
      \ Brown College (possibly Twin Cities, MN): ~45\xB0N\n\nIf these estimations\
      \ are correct, then Brown College in Minnesota would be south of Central Washington\
      \ University in Washington.\n\nBut let me double-check this reasoning.\n\nWait,\
      \ I need to be more precise about the locations.\n\nCentral Washington University\
      \ is definitely in Ellensburg, Washington. Ellensburg is at approximately 47.0\xB0\
      N latitude.\n\nFor Brown College in Minnesota, I need to find its specific location.\
      \ After thinking more, I believe it might be referring to Brown College (now\
      \ called Rasmussen University) which had campuses in Minnesota, including in\
      \ the Twin Cities area. The Twin Cities are at around 45\xB0N latitude.\n\n\
      So, if Brown College is indeed in the Twin Cities area or elsewhere in southern\
      \ Minnesota, it would be south of Central Washington University.\n\nActually,\
      \ let me reconsider. I need to be careful about identifying the exact institutions.\n\
      \nCentral Washington University (CWU) is a public university located in Ellensburg,\
      \ Washington. Its coordinates are approximately 47.0\xB0N, 120.5\xB0W.\n\nFor\
      \ Brown College in Minnesota, after research, I believe it's referring to what\
      \ was formerly known as Brown College, a for-profit institution with campuses\
      \ in Minnesota. It was acquired by Career Education Corporation and later became\
      \ part of Rasmussen University. Its main campus was in Mendota Heights, Minnesota,\
      \ near the Twin Cities. Mendota Heights is at approximately 44.9\xB0N, 93.1\xB0\
      W.\n\nComparing their latitudes:\n- Central Washington University: 47.0\xB0\
      N\n- Brown College (Mendota Heights, MN): 44.9\xB0N\n\nSince 44.9\xB0N is south\
      \ of 47.0\xB0N, Brown College in Minnesota is indeed south of Central Washington\
      \ University in Washington.\n\nTherefore, the answer is YES, Brown College,\
      \ MN is located south of Central Washington University, WA.\n\nActually, let\
      \ me be absolutely sure about this Brown College in Minnesota. I want to verify\
      \ that it existed and where exactly it was located.\n\nBrown College was indeed\
      \ a for-profit college with campuses in Minnesota, including in the Minneapolis-St.\
      \ Paul area. It was founded in 1946 and later became part of Rasmussen College\
      \ (now Rasmussen University).\n\nThe main campus of Brown College was in Mendota\
      \ Heights, Minnesota, which is a suburb southeast of St. Paul. Mendota Heights\
      \ is located at approximately 44.9\xB0N latitude.\n\nCentral Washington University\

      \ 44.9\xB0N (Mendota Heights, MN) is south of 47.0\xB0N (Ellensburg, WA), Brown\
      \ College in Minnesota is south of Central Washington University in Washington.\n\
      \nTherefore, the answer is YES.\n\nHmm, I'm double-checking and I'm not 100%\
      \ confident about Brown College's exact location. Let me try a different approach.\n\
      \nMinnesota is generally located east of Washington state. Minnesota's northern\
      \ border reaches the same latitude as Washington's northern border (both border\
      \ Canada at around 49\xB0N). However, Minnesota extends further south than Washington\
      \ does.\n\nWashington state's southern border is at about 45.5\xB0N, while Minnesota's\
      \ southern border goes down to about 43.5\xB0N.\n\nCentral Washington University\
      \ is in Ellensburg, which is in the central part of Washington state, not at\
      \ its southernmost point. So it's likely around 47\xB0N.\n\nNow, even if I'm\
      \ not sure about Brown College's exact location in Minnesota, if it's anywhere\
      \ in the southern half of Minnesota, it would be south of Central Washington\
      \ University.\n\nGiven the information available, I believe Brown College was\
      \ most likely in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, which is in the southeastern\
      \ part of Minnesota, around 45\xB0N latitude.\n\nTherefore, it's highly likely\
      \ that Brown College, MN is south of Central Washington University, WA.\n\n\
      So, the answer is YES.\n\nActually, let me be more methodical. I need to:\n\
      1. Confirm the exact locations of both institutions\n2. Compare their latitudes\
      \ to determine which one is further south\n\nCentral Washington University is\
      \ in Ellensburg, Washington. Ellensburg is located at approximately 47.0\xB0\
      N latitude.\n\nFor Brown College in Minnesota, I need to verify its exact location.\
      \ Brown College was a for-profit institution in Minnesota that was acquired\
      \ by Career Education Corporation and eventually became part of Rasmussen University.\
      \ It had campuses in several locations in Minnesota, including Mendota Heights\
      \ and Brooklyn Center.\n\nMendota Heights is a suburb of St. Paul, located at\
      \ approximately 44.9\xB0N latitude.\nBrooklyn Center is a suburb of Minneapolis,\
      \ located at approximately 45.1\xB0N latitude.\n\nBoth of these locations are\
      \ south of Ellensburg, Washington (47.0\xB0N).\n\nTherefore, regardless of which\
      \ campus of Brown College in Minnesota we're referring to, it would be south\
      \ of Central Washington University in Washington.\n\nSo, the answer is YES,\
      \ Brown College, MN is located south of Central Washington University, WA.\n\
      \nHold on, I need to be careful. Let me verify this again.\n\nCentral Washington\

      the question: "Is Western Kentucky University-Owensboro, KY located south of
      University of Scranton, PA?"


      To answer this, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of both universities

      2. Compare their latitudes to determine which one is further south


      Let''s start by identifying the locations:


      Western Kentucky University-Owensboro is located in Owensboro, Kentucky (KY).

      The University of Scranton is located in Scranton, Pennsylvania (PA).


      Now I need to figure out which one is further south. In the northern hemisphere,
      locations further south have lower latitude values.


      While I don''t have the exact latitude coordinates memorized for these specific
      campuses, I can reason about their general locations:


      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern United States

      - Kentucky is in the south-central United States


      Geographically, Kentucky is significantly south of Pennsylvania. Kentucky borders
      Tennessee to its south, while Pennsylvania borders New York to its north.


      Owensboro is a city in Kentucky, which would maintain this same north-south
      relationship with Scranton, Pennsylvania.


      So based on the general geographic knowledge of US states, Western Kentucky
      University-Owensboro, KY would be located south of the University of Scranton,
      PA.


      The answer is YES, Western Kentucky University-Owensboro, KY is located south
      of University of Scranton, PA.</think># Is Western Kentucky University-Owensboro,
      KY located south of University of Scranton, PA?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two universities
      by comparing their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Western Kentucky University-Owensboro is in Owensboro, Kentucky (KY)

      - University of Scranton is in Scranton, Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Compare the geographic positions of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States

      - Kentucky is located in the south-central United States

      - Kentucky is significantly south of Pennsylvania on a map


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      - Scranton is in northeastern Pennsylvania

      - Owensboro is in western Kentucky

      - The north-south relationship remains consistent at the city level


      Given that Kentucky is geographically south of Pennsylvania, and this relationship
      holds for the specific cities where these universities are located, I can determine
      that Western Kentucky University-Owensboro is indeed south of the University
      of Scranton.

      - Kennesaw State University College of Arts is in Georgia (GA), which is a state\

      \ a lower latitude means a more southern location. Since Georgia is in the southern\
      \ United States and New Jersey is in the northern United States, Georgia has\
      \ a lower latitude than New Jersey.\n\nMore specifically:\n- Kennesaw, Georgia\

      \ in New Jersey, Kennesaw State University College of Arts, GA is indeed located\
      \ south of Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination, NJ.\n\nWait, let me\
      \ verify this more precisely. The Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination\
      \ is likely at Princeton University, since that's where such an institute exists.\
      \ Princeton, NJ is at approximately 40.3\xB0 N latitude. Kennesaw, GA is at\
      \ approximately 34.0\xB0 N latitude. Since 34.0\xB0 N is lower than 40.3\xB0\

      \nFor Mildred Elley, NY:\nMildred Elley is a college in New York. I believe\

      \ DE is in the northern part of Delaware\n\nBased on general geography, Delaware\

      \ Widener University is indeed in Delaware (Wilmington) and Mildred Elley is\

      \ School is indeed in Wilmington, Delaware.\nMildred Elley has campuses in Albany\
      \ and NYC, New York.\n\nSince Delaware is south of New York state, and specifically,\
      \ Wilmington, DE is south of both Albany and NYC, the answer remains YES.\n\n\
      However, if the question is referring to Widener University's main campus, which\
      \ is in Chester, Pennsylvania, we would need to compare that location. Chester,\
      \ PA is at approximately 39.8\xB0 N latitude, which is still south of both Albany\
      \ and NYC.\n\nSo regardless of which campus of Widener University the question\
      \ is referring to (though it specified Delaware), the answer would be YES, it\
      \ is south of Mildred Elley in New York.\n\nActually I'm second guessing myself.\
      \ I think there's a chance that there is a Widener University in Delaware that\
      \ is not the Delaware Law School. Let me think about this carefully. If Widener\
      \ University Delaware is not the law school, then it could be a different campus\
      \ in Delaware.\n\nLet me work this out again. Widener University has its main\
      \ campus in Chester, Pennsylvania. It also has a law school campus in Wilmington,\
      \ Delaware, known as Delaware Law School (or Widener University Delaware Law\
      \ School). So when the question refers to \"Widener University, DE,\" it's likely\
      \ referring to the Delaware Law School campus in Wilmington.\n\nNow, Mildred\
      \ Elley is a career college with campuses in Albany, NY and NYC. Both Albany\
      \ and NYC are north of Wilmington, DE.\n\nSo, if \"Widener University, DE\"\
      \ refers to the Delaware Law School in Wilmington, then yes, it is south of\
      \ Mildred Elley in New York (whether we're considering the Albany or NYC campus).\n\
      \nActually, let me first verify that we do have a Widener University, Delaware.\
      \ Since the question says \"Widener University, DE\" this could stand for Delaware,\

      \nSo when the question refers to \"Widener University, DE,\" it is most likely\

      \ the question: Is Widener University, DE located south of Mildred Elley, NY?\n\
      \nIn geographical terms, Delaware is south of New York. Specifically, Wilmington,\
      \ Delaware (where the Delaware Law School campus is located) is south of both\
      \ Albany and New York City (where Mildred Elley campuses are located).\n\nTherefore,\
      \ the answer is YES, Widener University, DE (referring to the law school campus\
      \ in Wilmington, Delaware) is located south of Mildred Elley, NY (whether referring\
      \ to the Albany or NYC campus).\n\nLet's try one more time.\n\nFirst let's pinpoint\
      \ where Widener University, DE is located. I believe I've been correct in identifying\
      \ that the reference is likely to the Widener University School of Law in Wilmington,\
      \ Delaware. There isn't a separate \"Widener University, DE\" distinct from\
      \ the law school in Delaware. The main Widener University campus is in Chester,\
      \ Pennsylvania.\n\nNow, let's pinpoint where Mildred Elley, NY is located. Mildred\
      \ Elley has campuses in Albany, NY and New York City, NY.\n\nNow, to determine\
      \ if one is south of the other, I need to compare their latitudes:\n\nWilmington,\
      \ DE (location of Widener University School of Law) is approximately at 39.7\xB0\
      \ N latitude.\nAlbany, NY (one location of Mildred Elley) is approximately at\
      \ 42.6\xB0 N latitude.\nNew York City, NY (another location of Mildred Elley)\
      \ is approximately at 40.7\xB0 N latitude.\n\nSince a lower latitude indicates\
      \ a more southern location, and 39.7\xB0 is lower than both 42.6\xB0 and 40.7\xB0\
      , Wilmington, DE (Widener University School of Law) is south of both Albany,\
      \ NY and New York City, NY (Mildred Elley locations).\n\nTherefore, Widener\
      \ University, DE (referring to the law school in Wilmington, Delaware) is indeed\
      \ located south of Mildred Elley, NY (whether referring to the Albany or NYC\
      \ campus).\n\nSo, the answer to the question \"Is Widener University, DE located\
      \ south of Mildred Elley, NY?\" is YES.\n\nActually, I think I've been overthinking\
      \ this. Let's simplify:\n\n1. Widener University has a campus in Delaware, specifically\
      \ in Wilmington.\n2. Mildred Elley has campuses in New York, specifically in\
      \ Albany and New York City.\n3. Delaware is a state located south of New York\
      \ state on the U.S. east coast.\n4. Wilmington, Delaware is south of both Albany,\

      \nAndrews University is located in Berrien Springs, Michigan. Michigan is generally\
      \ east and somewhat south of Wisconsin.\n\nNortheast Wisconsin Technical College,\
      \ as the name suggests, is in northeast Wisconsin. Green Bay is a major city\
      \ in northeast Wisconsin, and I believe Northeast Wisconsin Technical College\
      \ has a campus in Green Bay.\n\nNow, to determine if one is south of the other,\
      \ I need to compare their latitudes:\n\n- Green Bay, Wisconsin (where Northeast\
      \ Wisconsin Technical College likely has its main campus) is at approximately\
      \ 44.5\xB0 N latitude.\n- Berrien Springs, Michigan (where Andrews University\
      \ is located) is in the southwestern part of Michigan, near the Indiana border,\
      \ at approximately 41.9\xB0 N latitude.\n\nSince a lower number of degrees North\
      \ latitude means further south, 41.9\xB0 N (Andrews University) is south of\
      \ 44.5\xB0 N (Northeast Wisconsin Technical College).\n\nSo yes, Andrews University\
      \ in Michigan is located south of Northeast Wisconsin Technical College in Wisconsin.\n\
      \nActually, let me double-check these locations to be sure:\n\nAndrews University\
      \ is definitely in Berrien Springs, Michigan, which is in the southwestern part\
      \ of Michigan.\n\nNortheast Wisconsin Technical College has its main campus\
      \ in Green Bay, Wisconsin, which is in the northeastern part of Wisconsin.\n\
      \nLooking at a map, Green Bay is further north than Berrien Springs. Wisconsin\
      \ extends further north than Michigan's Lower Peninsula, and Green Bay is in\
      \ the northern part of Wisconsin, while Berrien Springs is near the southern\
      \ border of Michigan.\n\nSo my conclusion remains the same: Andrews University\
      \ (MI) is located south of Northeast Wisconsin Technical College (WI).\n\nTherefore,\
      \ the answer is YES.</think># Determining if Andrews University (MI) is south\

      College (GMC) in Georgia is located south of Western Colorado University (WCU)
      in Colorado, I need to think about their geographic positions.


      Let me reason through this:


      1. Georgia Military College is located in Georgia (GA), which is a state in
      the southeastern United States.

      2. Western Colorado University is located in Colorado (CO), which is a state
      in the western/mountain region of the United States.


      If I think about the general geographic layout of the United States:

      - Georgia is located in the deep southeast of the country

      - Colorado is located in the west/mountain region, roughly in the middle of
      the country when looking at north-south positioning


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - Georgia is generally further south than Colorado

      - Georgia is one of the southernmost states in the continental US, while Colorado
      is more in the middle latitudinally


      To be more specific, Georgia Military College is located in Milledgeville, Georgia,
      which is in the central part of Georgia. Western Colorado University is in Gunnison,
      Colorado, which is in the western part of Colorado.


      Given that Georgia is substantially farther south than Colorado, Georgia Military
      College is almost certainly south of Western Colorado University.


      Therefore, the answer should be YES - Georgia Military College is located south
      of Western Colorado University.</think># Determining if Georgia Military College

      College (GMC) in Georgia is located south of Western Colorado University (WCU)
      in Colorado, I need to find the approximate latitude of each institution.


      First, let me recall basic US geography:

      - Georgia is a state in the southeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean.

      - Colorado is a state in the western/Rocky Mountain region of the United States.


      Generally speaking, states in the southern US (like Georgia) are at lower latitudes
      than states in the northern/central US (like Colorado). So my initial expectation
      is that Georgia Military College would be south of Western Colorado University.


      Let me be more specific:


      1. Georgia Military College is located in Milledgeville, Georgia.

      2. Western Colorado University is located in Gunnison, Colorado.


      While I don''t have the exact coordinates, I know that:

      - Georgia is roughly between 30-35 degrees North latitude

      - Colorado is roughly between 37-41 degrees North latitude


      Since Georgia is at a lower latitude than Colorado, and Georgia Military College
      is in Georgia while Western Colorado University is in Colorado, it is almost
      certain that Georgia Military College is located south of Western Colorado University.


      A place with a lower latitude is further south than a place with a higher latitude.
      Since Georgia has a lower latitude than Colorado, Georgia Military College is
      south of Western Colorado University.


      So my answer is YES, Georgia Military College is located south of Western Colorado
      University.</think># Determining if Georgia Military College is south of Western

      - Western Colorado University is in Gunnison, Colorado


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography

      - Georgia is a southeastern state, situated near the Atlantic coast

      - Colorado is in the Rocky Mountain region in the western/central United States


      ## Step 3: Compare latitudes

      - Georgia generally lies between approximately 30-35 degrees North latitude

      - Colorado generally lies between approximately 37-41 degrees North latitude

      - Lower latitude numbers indicate locations further south


      ## Step 4: Draw conclusion

      Since Georgia is at a lower latitude than Colorado, and these institutions are
      within their respective states, Georgia Military College is south of Western
      Colorado University.

      Mount Mary College in Wisconsin (WI) is located south of Michigan Technological
      University in Michigan (MI). I''ll solve this step by step by figuring out where
      each institution is located.


      Step 1: Determine the location of Mount Mary College in Wisconsin.

      Mount Mary College (now known as Mount Mary University) is located in Milwaukee,
      Wisconsin.


      Step 2: Determine the location of Michigan Technological University in Michigan.

      Michigan Technological University is located in Houghton, Michigan, which is
      in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions north-south.

      Wisconsin is generally south of Michigan''s Upper Peninsula. Let''s be more
      specific:

      - Milwaukee, Wisconsin is in the southeastern part of Wisconsin, located along
      Lake Michigan.

      - Houghton, Michigan is in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, near the northernmost
      part of the state.


      The Upper Peninsula of Michigan is north of Wisconsin. Since Houghton is in
      the Upper Peninsula, and Milwaukee is in southeastern Wisconsin, Mount Mary
      College in Milwaukee would be south of Michigan Technological University in
      Houghton.


      Therefore, the answer is YES, Mount Mary College in Wisconsin is located south
      of Michigan Technological University in Michigan.</think># Is Mount Mary College,
      WI located south of Michigan Technological University, MI?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic locations of both
      institutions and compare them on a north-south axis.


      Step 1: Locate Mount Mary College (now Mount Mary University)

      Mount Mary is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the southeastern part of the
      state.


      Step 2: Locate Michigan Technological University

      Michigan Tech is located in Houghton, Michigan, which is in Michigan''s Upper
      Peninsula.


      Step 3: Compare their positions

      Michigan''s Upper Peninsula is the northernmost part of Michigan, extending
      above Wisconsin''s northern border. Houghton is situated in this northern region,
      while Milwaukee is located much further south in Wisconsin.


      YES, Mount Mary College in Wisconsin is located south of Michigan Technological

      \nTexas is generally to the west of Alabama. Texas extends quite far south,\
      \ with parts of it being among the southernmost points in the continental US.\

      \ Texas Tech's main campus is in Lubbock, TX, and I'm not immediately certain\
      \ if they have a campus in Fredericksburg.\n\nI believe the main campus of Texas\
      \ Tech is in Lubbock, Texas, which is in the northern part of Texas, not in\
      \ Fredericksburg which is in central Texas. Lubbock, TX is at approximately\
      \ latitude 33.6\xB0 N, which is actually north of Selma, AL at 32.4\xB0 N.\n\
      \nHowever, the question specifically mentions \"Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg,\
      \ TX\". If such a campus exists (which I need to verify), it would be in Fredericksburg,\
      \ TX, which is indeed south of Selma, AL.\n\nLet me reconsider this carefully.\n\
      \nUpon reflection, I don't believe Texas Tech University has a major campus\
      \ in Fredericksburg, TX. Texas Tech's main campus is in Lubbock, TX, and it\
      \ has some satellite locations, but I'm not immediately aware of one in Fredericksburg.\n\
      \nThere might be some form of Texas Tech presence in Fredericksburg, such as\

      \ of their well-known campuses.\n\nIf we're referring to any Texas Tech facility\
      \ in Fredericksburg, TX, then it would be at approximately latitude 30.3\xB0\
      \ N, which is south of Selma, AL at approximately 32.4\xB0 N.\n\nIf we're referring\
      \ to Texas Tech's main campus in Lubbock, TX, then it would be at approximately\
      \ latitude 33.6\xB0 N, which is north of Selma, AL.\n\nSince the question specifically\
      \ mentions \"Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX,\" I should assume\
      \ it's asking about a Texas Tech facility in Fredericksburg, whether it's a\
      \ full campus or some other type of university presence.\n\nSo, to directly\
      \ answer the question:\n\nIs Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX located\

      \ I'm not aware of a Texas Tech University campus or facility specifically in\

      \ that if there were a Texas Tech facility in Fredericksburg, TX, it would be\
      \ at the same latitude as Fredericksburg, which is south of Selma, AL.\n\nHowever,\
      \ to be completely accurate, I should note that I'm not certain that \"Texas\
      \ Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX\" exists as described.\n\nActually,\
      \ I think I'm being too cautious. Let me just directly compare the latitudes\
      \ of the two cities:\n\n- Fredericksburg, TX: approximately 30.3\xB0 N\n- Selma,\
      \ AL: approximately 32.4\xB0 N\n\nSince 30.3\xB0 N is less than 32.4\xB0 N,\
      \ Fredericksburg is south of Selma.\n\nTherefore, if there is a Texas Tech University\
      \ facility in Fredericksburg, TX, it would be located south of Selma University,\
      \ AL.\n\nThe answer is YES.\n\nLet me double-check these coordinates more precisely.\n\
      \nFredericksburg, TX is at latitude approximately 30.27\xB0 N.\nSelma, AL is\
      \ at latitude approximately 32.41\xB0 N.\n\nThe exact numbers confirm that Fredericksburg,\
      \ TX is indeed south of Selma, AL, since 30.27\xB0 N is less than 32.41\xB0\
      \ N.\n\nTherefore, if there is a Texas Tech University facility in Fredericksburg,\
      \ TX, it would be located south of Selma University, AL.\n\nSo the answer is\
      \ YES.\n\nActually, let me do one more real sanity check. When I visualize the\
      \ map of the United States, Texas is generally to the southwest of Alabama.\
      \ So Texas cities are typically west and often south of Alabama cities. Fredericksburg\
      \ is in central Texas, which is still generally south of most of Alabama.\n\n\

      \ 33.4\xB0 N latitude.\nWaynesburg, PA is at approximately 39.9\xB0 N latitude.\n\
      \nSince 33.4\xB0 N is less than 39.9\xB0 N, Phoenix (and thus National Paralegal\

      Methodist University in Missouri is located south of Bryant University in Rhode
      Island. Let me think about this step by step by finding the approximate locations
      of both universities.


      Step 1: Let me think about the states these universities are in.

      - Central Methodist University is in Missouri (MO)

      - Bryant University is in Rhode Island (RI)


      Step 2: Let me think about the general geographical locations of these states.

      - Missouri is located in the Midwest/central region of the United States

      - Rhode Island is located in the Northeast region of the United States, specifically
      in New England


      Step 3: When considering north-south positioning in the United States:

      - Northern states tend to be closer to the Canadian border

      - Southern states tend to be closer to the Gulf of Mexico or Mexico border


      Step 4: Looking at the relative positions:

      - Rhode Island is quite far north, located in the northeastern corner of the
      United States

      - Missouri is more centrally located in the country, and while not a "southern"
      state, it is definitely south of the northeastern states


      Given this general knowledge of US geography, Missouri is south of Rhode Island.
      Therefore, Central Methodist University in Missouri would be south of Bryant
      University in Rhode Island.


      To be even more precise, I can think about the approximate latitudes:

      - Rhode Island is roughly around 41-42 degrees North latitude

      - Missouri spans approximately from 36 to 40 degrees North latitude


      This further confirms that Missouri is, on average, south of Rhode Island.

      - Rhode Island is located in the Northeast region of the United States (New
      England)

      - Missouri is located in the Midwest/central region of the United States


      ## Step 3: Compare north-south positioning

      - Rhode Island is positioned far north, in the northeastern corner of the US

      - Missouri is more centrally located and is south of the northeastern states

      - In terms of latitude, Rhode Island is approximately 41-42 degrees North

      - Missouri spans roughly 36-40 degrees North


      Since Missouri is south of Rhode Island on a north-south axis, Central Methodist
      University in MO is located south of Bryant University in RI.

      \ Polytechnic University, Humboldt is in California (CA), specifically in Humboldt\
      \ County, which is in the northern part of California.\n2. The Institute for\
      \ Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts is in Maine (ME), which is in the northeastern\
      \ United States.\n\nNow, to determine which is further north or south, I need\
      \ to think about the general geography of the United States:\n\n- Maine (ME)\
      \ is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous United States, located\
      \ in the Northeast.\n- California (CA) is on the West Coast, extending from\
      \ north to south.\n\nTo be more specific:\n- Maine is approximately between\
      \ 43\xB0N and 47\xB0N latitude.\n- Northern California (where Humboldt is located)\
      \ is approximately around 40\xB0N to 42\xB0N latitude.\n\nGiven these latitudes,\
      \ Maine is generally north of even the northern parts of California. Therefore,\
      \ California State Polytechnic University in Humboldt, CA would be south of\
      \ the Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts in Maine.\n\nJust to\
      \ be extra sure, let me consider the specific locations within these states:\n\
      \nHumboldt, CA is in the far northern part of California, but California as\
      \ a whole is still south of Maine. Even the northernmost part of California\

      \ would be in the southern part of Maine. But even southern Maine is still north\
      \ of northern California in terms of latitude.\n\nSo, California State Polytechnic\
      \ University, Humboldt, CA is located south of the Institute for Doctoral Studies\
      \ in the Visual Arts, ME.\n\nThe answer is YES.\n\nActually, let me double-check\
      \ this. I need to be careful about the phrasing of the question.\n\nThe question\
      \ asks: \"Is California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, CA located south\

      \nBased on my analysis above, California State Polytechnic University in Humboldt,\
      \ CA is south of the Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts in ME.\
      \ So, the answer is YES.\n\nActually, I'm second-guessing myself now, so let\
      \ me carefully think about the geography again. \n\nThe mainland United States\
      \ extends from approximately 25\xB0N to 49\xB0N latitude. \n\nMaine is one of\
      \ the northernmost states in the contiguous United States, located in the Northeast.\
      \ Its southern border is at about 43\xB0N latitude, and its northern border\
      \ reaches close to 47\xB0N.\n\nCalifornia extends from about 32.5\xB0N to 42\xB0\
      N latitude. Humboldt County, where California State Polytechnic University,\
      \ Humboldt is located, is in the northernmost part of California, so it's close\
      \ to 42\xB0N latitude.\n\nGiven these latitudinal positions, Maine is generally\
      \ north of California, including the northern parts of California like Humboldt\
      \ County.\n\nSo, if we're asking whether California State Polytechnic University,\
      \ Humboldt (around 42\xB0N) is south of the Institute for Doctoral Studies in\
      \ the Visual Arts in ME (between 43\xB0N and 47\xB0N), the answer is YES.\n\n\
      Let me remind myself of the directional conventions on a map: \n- North is up\n\
      - South is down\n- East is right\n- West is left\n\nSo, if Point A is south\
      \ of Point B, it means Point A is below (or at a lower latitude than) Point\
      \ B.\n\nIn our case, California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt is at\
      \ a lower latitude (around 42\xB0N) than the Institute for Doctoral Studies\
      \ in the Visual Arts in ME (between 43\xB0N and 47\xB0N). So, the California\
      \ institution is south of the Maine institution.\n\nTherefore, the answer to\
      \ the question \"Is California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, CA located\
      \ south of Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts, ME?\" is YES.\n\
      \nBut let me yet again confirm the cities they are in to be sure.\n\nOK so California\
      \ State Polytechnic University, Humboldt (formerly known as Humboldt State University)\
      \ is in Arcata, California. Arcata is a city located in Humboldt County in the\
      \ northwestern part of California, along the coast of the Pacific Ocean. It's\
      \ near Eureka, California. Its latitude is approximately 40.9\xB0N.\n\nThe Institute\

      Therefore, California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, located in Arcata,\

      likely in the town of Indiana, Pennsylvania (not to be confused with the state
      of Indiana). Pennsylvania is in the northeastern United States.


      In the United States, states that are more northern have higher latitudes, and
      states that are more southern have lower latitudes. So I need to determine whether
      North Carolina is south of Pennsylvania.


      Geographically, Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina. Looking at a mental
      map of the US:

      - Pennsylvania borders New York to the south and is above Maryland

      - North Carolina is further south, below Virginia, which is below Maryland


      So in terms of north-south positioning:

      Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina.


      Therefore, Wilmington, NC (where UNC Wilmington is located) is south of Indiana,
      PA (where Indiana University of Pennsylvania is located).


      The answer is YES, UNC Wilmington is located south of Indiana University of
      Pennsylvania.</think># Is University of North Carolina Wilmington, NC located
      south of Indiana University of Pennsylvania, PA?


      To answer this question, I need to compare the geographic locations of these
      two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of North Carolina Wilmington is in Wilmington, North Carolina

      - Indiana University of Pennsylvania is in Indiana, Pennsylvania (a town in
      Pennsylvania, not the state of Indiana)


      Step 2: Compare the north-south positions of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern United States

      - On a map of the United States, Pennsylvania is clearly north of North Carolina


      Step 3: Since Wilmington is in North Carolina (a southern state) and Indiana
      is in Pennsylvania (a northern state), Wilmington must be south of Indiana,
      PA.


      YES, University of North Carolina Wilmington is located south of Indiana University
      of Pennsylvania.'

      - New Hampshire generally lies north of Pennsylvania

      - Even accounting for specific locations within each state, any location in
      Pennsylvania would be south of most locations in New Hampshire due to the states''
      relative positions

      Alcorn State University is located in Lorman, Mississippi, which is in the southwestern
      part of Mississippi.


      Harding University is located in Searcy, Arkansas, which is in the central part
      of Arkansas.


      Given the general geography of the United States, with Arkansas being north
      of Mississippi, and considering the specific locations of these universities
      within their respective states, it is very likely that Alcorn State University
      is south of Harding University.


      Let me double-check the relative positions:

      - Arkansas is directly north of Mississippi on a US map

      - Searcy, AR (Harding University) is in central Arkansas

      - Lorman, MS (Alcorn State University) is in southwestern Mississippi


      This confirms that Alcorn State University, MS is indeed south of Harding University,

      \ the relative positions of Mississippi and Arkansas. These are neighboring\
      \ states in the southern United States. Arkansas is directly north of Louisiana,\
      \ while Mississippi is east of Louisiana and south of Tennessee. Arkansas is\
      \ generally west of Mississippi, though they don't share a long border - they\
      \ may only touch at the Mississippi River.\n\nAlcorn State University is in\
      \ Mississippi (MS). Let me think about where in Mississippi it might be located.\
      \ I'm not sure of the exact location, but Mississippi is a southern state.\n\
      \nHarding University is in Arkansas (AR). Again, I'm not sure of the exact location\
      \ within Arkansas.\n\nTo determine which university is farther south, I need\
      \ to know their specific locations. Since I don't have the ability to look up\
      \ this information directly, I'll try to reason about it based on my knowledge.\n\
      \nMississippi generally extends farther south than Arkansas, as Arkansas's southern\
      \ border is with Louisiana, while Mississippi's southern border reaches the\
      \ Gulf of Mexico. So if Alcorn State is in the southern part of Mississippi,\
      \ it's likely to be south of Harding University in Arkansas.\n\nBut I need to\
      \ be careful because the specific locations within each state are what matter.\
      \ Alcorn State could be in northern Mississippi, and Harding could be in southern\
      \ Arkansas, which would make their relative north-south positioning less clear.\n\
      \nActually, let me think about what I know about these universities. Alcorn\
      \ State University is a historically black university located in rural Mississippi.\
      \ I believe it's in southwestern Mississippi, in a town called Lorman. Harding\
      \ University, on the other hand, is in Searcy, Arkansas, which I believe is\
      \ in central Arkansas.\n\nGiven that Mississippi extends farther south than\
      \ Arkansas, and Alcorn State is in southwestern Mississippi, while Harding is\
      \ in central Arkansas, it's very likely that Alcorn State is south of Harding\
      \ University.\n\nLet me double-check this reasoning:\n- Arkansas is north of\
      \ Louisiana, while Mississippi is east of Louisiana and south of Tennessee.\n\
      - Alcorn State is in southwestern Mississippi (Lorman).\n- Harding University\
      \ is in central Arkansas (Searcy).\n\nBased on the general geography of these\
      \ states, and the specific locations of these universities within their states,\
      \ I can conclude that Alcorn State University, MS is located south of Harding\
      \ University, AR.\n\nHmm, I'm still not 100% certain, since I don't have the\
      \ exact coordinates. Let me think about it differently.\n\nThe southernmost\
      \ point of Arkansas is at about 33 degrees N latitude, where it borders Louisiana.\
      \ The northernmost point of Mississippi is at about 35 degrees N latitude, where\
      \ it borders Tennessee.\n\nIf Harding University is in central Arkansas, it's\
      \ likely to be around 35-36 degrees N latitude. If Alcorn State is in southwestern\
      \ Mississippi, it's likely to be around a similar latitude or farther south.\n\
      \nActually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The key fact is that Alcorn State\
      \ is in southwestern Mississippi, which is definitely south of central Arkansas.\
      \ So Alcorn State University, MS is located south of Harding University, AR.\n\
      \nActually, wait, let me make sure I have the locations right.\n\nAlcorn State\
      \ University is in Lorman, Mississippi, which is in southwestern Mississippi,\
      \ close to the Mississippi River. \n\nHarding University is in Searcy, Arkansas,\
      \ which is in central Arkansas.\n\nCentral Arkansas is roughly at the same latitude\
      \ as central Mississippi. But southwestern Mississippi is farther south than\
      \ central Arkansas. Therefore, Alcorn State University (in southwestern Mississippi)\
      \ is south of Harding University (in central Arkansas).\n\nSo, YES, Alcorn State\
      \ University, MS is located south of Harding University, AR.\n\nActually, I\
      \ realize that I've been making some assertions about the locations that I'm\
      \ not 100% sure about. Let me think more carefully about what I know.\n\nSearcy,\
      \ Arkansas (where Harding University is located) is in the central part of Arkansas,\
      \ somewhat to the northeast of Little Rock (the capital). The latitude of Searcy\
      \ is approximately 35.2 degrees N.\n\nLorman, Mississippi (where Alcorn State\
      \ University is located) is in southwestern Mississippi, not far from the Mississippi\
      \ River. The latitude of Lorman is approximately 31.9 degrees N.\n\nSince a\
      \ lower latitude means farther south, and 31.9 degrees N (Lorman, MS) is less\
      \ than 35.2 degrees N (Searcy, AR), Alcorn State University is indeed south\
      \ of Harding University.\n\nSo, YES, Alcorn State University, MS is located\
      \ south of Harding University, AR.\n\nBut wait, I'm not positive about these\
      \ latitudes. Let me reason through this one more time, carefully.\n\nArkansas\
      \ sits north of Louisiana and South of Missouri. Mississippi sits east of Louisiana\
      \ and Arkansas, and south of Tennessee.\n\nSearcy, AR (Harding University) is\
      \ in the central part of Arkansas, which means it's roughly at the same latitude\
      \ as central Mississippi. But Lorman, MS (Alcorn State University) is in southwestern\
      \ Mississippi, which is farther south than central Mississippi.\n\nSo Lorman,\
      \ MS is farther south than Searcy, AR, which means Alcorn State University is\
      \ south of Harding University.\n\nTherefore, the answer is YES.\n\nActually,\
      \ looking more carefully, I realize I haven't been precise enough.\n\nIn terms\
      \ of latitude:\n- Searcy, Arkansas (Harding University) is located at approximately\
      \ 35.25\xB0N latitude.\n- Lorman, Mississippi (Alcorn State University) is located\
      \ at approximately 31.85\xB0N latitude.\n\nSince 31.85\xB0N is less than 35.25\xB0\
      N, and lower latitudes are farther south, it is clear that Alcorn State University\
      \ is south of Harding University.\n\nSo the answer is YES, Alcorn State University,\

      Capital University is located in Columbus, Ohio, which is in the central part
      of Ohio.

      Claflin University is located in Orangeburg, South Carolina, which is in the
      central part of South Carolina.


      Given that South Carolina as a whole is south of Ohio, and these universities
      are not in unusual border locations that might change their relative north-south
      positioning, I can confirm that Claflin University in South Carolina is indeed
      south of Capital University in Ohio.</think># Determining if Claflin University,
      SC is south of Capital University, OH


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Claflin University is in South Carolina (SC)

      - Capital University is in Ohio (OH)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between the states

      - Ohio is a Midwestern state

      - South Carolina is a Southeastern state

      - Looking at a US map, South Carolina is positioned significantly south of Ohio


      ## Step 3: Verify specific locations

      - Claflin University is in Orangeburg, South Carolina

      - Capital University is in Columbus, Ohio

      - Both cities are in relatively central locations within their respective states


      Since South Carolina is entirely south of Ohio on the map of the United States,
      and these universities are in standard locations within their states, Claflin
      University must be south of Capital University.

      \nLet me think about the locations of Texas and Arkansas first. In general,\
      \ Texas is south of Arkansas. Texas borders the bottom (southern) part of Arkansas.\
      \ So a university in Texas is likely to be south of a university in Arkansas,\
      \ but I need to be more precise since we need to consider the specific locations\
      \ of these universities within their states.\n\nOur Lady of the Lake University\
      \ is in Texas (TX). Let me recall where it's located within Texas. Our Lady\
      \ of the Lake University is located in San Antonio, Texas, which is in the south-central\
      \ part of Texas.\n\nUniversity of Arkansas at Monticello is in Arkansas (AR).\
      \ Monticello is located in the southeastern part of Arkansas.\n\nNow, let's\
      \ think about the geographic relation. San Antonio, TX is definitely south of\
      \ any point in Arkansas because all of Texas is south of all of Arkansas (with\
      \ Texas being directly below Arkansas). Even though Monticello is in the southeastern\
      \ part of Arkansas, which is the southern part of the state, it's still going\
      \ to be north of San Antonio, TX.\n\nSo, Our Lady of the Lake University in\
      \ San Antonio, TX is south of University of Arkansas at Monticello, AR.\n\n\
      However, let me double check this. Looking at the relative positions more carefully:\n\
      \nTexas's northern border is at approximately 36.5\xB0 N latitude.\nArkansas's\
      \ southern border is at approximately 33\xB0 N latitude.\n\nGiven that San Antonio\
      \ is well within Texas (not near the northern border), it's definitely south\
      \ of the Texas-Arkansas border. And since Monticello is within Arkansas (not\
      \ exactly at the southern border), it's north of the Texas-Arkansas border.\n\
      \nTherefore, Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio, TX is indeed south\
      \ of University of Arkansas at Monticello, AR.\n\nWait, let me check my geography\
      \ again. I'm not completely confident in my description of the Texas-Arkansas\
      \ border. \n\nArkansas is directly north of Louisiana, and Texas is to the west\
      \ of Louisiana. So Texas is not directly below Arkansas; rather, it's southwest\
      \ of Arkansas.\n\nHowever, the key question is still about the north-south relationship,\
      \ not the east-west. Let me be more precise about the latitudes.\n\nSan Antonio,\
      \ TX is at about 29.4\xB0 N latitude.\nMonticello, AR is at about 33.6\xB0 N\
      \ latitude.\n\nSince 29.4\xB0 is less than 33.6\xB0, and latitude decreases\
      \ as you go south, San Antonio is indeed south of Monticello.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio, TX is south of University\
      \ of Arkansas at Monticello, AR.\n\nThe answer is YES.\n\nActually, I need to\
      \ be even more careful here. Let me verify the exact locations:\n\nOur Lady\
      \ of the Lake University is in San Antonio, Texas, which is at approximately\
      \ 29.4\xB0 N latitude.\nUniversity of Arkansas at Monticello is in Monticello,\
      \ Arkansas, which is at approximately 33.6\xB0 N latitude.\n\nSince a lower\
      \ latitude number means further south, and 29.4\xB0 is less than 33.6\xB0, Our\

      Lake Michigan College is likely located near Lake Michigan in Michigan state.\

      First, let me identify where these two colleges are located:\n\n1. Lake Michigan\
      \ College - This is in Michigan (MI), and based on my knowledge, it's located\
      \ in Benton Harbor, Michigan, which is in the southwestern part of Michigan\

      \nRiver Falls, Wisconsin (where University of Wisconsin\u2013River Falls is)\

      \ University of Wisconsin\u2013River Falls in River Falls, Wisconsin (44.9\xB0\

      \ south of Wisconsin's northern regions, and Benton Harbor is in the southern\
      \ part of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. River Falls is not in the extreme northern\
      \ part of Wisconsin, but it's still in the northern half of the United States.\n\

      \ Falls, WI, which is in western Wisconsin near the Minnesota border, not far\
      \ from Minneapolis-Saint Paul. This puts it at approximately 44.9\xB0 N latitude.\n\
      \nSince 42.1\xB0 N is south of 44.9\xB0 N, Lake Michigan College is south of\
      \ University of Wisconsin\u2013River Falls.\n\nSo my answer is YES, Lake Michigan\

      to determine whether Grayson College, which is in Texas (TX), is located south
      of Washburn University, which is in Kansas (KS).


      Step 1: Let me determine the locations of both institutions.

      - Grayson College is in Texas (TX)

      - Washburn University is in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: I need to be more specific about where in these states the institutions
      are located.

      - Grayson College is in Denison, Texas, which is in Grayson County in the northern
      part of Texas, near the Oklahoma border.

      - Washburn University is in Topeka, Kansas, which is in the eastern part of
      Kansas and is actually the capital city of Kansas.


      Step 3: Now I need to compare the latitudes (north-south positions) of these
      locations.

      - Kansas is a state that borders Oklahoma to the south. Kansas is entirely north
      of Texas.

      - Texas is south of Oklahoma, which is south of Kansas.

      - Since Grayson College is in northern Texas, it''s still south of Kansas, even
      though it''s in the northern part of Texas.

      - Topeka, Kansas (where Washburn University is located) is well within Kansas,
      not at its southern border.


      Step 4: To confirm, let me think about the geographic arrangement of these states
      from north to south:

      - Kansas is north of Oklahoma

      - Oklahoma is north of Texas

      - Therefore Kansas is north of Texas


      Since Washburn University is in Kansas and Grayson College is in Texas, and
      Kansas is north of Texas, it follows that Washburn University is north of Grayson
      College.


      If Washburn University is north of Grayson College, then Grayson College is
      south of Washburn University.

      ## Step 1: Locate both institutions

      - Grayson College is in Denison, Texas, in Grayson County (northern Texas)

      - Washburn University is in Topeka, Kansas (the capital city in eastern Kansas)


      ## Step 2: Consider state positions

      - Kansas is located directly north of Oklahoma

      - Oklahoma is located directly north of Texas

      - Therefore, Kansas is completely north of Texas


      ## Step 3: Compare specific locations

      - Even though Grayson College is in northern Texas (near the Oklahoma border),
      it''s still in Texas

      - Since Texas is entirely south of Kansas, and Washburn is in Kansas, Grayson
      College must be south of Washburn University

      First, let me identify their approximate locations:


      1) Grayson College is in Texas (TX). Texas is in the southern United States.

      2) Washburn University is in Kansas (KS). Kansas is in the central United States,
      north of Texas.


      To be more precise:

      - Grayson College is located in Denison, Texas, which is in North Texas near
      the Oklahoma border.

      - Washburn University is located in Topeka, Kansas, which is in the northeastern
      part of Kansas.


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - Places further north have higher latitude numbers


      Kansas is entirely north of Texas geographically. Topeka, Kansas is definitely

      First, let''s establish the general geographic locations:

      - Arkansas (AR) is a state in the southern United States

      - Connecticut (CT) is a state in the northeastern United States


      In terms of latitude:

      - Southern states are generally at lower latitudes

      - Northern states are generally at higher latitudes


      Arkansas is definitely south of Connecticut in terms of the overall geographic
      position of these states. Arkansas is in the south-central part of the United
      States, while Connecticut is in the northeast.


      Now, let''s think about the specific cities:

      - Newport is a city in Arkansas

      - Hartford is the capital city of Connecticut


      Since Newport, AR is in a southern state, and Hartford, CT is in a northeastern
      state, it follows that Newport, AR is south of Hartford, CT.


      Therefore, Arkansas State University-Newport, AR is located south of the University
      of Hartford, CT.

      First, let me identify the locations of these universities:


      1. Urbana University is in Urbana, Ohio (OH).

      2. Calvin University is in Grand Rapids, Michigan (MI).


      Now, I need to determine their relative positions. In the United States, Michigan

      Michigan being north of Ohio.


      To be more specific:

      - Michigan is in the Great Lakes region, with its southern border adjacent to
      Ohio''s northern border.

      - Grand Rapids, Michigan (where Calvin University is located) is in the western
