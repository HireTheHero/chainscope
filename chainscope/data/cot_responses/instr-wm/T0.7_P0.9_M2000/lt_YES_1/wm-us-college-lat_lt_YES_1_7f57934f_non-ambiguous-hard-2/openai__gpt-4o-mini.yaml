      1. Central Methodist University is located in Fayette, Missouri.

      2. Bryant University is located in Smithfield, Rhode Island.


      Next, we look at the geographical positions of these two states:


      - Missouri is located in the central part of the United States.

      - Rhode Island is located in the northeastern part of the United States.


      Now, we can analyze their relative positions:


      - When looking at a map, Missouri is generally west of Rhode Island.

      - Since Missouri is west and slightly south of Rhode Island, it is not directly
      south of it.


      Therefore, Central Methodist University is not located south of Bryant University.

      1. **California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt (CSU Humboldt)** is located
      in Arcata, California, which is in the northern part of California near the
      coast.


      2. **Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts (IDSVA)** is located

      Now, we can visualize or reference a map to compare their positions:


      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States.

      - Maine is located on the East Coast of the United States.


      Given that California is significantly further west than Maine, and considering
      that "south" implies a location that is further down (closer to the equator)
      on the same longitude or further south than another location:


      - CSU Humboldt (California) is geographically much further south than IDSVA
      (Maine).
