      - University of Scranton is in Scranton, Pennsylvania


      2) Looking at their states:

      - Kentucky is generally south of Pennsylvania in the United States

      - Pennsylvania is a northern state, bordering New York

      - Kentucky is a southern state, much closer to Tennessee


      3) More specifically:

      1. First, let me identify the locations:

      - Western Kentucky University-Owensboro is in Owensboro, Kentucky

      - University of Scranton is in Scranton, Pennsylvania


      2. Let me consider their geographical positions:

      - Scranton, PA is in northeastern Pennsylvania

      - Owensboro, KY is in western Kentucky


      3. Looking at relative positions:

      - Kentucky is several states south of Pennsylvania

      - Kentucky''s northern border is significantly south of Pennsylvania''s southern
      border


      4. Therefore, since Owensboro, KY is well within Kentucky''s borders, and Scranton,
      PA is well within Pennsylvania''s borders, Owensboro must be south of Scranton.

      - Ohio is located in the northern/midwest United States

      - Any location in Texas will be south of any location in Ohio


      3) Therefore, since Lubbock, TX is in Texas and Columbus, OH is in Ohio, Whitacre
      College of Engineering must be south of Ohio Dominican University.
