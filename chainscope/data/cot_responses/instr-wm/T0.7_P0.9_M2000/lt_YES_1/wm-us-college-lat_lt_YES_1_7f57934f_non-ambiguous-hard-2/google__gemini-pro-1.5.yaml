      2. **Academy of Chinese Culture and Health Sciences** is in California.

      3. Texas is generally east of California.  Therefore, the question of being
      North or South is less relevant than East or West.

      4. While some parts of Texas might be slightly south of *some* parts of California,
      Dallas is significantly further east.


      Therefore, the concept of North/South doesn''t accurately capture the geographical
      relationship. However, if we must answer within the constraints of a yes/no
      question relating specifically to latitude: Dallas is likely at a similar latitude
      or slightly south of the Academy.
