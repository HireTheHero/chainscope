      \ Pierce University (FPU) is located *south* of the University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Marathon County (UW-Marathon County).\n\n2.  **Identify the key locations:**\n\
      \    *   Franklin Pierce University, NH\n    *   University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Marathon County, WI\n\n3.  **Determine the geographical relationship needed:**\
      \ I need to compare the latitudes of these two locations. \"South of\" means\
      \ having a lower latitude (closer to the equator).\n\n4.  **Find the location/coordinates\
      \ for Franklin Pierce University, NH:**\n    *   A quick search reveals Franklin\
      \ Pierce University is in Rindge, New Hampshire.\n    *   Searching for \"latitude\
      \ of Rindge, NH\" or \"latitude of Franklin Pierce University NH\" gives a latitude\
      \ of approximately 42.75 degrees North.\n\n5.  **Find the location/coordinates\
      \ for University of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon County, WI:**\n    *   A quick search\
      \ reveals UW-Marathon County was located in Wausau, Wisconsin (it is now part\
      \ of UW-Stevens Point at Wausau).\n    *   Searching for \"latitude of Wausau,\
      \ WI\" or \"latitude of UW Marathon County\" gives a latitude of approximately\
      \ 44.96 degrees North.\n\n6.  **Compare the latitudes:**\n    *   FPU latitude:\
      \ ~42.75\xB0 N\n    *   UW-Marathon County latitude: ~44.96\xB0 N\n\n7.  **Interpret\
      \ the comparison:**\n    *   42.75 is *less than* 44.96.\n    *   A lower North\
      \ latitude means a location is further south.\n\n8.  **Formulate the answer\
      \ based on the comparison:** Since Franklin Pierce University's latitude (42.75\xB0\
      \ N) is lower than UW-Marathon County's latitude (44.96\xB0 N), Franklin Pierce\
      \ University is located south of UW-Marathon County.\n\n9.  **Determine the\
      \ final YES/NO answer:** The comparison confirms FPU is south of UW-Marathon\
      \ County. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n\n10. **Format the output:** Provide\
      \ the step-by-step reasoning first, and then the final YES or NO answer clearly.\n\
      \n*Self-Correction/Refinement:* I should double-check the locations and latitudes.\
      \ Rindge, NH seems correct for FPU. Wausau, WI seems correct for UW-Marathon\
      \ County (or its successor campus). The latitudes obtained are consistent with\
      \ the general location of New Hampshire relative to Wisconsin on a map. The\
      \ logic of comparing North latitudes is sound.\n\nOkay, planning complete. I\
      \ will now generate the output based on these steps.Here's the step-by-step\
      \ reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the locations:** We need the locations of Franklin\
      \ Pierce University, NH and the University of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon County,\
      \ WI.\n2.  **Determine the specific towns/cities:** Franklin Pierce University\
      \ is located in Rindge, New Hampshire. The former UW\u2013Marathon County campus\
      \ was located in Wausau, Wisconsin.\n3.  **Compare the relative north-south\
      \ positions:** To determine if one location is south of another in the Northern\
      \ Hemisphere, we compare their latitudes. A lower latitude means a location\
      \ is further south (closer to the equator).\n4.  **Find the approximate latitudes:**\n\
      \    *   Rindge, NH is approximately at latitude 42.75\xB0 North.\n    *   Wausau,\
      \ WI is approximately at latitude 44.96\xB0 North.\n5.  **Compare the latitudes:**\
      \ 42.75\xB0 N is less than 44.96\xB0 N.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since the latitude\
      \ of Rindge, NH (where FPU is located) is lower than the latitude of Wausau,\
      \ WI (where UW-Marathon County was located), Franklin Pierce University is located\
      \ south of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon County.\n\nYES"

      \ question:\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The question asks for a directional\
      \ relationship between two specific locations: Northcentral University, AZ and\
      \ California State University, Fresno, CA. Specifically, is the AZ location\
      \ *south* of the CA location?\n\n2.  **Determine the locations:**\n    *   Location\
      \ 1: Northcentral University, AZ. I need to find the city or approximate location\
      \ of this university in Arizona. A quick search reveals Northcentral University\
      \ is based in San Diego, California. *Correction:* While NCU *was* based in\
      \ San Diego, it was acquired by National University and its main office/operations\
      \ are now primarily associated with San Diego, CA. However, the question specifically\
      \ says \"Northcentral University, AZ\". This implies we should consider its\
      \ former, or at least *an* Arizona location, or understand that the university's\
      \ presence *was* tied to Arizona at some point, even if its main base shifted.\
      \ *Let's assume* the question is referring to an intended or former physical\
      \ presence in Arizona, or perhaps the *idea* of an Arizona university. If we\
      \ are forced to consider an \"AZ\" location for NCU, we would typically think\
      \ of a major city like Phoenix or Prescott (where its accreditation was originally\
      \ tied). Let's use Phoenix as a representative major city in Arizona. *Re-evaluation:*\
      \ Let's double-check if NCU *ever* had a significant physical *campus* in Arizona.\
      \ A search reveals NCU was founded in Arizona (Prescott Valley) in 1996 and\
      \ later moved its headquarters to San Diego. So, *at some point*, it *was* physically\
      \ located in Arizona. Prescott Valley is a reasonable reference point for \"\
      Northcentral University, AZ\".\n    *   Location 2: California State University,\
      \ Fresno, CA. This is clearly in Fresno, California.\n\n3.  **Determine the\
      \ geographic coordinates or relative positions:**\n    *   Fresno, CA: Located\
      \ in the Central Valley of California. Roughly latitude 36.74\xB0 N.\n    *\
      \   Prescott Valley, AZ (where NCU was founded/located): Located in central\
      \ Arizona, north of Phoenix. Roughly latitude 34.61\xB0 N.\n    *   Phoenix,\
      \ AZ (another major AZ city): Located in central Arizona. Roughly latitude 33.45\xB0\
      \ N.\n\n4.  **Compare the latitudes:**\n    *   Fresno (approx 36.74\xB0 N)\n\
      \    *   Prescott Valley (approx 34.61\xB0 N)\n    *   Phoenix (approx 33.45\xB0\
      \ N)\n\n5.  **Analyze the directional relationship:**\n    *   Is Prescott Valley\
      \ (34.61\xB0 N) south of Fresno (36.74\xB0 N)? Yes, a lower North latitude means\
      \ it is further south.\n    *   Is Phoenix (33.45\xB0 N) south of Fresno (36.74\xB0\
      \ N)? Yes, a lower North latitude means it is further south.\n\n6.  **Synthesize\
      \ the answer based on the comparison:** Regardless of whether we use Prescott\
      \ Valley or Phoenix as the reference for \"Northcentral University, AZ\", both\
      \ locations are at a lower latitude than Fresno, CA. Therefore, both are geographically\
      \ south of Fresno.\n\n7.  **Formulate the final YES/NO answer:** The question\
      \ is \"Is Northcentral University, AZ located south of California State University,\
      \ Fresno, CA?\". Based on the geographic positions of likely locations for \"\
      Northcentral University, AZ\" (like Prescott Valley or Phoenix) relative to\
      \ Fresno, CA, the answer is yes.\n\n8.  **Final check:** Let's visualize or\
      \ look at a map. Fresno is in central California. Prescott Valley and Phoenix\
      \ are in central Arizona, further south and east than Fresno. The directional\
      \ relationship is indeed that the Arizona locations are south of Fresno.\n\n\
      Therefore, the answer is YES.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n1. Identify the\
      \ two locations: Northcentral University, AZ and California State University,\
      \ Fresno, CA.\n2. Determine the approximate geographical location of each. CSU\
      \ Fresno is in Fresno, CA. Northcentral University's historical/founding location\
      \ in Arizona was Prescott Valley (or consider a major city like Phoenix as representative\
      \ of \"AZ\").\n3. Compare the latitudes of Fresno, CA, and Prescott Valley,\
      \ AZ (or Phoenix, AZ).\n4. Determine if the latitude of the Arizona location\

      1.  **Identify the locations:** We need to know the approximate locations of
      State University of New York (SUNY) at Cortland, NY, and Minot State University,
      ND.

      2.  **Locate SUNY Cortland:** Cortland, NY is in central New York state. New
      York is generally in the northeastern part of the US.

      3.  **Locate Minot State University:** Minot, ND is in northern North Dakota.
      North Dakota is in the upper midwestern part of the US.

      4.  **Compare latitudes:** To determine which is further south, we need to compare
      their latitudes. North Dakota is a state much further north than New York. Even
      the southernmost part of North Dakota is significantly north of the northernmost
      part of New York. Cortland, NY, being in the southern half of New York state,
      is at a considerably lower latitude (further south) than Minot, ND.

      5.  **Formulate the comparison:** SUNY Cortland, NY is located at a lower latitude
      (more south) than Minot State University, ND.
