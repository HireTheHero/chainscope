    96cf44a7-6006-4871-8075-4aa71784e6ac: "<think>Okay, so the question is whether\
      \ Texas Tech University College of Architecture in Texas is located south of\
      \ Cincinnati Christian University in Ohio. Hmm, let's break this down step by\
      \ step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where each university is located. I know\
      \ Texas Tech is in Texas, and Cincinnati Christian is in Ohio. The key here\
      \ is comparing their latitudes because the question is about north-south positioning.\n\
      \nStarting with Cincinnati Christian University in Ohio. Cincinnati is a city\
      \ in the southwestern part of Ohio, right along the Ohio River, which borders\
      \ Kentucky. I remember that Cincinnati's latitude is around 39 degrees north.\
      \ Maybe 39.1\xB0N or something like that. Let me confirm: a quick mental note\u2014\
      Cincinnati's coordinates are approximately 39.1031\xB0 N, 84.5120\xB0 W.\n\n\
      Now, Texas Tech University's College of Architecture. Texas Tech's main campus\
      \ is in Lubbock, Texas. So I need the latitude of Lubbock. Lubbock is in West\
      \ Texas. From what I recall, Lubbock's latitude is around 33 degrees north.\
      \ Let me be precise here: Lubbock's coordinates are approximately 33.5779\xB0\
      \ N, 101.8552\xB0 W.\n\nComparing those latitudes: 33.58\xB0N for Lubbock versus\
      \ 39.10\xB0N for Cincinnati. Since latitude decreases as you go south, a lower\
      \ latitude means a location is further south. So 33.58\xB0N is definitely south\
      \ of 39.10\xB0N. Therefore, Texas Tech's College of Architecture in Lubbock,\
      \ TX, is south of Cincinnati Christian University in Ohio.\n\nWait, but let\
      \ me make sure there's no confusion with the cities. Sometimes people might\
      \ mix up different campuses, but the question specifies Texas Tech University\
      \ College of Architecture in Texas. So assuming that's the main campus in Lubbock,\
      \ then yes. If there were a campus in another part of Texas that's further north,\
      \ but I don't think so. Lubbock is in the northern part of Texas, but even so,\
      \ compared to Cincinnati in Ohio, which is further north. Wait, Ohio is a northern\
      \ state, so even the southern part of Ohio would be more northern than much\
      \ of Texas. Wait, but Texas is a large state. For example, the panhandle of\
      \ Texas is at a higher latitude. Let me check: the northernmost part of Texas\
      \ is around 36.5\xB0N, which is the panhandle. Lubbock is in the panhandle area?\
      \ Wait, no. Lubbock is actually in the South Plains region, which is part of\
      \ West Texas. Wait, the Texas panhandle is more the very northern part, like\
      \ Amarillo. Let me confirm Amarillo's latitude: around 35.1988\xB0 N. Wait,\
      \ but Lubbock is at 33.58\xB0N, which is actually further south than Amarillo.\
      \ So the panhandle is more north, but Lubbock is a bit south of that. So Cincinnati\
      \ is at 39.1\xB0N, which is way further north than both. So regardless, Lubbock\
      \ is south of Cincinnati. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n</think>YES. Texas\
      \ Tech University College of Architecture is located in Lubbock, TX, at approximately\
      \ **33.58\xB0N** latitude. Cincinnati Christian University in Ohio is situated\
      \ at approximately **39.10\xB0N** latitude. Since lower latitude means further\
      \ south, Lubbock, TX, is unequivocally south of Cincinnati, OH. \n\n**Answer:\

      \ latitude of Lubbock. From what I recall, Lubbock is around 33 degrees north\
      \ latitude. \n\nComparing the two latitudes: Cincinnati at roughly 39\xB0N and\
      \ Lubbock at approximately 33\xB0N. Since lower latitude means further south,\
      \ Lubbock (Texas Tech) would be south of Cincinnati (CCU). But wait, is there\

      \ even if CCU is in Cincinnati, its latitude is around 39.1\xB0N. Texas Tech\
      \ in Lubbock is around 33.5\xB0N. \n\nSo 33.5 is definitely south of 39.1. Therefore,\
      \ the answer should be YES. I think that's it. Unless there's some other factor\
      \ I'm missing, like different campuses or something. But the question specifies\

      \ Generally, West Virginia is south of Wisconsin. For example, the northern\

      \ Mountain State University in Beckley, West Virginia closed around 2013 due\
      \ to accreditation issues. But for the sake of the question, assuming it's still\
      \ operational, the location would be Beckley, WV. \n\nNext, Viterbo University\
      \ in Wisconsin. Viterbo is located in La Crosse, Wisconsin. So, now I need to\
      \ compare the latitudes of Beckley, WV and La Crosse, WI to see which is further\

      \ latitude, the more south a location is. Let me think about the approximate\
      \ latitudes. La Crosse, WI is in western Wisconsin, near the Minnesota border.\
      \ Wisconsin is a northern state, so La Crosse is probably around 43-44 degrees\
      \ north latitude. Beckley, WV is in the southern part of West Virginia. West\

      \ The approximate latitude... Maybe around 37.7 degrees north? Let me check\
      \ that\u2014Beckley's latitude is approximately 37.7783\xB0 N.\n\nLa Crosse,\

      \ Let me try to remember or estimate the approximate latitudes.\n\nBeckley,\
      \ West Virginia: I know that West Virginia is south of Pennsylvania and Ohio.\
      \ Let's think about major cities. For example, the latitude of Charleston, WV\

    dcbf6e2c-d633-425b-9064-da329f78ef14: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Gannon University in Pennsylvania is located south of Saint Martin's\
      \ University in Washington state. Hmm, I need to figure out the latitudes of\
      \ both universities to compare their positions. \n\nFirst, I should recall where\
      \ these universities are. Gannon University is in Erie, Pennsylvania. Saint\
      \ Martin's University is in Lacey, Washington. Now, I need to find the latitude\
      \ of each city. \n\nErie, PA: I remember that Pennsylvania is in the northeastern\
      \ US. Erie is in the northwestern part of PA, right on Lake Erie. The latitude\
      \ for Erie, I think, is around 42 degrees north. Maybe 42.13\xB0 N or something\
      \ like that. \n\nLacey, WA: Washington state is in the Pacific Northwest. Lacey\
      \ is near the state capital, Olympia, which is south of Seattle. The latitude\
      \ there might be around 47 degrees north. For example, Seattle is about 47.6\xB0\
      \ N, but Lacey is a bit south of Seattle, so maybe 47.03\xB0 N or similar. \n\
      \nWait, if Erie is at 42\xB0N and Lacey is at 47\xB0N, then Erie would be south\
      \ of Lacey. But I need to check exact coordinates. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively,\
      \ maybe I can recall specific coordinates. Let me try to remember. For example,\
      \ Erie, PA's latitude is approximately 42.1292\xB0 N. Saint Martin's University\
      \ in Lacey, WA: looking up in my mind, Lacey's latitude is around 47.0344\xB0\
      \ N. \n\nComparing 42.13\xB0 N vs 47.03\xB0 N, the one with the smaller latitude\
      \ is further south. So 42.13 is south of 47.03. Therefore, Gannon University\
      \ in PA is indeed south of Saint Martin's in WA. \n\nWait, but maybe I mixed\
      \ up the coordinates. Let me confirm. For example, the general latitude of Pennsylvania\
      \ vs Washington. Washington state is further north. For example, the northern\
      \ border of Washington is at 49\xB0N, while Pennsylvania's northern border is\
      \ around 42.5\xB0N. So even the northernmost part of PA is around 42.5, while\
      \ the southern part of WA is maybe around 45.5\xB0N (like Vancouver, WA is about\
      \ 45.63\xB0N). So Lacey, WA is at 47.03\xB0N, which is definitely north of Erie,\
      \ PA's 42.13\xB0N. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be YES, Gannon University\

    111b79f9-caf0-4512-8efe-0f812704d9e3: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the user wants to know if Texas A&M University\u2013Kingsville, TX is\
      \ located south of New Mexico State University Carlsbad, NM. Hmm, okay. First,\
      \ I need to figure out where both these universities are located geographically.\n\
      \nStarting with Texas A&M\u2013Kingsville. I know Texas A&M has several campuses,\
      \ and Kingsville is one of them. Kingsville, TX is in South Texas, right? I\
      \ think it's near Corpus Christi. So maybe around the southern part of Texas,\
      \ closer to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThen there's New Mexico State University\
      \ Carlsbad. Carlsbad, NM is in southeastern New Mexico, I believe. Carlsbad\
      \ is famous for the Carlsbad Caverns National Park. So that's in the southern\
      \ part of New Mexico, near the Texas border.\n\nNow, I need to compare their\
      \ latitudes. Since the question is about being south, latitude is key. The more\
      \ south a location is, the lower its latitude. So, if Kingsville, TX has a lower\
      \ latitude than Carlsbad, NM, then the answer is yes.\n\nLet me get approximate\
      \ coordinates. Let me recall: Carlsbad, NM is at around 32.4\xB0 N latitude.\
      \ Wait, but wait, Texas is further south than New Mexico, generally. Wait, but\
      \ New Mexico's southern border is at about 31.3\xB0 N, so parts of New Mexico\
      \ are actually south of parts of Texas. Hmm, but Carlsbad is in the southeastern\
      \ part of NM. Let me check: Kingsville, TX. Let's see, Corpus Christi is about\
      \ 27.8\xB0 N, and Kingsville is a bit west of Corpus, so maybe around 27.5\xB0\
      \ N? Wait, no, that might be too low. Wait, wait, let's think again. San Antonio\
      \ is around 29.4\xB0 N. Corpus Christi is about 27.8\xB0 N. So Kingsville is\
      \ south of Corpus Christi? Wait, no, I think Kingsville is a bit inland from\
      \ Corpus. Wait, maybe around 27.5\xB0 N? \n\nBut Carlsbad, NM: if I recall,\
      \ Carlsbad's latitude is about 32.4\xB0 N. Wait, but that's higher than 27.5,\
      \ so Kingsville would be south of Carlsbad. Wait, but maybe I'm mixing up the\
      \ coordinates. Let me verify. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of major\
      \ cities. Carlsbad, NM is in the southeast of NM, near the Texas border. So\
      \ if you look at a map, Texas is to the east and south of New Mexico. So the\
      \ Texas state line east of Carlsbad would be the Texas border. But Kingsville\
      \ is in South Texas, so further south than, say, San Antonio. So Kingsville\
      \ would be south of the southernmost part of New Mexico. Wait, but the southern\
      \ tip of New Mexico is around 31\xB0 N, right? The Texas border with Mexico\
      \ is at the Rio Grande, which is around 26\xB0 N at the southernmost tip of\
      \ Texas. So if Kingsville is in South Texas, maybe around 27-28\xB0 N, and Carlsbad,\
      \ NM is around 32\xB0 N, then yes, Kingsville is south of Carlsbad.\n\nWait,\
      \ but wait. Let me think of cities. For example, El Paso, TX is at 31.8\xB0\
      \ N, which is at the western tip of Texas. So Carlsbad, NM is northeast of El\
      \ Paso? Maybe. If Carlsbad is at 32.4\xB0 N, then it's north of El Paso. So\
      \ Kingsville, being in South Texas at like 27.5\xB0 N, would definitely be south\
      \ of Carlsbad. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>To determine if Texas\

      \ New Mexico like Las Cruces are around 32 degrees north. But Carlsbad is more\
      \ to the east. Let me think. Carlsbad, NM's latitude is approximately 32.4 degrees\
      \ north. Wait, maybe a bit lower? Or higher? Let me recall. For example, Roswell,\
      \ NM is about 33.4 degrees north. Carlsbad is south of Roswell, so maybe around\
      \ 32.4 degrees north. \n\nSo if Kingsville, TX is at around 27.5\xB0N and Carlsbad,\

      \ than Carlsbad, NM, then the answer is yes. Let me think about the approximate\
      \ latitudes. Carlsbad, NM's latitude is around 32\xB0N, maybe? Wait, cities\
      \ in southern Texas like Brownsville are around 25\xB0N, but Kingsville is a\
      \ bit north of that. Let me check mentally: San Antonio is about 29\xB0N, Corpus\
      \ Christi around 27\xB0N. Kingsville is south of Corpus Christi, so maybe around\
      \ 27.5\xB0N. \n\nCarlsbad, NM: I think it's in the southern part of New Mexico.\
      \ New Mexico's southern border is at 31\xB0N to about 32\xB0N. So Carlsbad might\
      \ be around 32.4\xB0N or something. For example, Las Cruces, NM is at 32.3\xB0\
      N. If Carlsbad is in that area, then its latitude is higher (more north) than\
      \ Kingsville's. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. If Kingsville is at\
      \ 27.5\xB0N and Carlsbad is at 32.4\xB0N, then Kingsville is south of Carlsbad.\
      \ Because lower latitude means further south. So yes, Texas A&M Kingsville would\
      \ be south of NMSU Carlsbad. \n\nBut maybe I have the coordinates wrong. Let\
      \ me try to recall specific cities. For example, El Paso, TX is at 31.8\xB0\
      N. Carlsbad, NM is east of El Paso, but still in the southern part of NM. So\
      \ Carlsbad's latitude is around 32.5\xB0N. Kingsville, TX is much further south,\
      \ maybe 27.5\xB0N. So 27.5 is south of 32.5. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n\
      </think>To determine if Texas A&M University\u2013Kingsville, TX is south of\
      \ New Mexico State University Carlsbad, NM:  \n1. **Kingsville, TX** is in southern\

      \ a lower latitude (more southern) would be further south.\n\nStarting with\
      \ Texas A&M University\u2013Kingsville. I know that Texas is a big state, and\
      \ Kingsville is in South Texas. Maybe near Corpus Christi? Corpus Christi is\
      \ on the Gulf Coast. So Kingsville is likely south of that. Let me recall, Corpus\
      \ Christi is around 27.8 degrees north latitude. Wait, actually, I think Kingsville\
      \ is a bit inland from Corpus Christi. Let me check my memory\u2014if Corpus\
      \ Christi is at about 27.8\xB0N, then Kingsville, which is southwest of Corpus,\
      \ might be slightly more south. Maybe around 27.5\xB0N or so? I'm not exactly\
      \ sure, but I know it's in the southern part of Texas.\n\nNow, New Mexico State\
      \ University Carlsbad. That's in Carlsbad, New Mexico. Carlsbad, NM is in the\
      \ southeastern part of New Mexico, near the Texas border. I remember that Carlsbad\
      \ is close to the Texas state line. The latitude for Carlsbad, NM is higher,\
      \ I think. Let me think about major cities. For example, Albuquerque is around\
      \ 35\xB0N, but that's more central. Carlsbad is further south in NM. Maybe around\
      \ 32\xB0N? Wait, El Paso, TX is at about 31.8\xB0N, and Carlsbad, NM is east\
      \ of El Paso but still in the southern part of NM. So perhaps Carlsbad, NM is\
      \ around 32.4\xB0N latitude? \n\nIf Texas A&M-Kingsville is at around 27.5\xB0\
      N and Carlsbad, NM is around 32.4\xB0N, then Kingsville would be south of Carlsbad.\
      \ Because 27.5 is south of 32.4. So in that case, the answer would be yes. But\
      \ I need to make sure my latitude estimates are correct. Let me think again.\
      \ \n\nWait, another approach: Carlsbad, NM is in Eddy County. Looking at a map,\
      \ it's in the southeastern part of New Mexico, near the Texas border. The latitude\
      \ of Carlsbad, NM is approximately 32.4207\xB0 N. And Texas A&M University\u2013\
      Kingsville is in Kingsville, Texas, which has a latitude of about 27.5159\xB0\

      \ \n\nStarting with the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania. I know Scranton\

      \ So, I need to determine if Western Kentucky University's campus in Owensboro,\
      \ KY is located south of the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania. Hmm, okay.\
      \ Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the geographic\
      \ locations of both cities. Scranton is in Pennsylvania, and Owensboro is in\
      \ Kentucky. I know that Kentucky is generally south of Pennsylvania, but I need\
      \ to check the exact latitudes to be sure because sometimes state positions\
      \ can be a bit misleading. For example, parts of a southern state might be further\
      \ north than parts of a northern state depending on where they are situated.\n\
      \nLet me start by recalling the approximate latitudes of both states. Pennsylvania\
      \ is in the northeastern US, while Kentucky is in the southeastern part, more\
      \ towards the Midwest. Scranton is in northeastern Pennsylvania, near the New\
      \ York border. Owensboro, Kentucky, is in the western part of the state, near\
      \ the Indiana border. \n\nNow, I need to get the specific latitude coordinates\
      \ for both cities. Latitude measures how far north or south a place is. The\
      \ higher the latitude, the further north. So if Owensboro, KY has a lower latitude\
      \ than Scranton, PA, then it's further south.\n\nLooking up the latitude of\
      \ Scranton, PA. From what I remember, Scranton is around 41.4\xB0 North. For\
      \ Owensboro, KY, I think it's approximately 37.77\xB0 North. Wait, let me confirm\
      \ that. Maybe I should recall major cities nearby. For example, Louisville,\
      \ KY is around 38.25\xB0N, and Owensboro is west of Louisville, so maybe a bit\
      \ lower latitude? Or maybe similar. Alternatively, Evansville, IN is near Owensboro\
      \ and is around 37.97\xB0N. So Owensboro might be around 37.7\xB0N to 37.8\xB0\
      N. \n\nComparing that to Scranton's 41.4\xB0N. Since 37.7 is less than 41.4,\
      \ that would mean Owensboro is south of Scranton. Therefore, the answer would\
      \ be YES. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I mixed up the latitudes.\
      \ Is there a chance that Scranton is further south? No, Pennsylvania is north\
      \ of Kentucky. For example, the southern border of Pennsylvania is around the\
      \ 39\xB043' N latitude (the Mason-Dixon line), which is the border with Maryland.\
      \ So Scranton is further north than that. Let's see, if Scranton is at 41.4\xB0\
      N, and Owensboro is around 37.7\xB0N, the difference is about 3.7 degrees. Since\
      \ each degree is about 69 miles, that's roughly 255 miles further south. So\
      \ yes, Owensboro is significantly south of Scranton.\n\nAnother way to think\
      \ about it: Pennsylvania is in the north, Kentucky is in the south. Even if\
      \ Owensboro is in western Kentucky, which is more towards the Midwest, it's\
      \ still in the southern part relative to Pennsylvania. So unless there's a specific\
      \ geographical feature that puts Owensboro north of Scranton, which I don't\

      \ in Bowling Green, KY, right? But they have a campus in Owensboro. Owensboro\
      \ is a city in Kentucky. I should find its latitude. Kentucky is a state in\
      \ the southern part of the US, while Scranton, PA is in Pennsylvania, which\
      \ is more to the northeast.\n\nBut I need to be precise. Let me recall or imagine\
      \ the approximate coordinates. Scranton, PA is in northeastern Pennsylvania.\
      \ The University of Scranton's coordinates... I think Scranton is around 41.4\
      \ degrees north latitude. Let me confirm that. From memory, cities like New\
      \ York are around 40.7\xB0N, and Scranton is a bit north of there, maybe 41.4\xB0\
      N as I thought.\n\nThen Owensboro, KY. Kentucky's latitude range is roughly\
      \ from about 36.5\xB0N to 39\xB0N. Owensboro is in western Kentucky. Let me\
      \ think. Bowling Green, KY is around 37\xB0N. Owensboro is further north than\
      \ that? Wait, no, maybe. Let me visualize a map. Owensboro is along the Ohio\
      \ River, which forms the border between Kentucky and Indiana. The Ohio River\
      \ in that area... cities like Evansville, IN are nearby. Evansville is around\
      \ 37.97\xB0N, 87.55\xB0W. So Owensboro, being across the river, should be at\
      \ a similar latitude. Let me check that. Let's say approximately 37.75\xB0N.\
      \ \n\nWait, if Scranton is at 41.4\xB0N and Owensboro is around 37.7\xB0N, then\
      \ Owensboro would be south of Scranton. Because the lower the latitude, the\
      \ further south. So 37.7 is less than 41.4, meaning Owensboro is south. Therefore,\
      \ the answer would be YES.\n\nWait, but maybe I got the coordinates wrong? Let\
      \ me think again. Let's take Scranton, PA's coordinates. A quick search (if\
      \ I could do that) would show that Scranton is indeed at 41.409\xB0N latitude.\
      \ And Owensboro, KY is at approximately 37.7747\xB0N latitude. So yes, 37.77\
      \ is definitely south of 41.40. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>YES \

      \ For example, Chicago, IL is around 41.8781\xB0 N. Kentucky's latitude is lower.\

      \ question. So the question is whether Kennesaw State University College of\
      \ Arts in Georgia is located south of the Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination\

      \nStarting with Kennesaw State University. I know that Kennesaw is a city in\
      \ Georgia, USA. Georgia is in the southeastern part of the United States. The\
      \ university's main campus is in Kennesaw, which is northwest of Atlanta. So,\
      \ the College of Arts would be part of that main campus, I assume. Now, the\
      \ coordinates for Kennesaw, GA. Let me recall... Atlanta's latitude is around\
      \ 33.7490\xB0 N. Since Kennesaw is just northwest of Atlanta, maybe it's a similar\
      \ latitude. Let me check mentally\u2014probably around 34\xB0 N or maybe 34.0\xB0\
      \ N. Wait, actually, a quick search in my mind: Kennesaw's latitude is approximately\
      \ 34.0234\xB0 N. I think that's right.\n\nNext, the Liechtenstein Institute\
      \ on Self-Determination. This one is in New Jersey, so I need to figure out\
      \ where exactly. I remember that Princeton University in New Jersey hosts this\
      \ institute. Princeton, NJ's coordinates are about 40.3573\xB0 N, 74.6672\xB0\
      \ W. So the latitude there is around 40.36\xB0 N, which is significantly north\
      \ of Kennesaw's latitude of ~34\xB0 N.\n\nNow, comparing the latitudes: 34\xB0\
      \ N vs. 40.36\xB0 N. Since latitude increases as you go north, a place at 34\xB0\
      \ N is south of a place at 40\xB0 N. Therefore, Kennesaw State University in\

      \ Wait, Liechtenstein is a country in Europe, but this institute is probably\

      \ The Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination (LISD) is actually part\

      \ around the mid-Atlantic region. Arkansas is a state in the southern part of\
      \ the US, more towards the middle. But Paragould, Arkansas specifically\u2014\
      where is that exactly? I should probably check the approximate latitudes of\
      \ both cities to determine their north-south positions.\n\nStrayer University's\
      \ main campus is in Washington, DC. The latitude of DC is about 38.9072\xB0\
      \ N. Now, Paragould, Arkansas. Let me think... Arkansas is south of Missouri,\
      \ so it's in the southern Midwest or the northern part of the South. Paragould\
      \ is in northeastern Arkansas, near the Missouri border. The latitude there\u2014\
      maybe around 36\xB0 N? Because I remember that Memphis, Tennessee is around\
      \ 35\xB0 N, and Little Rock, Arkansas is about 34.7\xB0 N. Since Paragould is\
      \ in the northeast of Arkansas, maybe it's slightly north of Little Rock but\
      \ still south of the Missouri border. Let's say approximately 36\xB0 N.\n\n\
      Comparing 36\xB0 N (Paragould) to 38.9\xB0 N (DC), 36 is definitely south of\
      \ 38.9. So that would mean Arkansas State University Paragould is south of Strayer\
      \ University in DC. Wait, but I should double-check the exact latitude of Paragould\
      \ to be sure. Let me visualize a map: Paragould is in the northeastern corner\
      \ of Arkansas. The coordinates for Paragould, AR are approximately 36.0564\xB0\
      \ N, 90.5023\xB0 W. Yes, that's 36.0564\xB0 N. Washington, DC is at 38.9072\xB0\
      \ N. \n\nSince 36.0564 is less than 38.9072, Paragould is indeed south of DC.\
      \ Therefore, the answer should be YES. But wait, is there a Strayer University\
      \ campus in DC, or maybe the main campus? I think Strayer has multiple campuses,\
      \ but their headquarters is in DC, so I assume that's the one being referred\
      \ to here. So yes, since Paragould is south of DC, the answer is YES.\n</think>To\
      \ determine if Arkansas State University in Paragould, AR is south of Strayer\
      \ University in Washington, DC:  \n1. **Latitude of Paragould, AR**: Approximately\
      \ **36.0564\xB0 N**.  \n2. **Latitude of Washington, DC**: Approximately **38.9072\xB0\
      \ N**.  \n\nSince 36.0564\xB0 N (Paragould) is **south** of 38.9072\xB0 N (DC),\
      \ the answer is:  \n\n**YES**"

      \ So, the user is asking if Arkansas State University in Paragould, AR is located\
      \ south of Strayer University in DC. Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure out\
      \ the locations of both universities. \n\nStarting with Arkansas State University\
      \ Paragould. Wait, I think there's a main Arkansas State University campus in\
      \ Jonesboro, but there's also a campus in Paragould. Paragould is a city in\
      \ Arkansas. Let me confirm that. Yes, ASU has a campus in Paragould, which is\
      \ in the northeastern part of Arkansas, near the border with Missouri.\n\nNow,\
      \ Strayer University in DC. Strayer is a private university with multiple campuses,\
      \ and one of them is in Washington, D.C. So the DC campus is in the District\
      \ of Columbia, which is on the East Coast, between Maryland and Virginia.\n\n\
      Next, I need to determine the geographical positions. Paragould, AR is in the\
      \ northeastern corner of Arkansas. Let me think about the coordinates. Paragould's\
      \ latitude is approximately 36.0584\xB0 N, longitude 90.4973\xB0 W. Washington,\
      \ D.C. has a latitude of about 38.9072\xB0 N, longitude 77.0369\xB0 W. \n\n\
      Since latitude determines north-south position, a higher latitude means further\
      \ north. Paragould is at 36.06\xB0 N, and DC is at 38.91\xB0 N. So DC is north\
      \ of Paragould. Wait, but the question is if ASU Paragould is south of Strayer\
      \ DC. If DC is north of Paragould, then Paragould is south of DC. So that would\
      \ mean yes, ASU Paragould is south of Strayer DC. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check\
      \ the coordinates to be sure. Maybe I mixed up the numbers. Paragould, AR: 36.0584\xB0\
      \ N. Washington, DC: 38.9072\xB0 N. Yes, 36 is less than 38, so Paragould is\
      \ indeed south of DC. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \n\
      **Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Locate the Universities:**  \n   - Arkansas\
      \ State University (ASU) Paragould is in northeastern Arkansas.  \n   - Strayer\

    8dbf5b10-5528-426a-8886-af094b08faf0: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Johnson University in Tennessee is located south of the University\
      \ of Northern Colorado in Colorado. Hmm, I need to figure out the geographic\
      \ locations of both universities and compare their latitudes. \n\nFirst, I should\
      \ recall where each university is. Johnson University in Tennessee\u2014I think\
      \ Tennessee is in the southeastern part of the US. The University of Northern\
      \ Colorado is in Colorado, which is more towards the central western area, maybe\
      \ in the northern part of Colorado? The name \"Northern Colorado\" suggests\
      \ it's in the northern part of the state.\n\nSo, I need to check the approximate\
      \ latitudes. Let me think: Colorado is north of states like New Mexico and Arizona,\
      \ but compared to Tennessee, where exactly does it stand? Tennessee is south\
      \ of Kentucky and Virginia, right? So, Tennessee is in the southeastern US,\
      \ while Colorado is more in the Rocky Mountain region, mid-west.\n\nWait, but\
      \ latitude is the key here. The higher the latitude, the farther north. So if\
      \ the University of Northern Colorado is in the northern part of Colorado, and\
      \ Colorado is a state that's around 37\xB0N to 41\xB0N latitude. Tennessee,\
      \ on the other hand, is roughly between 35\xB0N and 36.5\xB0N latitude. So maybe\
      \ Tennessee is further south than Colorado?\n\nWait, no. Let me get more precise.\
      \ Let me try to get the exact cities where these universities are located. Johnson\
      \ University in Tennessee\u2014I think it's in Knoxville? Wait, no. Wait, Johnson\
      \ University's main campus is in Kimberlin Heights, Tennessee. Let me confirm.\
      \ Yes, Johnson University is located in Kimberlin Heights, TN. And the University\
      \ of Northern Colorado is in Greeley, Colorado.\n\nNow I need the latitudes\
      \ of these two cities. Let me recall or think. Greeley, Colorado. Colorado's\
      \ northern border is at 41\xB0N latitude, so Greeley being in northern Colorado\
      \ would be around 40.4\xB0N. Let me check: looking it up in my mind, Greeley,\
      \ CO latitude is approximately 40.4233\xB0 N. \n\nKimberlin Heights, TN. Tennessee's\
      \ latitude range\u2014Knoxville is around 35.9606\xB0 N. Kimberlin Heights is\
      \ near Knoxville, so probably similar. Let me check. If Kimberlin Heights is\
      \ near Knoxville, which is around 35.96\xB0N. So that would be about 35.9\xB0\
      N. \n\nSo comparing 35.9\xB0N (Johnson University, TN) with 40.4\xB0N (University\
      \ of Northern Colorado, CO). Since 35.9 is less than 40.4, that would mean Johnson\
      \ University is south of the University of Northern Colorado. So the answer\
      \ would be YES.\n\nWait, wait. But maybe I mixed up the latitude numbers. Let\
      \ me double-check. Latitude increases as you go north. So if a place is at 40\xB0\
      N, it's north of a place at 35\xB0N. So yes, 35.9\xB0N is south of 40.4\xB0\
      N. Therefore, Johnson University in Tennessee is indeed located south of the\
      \ University of Northern Colorado in Colorado.\n</think>To determine if Johnson\

      First, I need to figure out where exactly these two universities are. Let's\
      \ start with Johnson University in Tennessee. I know Tennessee is in the southeastern\
      \ part of the US. Johnson University\u2014there might be more than one Johnson\
      \ University, but the one in Tennessee is likely the main one. Let me confirm.\
      \ Yes, Johnson University is a private Christian university in Knoxville, Tennessee.\
      \ Wait, actually, I should check the city. Let me think. I recall that Johnson\
      \ University's main campus is in Kimberlin Heights, which is near Knoxville.\
      \ So the city is Knoxville, TN.\n\nNext, the University of Northern Colorado\
      \ (UNC) is in Colorado. Where in Colorado? UNC is located in Greeley, Colorado.\
      \ Now, I need to find the latitude of both cities to compare their positions\
      \ north or south of each other.\n\nLatitude is the key here. The further south\
      \ a location is, the lower its latitude. So if Knoxville, TN has a lower latitude\
      \ than Greeley, CO, then YES, Johnson University is south of UNC.\n\nLet me\
      \ look up the coordinates. Knoxville, TN: approximately 35.9606\xB0 N latitude.\
      \ Greeley, CO: approximately 40.4233\xB0 N latitude. Comparing these, 35.96\
      \ is definitely south of 40.42. Since latitude increases as you go north, Knoxville\
      \ is at a lower latitude than Greeley. Therefore, Johnson University in Tennessee\
      \ is indeed south of the University of Northern Colorado in Colorado.\n\nWait,\
      \ but wait a second\u2014is there any chance that the user might be confused\
      \ by state locations? For example, Colorado is west of Tennessee, but latitude\
      \ is purely north-south. So even though Colorado is further west, the key factor\
      \ is the north-south position. Since 35.96\xB0 N (Knoxville) is less than 40.42\xB0\
      \ N (Greeley), that means Knoxville is south of Greeley. Therefore, the answer\
      \ is YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Locate Johnson\

    e8ae4d25-6fec-4eb1-aaa9-a1ed070dc6a3: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure out if\
      \ Johnson University in Tennessee is located south of the University of Northern\

      \ Let's start with Johnson University in Tennessee. I know Tennessee is in the\
      \ southeastern part of the US. But where exactly is the university located?\
      \ Maybe I should recall if Johnson University is in a specific city there. I\
      \ think Johnson University is in Knoxville, Tennessee. Wait, no, Knoxville has\
      \ the University of Tennessee. Maybe Johnson University is in a different city.\
      \ Let me check my memory again. Oh right, Johnson University's main campus is\
      \ in Kimberlin Heights, which is near Knoxville, Tennessee. So the city is Kimberlin\
      \ Heights, TN.\n\nNow, the University of Northern Colorado. That's in Colorado,\
      \ obviously. The name suggests it's in the northern part of the state. The main\
      \ campus is in Greeley, Colorado. So, Greeley, CO is the location. \n\nNext\
      \ step is to compare the latitudes of these two cities to determine which is\
      \ further south. The one with a lower latitude (more south) would be the one\
      \ located to the south. \n\nI need to find the approximate latitudes of Kimberlin\
      \ Heights, TN and Greeley, CO. \n\nFrom what I remember, Tennessee is around\
      \ 35-36 degrees north latitude. Colorado is further north; for example, Denver,\
      \ CO is around 39.7\xB0N. Since Greeley is north of Denver, wait, no, actually,\
      \ Greeley is northeast of Denver but still in northern Colorado. Let me confirm.\
      \ Denver is in central Colorado, and Greeley is a bit northeast of Denver. The\
      \ latitude of Greeley, CO is approximately 40.4\xB0N. \n\nKimberlin Heights,\
      \ TN: The latitude of Knoxville, TN is about 35.96\xB0N. Since Kimberlin Heights\
      \ is near Knoxville, maybe around the same latitude, say 35.9\xB0N. \n\nSo comparing\
      \ 35.9\xB0N (Johnson University, TN) vs. 40.4\xB0N (University of Northern Colorado,\
      \ CO). Since 35.9 is south of 40.4, that means Johnson University is indeed\

    ee9987aa-0393-4323-b45e-c42be39a96cd: "<think>Okay, let's figure out whether Johnson\
      \ University in Tennessee is located south of the University of Northern Colorado\
      \ in Colorado. Hmm, first I need to know where each of these universities is.\
      \ \n\nStarting with Johnson University in Tennessee. I think Johnson University\
      \ is a private Christian university. But where exactly in Tennessee? Tennessee\
      \ is a state in the southeastern US. I recall that some of its major cities\
      \ are Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, and Chattanooga. Maybe Johnson University\
      \ is in one of these cities? Let me check in my mind. Wait, Johnson University\u2014\
      I think it's in Knoxville, TN. Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, I might be confusing\
      \ it with the University of Tennessee, which is in Knoxville. Maybe Johnson\
      \ University is elsewhere. Maybe it's in a smaller town. Let me think... Oh,\
      \ right! Johnson University's main campus is in Kimberlin Heights, Tennessee.\
      \ But I'm not exactly sure about the exact location. Alternatively, maybe it's\
      \ in the eastern part of Tennessee, which is more mountainous. \n\nNow, the\
      \ University of Northern Colorado is in Colorado. The University of Northern\
      \ Colorado (UNC) is in Greeley, Colorado. Where is Greeley located in Colorado?\
      \ Colorado is a state in the western US. Northern Colorado would be the northern\
      \ part of the state. Greeley is northeast of Denver, the capital. So, in terms\
      \ of latitude, where is Greeley? Let me recall that Denver is around 39.7\xB0\
      N latitude. Since Greeley is north of Denver, its latitude might be a bit higher,\
      \ maybe around 40.4\xB0N or so. \n\nNow, Johnson University in Tennessee. Let's\
      \ try to get its approximate latitude. If it's in Knoxville, TN, Knoxville's\
      \ latitude is approximately 35.96\xB0N. Memphis is lower, around 35.1\xB0N.\
      \ Nashville is about 36.16\xB0N. If Johnson University is in Kimberlin Heights,\
      \ TN, which is near Knoxville, then its latitude would be similar to Knoxville,\
      \ so around 35.9\xB0N. \n\nSo comparing the two: University of Northern Colorado\
      \ in Greeley, CO, at roughly 40.4\xB0N vs. Johnson University in TN at say 35.9\xB0\
      N. Since 35.9\xB0N is south of 40.4\xB0N, that would mean Johnson University\
      \ is indeed south of the University of Northern Colorado. \n\nWait, but wait.\
      \ Let me confirm the exact location of Johnson University in Tennessee. I just\
      \ need to make sure I'm not mixing up the cities. For example, if the university\
      \ is in a different part of Tennessee, maybe farther north. But Tennessee's\
      \ northern border is around 36.5\xB0N (the state's northernmost point is around\
      \ 36.678\xB0N). Wait, but the latitude of Johnson University\u2014if it's in\
      \ Knoxville, which is around 35.96\xB0N, then even the southern part of Tennessee\
      \ is around 35\xB0N. So, regardless, if the University of Northern Colorado\
      \ is at 40.4\xB0N in Greeley, then any point in Tennessee (even the northern\
      \ parts, which are around 36.6\xB0N) would still be south of 40.4\xB0N. \n\n\
      So yes, Johnson University in TN would be south of the University of Northern\
      \ Colorado in CO. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>To determine if Johnson\

      \ there's a Widener University in Pennsylvania, but the question specifies Delaware.\
      \ Maybe there's a campus there? Let me check. A quick search shows that Widener\
      \ University's main campus is in Chester, Pennsylvania. But they do have a Delaware\
      \ campus in Wilmington, DE. So Widener University, DE is in Wilmington.\n\n\
      Now, Mildred Elley, NY. Mildred Elley is a private college with campuses in\
      \ New York, right? Their New York campuses are in Albany and New York City.\
      \ The question doesn't specify which one, but maybe we need to consider both?\
      \ Or perhaps the main one. Let's confirm. Mildred Elley's Albany campus is at\
      \ 855 Central Ave, Albany, NY. The NYC campus is in Manhattan. But since the\
      \ question just says Mildred Elley, NY, perhaps the main campus is in Albany.\
      \ \n\nNext, compare the latitudes of Wilmington, DE and Albany, NY. Since the\
      \ question is about being south, latitude is key. The higher the latitude, the\
      \ further north. So if Wilmington's latitude is lower (south) than Albany's,\
      \ then the answer is yes.\n\nLooking up coordinates: Wilmington, DE is approximately\
      \ 39.7396\xB0 N. Albany, NY is around 42.6526\xB0 N. Comparing those, 39.7 is\
      \ definitely south of 42.6. So yes, Wilmington, DE (Widener) is south of Albany,\
      \ NY (Mildred Elley). \n\nWait, but what if the Mildred Elley campus in NYC\
      \ is considered? Let's check NYC's latitude. New York City is about 40.7128\xB0\
      \ N. So Wilmington, DE at 39.7396\xB0 N is still south of NYC. So regardless\
      \ of whether Mildred Elley is in Albany or NYC, Widener in DE is south. Therefore,\
      \ the answer is yes.\n</think>YES  \nWidener University's Delaware campus is\
      \ located in Wilmington, DE (latitude ~39.7\xB0 N), while Mildred Elley's New\
      \ York campuses are in Albany (~42.7\xB0 N) and NYC (~40.7\xB0 N). Wilmington\u2019\
      s latitude is south of both, so Widener University, DE is indeed south of Mildred\
      \ Elley, NY.  \n\n**Answer:** YES"

      \ is there a Widener University in Delaware? I know there's a Widener University\
      \ in Pennsylvania, specifically in Chester, PA. Maybe the user meant Widener\
      \ University Delaware Law School? Because I recall that Widener has a law school\
      \ in Wilmington, Delaware. So perhaps that's the campus they're referring to.\
      \ Let me confirm that. Yes, Widener University does have a Delaware campus in\
      \ Wilmington.\n\nNow, Mildred Elley, NY. Mildred Elley is a private college,\
      \ and I think they have a campus in New York. Let me check where exactly. They\
      \ have a campus in New York City, I believe. But maybe it's in another part\
      \ of New York. Alternatively, Mildred Elley also has a campus in Albany, NY.\
      \ Wait, let me be precise. A quick search in my mind: Mildred Elley has campuses\
      \ in NYC (Manhattan), Albany, and Pittsfield, MA. So the New York campuses are\
      \ NYC and Albany.\n\nNow, I need to compare the latitudes of Wilmington, DE\
      \ and, say, Albany or NYC to determine if Wilmington is south of those locations.\
      \ \n\nFirst, let's take the NYC campus. New York City is at approximately 40.7128\xB0\
      \ N latitude. Wilmington, DE is at about 39.7459\xB0 N. Since 39.7 is south\
      \ of 40.7, Wilmington is indeed south of NYC. So if Mildred Elley's NY campus\
      \ is in NYC, then yes, Widener DE is south.\n\nBut if the Mildred Elley NY campus\
      \ is in Albany, where is Albany's latitude? Albany, NY is around 42.6526\xB0\
      \ N. Wilmington, DE at 39.7\xB0 N would still be south of Albany. So in either\

      \ DE, and Albany, NY. To determine if Wilmington is south of Albany, I need\
      \ their approximate latitudes. Let me recall. Albany is around 42.65\xB0 N latitude.\
      \ Wilmington, DE is at about 39.74\xB0 N. Since lower latitude means further\
      \ south, 39.74 is south of 42.65. So yes, Wilmington, DE (Widener) is south\
      \ of Albany, NY (Mildred Elley). \n\nWait, but what if Mildred Elley's other\
      \ campus is in NYC? New York City is around 40.71\xB0 N. Then Wilmington's 39.74\xB0\

      \ Maybe I need to think about specific cities or regions within those states.\n\
      \nLet me break it down. Mercyhurst University is in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania\

      \ whether Shenandoah University in Virginia is located south of Mercyhurst University\
      \ in Pennsylvania. I need to figure out their locations and compare their latitudes.\n\
      \nFirst, I should find out where each university is. Shenandoah University is\
      \ in Virginia. Let me recall, Virginia is a state on the East Coast, south of\
      \ Pennsylvania. But universities can be in different parts of their states.\
      \ For example, northern Virginia is close to DC, which is further south than\
      \ parts of Pennsylvania. But where exactly are these two universities located?\n\
      \nMercyhurst University is in Erie, Pennsylvania. Erie is in the northwestern\
      \ part of PA, right on Lake Erie. I remember Erie being pretty far north in\
      \ PA. Then Shenandoah University is in Winchester, Virginia. Winchester is in\
      \ the northern part of Virginia, near the border with West Virginia and not\
      \ too far from Washington D.C. \n\nNow, comparing their latitudes. Erie, PA\
      \ is at around 42.13\xB0 N latitude. Winchester, VA is at approximately 39.18\xB0\
      \ N. Since latitude decreases as you go south, 39.18\xB0 N is south of 42.13\xB0\
      \ N. So even though Winchester is in northern Virginia, it's still significantly\
      \ south of Erie, PA. Therefore, Shenandoah University (Winchester, VA) is indeed\
      \ south of Mercyhurst University (Erie, PA).\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step\
      \ Explanation:**  \n1. **Locate the Universities**: Shenandoah University is\

      \ Coordinates**: Erie, PA, is at ~42.13\xB0N latitude. Winchester, VA, is at\

    7539138d-ced0-452d-82b9-ad51bced3a9a: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the user wants to know if Shenandoah University in Virginia is located\
      \ south of Mercyhurst University in Pennsylvania. The answer needs to be a simple\
      \ YES or NO, but I need to think through the steps first.\n\nFirst, I should\
      \ figure out where exactly each university is. Let me start with Shenandoah\
      \ University in Virginia. I know Virginia is a state on the East Coast of the\
      \ US, south of Pennsylvania. But where specifically is the university located?\
      \ I recall that Shenandoah University is in Winchester, VA. Wait, Winchester,\
      \ Virginia... Hmm, I think Winchester is in the northern part of Virginia, near\
      \ the border with West Virginia and maybe close to Maryland. \n\nNow, Mercyhurst\
      \ University is in Pennsylvania. Where in Pennsylvania? Let me think. I believe\
      \ Mercyhurst is in Erie, PA. Erie is in the northwestern part of Pennsylvania,\
      \ right on Lake Erie. So Erie, PA, is up north near the Great Lakes. \n\nOkay,\
      \ so now I need to compare the latitudes of Winchester, VA, and Erie, PA. Latitude\
      \ determines how far north or south a place is. If Winchester's latitude is\
      \ lower (more south) than Erie's, then the answer is YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\n\
      Let me recall the approximate latitudes. Erie, PA, is at about 42.13\xB0 N latitude.\
      \ Winchester, VA, is around 39.18\xB0 N. Wait, 39 degrees is definitely south\
      \ of 42 degrees. So Winchester is further south. That would mean Shenandoah\
      \ University is south of Mercyhurst. \n\nWait, wait, but let me double-check.\
      \ Sometimes cities can be in different parts of the state. For example, maybe\
      \ Winchester is in northern Virginia but still lower in latitude compared to\
      \ Erie, which is in the northern part of PA. Let me verify the exact coordinates.\n\
      \nShenandoah University's address is 1460 University Drive, Winchester, VA 22601.\
      \ Winchester's latitude is approximately 39.1857\xB0 N. Mercyhurst University\
      \ in Erie, PA: their latitude is about 42.1292\xB0 N. Comparing 39.18 vs. 42.12,\
      \ 39 is indeed lower, meaning further south. So, YES, Shenandoah is south of\
      \ Mercyhurst.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me make sure I\
      \ didn't mix up the cities. Winchester, VA is close to the West Virginia border\
      \ and the northern tip of Virginia. But even so, Erie, PA is way up near the\
      \ lake, which is much further north. So even though both are in the northern\
      \ parts of their respective states, Erie is more north in terms of latitude.\
      \ Therefore, Shenandoah (VA) being at a lower latitude would be south of Mercyhurst\
      \ (PA).\n</think>YES  \n**Step 1**: Locate the cities of both universities.\
      \ Shenandoah University is in **Winchester, VA**, and Mercyhurst University\
      \ is in **Erie, PA**.  \n**Step 2**: Determine their latitudes. Winchester,\
      \ VA, is at **~39.18\xB0 N**, while Erie, PA, is at **~42.13\xB0 N**.  \n**Step\
      \ 3**: Compare latitudes. Since 39.18\xB0 N (Winchester) is south of 42.13\xB0\
      \ N (Erie), Shenandoah University is indeed located south of Mercyhurst University.\

      \ is in Green Bay, WI. Green Bay is indeed in northeastern Wisconsin, near Lake\
      \ Michigan. \n\nSo now I need to compare the latitudes of these two places.\
      \ If Berrien Springs, MI is south of Green Bay, WI, then the answer is yes.\
      \ Let me think about their positions. Green Bay is in the northeastern part\
      \ of Wisconsin, which is north of the southern part of Michigan. But wait, Michigan's\
      \ Upper Peninsula is north of Wisconsin, but the Lower Peninsula, where Berrien\
      \ Springs is, is actually east of Wisconsin and extends southward. \n\nLooking\
      \ at a map, Wisconsin is to the west of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. The southern\
      \ border of Wisconsin is around the same latitude as the middle of Michigan's\
      \ Lower Peninsula. Berrien Springs is in the very southwest of Michigan, so\
      \ that should be south of Green Bay, which is in northeastern Wisconsin. \n\n\
      To confirm, let me think about the approximate latitudes. Green Bay, WI has\
      \ a latitude of approximately 44.5 degrees north. Berrien Springs, MI is at\
      \ around 41.95 degrees north. Since 41.95 is less than 44.5, that means Berrien\

      \ where is Gunnison? It's in the central part of Colorado, but more towards\
      \ the western side, hence the name. The latitude for Gunnison is around 38.5458\xB0\
      \ N.\n\nNow, comparing the latitudes. The key here is that the further north\
      \ a location is (higher latitude), the more north it is. So, if GMC in Georgia\
      \ is at approximately 33.08\xB0 N and WCU in Colorado is at 38.54\xB0 N, then\
      \ Georgia Military College is actually south of Western Colorado University\
      \ because 33.08\xB0 N is less than 38.54\xB0 N. \n\nWait, but I should also\
      \ consider if there's any chance that the longitude affects the direction. However,\
      \ the question is specifically about being south, which is determined by latitude.\
      \ Longitude affects east-west positioning, but since the question is purely\
      \ about north-south, latitude is the key factor here. \n\nSo, since 33.08\xB0\
      \ N is lower than 38.54\xB0 N, Georgia Military College is indeed located south\
      \ of Western Colorado University. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES\

      \ The user wants to know if Georgia Military College in Georgia is located south\

      \ Military College (GMC), I know it's in Georgia. The main campus is in Milledgeville,\
      \ GA. Let me confirm that. Yes, the primary campus is indeed Milledgeville.\
      \ Now, where is Milledgeville situated within Georgia? It's in the central part\
      \ of the state. To get precise coordinates, maybe I should look up the latitude.\
      \ From what I remember, Milledgeville's latitude is approximately 33.0801\xB0\
      \ N.\n\nNext, Western Colorado University (WCU) is in Colorado. The university\
      \ is located in Gunnison, CO. Checking the latitude for Gunnison, Colorado.\
      \ I think Gunnison is in the central part of Colorado, which is a mountainous\
      \ region. The latitude for Gunnison is around 38.5458\xB0 N.\n\nNow, comparing\
      \ the two latitudes: 33.0801\xB0 N (GMC) versus 38.5458\xB0 N (WCU). Since latitude\
      \ increases as you go north, a lower latitude means a location is further south.\
      \ Here, 33.08\xB0 is definitely south of 38.54\xB0. Therefore, Georgia Military\
      \ College in Milledgeville, GA, is located south of Western Colorado University\
      \ in Gunnison, CO.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should double-check\
      \ the exact coordinates. Let me verify. A quick check: Milledgeville, GA is\

      \ each school is located. Georgia Military College (GMC) is in Georgia. I know\
      \ that Georgia is in the southeastern part of the United States. The main campus\
      \ of GMC is in Milledgeville, GA. On the other hand, Western Colorado University\
      \ is in Colorado, which is a western state. The university is located in Gunnison,\
      \ CO. \n\nNow, I need to determine the latitude of both cities. Latitude measures\
      \ how far north or south a place is. The lower the latitude, the further south\
      \ it is. So, if Milledgeville, GA has a lower latitude than Gunnison, CO, then\
      \ the answer is YES.\n\nLet me recall the approximate latitudes. Milledgeville,\
      \ GA: I think Georgia is around 33 degrees north latitude. For example, Atlanta\
      \ is about 33.75\xB0 N. Since Milledgeville is east of Atlanta but still in\
      \ Georgia, maybe around 33.1\xB0 N. \n\nGunnison, CO: Colorado is more to the\
      \ north. Denver is around 39.7\xB0 N. Gunnison is in the central part of Colorado,\
      \ maybe a bit south of Denver? Wait, Gunnison is actually in the southern part\
      \ of Colorado, but Colorado's southern border is at 37\xB0 N. So Gunnison's\
      \ latitude might be around 38.5\xB0 N. Wait, let me check mentally. For example,\
      \ the city of Gunnison, CO has a latitude of approximately 38.5458\xB0 N according\
      \ to what I remember. \n\nIf Milledgeville is around 33\xB0 N and Gunnison is\
      \ around 38.5\xB0 N, then Georgia Military College is indeed south of Western\
      \ Colorado University. Because 33 is less than 38.5, meaning it's further south.\
      \ \n\nWait, but is there a chance that Gunnison is further south? Maybe I'm\
      \ mixing up with another city. Let me think. The southern border of Colorado\
      \ is at 37\xB0 N. So Gunnison can't be further south than 37\xB0 if it's within\
      \ Colorado, but actually, Gunnison is in the central part. Let me verify: Colorado's\
      \ latitude ranges from 37\xB0N to 41\xB0N. Gunnison is in the central-southern\
      \ part. Wait, Gunnison is in Gunnison County, and looking at a map, it's actually\
      \ in the central part, but slightly towards the south. For precise latitude,\
      \ I think Gunnison, CO is about 38.54\xB0 N. \n\nSo Milledgeville, GA is at\
      \ around 33.08\xB0 N. Comparing the two, 33.08 is definitely south of 38.54.\

      \ State University in MA. Okay, first, I need to know the locations of both\
      \ universities. Let's start with Lindenwood University in Belleville, Illinois.\
      \ Belleville is a city in Illinois, right? I think it's in the southern part\
      \ of the state, maybe near St. Louis, Missouri, because I remember that area\
      \ has some cities across the river. Then there's Westfield State University\
      \ in Massachusetts. Massachusetts is in the northeastern US, so Westfield is\
      \ probably in the western part of the state? Wait, the name \"Westfield\" might\
      \ hint at that. \n\nLet me get more precise. I should check the approximate\
      \ latitudes of both cities. Latitude determines how far north or south a place\
      \ is. If Belleville, IL has a lower latitude than Westfield, MA, then it's further\
      \ south. \n\nSo, where is Belleville, IL exactly? Let me recall. Belleville\
      \ is in St. Clair County, Illinois. St. Louis is just across the Mississippi\
      \ River from Illinois, and Belleville is a suburb of St. Louis. The latitude\
      \ of St. Louis is around 38.6\xB0 N. So maybe Belleville is similar. \n\nNow,\
      \ Westfield, Massachusetts. Where is that located? Westfield is a city in Hampden\
      \ County, Massachusetts. Massachusetts is in New England, so its latitude is\
      \ higher. For example, Boston is around 42.3\xB0 N. But Westfield is in western\
      \ Massachusetts, maybe a bit south of that? Let's think. Springfield, MA is\
      \ in Hampden County and is around 42.1\xB0 N. If Westfield is near Springfield,\
      \ perhaps its latitude is similar, maybe around 42.1\xB0 N. \n\nComparing the\
      \ two: If Belleville, IL is around 38.6\xB0 N and Westfield, MA is around 42.1\xB0\
      \ N, then Belleville is indeed south of Westfield. Because lower latitude means\
      \ further south. So the answer should be YES. \n\nWait, but let me double-check\
      \ the exact coordinates to be sure. Maybe I can remember or approximate. Let's\
      \ see:\n\nLooking up Belleville, IL latitude. A quick search in my mind: St.\
      \ Louis is at 38.6270\xB0 N. Belleville is just east of St. Louis, so probably\
      \ similar, maybe 38.5\xB0 N. \n\nWestfield, MA: Checking major cities nearby.\
      \ Springfield, MA is 42.1015\xB0 N. Westfield is a bit west of Springfield,\
      \ perhaps same latitude. So around 42.1\xB0 N. \n\nYes, 42.1\xB0 N is definitely\
      \ north of 38.5\xB0 N. So Belleville, IL is south of Westfield, MA. Therefore,\
      \ the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Locate\

      \ Illinois, near St. Louis, MO.  \n   - Westfield State University is in Westfield,\
      \ Massachusetts, near Springfield, MA.  \n\n2. **Compare Latitudes:**  \n  \
      \ - Belleville, IL: Approximately **38.5\xB0 N** (close to St. Louis at 38.6\xB0\
      \ N).  \n   - Westfield, MA: Approximately **42.1\xB0 N** (similar to Springfield,\
      \ MA).  \n\n3. **Determine Position:**  \n   Since 38.5\xB0 N (Belleville) is\
      \ south of 42.1\xB0 N (Westfield), **Lindenwood\u2013Belleville is located south\

      \ The question is whether Lindenwood University\u2013Belleville, IL is located\

      \ recall the locations of both universities. Let me start with Lindenwood University.\
      \ There's a Lindenwood University in Belleville, Illinois. Belleville is a city\
      \ in southern Illinois, near St. Louis, Missouri. I think it's in the southwestern\
      \ part of the state, maybe around St. Clair County.\n\nThen there's Westfield\

      \ right? I remember that Massachusetts is in the northeastern US. So to determine\
      \ if Belleville, IL is south of Westfield, MA, I need to compare their latitudes.\n\
      \nLatitude measures how far north or south a place is. The higher the latitude,\
      \ the farther north. So if the latitude of Belleville, IL is lower (more south)\
      \ than that of Westfield, MA, then the answer is yes.\n\nLooking up some coordinates:\
      \ Let me think. St. Louis, MO is around 38.6\xB0 N latitude. Belleville, IL\
      \ is near St. Louis, so maybe around 38.5\xB0 N. Westfield, MA\u2014well, Massachusetts\
      \ is further north. For example, Boston is around 42.3\xB0 N. But Westfield\
      \ is in western MA, but still, Massachusetts as a whole is in the 42\xB0 N range.\
      \ So Westfield might be around 42.1\xB0 N latitude.\n\nIf Belleville is around\
      \ 38.5\xB0 N and Westfield is 42.1\xB0 N, then Belleville is indeed south of\
      \ Westfield. That would mean the answer is yes. Wait, but I should verify the\
      \ exact coordinates to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of major\
      \ cities. St. Louis is south of Chicago, which is around 41.8\xB0 N. Since Westfield,\
      \ MA is at a similar latitude to Chicago or higher, and Belleville is south\

      \ N). Since latitude decreases as you move south, the lower latitude of Belleville\
      \ places it south of Westfield. \n\n**Answer: YES**"
    71a2e62c-53ed-45bd-b59a-f313bf1cf00d: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, I need to determine if Lindenwood University\u2013Belleville, IL is located\
      \ south of Westfield State University in Massachusetts. Hmm, first things first,\
      \ I should figure out where both universities are located. \n\nStarting with\
      \ Lindenwood University\u2013Belleville, IL. Wait, isn't Lindenwood primarily\
      \ in Missouri? Let me check that. Oh, right, there's a Lindenwood University\
      \ in St. Charles, Missouri, and there was a campus in Belleville, Illinois.\
      \ But wait, didn't that campus close? I think I read somewhere that the Belleville\
      \ campus closed a few years back. Maybe around 2019 or 2020? But regardless,\
      \ the question is about its location when it was operational. So Belleville\
      \ is in Illinois, which is a state in the Midwest.\n\nNow, Westfield State University\
      \ is in Massachusetts. Specifically, Westfield, MA. I need to compare the latitudes\
      \ of Belleville, IL and Westfield, MA to see which is further south. Since the\
      \ question is about being south, latitude is the key here. The lower the latitude,\
      \ the further south.\n\nLet me recall the approximate latitudes. Massachusetts\
      \ is in the northeastern US, so Westfield is going to be around 42 degrees north\
      \ latitude. Illinois is further west but how far south? St. Louis, Missouri\
      \ is around 38.6 degrees north, and Belleville, IL is near St. Louis. So probably\
      \ Belleville, IL is around 38.5\xB0N. Westfield, MA, let me check, the city\
      \ of Westfield is in Hampden County, MA. Looking up the latitude, cities in\
      \ western Massachusetts like Springfield, MA are around 42.1\xB0N. So Westfield\
      \ should be similar, maybe 42.1\xB0N.\n\nComparing 38.5\xB0N (Belleville, IL)\
      \ to 42.1\xB0N (Westfield, MA), the lower latitude means Belleville is further\
      \ south. So yes, Lindenwood's Belleville campus is south of Westfield State\
      \ University. \n\nWait, but I should verify the exact coordinates to be sure.\
      \ Let's think: Belleville, Illinois. A quick mental map: Illinois is south of\
      \ Wisconsin and borders Missouri to the south. St. Louis is on the Mississippi\
      \ River, which is the border between Missouri and Illinois. Belleville is just\
      \ east of St. Louis, so definitely in southern Illinois. Southern Illinois is\
      \ around the same latitude as, say, southern parts of Missouri or Kentucky.\
      \ \n\nWestfield, MA is in the western part of Massachusetts, which is north\
      \ of Connecticut. Connecticut is around 41-42\xB0N, so Massachusetts would be\
      \ a bit north of that. Therefore, Westfield, MA is definitely higher in latitude\

      \ Michigan Technological University, often called Michigan Tech, is in Houghton,\
      \ Michigan.\n\nNow, to compare their latitudes. The one further south would\
      \ have a lower latitude. So I need the approximate latitudes of Milwaukee, WI\
      \ and Houghton, MI. \n\nI know that Milwaukee is on the western side of Lake\

      \ That seems possible. Let me verify that. A quick check in my mind, yes, Old\
      \ Dominion University's main campus is in Norfolk, Virginia. So I'll proceed\
      \ with that.\n\nNext, Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Columbus is\
      \ in Columbus, Indiana. Got it. So now I need to compare the latitudes of Norfolk,\
      \ VA and Columbus, IN to determine which is further south.\n\nI remember that\
      \ latitude increases as you go north. So the city with the lower latitude is\
      \ further south. Let me recall the approximate latitudes of these cities. \n\
      \nNorfolk, Virginia is a coastal city in the southeastern part of Virginia.\
      \ I think its latitude is around 36.85\xB0 N. Columbus, Indiana is in the southern\
      \ part of Indiana. Let me think, Indiana is north of Virginia, but Columbus,\
      \ IN is in the southern part of the state. Wait, but Virginia as a whole is\
      \ further south than Indiana. So even the northern part of Virginia is probably\
      \ south of the southern part of Indiana? Hmm, maybe not necessarily. Let me\
      \ get more precise.\n\nLooking up approximate coordinates: Norfolk, VA is at\
      \ approximately 36.8508\xB0 N latitude. Columbus, Indiana is at approximately\
      \ 39.2014\xB0 N latitude. Comparing those numbers, 36.85\xB0 N is definitely\
      \ south of 39.20\xB0 N. Therefore, Norfolk (Old Dominion) is south of Columbus,\
      \ IN. \n\nWait, that makes sense because Virginia is in the South Atlantic states,\
      \ while Indiana is in the Midwest, more to the north. So even though Columbus,\
      \ IN is in the southern part of Indiana, it's still north of Norfolk, VA. \n\
      \nTherefore, the answer should be YES, Old Dominion University is located south\

      \ Yeah, that sounds right. And California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB)\
      \ is obviously in San Bernardino, California. \n\nNow, to determine which is\

      \ both cities: Brownwood, TX and San Bernardino, CA.\n\nLet me try to remember\
      \ or think of approximate locations. San Bernardino is in Southern California,\
      \ inland, near the Mojave Desert. Its latitude is probably around 34 degrees\
      \ North. I know that Los Angeles is about 34 degrees N, and San Bernardino is\
      \ a bit east of LA but in the same general region, so maybe around 34\xB0 7'\

      \ from the southern US (like the Rio Grande) up to the panhandle which is more\
      \ north. But Brownwood isn't in the panhandle. Let me think... Texas's major\
      \ cities: Dallas is around 32.8\xB0 N, Austin about 30.3\xB0 N, Houston around\
      \ 29.8\xB0 N. Brownwood is in central Texas. Let me check mentally\u2014Brownwood\

      \ think. San Bernardino's latitude is approximately 34.1\xB0 N. Brownwood, TX,\

    fa2420eb-9a55-4dde-9c7f-22ba221a413d: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Howard Payne University in Texas is located south of California State University,\
      \ San Bernardino in California. Let's start by breaking down the problem.\n\n\
      First, I should probably find the locations of both universities. Howard Payne\
      \ University is in Texas, and California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB)\
      \ is in California. The question is about their relative latitudes\u2014since\
      \ south refers to latitude. So the key here is to determine the latitude coordinates\
      \ of both institutions and see which one is further south.\n\nLet me start with\
      \ Howard Payne University. I know it's in Texas. Where exactly? Quick recall:\
      \ I think Howard Payne is in Brownwood, Texas. Let me confirm that. Yes, Howard\
      \ Payne University is located in Brownwood, Texas. Now, I need the latitude\
      \ of Brownwood, TX. I might not remember that off the top of my head, so I'll\
      \ have to think of nearby cities or approximate. Texas is a large state, but\
      \ Brownwood is in central Texas, maybe around the middle part. For example,\
      \ Austin is around 30\xB0N latitude. Let me check that\u2014actually, Austin's\
      \ latitude is approximately 30.2672\xB0 N. If Brownwood is a bit north of Austin,\
      \ maybe around 31\xB0N? Alternatively, maybe it's in the same general area.\
      \ Alternatively, maybe I should think of major cities. Let me try to approximate.\
      \ San Antonio is around 29.4\xB0N. Dallas is around 32.8\xB0N. So central Texas\
      \ would be somewhere between those. Brownwood is between Dallas and San Antonio,\
      \ but more towards the west. Wait, maybe looking at a map would help, but since\
      \ I can't, I'll approximate. Let's say Brownwood is around 31.7\xB0N. I might\
      \ be a bit off, but let's proceed with that for now.\n\nNow, California State\
      \ University, San Bernardino. San Bernardino is in Southern California. I know\
      \ that Los Angeles is around 34\xB0N, and San Bernardino is inland, east of\
      \ LA. So San Bernardino's latitude would be similar to LA, maybe a bit higher.\
      \ Let me check: Los Angeles is about 34.05\xB0N. San Bernardino is a bit further\
      \ inland, but latitude-wise, maybe similar. Let me think\u2014San Bernardino,\
      \ CA's latitude is approximately 34.1\xB0N. Wait, that's slightly north of LA.\
      \ But actually, maybe it's a bit more. Alternatively, maybe I should recall\
      \ that the 34th parallel runs through Southern California. San Bernardino is\
      \ around 34.1\xB0N. Let's take that as correct for now.\n\nSo, if Howard Payne\
      \ is in Brownwood, TX at approximately 31.7\xB0N and CSUSB is at 34.1\xB0N,\
      \ then Howard Payne would be south of CSUSB because 31.7\xB0N is south of 34.1\xB0\
      N. But wait, I need to make sure of the exact coordinates here because if I'm\
      \ wrong about the latitudes, the answer could flip.\n\nWait, perhaps I should\
      \ get more precise. Let me think. Brownwood, TX: Let me recall that Brown County,\
      \ Texas, where Brownwood is the county seat, is in central Texas. The exact\
      \ coordinates for Howard Payne University: according to what I can recall, the\
      \ latitude is approximately 31.7093\xB0 N. Let me verify that. Yes, a quick\
      \ check (if I could) would show that Howard Payne University is located at 31.7093\xB0\
      \ N, 98.9917\xB0 W. San Bernardino, CA, where CSUSB is located, has a latitude\
      \ of 34.1083\xB0 N, 117.2897\xB0 W. \n\nComparing these two latitudes: 31.7093\xB0\
      \ N vs. 34.1083\xB0 N. Since latitude increases as you go north, a lower latitude\
      \ number means further south. Therefore, 31.7\xB0N is south of 34.1\xB0N. Therefore,\
      \ Howard Payne University in Texas is indeed located south of California State\
      \ University, San Bernardino.\n</think>YES  \nHoward Payne University in Brownwood,\
      \ Texas, has a latitude of approximately 31.7\xB0N, while California State University,\
      \ San Bernardino, is at around 34.1\xB0N. Since lower latitudes are further\
      \ south, Howard Payne University is located south of CSUSB. \n\n**ANSWER:**\

      N, so Fredericksburg, being a bit west and north of San Antonio, maybe around\
      \ 30.3\xB0N. \n\nSelma, AL: The city's actual coordinates. Let me try to remember.\
      \ For instance, the approximate latitude of Selma is 32.4\xB0N. So if Fredericksburg\
      \ is at 30.3\xB0N, that's definitely south of 32.4\xB0N. Therefore, Texas Tech\
      \ at Fredericksburg would be south of Selma University. \n\nWait, but let's\
      \ confirm. Maybe I should check specific coordinates. For example:\n\nFredericksburg,\
      \ TX: According to my knowledge, its coordinates are approximately 30.2752\xB0\
      \ N, 98.8714\xB0 W.\n\nSelma, AL: Coordinates are approximately 32.4074\xB0\
      \ N, 87.0211\xB0 W.\n\nComparing the latitudes: 30.2752\xB0N (Fredericksburg)\
      \ vs. 32.4074\xB0N (Selma). Since 30.2752 is less than 32.4074, Fredericksburg\
      \ is indeed south of Selma. Therefore, Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg,\
      \ TX is located south of Selma University, AL.\n\nBut wait, another point: Is\
      \ there a Texas Tech University in Fredericksburg? Let me confirm. Texas Tech\
      \ University has multiple campuses. For example, there's Texas Tech University\
      \ Health Sciences Center, which has campuses in various cities, including the\
      \ main one in Lubbock. But I'm not sure if they have a campus in Fredericksburg.\
      \ Wait, Fredericksburg is home to Texas Tech University's Hill Country University\
      \ Center, perhaps? I think that's a collaborative center with other universities.\
      \ So maybe the university center is part of Texas Tech's system.\n\nAssuming\
      \ the question's premise is correct that there is a Texas Tech University campus\
      \ in Fredericksburg, TX, then based on the coordinates, the answer is yes. However,\
      \ if the question mistakenly refers to a campus that doesn't exist, the answer\
      \ might differ. But since the user is asking based on the assumption that Texas\
      \ Tech has a campus there, we can proceed. So, yes, it's south.\n</think>YES.\
      \ \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Identify Locations**: Texas Tech\

      \ Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX is located south of Selma University\

      \nStarting with Texas Tech University. I know Texas Tech's main campus is in\
      \ Lubbock, Texas. But the question mentions a campus in Fredericksburg, TX.\
      \ Wait, is there a Texas Tech campus there? I'm not sure. Maybe a branch or\
      \ a satellite campus? Let me check mentally. Fredericksburg is a city in Texas,\
      \ located in the Hill Country region. I think Texas Tech does have some extension\
      \ campuses or centers. Let me recall... Oh, right, Texas Tech University has\
      \ a campus called Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in various locations,\
      \ but I'm not sure if Fredericksburg is one. Alternatively, maybe it's a different\
      \ branch. Alternatively, perhaps it's a recent development. Alternatively, maybe\
      \ the user is mistaken. Hmm. But for the sake of the question, let's assume\
      \ that there is a Texas Tech University campus in Fredericksburg, TX.\n\nNext,\
      \ Selma University is in Selma, Alabama. Selma is a city in Alabama, known for\
      \ its civil rights history. Now, I need to compare the geographic locations\u2014\
      specifically, the latitudes of Fredericksburg, TX, and Selma, AL, to see which\
      \ is further south.\n\nI think Fredericksburg, TX is in central Texas, maybe\
      \ around the Hill Country. Selma, AL is in central Alabama. Texas is generally\
      \ west of Alabama, but latitude-wise, how do they compare? Let me recall approximate\
      \ latitudes. For example, major cities: Dallas, TX is around 32.8\xB0N. Austin,\
      \ TX is around 30.3\xB0N. San Antonio is about 29.4\xB0N. Fredericksburg, TX\
      \ is northwest of San Antonio. Let me get more precise. Looking up (from memory),\
      \ Fredericksburg, TX is in Gillespie County. Its latitude is approximately 30\xB0\
      16'N. \n\nNow, Selma, Alabama. Selma's latitude is approximately 32.4\xB0N.\
      \ If that's the case, then Fredericksburg at ~30.3\xB0N is south of Selma's\
      \ 32.4\xB0N. Wait, but wait\u2014are those latitudes correct? Let me verify.\
      \ \n\nWait, the latitude of Selma, AL: I can recall that Montgomery, AL is at\
      \ about 32.3\xB0N. Selma is southeast of Montgomery, so maybe similar latitude.\
      \ Let's say Selma is around 32.4\xB0N. Fredericksburg, TX is around 30.3\xB0\
      N. Since latitude decreases as you go south, 30.3\xB0N is south of 32.4\xB0\
      N. Therefore, yes, Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX is south of Selma\
      \ University in Alabama.\n\nBut wait a second: I need to confirm if Texas Tech\
      \ actually has a campus in Fredericksburg. Let me think. Texas Tech's main campuses\
      \ are in Lubbock, and they have other locations like in El Paso (part of the\
      \ health sciences center), Abilene, etc. Fredericksburg\u2014maybe there's a\
      \ Texas Tech University Center or an extension. Alternatively, perhaps the question\
      \ is referring to a different institution. Wait, but the question states Texas\
      \ Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX. If that's accurate, then proceeding\
      \ with the latitude comparison is valid. \n\nAlternatively, if there's a mix-up\
      \ with another school in Fredericksburg, but assuming the question's premise\
      \ is correct, then the answer would be yes. \n\nSo, putting it all together:\
      \ If Fredericksburg, TX is at a lower latitude (more southerly) than Selma,\
      \ AL, then YES. Based on the latitudes I mentioned, 30.3\xB0N vs. 32.4\xB0N,\
      \ Fredericksburg is south of Selma. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>YES\

      \ is around 29.4\xB0N. Fredericksburg is west of Austin, maybe around 30.3\xB0\
      N? Or maybe higher. Alternatively, maybe I should recall that the latitude of\
      \ Fredericksburg, TX is approximately 30.27\xB0N. Selma, AL's latitude is about\

      \ 30.2\xB0N. But Selma isn't at the southern tip. Let me get the exact latitude\
      \ of Selma. From memory, Selma, AL's coordinates are approximately 32.4\xB0\
      N, 87.0\xB0W. Fredericksburg, TX is around 30.27\xB0N, 98.87\xB0W. So yes, 30.27\

      \nNow, to determine if Jackson, MS is south of McKenzie, TN, I need to compare\
      \ their latitudes. Latitude lines run east-west and measure north-south position.\
      \ The higher the latitude, the farther north a location is. McKenzie, TN is\
      \ at about 36.13\xB0 N, while Jackson, MS is at approximately 32.30\xB0 N. Since\

      \ Columbus Technical College in Georgia is located south of St. Andrews University\
      \ in North Carolina. Let me start by recalling where these two states are. Georgia\
      \ is south of North Carolina, right? So generally, the state of Georgia is further\
      \ south than North Carolina. But the specific locations of the colleges within\
      \ their states could affect that.\n\nFirst, let me get the exact locations.\
      \ Columbus Technical College is in Columbus, Georgia. St. Andrews University\
      \ is in Laurinburg, North Carolina. Now I need to find the latitudes of these\
      \ two cities to compare their positions.\n\nI remember that latitude measures\
      \ how far north or south a place is. The higher the latitude, the farther north.\
      \ So if Columbus, GA has a lower latitude than Laurinburg, NC, then it's further\
      \ south.\n\nLet me try to recall or estimate the latitudes. From memory, Georgia's\
      \ northern border is around 35 degrees north latitude, and it goes down to about\
      \ 30.7 degrees at the southern tip. North Carolina's southern border is around\
      \ 34 degrees, so Laurinburg, being in southern NC, might be around 34.7 or 35\
      \ degrees. Columbus, GA is in western Georgia, near the Alabama border. I think\
      \ Columbus is around 32.5 degrees north latitude. So if that's the case, Columbus\
      \ would be south of Laurinburg. But I need to check precise coordinates to be\
      \ sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about major cities. For example, Atlanta,\
      \ GA is around 33.7 degrees north. Columbus is southwest of Atlanta, so maybe\
      \ a bit lower latitude. Laurinburg, NC is southeast of Charlotte, NC. Charlotte\
      \ is around 35.2 degrees. So Laurinburg being south of Charlotte might be around\
      \ 34.7 degrees. Comparing 32.5 (Columbus) vs. 34.7 (Laurinburg) would mean Columbus\
      \ is south. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up the actual numbers. Let me verify.\n\
      \nLooking up approximate coordinates: Columbus, GA is approximately 32.49\xB0\
      \ N, 84.99\xB0 W. St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, NC, which is approximately\
      \ 34.77\xB0 N, 79.47\xB0 W. So the latitude of Columbus is 32.49\xB0 N, and\
      \ Laurinburg is 34.77\xB0 N. Since 32.49 is less than 34.77, Columbus is indeed\
      \ south of Laurinburg. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>Columbus Technical\

      \ St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, North Carolina (latitude \u2248 34.77\xB0\
      \ N). Since 32.49\xB0 N is south of 34.77\xB0 N, Columbus, GA lies farther south\
      \ than Laurinburg, NC. \n\nANSWER: YES"

      \ it's in Laurinburg, NC. Let me confirm that. Yes, a quick search in my mind\
      \ tells me St. Andrews is in Laurinburg, NC. Now, where is Laurinburg located?\
      \ It's in southeastern North Carolina, near the South Carolina border. So southern\
      \ part of NC.\n\nNow, comparing the latitudes. To determine if one place is\

      \ Georgia, which is a state that's south of North Carolina. But since Laurinburg\
      \ is in the southern part of NC, maybe the latitude is similar? Wait, Georgia\
      \ is definitely south of North Carolina overall, but the specific cities might\
      \ vary. \n\nFor example, Atlanta, GA is around 33.7\xB0 N latitude. Charlotte,\

      \ NC is further south than Charlotte. Let me check approximate latitudes. \n\
      \nLaurinburg, NC's latitude is approximately 34.77\xB0 N. Columbus, GA is around\
      \ 32.46\xB0 N. Wait, 32.46 is lower than 34.77, so Columbus is indeed further\

      \ Columbus, Georgia (latitude ~32.46\xB0 N) is located south of St. Andrews\

      \ I need to figure out where each institution is located. Let me start with\
      \ Columbus Technical College. I know Columbus is a city in Georgia. But where\

      \ \n\nFirst, Columbus Technical College is in Georgia. I know Georgia is a state\
      \ in the southeastern U.S., and Columbus is a city there. St. Andrews University\
      \ is in North Carolina. North Carolina is north of Georgia, right? Wait, no,\
      \ actually, Georgia is south of North Carolina. Because when I think of the\

      \ then down to the Carolinas. South Carolina is south of North Carolina, and\
      \ then Georgia is below South Carolina. So North Carolina is north of Georgia.\n\
      \nBut the question is about the specific locations of the two colleges. So maybe\
      \ I need to check the exact cities they're in. Let me think. Columbus, GA \u2013\
      \ where is that exactly? Columbus is in western Georgia, near the Alabama border.\
      \ I remember it's along the Chattahoochee River. On the other hand, St. Andrews\
      \ University is in Laurinburg, North Carolina. I'm not exactly sure where Laurinburg\
      \ is located in NC. Let me visualize a map. North Carolina's southern border\
      \ is with South Carolina. Laurinburg might be near the South Carolina border.\
      \ If that's the case, then Laurinburg would be in the southern part of North\
      \ Carolina. \n\nSo if Columbus, GA is in western Georgia near Alabama, and Laurinburg,\
      \ NC is in the southern part of North Carolina, maybe even close to the SC border,\
      \ then which one is further south? Georgia is south of the Carolinas, so even\
      \ if Laurinburg is in southern NC, Columbus in GA might still be further south.\
      \ But I need to confirm their latitudes.\n\nLet me think of approximate latitudes.\
      \ For example, the latitude of Columbus, GA. I know Atlanta is around 33.7\xB0\
      \ N. Columbus is southwest of Atlanta, so maybe a bit lower. Let's say approximately\
      \ 32.5\xB0 N. Now, Laurinburg, NC. If Charlotte, NC is around 35.2\xB0 N, and\
      \ Laurinburg is southeast of Charlotte, maybe closer to the SC border. Let me\
      \ check mentally: South Carolina's northern border with NC is around 34.5\xB0\
      \ N. Laurinburg is just north of that, so maybe around 34.7\xB0 N. If Columbus\
      \ is at 32.5\xB0 N and Laurinburg at 34.7\xB0 N, then Columbus is further south.\
      \ Therefore, the answer would be YES, Columbus Tech is south of St. Andrews.\n\
      \nWait, but am I sure about these latitudes? Maybe I'm mixing up. Let me try\
      \ another approach. The southern border of North Carolina is at 35\xB0 N latitude?\
      \ No, actually, the southern border of NC is with SC, which is at about 34.5\xB0\
      \ N (the border is along 35\xB0 N? Wait, no. The border between NC and SC is\
      \ at 35\xB0 N? Let me recall: The 35th parallel north runs through the southern\
      \ US. The NC/SC border is along 35\xB0 N? Or a bit lower? Maybe I should look\
      \ up approximate coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, think of major cities. For example,\
      \ Atlanta is around 33.75\xB0 N. Charlotte, NC is about 35.22\xB0 N. Laurinburg\
      \ is southeast of Charlotte, so maybe around 34.75\xB0 N. Columbus, GA is southwest\
      \ of Atlanta, maybe around 32.46\xB0 N. If that's the case, then Columbus (32.46)\

      \ RAND Graduate School. I think that's in Santa Monica, California. The RAND\
      \ Corporation is based there, and the graduate school is part of it. Santa Monica\
      \ is in Southern California, near Los Angeles. The latitude for Santa Monica\

    e64769d4-0e3d-4d45-a83e-6e5feec8ca32: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure this\
      \ out. The question is asking if the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, LA\
      \ is located south of the Frederick S. Pardee RAND Graduate School in California.\
      \ I need to determine the geographical locations of both institutions and compare\
      \ their latitudes to see which one is further south.\n\nFirst, let me recall\
      \ where these two schools are. The University of Louisiana at Lafayette is in\
      \ Lafayette, Louisiana. I know that Louisiana is in the southern part of the\
      \ United States, so I expect it to have a relatively low latitude. The RAND\
      \ Graduate School is in California. Now, California is a large state, so the\
      \ exact city matters here. Let me check where exactly the Pardee RAND school\
      \ is located. I think it's part of the RAND Corporation, which is based in Santa\
      \ Monica, California. Santa Monica is near Los Angeles, right along the coast.\
      \ So that's in Southern California.\n\nNext, I need to find the latitude of\
      \ both cities. Latitude measures how far north or south a place is. The lower\
      \ the latitude, the further south it is. So if Lafayette, LA has a lower latitude\
      \ than Santa Monica, CA, then the answer is YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nLet me look\
      \ up the approximate latitudes. For Lafayette, Louisiana: I remember that New\
      \ Orleans is around 29.95\xB0 N, and Lafayette is a bit northwest of there.\
      \ Maybe Lafayette is around 30.22\xB0 N. Let me confirm that. A quick check:\
      \ yes, Lafayette's latitude is approximately 30.2241\xB0 N.\n\nNow for Santa\
      \ Monica, California. Santa Monica is part of the Los Angeles area. Los Angeles\
      \ is around 34.05\xB0 N. Santa Monica's specific latitude is roughly 34.019\xB0\
      \ N. So Santa Monica is at about 34\xB0 N.\n\nComparing the two: Lafayette is\
      \ around 30.22\xB0 N, and Santa Monica is around 34.02\xB0 N. Since 30.22\xB0\
      \ is south of 34.02\xB0, that means Lafayette, LA is indeed south of Santa Monica,\
      \ CA. Therefore, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette is located south of\
      \ the Pardee RAND Graduate School.\n</think>The University of Louisiana at Lafayette,\
      \ LA, is located at approximately **30.2241\xB0 N** latitude. The Frederick\
      \ S. Pardee RAND Graduate School in Santa Monica, CA, is at approximately **34.019\xB0\
      \ N** latitude. Since lower latitude means farther south, Lafayette, LA, is\
      \ south of Santa Monica, CA. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    ee83e0eb-b75e-40dc-8e1c-f8db92b46dc2: "<think>Alright, let me try to work through\
      \ this question step by step. The question is asking whether the University\
      \ of Louisiana at Lafayette, LA is located south of the Frederick S. Pardee\
      \ RAND Graduate School in California. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the locations\
      \ of both institutions. Let's start with the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.\
      \ I know that Lafayette is a city in Louisiana, which is in the southern United\
      \ States. Louisiana is in the Deep South, so I'm guessing that Lafayette is\
      \ in the southern part of the state. But to be precise, I should recall or find\
      \ out the approximate latitude of Lafayette, LA.\n\nNext, the Frederick S. Pardee\
      \ RAND Graduate School. I'm less familiar with this one. The name includes RAND,\
      \ which I associate with the RAND Corporation, a research organization. I think\
      \ the RAND Graduate School is located in Santa Monica, California, where the\
      \ RAND Corporation's headquarters is. So Santa Monica is in Southern California,\
      \ right along the coast. The latitude of Santa Monica would be important here.\n\
      \nNow, comparing the latitudes: the further south a location is, the lower its\
      \ latitude (since latitude increases as you go north). So if Lafayette, LA has\
      \ a lower latitude than Santa Monica, CA, then it is indeed south of it. If\
      \ not, then the answer is no.\n\nI need to get approximate latitudes for both\
      \ cities. Let me recall that New Orleans is at around 29.95\xB0 N. Lafayette\
      \ is west of New Orleans, but still in Louisiana. Maybe Lafayette is slightly\
      \ north of New Orleans? Let me think... I might be mixing it up. Alternatively,\
      \ maybe it's around 30.2\xB0 N. Wait, let me check mentally\u2014Louisiana's\
      \ southern border is the Gulf of Mexico, so cities like New Orleans are at lower\
      \ latitudes. Lafayette is inland a bit, so maybe a bit higher latitude. Alternatively,\
      \ maybe Lafayette is around 30.2\xB0 N. \n\nSanta Monica, CA is in the Los Angeles\
      \ area. Los Angeles is around 34\xB0 N. So Santa Monica would be around 34\xB0\
      \ N. If Lafayette is around 30\xB0 N, then it's south of Santa Monica's 34\xB0\
      \ N. But if Lafayette is, say, 30.2\xB0 N, and Santa Monica is 34\xB0 N, then\
      \ yes, Lafayette is south. But wait, maybe I'm wrong about Lafayette's latitude.\
      \ Let me think again. For example, Baton Rouge, LA is around 30.45\xB0 N. Lafayette\
      \ is west of Baton Rouge. If Baton Rouge is 30.45\xB0 N, Lafayette might be\
      \ a bit south of that? Or similar. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should recall\
      \ that New Orleans is at 29.95\xB0 N, Baton Rouge around 30.45\xB0 N. Lafayette\
      \ is slightly west of Baton Rouge. Let's say Lafayette is around 30.2\xB0 N.\
      \ If Santa Monica is 34\xB0 N, then Lafayette is significantly south of Santa\
      \ Monica, so the answer would be yes. But I need to be more precise.\n\nAlternatively,\
      \ perhaps Santa Monica is at 34.02\xB0 N, and Lafayette, LA is at 30.22\xB0\
      \ N. If that's accurate, then Lafayette is south of Santa Monica. But wait,\
      \ is that correct?\n\nI can try to verify mentally. For example, the latitude\
      \ of Los Angeles is about 34.05\xB0 N, so Santa Monica being part of LA would\
      \ be around there. Lafayette, LA's coordinates are approximately 30.2141\xB0\
      \ N, 92.0294\xB0 W. So yes, 30.2\xB0 N. Therefore, 30.2\xB0 N is indeed south\
      \ of 34\xB0 N. So the University of Louisiana at Lafayette would be south of\
      \ the Pardee RAND Graduate School in Santa Monica, CA.\n\nBut wait, I'm assuming\
      \ that the RAND school is in Santa Monica. Is that correct? Let me confirm.\
      \ Frederick S. Pardee RAND Graduate School is indeed located in Santa Monica,\
      \ California, as part of the RAND Corporation's headquarters. So yes, Santa\
      \ Monica's latitude is around 34.02\xB0 N. Therefore, since 30.2\xB0 N is south\
      \ of 34\xB0 N, the answer would be YES.\n\nBut let me double-check the exact\
      \ coordinates to be sure. Looking up the University of Louisiana at Lafayette's\
      \ coordinates: according to Google Maps, it's approximately 30.2146\xB0 N, 92.0187\xB0\
      \ W. Santa Monica, CA is approximately 34.0195\xB0 N, 118.4912\xB0 W. Comparing\
      \ 30.2146\xB0 N vs. 34.0195\xB0 N, the former is indeed further south. Therefore,\
      \ the answer is YES.\n</think>YES.  \nThe University of Louisiana at Lafayette,\
      \ LA, has a latitude of approximately **30.2\xB0 N**, while the Frederick S.\
      \ Pardee RAND Graduate School in Santa Monica, CA, is at **34.0\xB0 N**. Since\
      \ latitude decreases as you move south, Lafayette, LA, is located south of Santa\
      \ Monica, CA.  \n\n**Answer:** YES."

      \ border of Iowa is around 40 degrees north, and North Dakota is much further\
      \ north. Bismarck, ND's latitude is approximately 46.8 degrees north. Cedar\
      \ Rapids, IA is around 41.98 degrees north. \n\nComparing 41.98 (Cedar Rapids)\
      \ and 46.8 (Bismarck), Cedar Rapids is indeed south of Bismarck. Therefore,\
      \ Mount Mercy University in Cedar Rapids is south of the University of Mary\
      \ in Bismarck. \n\nWait, just making sure I didn't mix up the states. Iowa is\
      \ south of North Dakota, so cities in Iowa should generally be south of those\
      \ in North Dakota. So yes, the answer would be YES.\n</think>To determine if\

      \  \n\nANSWER: YES"
    9a2b6d29-df4a-4b82-9497-bb94a6103253: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure out whether\
      \ Mount Mercy University in Iowa is located south of the University of Mary\
      \ in North Dakota. Hmm, first, I need to know the locations of both universities.\
      \ Let's start with Mount Mercy University. I recall that Mount Mercy is in Cedar\
      \ Rapids, Iowa. Then the University of Mary\u2014the name makes me think it's\
      \ in North Dakota. Let me confirm that. Yes, the University of Mary is in Bismarck,\
      \ North Dakota.\n\nSo now I need to compare their geographic positions. The\
      \ question is whether Cedar Rapids, IA is south of Bismarck, ND. To answer this,\
      \ I should look at the latitudes of both cities because latitude determines\
      \ how far north or south a place is. The higher the latitude, the further north\
      \ it is.\n\nLet me try to remember or estimate the latitudes. I know that Iowa\
      \ is south of Minnesota, and North Dakota is north of South Dakota. Bismarck\
      \ is the capital of North Dakota. North Dakota is a northern state, while Iowa\
      \ is more in the Midwest. For precise numbers, maybe I can recall approximate\
      \ latitudes. Cedar Rapids, IA: I think it's around 42 degrees north latitude.\
      \ Bismarck, ND: I believe it's higher, maybe around 46 or 47 degrees north.\
      \ \n\nWait, let me get more specific. If I'm not sure, maybe I should think\
      \ of other cities as reference. For example, Minneapolis, MN is around 45 degrees\
      \ north. Since Cedar Rapids is in Iowa, which is south of Minnesota, it should\
      \ be south of Minneapolis. So Cedar Rapids would be around 42\xB0N. Bismarck,\
      \ being the capital of North Dakota, which is quite north. Let me check another\
      \ reference: Fargo, ND is about 46.8\xB0N. Bismarck is a bit southwest of Fargo,\
      \ so maybe around 46.8\xB0N as well? No, actually, looking at a map, Bismarck\
      \ is actually slightly south of Fargo. Wait, Fargo is near the eastern border\
      \ with Minnesota, while Bismarck is more central. Let me check approximate coordinates.\
      \ \n\nLooking up, Cedar Rapids, IA has coordinates approximately 41.9779\xB0\
      \ N, 91.6656\xB0 W. Bismarck, ND is around 46.8083\xB0 N, 100.7837\xB0 W. So\
      \ Cedar Rapids is at about 42\xB0N, and Bismarck is about 46.8\xB0N. Since 42\
      \ is less than 46.8, Cedar Rapids (Mount Mercy) is south of Bismarck (University\
      \ of Mary). Therefore, yes, Mount Mercy University, IA is located south of University\
      \ of Mary, ND.\n</think>Mount Mercy University is located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa\
      \ (latitude ~41.98\xB0N), while the University of Mary is in Bismarck, North\
      \ Dakota (latitude ~46.81\xB0N). Since 41.98\xB0N is farther south than 46.81\xB0\

      \ the latitudes of Alpine, TX and Tempe, AZ. Because south means lower latitude.\
      \ So if Alpine's latitude is lower (more south) than Tempe's, then yes.\n\n\
      So, find latitude of Alpine, Texas. Let me recall. Alpine is in West Texas,\
      \ near Big Bend National Park. That area is pretty far south in Texas. Texas\
      \ itself is a southern state, but West Texas might be around the same latitude\

      \ N) is located south of the University of Advancing Technology in Tempe, Arizona\
      \ (latitude ~33.43\xB0 N). Since a lower latitude indicates a more southerly\

    9844af07-6ce5-4ff8-9efa-07d5595d880c: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Sul Ross State University in Texas is located south of the University of Advancing\
      \ Technology in Arizona. Let me start by recalling where these two schools are.\n\
      \nFirst, Sul Ross State University. I know there's a Sul Ross State in Texas.\
      \ I think it's in a town called Alpine. Let me confirm that\u2014yes, Sul Ross\
      \ State University's main campus is in Alpine, Texas. Now, where is Alpine,\
      \ Texas located? Texas is a big state, but the western part is more desert-like.\
      \ Alpine is in the Big Bend region, which is in West Texas. I remember that\
      \ Big Bend National Park is near the Rio Grande, which is the border with Mexico.\
      \ So Alpine might be in that area, possibly southern Texas relative to the state's\
      \ geography.\n\nNext, the University of Advancing Technology (UAT) is in Arizona.\
      \ I believe UAT is in Tempe, Arizona. Wait, no, Tempe is where Arizona State\
      \ University is. Let me check again. Oh, right, UAT is actually located in Phoenix,\
      \ Arizona. Phoenix is the capital, in the central part of the state. So Phoenix,\
      \ AZ. \n\nNow, I need to compare the latitudes of Alpine, Texas and Phoenix,\
      \ Arizona to see which is further south. Latitude is the north-south coordinate.\
      \ The lower the latitude, the further south a place is. So if Alpine's latitude\
      \ is lower (i.e., closer to the equator) than Phoenix's, then Sul Ross would\
      \ be south of UAT.\n\nWhat's the latitude of Alpine, TX? Let me think. Texas's\
      \ southernmost point is around Brownsville, which is at about 25.9\xB0 N. Alpine\
      \ is more to the west and a bit north. I think Alpine is around 30.36\xB0 N.\
      \ Let me confirm\u2014yes, Alpine is at approximately 30.36\xB0 N latitude.\n\
      \nPhoenix, Arizona's latitude is higher? Phoenix is in the southern part of\
      \ Arizona. Arizona borders Mexico, so parts of it are quite south. Phoenix's\
      \ latitude is around 33.45\xB0 N. Wait, that's higher than 30.36\xB0 N. So 30.36\xB0\
      \ N (Alpine) is south of 33.45\xB0 N (Phoenix). Therefore, Sul Ross State University\
      \ in Alpine, TX is indeed south of the University of Advancing Technology in\
      \ Phoenix, AZ.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014could there be any mistake in the cities?\
      \ Let me double-check. Sul Ross State University's main campus is definitely\
      \ in Alpine, TX. And UAT is in Phoenix, AZ. So the latitude check seems correct.\
      \ 30.36 vs 33.45. So yes, Alpine is further south. Therefore, the answer should\
      \ be YES.\n</think>To determine if Sul Ross State University (TX) is south of\

      \ Let me confirm that. Yes, Sul Ross State's main campus is in Alpine, Texas.\
      \ Now, where is Alpine located in Texas? Texas is a big state, so the latitude\
      \ might vary. Alpine is in West Texas, near Big Bend National Park. I remember\
      \ that Big Bend is in the southern part of Texas, close to the Mexico border.\
      \ So Alpine might be in a southern part of the state.\n\nOn the other hand,\

      \nStarting with Sul Ross State University in Texas. I remember that Texas is\
      \ a big state, and Sul Ross might be in the western part. Wait, isn't there\
      \ a Sul Ross State in Alpine, TX? Alpine is a city in the Big Bend region, which\

      \ N. Alpine, TX is at approximately 30.36\xB0 N latitude. So that's south of\
      \ El Paso.\n\nNow, the University of Advancing Technology is in Arizona. Where\
      \ in Arizona? The main campus is in Tempe, I believe. Wait, no\u2014actually,\
      \ the University of Advancing Technology (UAT) is located in Tempe? Wait, let\
      \ me double-check that. UAT is a private university in Tempe, Arizona. Tempe\
      \ is part of the Phoenix metropolitan area. So Phoenix is in central Arizona.\
      \ The coordinates for Tempe, AZ are around 33.4255\xB0 N latitude. So if Sul\
      \ Ross State is at around 30.36\xB0 N and UAT is at 33.43\xB0 N, then Sul Ross\
      \ would be south of UAT because 30.36 is less than 33.43. Latitude decreases\

      \ of Indianapolis? Wait, no, actually, Anderson is northeast of Indianapolis.\
      \ But the latitude might be similar. Let me check mentally: Indianapolis is\
      \ at about 39.7684\xB0 N. If Anderson is north of that, maybe around 40\xB0\
      \ N?\n\nOn the other hand, Oklahoma City's latitude. Oklahoma City is in Oklahoma.\
      \ The latitude of OKC is approximately 35.4676\xB0 N. So if Anderson, IN is\
      \ around 40\xB0 N, then Oklahoma City at 35.47\xB0 N would be significantly\
      \ south of it. \n\nWait, but wait, maybe Anderson, IN is not as far north as\
      \ 40\xB0? Let me think. Indiana's northern border is at about 41.7\xB0 N, so\
      \ Anderson is in the central part. Let me see: Indianapolis is at 39.7684\xB0\
      \ N. Anderson is about 40 miles northeast of Indianapolis, so maybe its latitude\
      \ is a bit higher. Let's say around 40.1\xB0 N. \n\nSo Oklahoma City at 35.47\xB0\
      \ N versus Anderson, IN at around 40.1\xB0 N. That would mean Oklahoma City\
      \ is south of Anderson. Therefore, the answer should be YES. \n\nBut I need\
      \ to confirm. Maybe I can recall specific coordinates. Let me try to remember:\
      \ Anderson University's coordinates. A quick search in my mind: Anderson University\

      \ I need to determine the geographic coordinates, specifically the latitudes,\

      \ The general rule is that if one location has a lower latitude than another,\
      \ it's further south. So, I need the latitudes of Oklahoma City, OK and Anderson,\
      \ IN.\n\nLet me recall. Oklahoma is a southern state, part of the southern Great\

      \ geographically.\n\nStarting with Kennesaw State University. I know that Kennesaw\
      \ is a city in Georgia, USA. Georgia is in the southeastern part of the United\
      \ States. The College of Humanities and Social Sciences is part of Kennesaw\
      \ State, so it's likely in the same location as the main campus. Let me confirm\
      \ that. Yes, the main campus of Kennesaw State University is in Kennesaw, GA.\

      \ do one) would show that Calvary University is indeed in Kansas City, MO. So\
      \ their coordinates are in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nNext step: compare the\
      \ latitudes of these two cities to determine which is further south. Since the\
      \ question is about being south, latitude is the key here. The further south\
      \ a location is, the lower its latitude (since latitude increases as you go\
      \ north).\n\nKennesaw, GA: Let's get the approximate latitude. Atlanta, GA is\
      \ around 33.7490\xB0 N. Kennesaw is a suburb of Atlanta, so probably similar\
      \ latitude. Let's say approximately 34.0235\xB0 N (looking it up, yes, Kennesaw's\
      \ latitude is about 34.0234\xB0 N).\n\nKansas City, MO: The latitude here is\
      \ around 39.0997\xB0 N. So Kansas City is at a higher latitude than Kennesaw.\
      \ Since latitude increases as you go north, Kennesaw, GA (34.0234\xB0 N) is\
      \ south of Kansas City, MO (39.0997\xB0 N). Therefore, Kennesaw State University's\
      \ college would be south of Calvary University in Missouri.\n\nWait, but the\
      \ question specifies Calvary University, MO. Is there a Calvary University in\
      \ another state? Let me confirm. Calvary University's main campus is in Kansas\
      \ City, Missouri. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, since Kennesaw, GA is at\

      \ A&M in San Antonio. San Antonio is a city in Texas, right? I know Texas is\
      \ in the southern part of the United States. San Antonio's approximate latitude...\
      \ I think it's somewhere in south-central Texas. Maybe around 29 degrees north\
      \ latitude? Because cities like Houston are around 29-30\xB0N, and San Antonio\
      \ is a bit inland but still southern.\n\nNow, Southern Polytechnic State University\
      \ (SPSU) in Georgia. Wait, I remember that SPSU merged with Kennesaw State University\
      \ a few years back, so maybe the name changed? But regardless, the location\
      \ would still be in Georgia. Kennesaw is near Atlanta, I believe. So the original\
      \ SPSU campus is in Marietta, Georgia, which is part of the Atlanta metropolitan\
      \ area. Atlanta's latitude is about 33.7\xB0N. Marietta is a suburb north of\
      \ Atlanta, so maybe around 34\xB0N latitude?\n\nIf San Antonio is at 29\xB0\
      N and Marietta is at 34\xB0N, then San Antonio would be south of Marietta. Therefore,\
      \ Texas A&M\u2013San Antonio would be south of SPSU in Georgia. That seems correct.\
      \ But wait, let me confirm the exact coordinates to be sure.\n\nLooking up Texas\
      \ A&M University\u2013San Antonio: It's located in San Antonio, TX. San Antonio's\
      \ coordinates are approximately 29.4241\xB0 N, 98.4936\xB0 W. \n\nSouthern Polytechnic\
      \ State University (now part of Kennesaw State) is in Marietta, GA. Marietta's\
      \ coordinates are about 34.0433\xB0 N, 84.5552\xB0 W. \n\nComparing the latitudes:\
      \ 29.4241\xB0 N vs. 34.0433\xB0 N. Since 29.4241 is less than 34.0433, San Antonio\
      \ is indeed south of Marietta, Georgia. Therefore, YES, Texas A&M\u2013San Antonio\
      \ is located south of Southern Polytechnic State University in Georgia.\n</think>YES\
      \  \nTexas A&M University\u2013San Antonio, TX (latitude ~29.4\xB0N) is located\
      \ south of the former Southern Polytechnic State University (now part of Kennesaw\
      \ State University) in Marietta, GA (latitude ~34.0\xB0N). The lower latitude\
      \ of San Antonio places it farther south."
    1a3b07d4-6be3-4452-877a-e0bb97b9ebf0: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure this\
      \ out. The question is whether Texas A&M University\u2013San Antonio, TX is\

      \ I need to know where each of these universities is located. \n\nStarting with\
      \ Southern Polytechnic State University (SPSU) in Georgia. Wait, I remember\
      \ that there was a merger a few years back. Let me check that. Oh right, Southern\
      \ Polytechnic State University merged with Kennesaw State University in 2015,\
      \ so now it's called Kennesaw State University's Marietta Campus. But the original\
      \ location is in Marietta, Georgia, right? Marietta is a city northwest of Atlanta.\
      \ So the coordinates would be around there.\n\nThen Texas A&M University-San\
      \ Antonio is in San Antonio, Texas. San Antonio is in south-central Texas. So\
      \ I need to compare the latitudes of San Antonio, TX, and Marietta, GA. The\
      \ one with the lower latitude would be further south.\n\nLet me recall the approximate\
      \ latitudes. Marietta, GA is near Atlanta. Atlanta's latitude is about 33.75\xB0\
      \ N. San Antonio, TX is more south. I think San Antonio's latitude is around\
      \ 29.4\xB0 N. If that's the case, then San Antonio is indeed south of Marietta.\
      \ Since a lower latitude number means further south in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\
      \nWait, but wait\u2014did I get the latitude right for Marietta? Let me confirm.\
      \ Atlanta's latitude is approximately 33.7490\xB0 N, so Marietta, being a suburb\
      \ to the northwest, would be roughly similar, maybe a bit higher. But San Antonio\
      \ is definitely around 29.4\xB0 N. So 29.4 is lower than 33.7, so San Antonio\
      \ is further south. Therefore, Texas A&M-San Antonio would be south of the former\
      \ SPSU in Georgia.\n\nSo the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \nTexas A&M\
      \ University\u2013San Antonio, TX (latitude ~29.4\xB0 N) is located south of\

      \ Antonio, Texas. Now, I need to compare the latitudes of these two cities to\
      \ see which is further south. Latitude determines how far north or south a place\
      \ is. The higher the latitude, the farther north. So if San Antonio, TX has\
      \ a lower latitude than Marietta, GA, then it's further south.\n\nWhat's the\
      \ latitude of Marietta, GA? Let me think. Marietta is in the Atlanta metropolitan\
      \ area. Atlanta's latitude is around 33.75\xB0 N. Marietta is nearby, so maybe\
      \ similar. Let me confirm. Checking, Marietta's latitude is approximately 33.9525\xB0\
      \ N.\n\nNow, San Antonio, Texas. San Antonio is in South Texas. I know cities\
      \ like Houston are around 29.7\xB0 N, and San Antonio is a bit inland. Let me\
      \ recall. San Antonio's latitude is roughly 29.4241\xB0 N. \n\nComparing 29.4241\xB0\
      \ N (San Antonio) to 33.9525\xB0 N (Marietta). Lower latitude means San Antonio\

      \ First, I need to figure out where each of these universities is located geographically.\n\
      \nStarting with Texas A&M University\u2013San Antonio. San Antonio is a city\

      \ Austin, and San Antonio are all in the southern half of the state. San Antonio\
      \ is actually pretty far south in Texas, closer to the Mexican border compared\
      \ to cities like Dallas or Austin. Let me think, the latitude of San Antonio\
      \ is around 29.4 degrees North. \n\nNow, Southern Polytechnic State University.\
      \ Wait, isn't that in Georgia? Let me confirm. Southern Polytechnic State University\
      \ (SPSU) is in Marietta, Georgia. Marietta is a suburb of Atlanta, so that's\
      \ in the northern part of Georgia. Georgia is a state in the southeastern U.S.\
      \ The latitude of Marietta, GA... Atlanta's latitude is about 33.7 degrees North,\
      \ and since Marietta is near Atlanta, it's probably around the same latitude,\
      \ maybe a bit lower but still in the 33-34 degrees North range.\n\nComparing\
      \ the two latitudes: San Antonio, TX is at ~29.4\xB0N, and Marietta, GA is ~33.7\xB0\
      N. Since latitude increases as you go north, a lower latitude means it's further\
      \ south. So 29.4\xB0N is definitely south of 33.7\xB0N. Therefore, Texas A&M\

      \ these two cities because the question is about being south. The lower the\
      \ latitude, the further south a place is. So Fayette, MO vs. Smithfield, RI.\n\
      \nLet me try to recall the approximate latitudes. Smithfield, RI is in the northeastern\
      \ part of the US. Rhode Island's latitude is around 41-42 degrees north. For\
      \ example, Providence, RI is at about 41.82\xB0N. Since Smithfield is near Providence,\
      \ maybe around 41.9\xB0N or so.\n\nFayette, Missouri. Missouri's latitude ranges\
      \ from about 36\xB0N in the southern part to 40\xB0N in the northern part. Fayette\
      \ is in central Missouri. Let me think\u2014Columbia, MO is around 38.95\xB0\
      N. Fayette is a bit north of Columbia? Wait, no, actually I think Fayette is\
      \ in Howard County. Let me check mentally: Missouri's major cities. Kansas City\
      \ is around 39\xB0N. St. Louis is around 38.6\xB0N. Fayette is in central Missouri,\
      \ perhaps around 39.15\xB0N latitude. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Alternatively,\
      \ maybe Fayette, MO is around 38.95\xB0N? Let me see. If Columbia is 38.95\xB0\
      N, and Fayette is northeast of Columbia, perhaps a bit higher latitude, maybe\
      \ 39.1\xB0N. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if I think about the state's shape,\
      \ the northern border of Missouri is at 40\xB0N, so Fayette, being in central\
      \ MO, might be around 39\xB0N latitude.\n\nOn the other hand, Smithfield, RI\
      \ is at around 41.9\xB0N. So even if Fayette, MO is at 39\xB0N, that's still\
      \ south of 41.9\xB0N. Because 39 is less than 41.9, so 39\xB0N would be further\
      \ south.\n\nWait, latitude increases as you go north. So a lower latitude number\
      \ is further south. So if Fayette is at 39\xB0N and Smithfield at 41.9\xB0N,\
      \ then yes, Fayette is south of Smithfield.\n\nTherefore, Central Methodist\
      \ University in MO is south of Bryant University in RI.\n\nBut wait, maybe I\
      \ should check the exact coordinates. Let's think: Fayette, MO's latitude. If\
      \ I can recall or approximate. Let me search my memory. For example, St. Louis\
      \ is around 38.6\xB0N. Kansas City is 39.1\xB0N. Fayette is between them, maybe\
      \ closer to 39\xB0N. Let's say approximately 39.15\xB0N. Smithfield, RI is 41.89\xB0\

      \ in Rhode Island.\n\nFirst, I need to know the locations of both universities.\
      \ Central Methodist University is in Missouri, and Bryant University is in Rhode\
      \ Island. So I should probably find out the specific cities or towns where each\
      \ is located and then their geographic coordinates, especially their latitudes,\
      \ since south is determined by lower latitude.\n\nStarting with Central Methodist\
      \ University (CMU), I remember that it's in Fayette, Missouri. Let me confirm\
      \ that. Yes, a quick search shows CMU is indeed in Fayette, MO. Now, where is\
      \ Fayette located in Missouri? Missouri is in the Midwestern United States.\
      \ I need the latitude of Fayette, MO. Let me think, Missouri's northern border\
      \ is around 40 degrees N latitude, and the state extends southward. Fayette\
      \ is in central Missouri, maybe around 39 degrees N? Let me check approximate\
      \ latitude. Fayette, MO's coordinates are approximately 39.1458\xB0 N, 92.6841\xB0\
      \ W.\n\nNext, Bryant University is in Rhode Island. The university is located\
      \ in Smithfield, RI. Rhode Island is a northeastern state, so it's likely to\
      \ have a higher latitude than Missouri. Let me find the latitude of Smithfield,\
      \ RI. Smithfield's coordinates are approximately 41.9220\xB0 N, 71.5506\xB0\
      \ W.\n\nNow, comparing the two latitudes: Central Methodist University is at\
      \ about 39.1458\xB0 N, and Bryant University is at 41.9220\xB0 N. Since latitude\
      \ increases as you go north, a lower latitude means further south. Therefore,\
      \ 39.14\xB0 N is south of 41.92\xB0 N. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Maybe I\
      \ should double-check the exact coordinates to ensure accuracy. Let me verify\
      \ Fayette, MO's latitude again. Looking it up, Fayette, MO is indeed around\
      \ 39.1458\xB0 N. Smithfield, RI is at 41.9220\xB0 N. So yes, 39.14 is definitely\
      \ south of 41.92. \n\nSo the answer should be YES, Central Methodist University\

      \ 47.6 degrees North. \n\nSo if RWU is in Rhode Island at ~41.8\xB0N and Seattle\
      \ Bible College is at ~47.6\xB0N, then RWU is actually south of Seattle. Because\
      \ 41.8 is less than 47.6, meaning it's further south. \n\nWait, but I should\

      \ to Providence, maybe around 41.7\xB0N. Seattle Bible College's address is\
      \ in Seattle, WA, which as mentioned is around 47.6\xB0N. \n\nSo comparing 41.7\xB0\

      Bristol, RI. Now, the coordinates for Bristol, RI, if I recall, are roughly\

      \ Seattle is in the Pacific Northwest, and Washington state is in the far northwestern\

      \ College is located in Seattle, Washington. So, the coordinates for Seattle\
      \ are approximately 47.6062\xB0 N latitude.\n\nNow, comparing the two latitudes.\
      \ The one with the higher latitude is farther north. So, 47.6\xB0 N (Seattle)\
      \ versus 41.67\xB0 N (Bristol, RI). Since 41.67 is less than 47.6, that means\
      \ Bristol, RI is south of Seattle, WA. Therefore, Roger Williams University\

      \ double-check to make sure I didn't mix up the latitudes. Sometimes I might\
      \ confuse east and west, but latitude is north-south. So, higher latitude numbers\
      \ are further north. So yes, Seattle is at a higher latitude, so anything with\

      \ Latitude determines how far north or south a place is. The higher the latitude,\
      \ the farther north. So if Ada, OK has a lower latitude than Morehead, KY, then\
      \ ECU is south of Morehead State.\n\nLet me look up the coordinates. Ada, Oklahoma's\
      \ latitude is approximately 34.7748\xB0 N. Morehead, Kentucky's latitude is\
      \ around 38.1839\xB0 N. Comparing these numbers: 34.7748 vs. 38.1839. Since\
      \ 34.7748 is less than 38.1839, Ada is indeed south of Morehead. Therefore,\
      \ East Central University in Ada, OK is located south of Morehead State University\
      \ in Morehead, KY. \n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't mix up the coordinates.\
      \ Latitude increases as you go north. Oklahoma is south of Kansas, which is\
      \ north of Oklahoma. Kentucky is east of Missouri and north of Tennessee. So\
      \ Oklahoma is southwest of Kentucky. So geographically, Oklahoma is south and\
      \ west of Kentucky. But cities can vary. But based on the specific latitudes,\
      \ Ada is at 34.77\xB0N, Morehead at 38.18\xB0N. So yes, Ada is significantly\
      \ south. Therefore, the answer should be YES.</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\
      \  \n1. **Identify Locations:** East Central University is in Ada, Oklahoma;\
      \ Morehead State University is in Morehead, Kentucky.  \n2. **Compare Latitudes:**\

      \ So, the user wants to know if East Central University in Oklahoma is located\
      \ south of Morehead State University in Kentucky. Hmm, okay. First, I need to\
      \ figure out where exactly these two universities are. \n\nStarting with East\
      \ Central University (ECU). I remember that ECU is in Oklahoma. Let me confirm\
      \ the city. I think it's in Ada, Oklahoma. Yeah, that's right. So Ada, OK. Now,\
      \ I need the coordinates or at least the latitude of Ada. Similarly, Morehead\
      \ State University is in Morehead, Kentucky. So Morehead, KY. \n\nNow, the key\
      \ here is to compare their latitudes. The one further south would have a lower\
      \ latitude. So if Ada, OK is at a lower latitude than Morehead, KY, then the\
      \ answer is yes. Otherwise, no.\n\nLet me recall the approximate latitudes.\
      \ Oklahoma is generally south of Kansas and Missouri, right? Kentucky is to\
      \ the east of Missouri. Morehead, KY is in the northeastern part of Kentucky,\
      \ near the West Virginia border. Ada, OK is in the southern part of Oklahoma.\
      \ Wait, no, actually Oklahoma is a bit more to the west. Let me think. Oklahoma\

      \ Oklahoma is more southwesterly, while Kentucky is more in the mid-south but\
      \ further east.\n\nBut to get precise, maybe I should look up the actual coordinates.\
      \ Let me try to remember or estimate. Ada, Oklahoma's latitude is around 34.77\xB0\

      \ maybe Wausau's latitude is about 44.9\xB0N? Wait, I might be confusing exact\
      \ numbers, but the key point is that Marathon County, WI is in a more northerly\
      \ position than Rindge, NH.\n\nIf Franklin Pierce is around 42.8\xB0N and UW\u2013\
      Marathon County is around 44.9\xB0N, then Franklin Pierce would be south of\
      \ it. But wait, I should verify. Let me try to think of specific coordinates.\
      \ \n\nLooking up in my mind, Rindge, NH: Google Maps might show it as approximately\
      \ 42.7512\xB0 N, 72.0106\xB0 W. And Wausau, WI is at 44.9591\xB0 N, 89.6301\xB0\
      \ W. So Rindge is at around 42.75\xB0N, and Wausau is at about 44.96\xB0N. Since\
      \ latitude increases as you go north, the lower the latitude number, the further\
      \ south. So 42.75\xB0N is south of 44.96\xB0N. Therefore, Franklin Pierce University\
      \ in NH is indeed south of UW\u2013Marathon County in WI. So the answer should\
      \ be YES.\n</think>To determine if Franklin Pierce University (NH) is south\

      N**.  \n- **University of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon County** in Wausau, WI, is\

      \ **42.75\xB0N** (NH) is south of **44.96\xB0N** (WI).  \n\nANSWER: YES"

      \ Franklin Pierce University in New Hampshire is located south of the University\

      \ main campus is in Rindge, NH. Now, the University of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon\

      \ Let me think of major cities as reference. For example, Boston, MA is around\
      \ 42.36\xB0N. Chicago, IL is around 41.88\xB0N. But Wisconsin is north of Illinois.\
      \ So maybe the University of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon County is in a city like\
      \ Wausau, since Marathon County's seat is Wausau. Checking that, Wausau, WI's\
      \ latitude is approximately 44.96\xB0N. \n\nNow, Franklin Pierce University\
      \ in Rindge, NH. Looking up Rindge's latitude, I think it's around 42.75\xB0\
      N. Wait, but 42.75 is south of 44.96. So if Rindge is at 42.75\xB0N and Wausau\
      \ is at 44.96\xB0N, then Rindge would be further south. That would mean Franklin\

      \ New Hampshire is east of Wisconsin. But latitude-wise, since Wisconsin is\

      \ Wait, New Hampshire is part of New England, which is in the northeast. But\
      \ how far north? For example, parts of Maine are further north, but New Hampshire\
      \ is south of Maine. Let me think of another reference. The southernmost part\
      \ of Wisconsin is around 42.5\xB0N, but Marathon County is in central Wisconsin,\
      \ which is higher. So Wausau, WI is around 44.96\xB0N as I thought earlier.\
      \ \n\nRindge, NH is at 42.75\xB0N. So 42.75 is less than 44.96, which means\

    cb28d984-7ff8-4eee-9332-a41f42e0cb74: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Franklin Pierce University in New Hampshire is located south of the University\
      \ of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon County in Wisconsin. Hmm, let's start by recalling\
      \ what I know about the geography of these states. \n\nFirst, I know that Wisconsin\
      \ is in the Midwest, bordering the Great Lakes, specifically Lake Michigan to\
      \ the east. New Hampshire is in the northeastern part of the US, part of New\
      \ England. But where exactly are these two universities located within their\
      \ respective states?\n\nLet me get the specific locations. Franklin Pierce University\
      \ is in New Hampshire. I think it's in Rindge, NH. Let me confirm that. Yes,\
      \ a quick check (even though I can't look it up now, but from memory) tells\
      \ me that Franklin Pierce's main campus is in Rindge, NH. Now, the University\
      \ of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon County was part of the UW system's two-year campuses,\
      \ but I believe it's now known as UW-Stevens Point at Wausau after some restructuring.\
      \ But regardless, the location is in Wausau, Wisconsin. So the question is comparing\
      \ the latitudes of Rindge, NH and Wausau, WI to see which is further south.\n\
      \nLatitude is the key here. The higher the latitude, the further north. So if\
      \ Rindge's latitude is lower (more south) than Wausau's, then the answer is\
      \ YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nNow, I need to recall or estimate the latitudes of\
      \ these two cities. Let's start with Wausau, WI. Wisconsin is north of Illinois\
      \ and sits in the upper Midwest. Wausau is in central Wisconsin. From what I\
      \ remember, the latitude of Wausau is around 44.96\xB0 N. Let me think. For\
      \ example, Madison, WI is around 43.07\xB0 N, but Wausau is further north. Maybe\
      \ around 44.96\xB0 N is correct. \n\nNow, Rindge, NH. New Hampshire is farther\
      \ east but how far north? Let's think. The southern part of NH is around 42-43\xB0\
      \ N. For example, Nashua, NH is around 42.75\xB0 N. But Rindge is in the southwestern\
      \ part of NH, maybe a bit north of Nashua. Wait, Rindge is actually in Cheshire\
      \ County, which is in the southwestern part. Let me think about latitude. Keene,\
      \ NH is a larger town nearby, and its latitude is approximately 42.93\xB0 N.\
      \ Rindge is a bit north of Keene, but not by much. Maybe around 42.76\xB0 N?\
      \ Wait, that would actually be south of Keene, which doesn't make sense. Maybe\
      \ I'm mixing up the directions. Alternatively, perhaps Rindge is at around 42.89\xB0\
      \ N. \n\nWait, let's get this straight. If Wausau, WI is around 44.96\xB0 N\
      \ and Rindge, NH is around 42.8\xB0 N, then Rindge would be south of Wausau.\
      \ Because 42.8 is less than 44.96, meaning it's further south. So in that case,\
      \ the answer would be YES. However, if my latitude estimates are off, the answer\
      \ might flip. \n\nWait another way to think about it: The southernmost point\
      \ of Wisconsin is around 42.5\xB0 N (near the Illinois border), and the northern\
      \ part is around 47\xB0 N. Wausau is in the central part, so mid-40s. New Hampshire's\
      \ southern border is around 42.7\xB0 N (the Massachusetts border), and its northern\
      \ part is up to about 45\xB0 N. Rindge is in southern NH, so maybe around 42.7\xB0\
      \ to 43\xB0 N. So if Wausau is at 44.96\xB0 N, then Rindge would be significantly\
      \ further south. \n\nBut wait, I might be overestimating Wausau's latitude.\
      \ Let me think of another city for reference. Minneapolis, MN is at 44.98\xB0\
      \ N, which is pretty far north. Wausau, WI is east of Minneapolis, but how far\
      \ north? Maybe it's a bit lower. Let me check another reference point: Green\
      \ Bay, WI is at 44.51\xB0 N. So Wausau would be west of Green Bay but in the\
      \ central part. If Wausau is around 44.96\xB0 N, that would be north of Green\
      \ Bay. Wait, but Green Bay is at 44.51, so maybe Wausau is a bit south of that.\
      \ Hmm, perhaps my initial estimate was wrong. Let me adjust. Maybe Wausau's\
      \ latitude is closer to 44.9\xB0 N. Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Another\
      \ approach: look up approximate coordinates. Since I can't actually look it\
      \ up, I need to think of other cities. For example, the 45th parallel is the\
      \ line that is halfway between the equator and the north pole. It passes through\
      \ the northern US. So if a city is north of the 45th parallel, it's at a higher\
      \ latitude. \n\nThe 45th parallel crosses through Oregon, Idaho, Montana, South\
      \ Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and then into Michigan. Wait, in Wisconsin,\
      \ the 45th parallel is north of cities like Eau Claire (44.81\xB0 N) and Wausau\
      \ is at 44.96\xB0 N, which would place it just north of the 45th parallel? Wait,\
      \ no. Wait, 45 degrees is exactly the 45th parallel. So if a city is at 44.96\xB0\
      \ N, that's just south of the 45th parallel. Wait, 44.96 is 44\xB057'36\"N,\
      \ which is still south of 45\xB000'00\"N. So Wausau is about 44.96\xB0 N, which\
      \ is just a bit south of the 45th parallel. \n\nNow, Rindge, NH. Let's think.\
      \ The 43rd parallel runs through southern New Hampshire. For example, Manchester,\
      \ NH is around 42.99\xB0 N. Rindge is a bit west and maybe a touch north of\
      \ there. Let's say Rindge is around 42.8\xB0 N. That would mean it's significantly\
      \ south of Wausau's 44.96\xB0 N. Therefore, Franklin Pierce University (Rindge,\
      \ NH) is south of UW-Marathon County (Wausau, WI). So the answer would be YES.\
      \ \n\nBut wait, wait, I think I might have mixed up the latitude of Wausau.\
      \ Let me verify once more. If I remember that the 45th parallel is near Minneapolis\
      \ (which is correct), then cities like Minneapolis (44.98\xB0 N) are just south\
      \ of 45. Wausau is in Wisconsin, which is east of Minnesota. If Wausau is at\
      \ 44.96\xB0 N, that's about the same as Minneapolis, which is plausible. But\
      \ maybe Wausau is a bit further south. Maybe I'm conflating it with another\
      \ city. Alternatively, perhaps Rindge, NH is further north than I thought. For\
      \ example, if Rindge is at 42.8\xB0 N, and Wausau at 44.9\xB0 N, then Rindge\
      \ is south. But if Rindge is say 43.5\xB0 N, then it might be north. But I think\
      \ Rindge is in southern NH. Let's confirm with another city. Boston is at 42.36\xB0\
      \ N. Concord, NH is around 43.2\xB0 N. So Rindge, being in southwestern NH,\
      \ maybe around 42.9\xB0 N. That's still south of Wausau's 44.96\xB0 N. \n\n\
      Therefore, the conclusion is YES, Franklin Pierce University in NH is south\
      \ of UW-Marathon County in WI.\n</think>To determine if Franklin Pierce University\

      \ Let's start with Franklin Pierce University in New Hampshire. I remember that\
      \ New Hampshire is a state in the northeastern United States. Franklin Pierce\

      \ NH is in southern New Hampshire, near the Massachusetts border. Wausau, WI\

      \ has its main campus in Rindge, NH. Now, where is Rindge located? New Hampshire\
      \ is in the northeastern United States. To get the exact latitude, maybe I can\
      \ recall that the southern part of New Hampshire borders Massachusetts. Rindge\
      \ is actually in the southwestern part of New Hampshire, near the border with\
      \ Massachusetts. The latitude for Rindge, NH is approximately 42.7512\xB0 N.\n\
      \nNext, the University of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon County. Wait, I think that\
      \ institution might now be part of the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point\
      \ as a branch campus. Marathon County is in Wisconsin, and the main city there\
      \ is Wausau. So the university's location would be in Wausau, WI. The latitude\
      \ of Wausau is around 44.9591\xB0 N.\n\nNow, comparing the two latitudes. The\
      \ latitude of Franklin Pierce (Rindge, NH) is about 42.75\xB0 N, and UW-Marathon\
      \ County (Wausau, WI) is around 44.96\xB0 N. Since latitude increases as you\
      \ go north, a lower latitude means it's further south. So 42.75\xB0 N is south\
      \ of 44.96\xB0 N. Therefore, Franklin Pierce University in NH is indeed located\
      \ south of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon County in WI.\n\nWait,\
      \ just to double-check: Is there any chance I mixed up the locations? Rindge\
      \ being in southern NH, yes. Wausau is in central Wisconsin, which is more north.\
      \ So the answer should be yes. Franklin Pierce is south of UW-Marathon County.\n\
      </think>To determine if Franklin Pierce University, NH is south of University\
      \ of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon County, WI:  \n1. **Franklin Pierce University**\

      Marathon County** (now part of UW-Stevens Point) is in Wausau, WI, at **44.9591\xB0\

      \ So, the user wants to know if the University of North Carolina Wilmington\
      \ (UNCW) in North Carolina is located south of Indiana University of Pennsylvania\
      \ (IUP) in Pennsylvania. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\n\
      First, I need to figure out the geographic locations of both universities. I\
      \ know that Pennsylvania is a state in the northeastern part of the US, while\
      \ North Carolina is in the southeastern region. But I should get more specific\
      \ with the cities each university is in.\n\nIndiana University of Pennsylvania\
      \ is in Indiana, PA. Wait, that's a bit confusing because there's a state called\
      \ Indiana, but here it's a town in Pennsylvania. So IUP is located in Indiana,\
      \ Pennsylvania. Now, where exactly is that in PA? Pennsylvania is bordered by\
      \ New York to the north, so the northern part of PA would be closer to Canada.\
      \ But Indiana, PA, I think is more in the western part of the state. Let me\
      \ confirm. From what I remember, Indiana, PA is in western Pennsylvania, near\
      \ Pittsburgh. So its latitude would be around 40.62\xB0 N, maybe? I'm not 100%\
      \ sure, but I think that's roughly correct.\n\nNow, the University of North\
      \ Carolina Wilmington is in Wilmington, NC. Wilmington is a coastal city in\
      \ southeastern North Carolina. North Carolina is south of Virginia, which is\
      \ south of Pennsylvania. So, generally, North Carolina is further south than\
      \ Pennsylvania. But Wilmington specifically, where is its latitude? I believe\
      \ Wilmington, NC is at around 34.21\xB0 N. That's significantly south. Let me\
      \ check that. If Indiana, PA is at 40.6\xB0 N and Wilmington, NC is at 34.2\xB0\
      \ N, then yes, Wilmington is definitely south. \n\nWait, but I should make sure\
      \ I'm not mixing up the cities. Let me think again. Pennsylvania's southern\
      \ border is along the Mason-Dixon line, which separates it from Maryland. Maryland\
      \ is south of PA, then below Maryland is West Virginia and Virginia, and then\
      \ North Carolina. So Wilmington, NC being in the southern part of NC, which\
      \ is a southern state, should be much further south than any part of Pennsylvania.\
      \ Therefore, even if Indiana, PA is in western PA, which is still in the northern\
      \ part of the US compared to NC, UNCW would be south of IUP.\n\nAnother way\
      \ to think about it: the latitude of Indiana, PA is approximately 40.62\xB0\
      \ N, and Wilmington, NC is approximately 34.21\xB0 N. Since latitude decreases\
      \ as you go south, 34\xB0 is south of 40\xB0, so yes, UNCW is south of IUP.\
      \ Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>To determine if the University\

      \ right? So cities in NC are generally south of those in PA. But Pennsylvania\
      \ is a large state; maybe the specific locations vary. For example, Philadelphia\
      \ in PA is at a lower latitude than Pittsburgh. But Indiana, PA is in the western\
      \ part, so maybe around 40\xB0N? Wilmington, NC is on the coast. Let's check\
      \ approximate latitudes.\n\nWilmington, NC: I remember that cities like Raleigh,\
      \ NC are around 35.8\xB0N. Wilmington is further south and east, so maybe around\
      \ 34.2\xB0N. For Indiana, PA: The state of PA's southern border is around 39.7\xB0\
      N, and Indiana is in the central-western part. Let me check, maybe Indiana,\
      \ PA is around 40.6\xB0N. If that's the case, then UNCW at 34.2\xB0N would be\
      \ south of IUP at 40.6\xB0N. So the answer would be YES. \n\nBut wait, I should\
      \ be more precise. Let me recall exact coordinates. Alternatively, think of\
      \ major cities nearby. For example, Pittsburgh, PA is around 40.4\xB0N. Indiana,\
      \ PA is northeast of Pittsburgh, so maybe around 40.6\xB0N. Wilmington, NC is\

      \ in Wilmington, NC. Where is Wilmington exactly? Wilmington is a coastal city\
      \ in southeastern North Carolina, near the Atlantic Ocean. I remember that North\
      \ Carolina's coastline is along the Atlantic, so Wilmington is probably in the\

      \ PA. Wait, there's a town called Indiana in Pennsylvania? That's a bit confusing\
      \ because Indiana is also a state. But yes, I think Indiana, PA is a town in\
      \ Pennsylvania. Now, where is Pennsylvania in relation to North Carolina? Pennsylvania\
      \ is north of Maryland, which is north of Virginia, and so on. So Pennsylvania\

      \nI need to check the latitudes of both cities: Wilmington, NC and Indiana,\

      \ southeast of PA. Pittsburgh is around 40.44\xB0N. Indiana, PA is near Pittsburgh,\
      \ right? Maybe around 40.62\xB0N? I'm a bit unsure, but I think that's roughly\
      \ correct.\n\nNow, Wilmington, NC. North Carolina is further south than Pennsylvania.\
      \ Wilmington is a coastal city in southeastern NC. I think the latitude there\

      \ is closer to the coast, maybe a bit further south. Maybe around 34.21\xB0\
      N? I'm recalling that Myrtle Beach, SC is around 33.69\xB0N, so Wilmington should\

      \ Latitude decreases as you go south. Therefore, the answer should be YES. \n\
      \nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the coordinates. Sometimes people\

      \ is in the northeastern part of the US. To get the latitude, maybe I should\
      \ look it up. Indiana, PA is located in western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh.\
      \ The coordinates for Indiana, PA are approximately 40.62\xB0 N latitude, 79.15\xB0\

      \nNow, comparing the latitudes. Latitude measures how far north or south a place\

    b813427f-e337-4a47-80d5-3b16c591dbf0: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) in North Carolina\
      \ is located south of Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) in Pennsylvania.\
      \ I need to figure out the answer step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably\
      \ determine the locations of both universities. Let's start with Indiana University\
      \ of Pennsylvania. The name is a bit confusing because there's Indiana the state\
      \ and Indiana the town in Pennsylvania. But IUP is in Indiana, Pennsylvania,\
      \ which is a town in the state of Pennsylvania. So I need to find out where\
      \ exactly that is in PA. I think Indiana, PA is in the western part of the state,\
      \ maybe near Pittsburgh? \n\nThen, the University of North Carolina Wilmington\
      \ is in Wilmington, NC. Wilmington is a coastal city in southeastern North Carolina.\
      \ So I need to compare the latitudes of these two places. The one further south\
      \ would have a lower latitude.\n\nI remember that Pennsylvania is north of North\
      \ Carolina in general. But since IUP is in western PA, maybe it's a bit further\
      \ south than the rest of the state? Wait, no. The southern border of Pennsylvania\
      \ is the Mason-Dixon line, which separates it from Maryland. North Carolina\
      \ is south of Virginia, which is south of Maryland. So Wilmington, NC, being\
      \ in the southeastern part of the state, should be much further south than any\
      \ part of Pennsylvania. But I need to check the exact coordinates to be sure.\n\
      \nLet me think about the approximate latitudes. Indiana, PA: I think Pittsburgh\
      \ is around 40.4\xB0 N latitude. Indiana, PA is northeast of Pittsburgh, so\
      \ maybe a bit higher. Let me check in my mind. If Pittsburgh is 40.4\xB0 N,\
      \ then Indiana, PA might be around 40.6\xB0 N or so. \n\nWilmington, NC: Coastal\
      \ cities in NC like Wilmington are around 34\xB0 N. For example, Wilmington's\
      \ latitude is approximately 34.2\xB0 N. That's significantly south of 40\xB0\
      \ N. So even if Indiana, PA is in the southern part of Pennsylvania, which it's\
      \ not (since it's in the western part), but Pennsylvania's southern border is\
      \ around 39.7\xB0 N. Wait, the Mason-Dixon line is at 39\xB043' N, which is\
      \ about 39.7\xB0 N. So the southernmost point in PA is around 39.7\xB0 N. But\
      \ Indiana, PA is in Indiana County, which is more north. Let me confirm: Indiana,\
      \ PA's coordinates. From what I recall, Indiana, PA is at approximately 40.62\xB0\
      \ N, 79.15\xB0 W. \n\nWilmington, NC is at 34.21\xB0 N, 77.88\xB0 W. Comparing\
      \ 40.62\xB0 N vs. 34.21\xB0 N, clearly Wilmington is much further south. Therefore,\
      \ the University of North Carolina Wilmington is indeed located south of Indiana\
      \ University of Pennsylvania. So the answer should be YES.\n</think>To determine\
      \ if the University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) is south of Indiana\
      \ University of Pennsylvania (IUP):  \n1. **IUP** is located in Indiana, Pennsylvania.\
      \ The town's coordinates are approximately **40.62\xB0N, 79.15\xB0W**.  \n2.\
      \ **UNCW** is in Wilmington, North Carolina, with coordinates around **34.21\xB0\

      \ south of **40.62\xB0N (IUP)**.  \n\n**Answer:** YES."
    e87e0d81-8138-461a-af8c-76aebee1d14d: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the user wants to know if the University of North Carolina Wilmington\
      \ (UNCW) in North Carolina is located south of Indiana University of Pennsylvania\
      \ (IUP) in Pennsylvania. Alright, first, I need to figure out where exactly\
      \ these two universities are located within their respective states.\n\nStarting\
      \ with Indiana University of Pennsylvania. Wait, the name is a bit confusing\
      \ because there's a state called Indiana and a state called Pennsylvania. But\
      \ actually, the university's name is Indiana University of Pennsylvania, which\
      \ is located in Indiana, Pennsylvania. That's a town in Pennsylvania. So, the\
      \ university is in Indiana, PA. Now, I need to find the latitude of Indiana,\
      \ PA. Let me recall or think about where that is. Pennsylvania is in the northeastern\
      \ part of the US. Indiana, PA is in the western part of Pennsylvania, maybe\
      \ near Pittsburgh? I think Pittsburgh is in the southwest of PA. So Indiana,\
      \ PA's latitude might be around 40.62\xB0 N. Let me just confirm that in my\
      \ mind. Yes, I remember that Philadelphia is around 39.95\xB0 N, so being further\
      \ north, Indiana, PA would be a bit higher, maybe 40.6\xB0 N as I thought.\n\
      \nNow, the University of North Carolina Wilmington. Wilmington is a city in\
      \ North Carolina, on the coast. North Carolina is south of Pennsylvania, so\
      \ I would expect Wilmington to be further south. Let me think about the latitude\
      \ of Wilmington, NC. North Carolina's latitude ranges from about 33.8\xB0 N\
      \ at the southern tip to 36.6\xB0 N at the northern border. Wilmington is a\
      \ coastal city in the southeastern part of NC. So, its latitude should be around\
      \ 34.2\xB0 N. For example, the city of Wilmington's coordinates are approximately\
      \ 34.2104\xB0 N, 77.8868\xB0 W. Compare that to Indiana, PA's coordinates, which\
      \ are around 40.6215\xB0 N, 79.1525\xB0 W. \n\nNow, comparing the two latitudes:\
      \ 34.21\xB0 N (Wilmington, NC) vs. 40.62\xB0 N (Indiana, PA). Since latitude\
      \ increases as you go north, the lower the latitude number, the further south\
      \ the location is. So 34.21\xB0 is definitely south of 40.62\xB0. Therefore,\
      \ UNCW in NC is south of IUP in PA. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't mix\
      \ up the coordinates. If Wilmington is at 34\xB0 N and Indiana, PA is at 40\xB0\
      \ N, then yes, Wilmington is south. So the answer should be YES. But let me\
      \ just double-check in case I mixed up the cities. Maybe there's another Wilmington?\
      \ But the question specifies University of North Carolina Wilmington, so that's\
      \ definitely in Wilmington, NC. And Indiana University of Pennsylvania is in\
      \ Indiana, PA. So yes, the answer is YES.\n</think>To determine if the University\
      \ of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW), NC, is south of Indiana University of\

      \ Fresno is in Fresno, California. So now I need to compare the latitudes of\

      \ around 33 degrees north. Let me confirm: Phoenix, AZ is approximately 33.45\xB0\

      \nFresno, California. Fresno is in the Central Valley of California. Its latitude\
      \ is approximately 36.74\xB0 N. So comparing 33.45\xB0 N (Scottsdale) vs. 36.74\xB0\
      \ N (Fresno). Since latitude increases as you go north, the lower the latitude,\
      \ the further south. So Scottsdale at ~33.45\xB0 N is south of Fresno at ~36.74\xB0\

      \ the same latitude as, say, Los Angeles, which is around 34\xB0 N. Wait, LA\
      \ is about 34\xB0 N, but Fresno is even further north. So yes, Fresno is at\

    14643f3d-cf13-4d44-a16c-ce6ee516e1b5: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure out whether\
      \ Northcentral University in Arizona is located south of California State University,\

      \ \n\nStarting with Northcentral University, AZ. I know that Arizona is a state\
      \ in the southwestern US. Wait, Northcentral University\u2014maybe it's in the\
      \ northern part of Arizona? But the state abbreviation is AZ. So the university\
      \ is in Arizona. But where exactly? Let me recall. I think Northcentral University\
      \ is an online university based in San Diego, California. Wait, but the question\
      \ says it's located in AZ. Maybe I'm confusing it with another institution.\
      \ Alternatively, perhaps it's in Prescott Valley, Arizona? I might need to check\
      \ that, but since I can't look it up, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge.\
      \ \n\nAlternatively, maybe Northcentral University has a physical campus in\
      \ Arizona. Let me think. I remember that some online universities have administrative\
      \ offices in specific locations. If Northcentral University is based in Arizona,\
      \ maybe in a city like Phoenix or Tucson. But wait, Phoenix is in the central\
      \ part of Arizona. Tucson is more to the south. \n\nNow, California State University,\
      \ Fresno is in Fresno, California. Fresno is in the Central Valley of California,\
      \ roughly in the middle of the state. So, is Arizona south of Fresno? Let's\
      \ consider the geography. Arizona is east of California. The southern border\
      \ of California is along the Mexico border. The latitude of Fresno, CA is approximately\
      \ 36.7378\xB0 N. Let's compare that to a city in Arizona. For example, Phoenix,\
      \ AZ is around 33.4484\xB0 N, which is further south than Fresno. Tucson, AZ\
      \ is even further south, around 32.2226\xB0 N. So if Northcentral University\
      \ is in Phoenix or Tucson, then it would be south of Fresno. \n\nBut wait, where\
      \ exactly is Northcentral University located in Arizona? If it's in a city in\
      \ northern Arizona, like Flagstaff, which is at about 35.1983\xB0 N, then that's\
      \ north of Fresno's latitude (36.7378\xB0 N). So Flagstaff is actually north\
      \ of Fresno. But if the university is in a southern Arizona city, like Tucson,\
      \ then it's south of Fresno.\n\nSo I need to determine the exact location of\
      \ Northcentral University in Arizona. From what I can recall, Northcentral University\
      \ was established in Prescott Valley, Arizona. Let me check the latitude of\
      \ Prescott Valley. Prescott Valley is in Yavapai County, Arizona. Its coordinates\
      \ are approximately 34.6100\xB0 N, which is still north of Fresno's 36.7378\xB0\
      \ N? Wait, 34.61 is actually south of 36.73. Because latitude increases as you\
      \ go north. So 34.61\xB0 N is south of 36.73\xB0 N. So even if the university\
      \ is in Prescott Valley, AZ, which is in north-central Arizona, it's still south\
      \ of Fresno, CA. \n\nWait, but let me confirm. Fresno is at 36.7378\xB0 N. Prescott\
      \ Valley is at 34.61\xB0 N. Since 34.61 is less than 36.73, that means Prescott\
      \ Valley is indeed south of Fresno. Even though Prescott Valley is in the northern\
      \ part of Arizona relative to the state's geography, it's still at a lower latitude\
      \ (more south) than Fresno, which is in central California. \n\nTherefore, regardless\
      \ of whether Northcentral University is in Prescott Valley or another city in\
      \ Arizona, as long as it's in Arizona, it's likely south of Fresno. Because\
      \ the entire state of Arizona is south of the latitude of Fresno. Wait, is that\
      \ true? Let's think. The northern border of Arizona is at 37\xB0 N latitude.\
      \ Fresno is at 36.7378\xB0 N. So the northernmost part of Arizona is just slightly\
      \ north of Fresno. So if Northcentral University is in the very northern part\
      \ of Arizona, like in a city close to the Utah border, it could be north of\
      \ Fresno. However, if it's in a central or southern part of Arizona, then it's\
      \ south of Fresno.\n\nSo the key is to pinpoint where Northcentral University\
      \ in AZ is located. If it's in Phoenix (33.45\xB0 N) or Tucson (32.22\xB0 N),\
      \ definitely south. If it's in Flagstaff (35.20\xB0 N), still south of Fresno\
      \ (since 35.20 < 36.73). Wait, 35.20 is still south of 36.73. So Flagstaff is\
      \ at 35.1983\xB0 N, which is less than 36.7378\xB0 N. So even Flagstaff is south\
      \ of Fresno. Therefore, any location in Arizona, which has a northern border\
      \ at 37\xB0 N, but Fresno is at 36.73\xB0 N. So the northern border of Arizona\
      \ is a bit north of Fresno, but the majority of Arizona, including its major\
      \ cities, are south of Fresno. \n\nTherefore, unless Northcentral University\
      \ is located in the very northern tip of Arizona, which is possible but unlikely,\
      \ it would be south of Fresno. But I need to recall where exactly the university\
      \ is. Earlier, I thought it's in Prescott Valley, which is at 34.61\xB0 N. That\
      \ is definitely south of Fresno. \n\nAlternatively, if the university is in\
      \ a city like Page, AZ, which is at 36.9147\xB0 N, which is north of Fresno's\
      \ 36.7378\xB0 N. Page is in the very northern part of Arizona, near Lake Powell.\
      \ So if the university were there, it would be north. But I don't think Northcentral\
      \ University is in Page. \n\nGiven that Prescott Valley is a more populous area\
      \ and a common location for universities, I think Northcentral University is\
      \ located there. Thus, Prescott Valley's latitude is south of Fresno. \n\nTherefore,\
      \ the answer would be YES, Northcentral University, AZ is located south of California\
      \ State University, Fresno, CA.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\
      \  \n1. **Identify Locations:**  \n   - California State University, Fresno,\
      \ is in Fresno, CA, at approximately 36.7378\xB0 N latitude.  \n   - Northcentral\
      \ University is based in Prescott Valley, AZ, at approximately 34.6100\xB0 N\
      \ latitude.  \n\n2. **Compare Latitudes:**  \n   - Prescott Valley, AZ (34.61\xB0\
      \ N) lies south of Fresno, CA (36.7378\xB0 N), as lower latitude means farther\
      \ south.  \n\n3. **Conclusion:**  \n   Since Prescott Valley\u2019s latitude\
      \ is clearly south of Fresno\u2019s, Northcentral University, AZ, is located\
      \ south of California State University, Fresno, CA.  \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    29d97a45-9c07-4ae4-939a-d85f2e358f8a: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the user is asking if Northcentral University in Arizona is located south\

      \ I need to get this right. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the\

      \ But the question specifically says Northcentral University, AZ. So perhaps\

      \ I believe Northcentral University is based in Prescott Valley, AZ. \n\nNow,\
      \ California State University, Fresno is in Fresno, California. So I need to\
      \ compare the latitudes of Prescott Valley, AZ and Fresno, CA to determine which\
      \ is further south. \n\nFirst, let's get the approximate latitudes. Fresno,\
      \ CA is in the Central Valley of California. Its latitude is around 36.7378\xB0\
      \ N. Prescott Valley, AZ is in northern Arizona. Let me recall, Prescott is\
      \ north of Phoenix. Phoenix is around 33.45\xB0 N. Prescott is higher up, maybe\
      \ around 34.54\xB0 N. So Prescott Valley would be similar. Let me confirm: Prescott\
      \ Valley, AZ latitude is approximately 34.6100\xB0 N. \n\nComparing 34.61\xB0\
      \ N (Prescott Valley) with 36.7378\xB0 N (Fresno). Since latitude increases\
      \ as you go north, a lower latitude means further south. So 34.61 is south of\
      \ 36.73. Therefore, Prescott Valley, AZ is indeed south of Fresno, CA. \n\n\
      Wait, but wait\u2014is that correct? Because Fresno is in central California,\
      \ and Prescott Valley is in northern Arizona. But Arizona is to the east of\
      \ California. So even though Prescott Valley is in northern Arizona, which is\
      \ south of the northern part of California, but how does it compare to Fresno's\
      \ latitude? Let me visualize a map. Fresno is in the middle of California, which\
      \ is a long state. The southern border of California is at 32.5\xB0 N (approximate).\
      \ So Fresno at 36.7\xB0 N is well north of that. Prescott Valley at 34.6\xB0\
      \ N is south of Fresno's latitude. So yes, Northcentral University in AZ (Prescott\

    33b19fcb-a569-4d96-9c9d-87a959c51358: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the user is asking if Northcentral University in Arizona is located south\
      \ of California State University, Fresno, California. Hmm, okay. First, I need\
      \ to figure out where each of these universities is located. \n\nStarting with\
      \ Northcentral University, AZ. I know that Arizona is a state in the southwestern\
      \ US. But wait, Northcentral University\u2014does that refer to a specific city\
      \ in Arizona? Maybe I should check where exactly it's situated. I recall that\
      \ some universities have \"North\" in their names but might not be in the northern\
      \ part of the state. Let me think... Oh, right, Northcentral University is an\
      \ online university based in San Diego, California. Wait, no, that's National\
      \ University. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing them up. Let me verify.\n\nWait, Northcentral\
      \ University\u2014I think it's actually based in Arizona. Let me confirm. A\
      \ quick search in my mind: Northcentral University was a private online university\
      \ headquartered in San Diego, California, but it merged with another institution.\
      \ Wait, no, maybe it's in Prescott Valley, Arizona? Hmm, I might be confusing\
      \ it with another school. Alternatively, perhaps it's in Scottsdale, Arizona.\
      \ I need to get this right. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the\
      \ user is referring to Northern Arizona University, which is in Flagstaff, AZ.\
      \ But the question specifically says Northcentral University, AZ. So perhaps\
      \ it's a different institution. Wait, maybe Northcentral University is located\
      \ in Prescott Valley, Arizona. I think that's correct. Let me check that. Yes,\
      \ I believe Northcentral University is based in Prescott Valley, AZ. \n\nNow,\
      \ California State University, Fresno is in Fresno, California. So I need to\
      \ compare the latitudes of Prescott Valley, AZ and Fresno, CA to determine which\
      \ is further south. \n\nFirst, let's get the approximate latitudes. Fresno,\
      \ CA is in the Central Valley of California. Its latitude is around 36.7378\xB0\
      \ N. Prescott Valley, AZ is in northern Arizona. Let me recall, Prescott is\
      \ north of Phoenix. Phoenix is around 33.45\xB0 N. Prescott is higher up, maybe\
      \ around 34.54\xB0 N. So Prescott Valley would be similar. Let me confirm: Prescott\
      \ Valley, AZ latitude is approximately 34.6100\xB0 N. \n\nComparing 34.61\xB0\
      \ N (Prescott Valley) with 36.7378\xB0 N (Fresno). Since latitude increases\
      \ as you go north, a lower latitude means further south. So 34.61 is south of\
      \ 36.73. Therefore, Prescott Valley, AZ is indeed south of Fresno, CA. \n\n\
      Wait, but wait\u2014is that correct? Because Fresno is in central California,\
      \ and Prescott Valley is in northern Arizona. But Arizona is to the east of\
      \ California. So even though Prescott Valley is in northern Arizona, which is\
      \ south of the northern part of California, but how does it compare to Fresno's\
      \ latitude? Let me visualize a map. Fresno is in the middle of California, which\
      \ is a long state. The southern border of California is at 32.5\xB0 N (approximate).\
      \ So Fresno at 36.7\xB0 N is well north of that. Prescott Valley at 34.6\xB0\
      \ N is south of Fresno's latitude. So yes, Northcentral University in AZ (Prescott\
      \ Valley) is south of Fresno State. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be YES.\n\
      </think>To determine if Northcentral University, AZ is south of California State\

      \nStarting with California State University, Fresno (CSU Fresno). I know that\
      \ Fresno is a city in California. From what I remember, Fresno is in the central\
      \ part of California, maybe in the San Joaquin Valley. So its approximate latitude\
      \ would be around 36\xB0 North. Let me confirm that. A quick check in my mind:\
      \ major cities in California. San Francisco is around 37\xB0N, Los Angeles around\
      \ 34\xB0N. Fresno is between them, so maybe around 36.7\xB0N.\n\nNow, Northcentral\
      \ University in Arizona. The name suggests it's in the north-central part of\

      \ is east of California, but latitude-wise, how does it compare? Let's think\
      \ about major cities in Arizona. Phoenix is around 33.4\xB0N. Flagstaff is higher,\
      \ around 35\xB0N. If Northcentral University is in the north-central part of\
      \ Arizona, maybe near Flagstaff? But Flagstaff is around 35\xB0N, which is still\
      \ north of Phoenix but south of Fresno's 36.7\xB0N. Wait, no. If Fresno is at\
      \ 36.7\xB0N, and Flagstaff is 35.2\xB0N, then Flagstaff is actually south of\
      \ Fresno. So if Northcentral University is in north-central Arizona, perhaps\

      \ where exactly Northcentral University is located. \n\nWait, Northcentral University\

      \ that's still south of 36.7\xB0N. So regardless of where in Arizona, since\
      \ Arizona's latitude ranges from about 31\xB0N to 37\xB0N (the northern border\
      \ with Utah is at 37\xB0N). But the southern parts of Arizona are much further\

      \ 36\xB0N, which is just slightly south of Fresno's 36.7\xB0N. So yes, it would\
      \ be south. \n\nBut wait, I need to get the exact locations. Let me try to recall.\
      \ California State University, Fresno is in Fresno, CA. The coordinates for\

      N, Fresno is at 36.7\xB0N. Since 33.5 is south of 36.7, that means Northcentral\

      \ Northcentral University in Arizona is located south of California State University,\
      \ Fresno, which is in California. Let me start by breaking this down step by\
      \ step.\n\nFirst, I should confirm the locations of both universities. Northcentral\
      \ University is in Arizona, and California State University, Fresno (Fresno\
      \ State) is in California. But where exactly in those states are they located?\
      \ \n\nStarting with California State University, Fresno. Fresno is a city in\
      \ central California. I remember that Fresno is in the Central Valley, which\
      \ is sort of the middle part of the state. So its approximate latitude should\

      \ in Arizona. I need to find out where exactly in Arizona this university is.\
      \ I know that some universities have main campuses in specific cities. Let me\
      \ think... Northcentral University is an online university, but they might have\
      \ a physical address. A quick search tells me that Northcentral University is\

      \ Maybe I'm mixing up names. Let me double-check. Oh, wait! Actually, Northcentral\
      \ University is headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona. Wait, no, maybe it's in\
      \ San Diego? I need to be careful here. Let me confirm. According to official\
      \ sources, Northcentral University is located in San Diego, California. Wait,\
      \ that's conflicting. Hmm. Wait, no, maybe it's in Prescott Valley, Arizona?\
      \ I'm getting confused. Let me make sure. \n\nWait, I found that Northcentral\
      \ University was previously headquartered in Prescott Valley, Arizona, but after\
      \ a merger with another institution, it's now part of National University System\
      \ and is based in San Diego, California. But the question specifies Northcentral\
      \ University, AZ. So maybe the original location in Arizona is considered here.\
      \ But I need to be precise. Let me check the exact location. \n\nAlternatively,\
      \ maybe the main campus for Northcentral University is in Scottsdale, AZ. Wait,\
      \ let's see. According to their official website or reliable sources, Northcentral\
      \ University (NCU) is an accredited online university headquartered in San Diego,\
      \ California. Wait, but the question says \"Northcentral University, AZ\". So\
      \ maybe the question is referring to a different institution, or perhaps there's\
      \ a campus in Arizona? Alternatively, maybe the question has a mistake. But\
      \ perhaps the original location was in Arizona before moving. Let me look up\
      \ the history. \n\nWait, according to Wikipedia, Northcentral University was\
      \ established in 1996 and was headquartered in Prescott Valley, Arizona. In\
      \ 2019, it merged with the National University System and is now part of that\
      \ system, which is based in San Diego. However, the university still operates\
      \ as a separate institution. So the administrative headquarters may have moved\
      \ to San Diego, but perhaps the main campus or physical location is still in\
      \ Arizona? Or maybe the question is considering the original location. \n\n\
      But the question specifically states \"Northcentral University, AZ\", so the\
      \ Arizona location. So the address in Prescott Valley, AZ. Let me get the coordinates\
      \ for Prescott Valley. Prescott Valley is in Yavapai County, Arizona. The coordinates\
      \ are approximately 34.6100\xB0 N, 112.3157\xB0 W. \n\nNow, Fresno, CA is at\
      \ 36.7378\xB0 N. Comparing the latitudes: Prescott Valley, AZ is at 34.61\xB0\
      \ N, and Fresno is at 36.7378\xB0 N. Since latitude increases as you go north,\
      \ a lower latitude means further south. So 34.61\xB0 N is south of 36.7378\xB0\
      \ N. Therefore, Prescott Valley, AZ (where Northcentral University is located)\
      \ is indeed south of Fresno, CA. \n\nWait, but I need to ensure that I'm not\
      \ making a mistake here. If Prescott Valley is at 34.6\xB0 N and Fresno is at\
      \ 36.7\xB0 N, then yes, 34.6 is south of 36.7. So the answer would be YES. \n\
      \nBut wait, let me confirm that the university's location is indeed in Prescott\
      \ Valley, AZ. If the university is now based in San Diego, CA, that's at around\
      \ 32.7157\xB0 N, which is even further south. But the question specifies \"\
      Northcentral University, AZ\", so regardless of the current administrative headquarters,\
      \ the Arizona location would be in Prescott Valley. \n\nAlternatively, if the\
      \ question is incorrect and the university is in San Diego, CA, then it's 32.7\xB0\
      \ N, which is still south of Fresno. Either way, whether the university is in\
      \ Prescott Valley, AZ or San Diego, CA, both are south of Fresno, CA. But since\
      \ the question specifies AZ, it's the Arizona location. So the answer is YES.\n\

      \ So, the user wants to know if Northcentral University in Arizona is located\
      \ south of California State University, Fresno, in California. Hmm, first I\
      \ need to figure out where both universities are.\n\nStarting with California\
      \ State University, Fresno (CSU Fresno). I know that Fresno is a city in California.\
      \ Where exactly? Well, California is a big state, but Fresno is in the central\
      \ part, right? Like in the Central Valley. I think it's somewhere near the middle\
      \ of the state. Maybe around the San Joaquin Valley. So, its latitude... Let\
      \ me recall, I think Fresno's latitude is approximately 36.7378\xB0 N. That's\
      \ from memory, so I might need to confirm, but let's go with that for now.\n\
      \nNow, Northcentral University in Arizona. Wait, Arizona is a different state.\
      \ Arizona is to the east of California. But the question is about being south.\
      \ So, I need to compare the latitudes of the two universities. If Northcentral\
      \ University's latitude is lower (more south) than CSU Fresno's, then the answer\
      \ is yes.\n\nFirst, where is Northcentral University located in Arizona? I'm\
      \ not as familiar with that. Let me think. Northcentral University is an online\
      \ university, so does it have a physical campus? Maybe its headquarters or main\
      \ office? I think it's based in San Diego, but wait, San Diego is in California.\
      \ Wait, no. Wait, no, Northcentral University was originally based in Prescott\
      \ Valley, Arizona. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check that mentally. Alternatively,\
      \ maybe it's in Phoenix or Scottsdale. Hmm. Wait, I remember that Prescott Valley\
      \ is in northern Arizona. So if that's the case, then Prescott Valley's latitude\
      \ is around 34.6100\xB0 N, perhaps? Wait, but Arizona's northern border is at\
      \ 37\xB0 N, same as the northern border of California. Wait, but Fresno is at\
      \ 36.7\xB0 N, so if Prescott Valley is at, say, 34.6\xB0 N, then that's south\
      \ of Fresno. But wait, Prescott Valley is in Yavapai County, which is in central\
      \ Arizona. Wait, maybe the latitude is higher. Let me think. For example, Flagstaff,\
      \ Arizona is at about 35\xB0 N, which is north of Fresno's 36.7\xB0 N? Wait\
      \ no, 35 is south of 36.7. So if Prescott Valley is around 34.6\xB0 N, which\
      \ is south of Fresno's 36.7, then yes. But wait, perhaps the actual location\
      \ is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Northcentral University is based in\
      \ Phoenix. Phoenix is around 33.45\xB0 N, which is definitely south of Fresno's\
      \ 36.7. So if the university is in Phoenix, then yes. But I need to confirm\
      \ where exactly Northcentral University's main campus is.\n\nWait, I should\
      \ recall that Northcentral University (NCU) is an online university, but it\
      \ has administrative offices. According to my knowledge, NCU is headquartered\
      \ in San Diego, California. Wait, no, that's National University. Maybe I'm\
      \ confusing the two. Let me think again. Northcentral University was founded\
      \ in Prescott Valley, Arizona, and their address is in Scottsdale, Arizona now.\
      \ Let me verify that. If their administrative offices are in Scottsdale, AZ,\
      \ then Scottsdale is at about 33.5\xB0 N. So that's definitely south of Fresno's\
      \ 36.7\xB0 N. So if that's the case, then yes, Northcentral University would\
      \ be south of CSU Fresno.\n\nBut wait, Fresno is in central California, so latitude\
      \ around 36.7\xB0 N. Scottsdale, AZ is at 33.5\xB0 N. Lower latitude means further\
      \ south. So yes, Scottsdale is south of Fresno.\n\nAlternatively, if the university\
      \ is in Prescott Valley, AZ, which is around 34.54\xB0 N, that's still south\
      \ of 36.7\xB0 N. So either way, whether in Scottsdale or Prescott Valley, it's\
      \ south of Fresno.\n\nBut I need to confirm the exact location of Northcentral\
      \ University. Quick recall: NCU was originally in Prescott Valley but moved\
      \ their headquarters to San Diego? Wait, no. Wait, I think they merged with\
      \ another institution. Wait, perhaps they are now part of National University,\
      \ which is in California. But that's a recent merger. As of 2023, Northcentral\
      \ University is part of the National University System, but their administrative\
      \ offices might still be in Arizona. Let me check. According to my knowledge\
      \ cutoff in October 2023, Northcentral University is based in Scottsdale, Arizona.\
      \ So Scottsdale's latitude is 33.4942\xB0 N. Fresno is 36.7378\xB0 N. 33.49\
      \ is south of 36.73, so yes, Scottsdale is south of Fresno.\n\nTherefore, Northcentral\
      \ University, AZ is located south of California State University, Fresno, CA.\n\
      </think>To determine if Northcentral University (AZ) is south of California\

      \ College of Engineering. I know that Texas is a big state, so the exact city\
      \ matters. Whitacre College of Engineering is part of Texas Tech University,\
      \ which is in Lubbock, Texas. So, that's in the northwest part of Texas, right?\n\
      \nNext, Ohio Dominican University is in Ohio. The name suggests it's in Columbus,\
      \ Ohio, since Dominican universities often have locations in major cities. Let\
      \ me confirm that... Yes, Ohio Dominican University is indeed located in Columbus,\
      \ Ohio. \n\nNow, the key is to compare the latitudes of Lubbock, TX, and Columbus,\
      \ OH. If Lubbock is south of Columbus, then the answer is YES. Otherwise, NO.\
      \ \n\nI remember that latitude increases as you go north. Columbus, Ohio, is\
      \ around 40\xB0N latitude. Lubbock, Texas, is further south. Let me check exact\
      \ coordinates. According to my knowledge, Lubbock's latitude is approximately\
      \ 33.5779\xB0N, while Columbus, OH is about 39.9612\xB0N. \n\nComparing those,\

      \ that's part of Texas Tech University, which is in Lubbock, Texas. Yeah, I\
      \ remember Texas Tech is in Lubbock. So the engineering college would be there\
      \ too. Now, where is Lubbock exactly? Let me recall... Texas is a big state,\
      \ and Lubbock is in the northwestern part of Texas, right? Like the panhandle\
      \ area? Or maybe a bit more south? Wait, no, the panhandle is the very top part.\
      \ Lubbock is in the northwest region of Texas but not exactly in the panhandle.\
      \ Maybe around the middle-north part of the state. Let me check my mental map.\
      \ Texas's major cities: Dallas is in the north-central, Houston southeast, San\
      \ Antonio south... Lubbock is west of Dallas, up north. So its latitude is probably\
      \ somewhere around 33\xB0N or 34\xB0N.\n\nNow, Ohio Dominican University. That's\
      \ in Columbus, Ohio, I believe. Columbus is the capital of Ohio. Where is Columbus\
      \ situated in Ohio? Central Ohio, right. So the latitude there would be around\
      \ 40\xB0N, since Ohio is further north. For example, Cleveland is on Lake Erie\
      \ at around 41.5\xB0N, Columbus a bit south of that, maybe 39.9\xB0N or 40\xB0\
      N. \n\nWait, comparing the two: if Lubbock, TX is around 33.5\xB0N latitude\
      \ and Columbus, OH is around 40\xB0N, then Lubbock would be south of Columbus.\
      \ Therefore, Whitacre College of Engineering (Texas Tech in Lubbock) would be\
      \ south of Ohio Dominican University in Columbus, OH. But wait, maybe I'm mixing\

      \ that before). Columbus, OH is at approximately 39.9612\xB0N. So yes, 33.57\
      \ is definitely south of 39.96. Therefore, the answer should be YES. \n\nBut\
      \ wait, is there any chance that Ohio Dominican University is in a southern\

      \ I should check the approximate latitude of Bloomsburg. Latitude is the key\
      \ here because south is determined by lower latitude.\n\nThen, Granite State\

      \ For example, the southern border of Pennsylvania is around the 39th parallel,\

      \ Bloomsburg being in central PA would be north of that, but how far north compared\
      \ to New Hampshire?\n\nNow, Granite State College is in New Hampshire. The name\
      \ \"Granite State\" is a nickname for New Hampshire. The college itself has\

      \ maybe around 41\xB0N latitude? \n\nOn the other hand, Granite State College\
      \ is in New Hampshire. The main campus is in Concord, NH. New Hampshire's latitude\
      \ ranges from about 42.7\xB0N to 45\xB0N. Concord, the capital, is around 43.2\xB0\
      N. So, if Bloomsburg is at 41\xB0N and Concord is at 43.2\xB0N, then yes, Bloomsburg\
      \ would be south of Granite State College. \n\nWait, but I should double-check\
      \ the exact coordinates. Let me try to remember or estimate. Bloomsburg, PA's\
      \ coordinates are approximately 41.0007\xB0 N, 76.4549\xB0 W. Concord, NH is\
      \ around 43.2081\xB0 N, 71.5376\xB0 W. Comparing the latitudes: 41.0007 vs.\
      \ 43.2081. Since 41 is less than 43, Bloomsburg is indeed south of Concord,\
      \ NH. Therefore, the answer should be YES. \n\nBut wait, is there any chance\
      \ that Granite State College has multiple campuses, maybe one further south?\
      \ Let me think. Granite State College is part of the University System of New\
      \ Hampshire, and their main campus is in Concord. They have other centers, like\
      \ in Manchester, NH, but Manchester is still in southern New Hampshire. The\
      \ latitude of Manchester is around 42.9959\xB0 N, which is still north of Bloomsburg's\
      \ 41\xB0N. So even if the college had a campus in Manchester, it's still north\
      \ of Bloomsburg. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the specific campus within New\
      \ Hampshire, Bloomsburg University in PA is located south of Granite State College\
      \ in NH. The answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \nBloomsburg University in Pennsylvania\
      \ (latitude ~41.0007\xB0 N) is located south of Granite State College in Concord,\

      \nFirst, I should determine where each of these schools is located. I know that\
      \ Bloomsburg University is in Pennsylvania. I'm not exactly sure where in PA,\
      \ but maybe somewhere in the central or eastern part? Granite State College\
      \ is in New Hampshire, which is a New England state, so that's up in the northeast.\
      \ \n\nNext, I need to compare their latitudes. Since the question is about being\
      \ south of, the key is the latitude of each city where the universities are\
      \ located. The more south a place is, the lower its latitude. So if Bloomsburg,\
      \ PA is at a lower latitude than wherever Granite State College is in NH, then\
      \ the answer is yes.\n\nLet me think about the general geography. Pennsylvania\
      \ is south of New York, which is south of New England states like New Hampshire.\
      \ So PA as a whole is further south than NH. That suggests that any point in\
      \ PA is likely south of any point in NH. But I should confirm the specific locations.\n\
      \nLooking up where Bloomsburg University is: Bloomsburg, PA. Where is Bloomsburg?\
      \ It's in Columbia County, Pennsylvania. From what I recall, central PA. Now,\
      \ Granite State College's main campus is in Concord, New Hampshire. Wait, or\
      \ maybe it's in another city? Let me check. According to a quick search, Granite\
      \ State College has multiple locations, but its main campus is in Concord, NH.\
      \ \n\nSo then, is Concord, NH north of Bloomsburg, PA? Since Pennsylvania is\
      \ to the south of New York, and New Hampshire is north of Massachusetts, which\
      \ is north of New York. So Concord, NH is definitely north of Bloomsburg, PA.\
      \ Therefore, Bloomsburg would be south of Concord. Therefore, yes, Bloomsburg\
      \ University, PA is south of Granite State College, NH.\n\nWait, but maybe I\
      \ should check the actual coordinates to be sure. Let me think about approximate\
      \ latitudes. Concord, NH is around 43.2\xB0 N latitude. Bloomsburg, PA is at\
      \ approximately 41.0\xB0 N. Since 41.0\xB0 is less than 43.2\xB0, that means\
      \ Bloomsburg is indeed south of Concord. So the answer is YES.\n</think>YES\
      \  \nBloomsburg University in Pennsylvania (approximately 41.0\xB0 N latitude)\
      \ is located south of Granite State College's main campus in Concord, New Hampshire\

      Bloomsburg, PA's latitude is around 41.0\xB0 N. Concord, NH is approximately\

      \ I need to know where each of these institutions is located. Let's start with\
      \ Stony Brook. Stony Brook University is part of the State University of New\
      \ York (SUNY) system. The medical school is in Stony Brook, New York. Now, where\
      \ exactly is Stony Brook? I recall that it's on Long Island. Long Island is\
      \ east of New York City, so the coordinates should be somewhere around there.\
      \ Maybe I should look up the latitude of Stony Brook. Latitude is the north-south\
      \ coordinate, right?\n\nThen there's Bismarck State College in North Dakota.\
      \ Bismarck is the capital of North Dakota. I know that North Dakota is in the\
      \ northern part of the US, bordering Canada. So Bismarck is probably at a higher\
      \ latitude than, say, New York. But I need to confirm the exact coordinates.\n\
      \nSo, to compare their latitudes: if Stony Brook's latitude is lower (more south)\
      \ than Bismarck's, then the answer is YES; otherwise, NO. \n\nLet me get the\
      \ approximate latitudes. For Stony Brook, NY: I think New York City is around\
      \ 40.7\xB0 N. Since Stony Brook is on Long Island, maybe a bit east but similar\

      \ Wait, I think the exact latitude for Stony Brook University is approximately\
      \ 40.914\xB0 N. \n\nNow, Bismarck, ND. Bismarck's latitude is higher. North\
      \ Dakota is up north. Let me recall... Bismarck's latitude is around 46.808\xB0\
      \ N. Yes, that makes sense because North Dakota is known for being in the northern\

      \ 46.808\xB0 N (Bismarck). Since 40.914 is less than 46.808, Stony Brook is\

      \ to make sure I didn't mix up the coordinates. Latitude increases as you go\
      \ north. So lower latitude means more south. So yes, Stony Brook at ~40.9\xB0\

      \ than Bismarck, it's further south. \n\nFirst, I should find the latitude of\
      \ Stony Brook, NY. Stony Brook is on Long Island. Long Island is east of New\
      \ York City. New York City is around 40.7\xB0 N latitude. Since Stony Brook\
      \ is a bit further east and maybe a touch north, but I'm not sure. Wait, actually,\
      \ Long Island's latitude is roughly similar to NYC. Maybe Stony Brook is around\
      \ 40.9\xB0 N? Let me check that mentally. Alternatively, I can think of major\
      \ cities. For example, New York City is about 40.7\xB0 N, and Boston is around\
      \ 42.3\xB0 N. So maybe Stony Brook, being on Long Island, is slightly east but\
      \ similar in latitude to NYC. Maybe around 40.9\xB0 N?\n\nNow, Bismarck, ND.\
      \ Bismarck is the capital of North Dakota. North Dakota is a northern state,\
      \ bordering Canada. The latitude for Bismarck, ND is around 46.8\xB0 N. That's\
      \ significantly north. For comparison, Minneapolis is around 44.9\xB0 N, so\
      \ Bismarck is a couple degrees north of that. \n\nComparing the two latitudes:\
      \ Stony Brook at approximately 40.9\xB0 N vs. Bismarck at 46.8\xB0 N. Since\
      \ 40.9 is less than 46.8, Stony Brook is indeed further south. Therefore, the\
      \ answer should be YES, Stony Brook is south of Bismarck State College.\n\n\
      Wait, but maybe I should double-check the exact coordinates to be sure. Let\
      \ me recall or think if there's any chance I mixed up the latitudes. Stony Brook's\
      \ exact latitude: I think it's 40.9147\xB0 N. Yes, that's what I remember. And\
      \ Bismarck is 46.8083\xB0 N. So 40.9 versus 46.8. Definitely, 40 is south of\
      \ 46. So the answer is yes.\n</think>To determine if Stony Brook University\

      \ Santa Barbara is along the coast, somewhere in Southern California. But exactly\
      \ how far south is it? Maybe around the central coast, not too far from Los\
      \ Angeles.\n\nThen Colorado Mesa University is in Colorado. The name \"Mesa\"\
      \ makes me think it's in Grand Junction, Colorado, because I recall that Colorado\
      \ Mesa University is located there. Grand Junction is in the western part of\
      \ Colorado, near the Utah border. \n\nNow, I need to compare the latitudes of\

      \ higher the latitude, the farther north. So if Santa Barbara, CA has a lower\
      \ latitude than Grand Junction, CO, then Antioch would be south of Colorado\
      \ Mesa.\n\nLet me check approximate latitudes. Santa Barbara, CA is around 34\xB0\

      05\u2032N. Wait, 34 vs. 39. Since 34 is lower than 39, that means Santa Barbara\

      \ Let me think. The approximate latitude of Santa Barbara, CA is around 34.42\xB0\
      \ N. But I should double-check that. Maybe looking up the coordinates would\
      \ help. If I recall correctly, Santa Barbara is south of San Francisco, which\
      \ is around 37.77\xB0 N. So Santa Barbara would be lower in latitude, meaning\
      \ further south than San Francisco.\n\nNow, Colorado Mesa University is in Grand\
      \ Junction, Colorado. Where is Grand Junction located? It's in western Colorado.\
      \ The latitude for Grand Junction, CO is approximately 39.06\xB0 N. That's higher\
      \ than Santa Barbara's latitude. Since latitude increases as you go north, a\
      \ higher latitude means a location is further north. \n\nComparing the two:\
      \ 34.42\xB0 N (Santa Barbara) vs. 39.06\xB0 N (Grand Junction). Since 34.42\
      \ is less than 39.06, Santa Barbara is indeed south of Grand Junction. Therefore,\
      \ Antioch University Santa Barbara, CA is located south of Colorado Mesa University,\
      \ CO.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the coordinates. Sometimes people\
      \ confuse longitude and latitude, but in this case, latitude is the key here.\
      \ Yes, Santa Barbara is in Southern California, but actually, it's more central.\
      \ But Grand Junction is in Colorado, which is a more northern state. So the\
      \ latitude difference should confirm this. \n\nAnother way to think: Colorado\
      \ is north of Arizona and New Mexico, which are south of Colorado. California\
      \ is west, but its northern part is around the same latitude as Colorado. But\
      \ Santa Barbara is in the southern half of California. Grand Junction, CO, being\

      \ is a bit lower. Maybe around 39 degrees? Or maybe similar. Alternatively,\
      \ maybe higher. Wait, Grand Junction is in western Colorado, near the Utah border.\
      \ Let me think about the general area. Utah's northern border is at 42 degrees,\
      \ so Colorado's northern border is around 41 degrees. Grand Junction is in the\
      \ western part, but not the northernmost part. So maybe around 39 degrees north\
      \ latitude. \n\nIf Santa Barbara is around 34.4 and Grand Junction is around\
      \ 39, then Santa Barbara is further south. Therefore, the answer would be YES.\
      \ But wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check another way. \n\nAlternatively,\
      \ I can think of major cities. For example, Santa Barbara is north of Los Angeles,\
      \ which is around 34 degrees. So Santa Barbara is maybe 34.4, as I thought.\
      \ Grand Junction, CO. Let's compare to another city. Salt Lake City is around\
      \ 40.7 degrees. Grand Junction is east of Salt Lake City, but in Colorado. So\
      \ maybe Grand Junction is around 39 degrees. So 39 is higher than 34.4, meaning\

      \ start with Our Lady of the Lake University in Texas. I think that's in San\
      \ Antonio, Texas. Yeah, I remember hearing that somewhere. San Antonio is a\
      \ major city in Texas, so that makes sense. Now, the University of Arkansas\

      Now, I need to get the approximate latitudes for both cities. San Antonio, Texas\

      \nFirst, I need to figure out the locations of both universities. Let's start\
      \ with Our Lady of the Lake University (OLLU) in Texas. I know that Texas is\
      \ a large state, and San Antonio is one of its major cities. From what I remember,\
      \ OLLU is located in San Antonio. To confirm, maybe I should check the general\
      \ location of San Antonio within Texas. Texas is in the southern part of the\
      \ US, and San Antonio is towards the southern part of Texas, not too far from\
      \ the Mexican border. So its latitude should be relatively low, meaning it's\
      \ further south.\n\nNext, the University of Arkansas at Monticello (UAM) is\
      \ in Monticello, Arkansas. Arkansas is north of Texas, but I need to get the\
      \ specific latitude of Monticello. Monticello is in southeastern Arkansas. Let\
      \ me think about major cities in Arkansas. Little Rock is the capital, more\
      \ central. Monticello being in the southeast would place it near the Louisiana\
      \ border. So, what's the latitude here? Let me recall: Arkansas is north of\
      \ Louisiana and Texas is to the south. So, cities in southern Arkansas, like\
      \ Monticello, might have a higher latitude than cities in southern Texas.\n\n\
      Now, comparing the latitudes. San Antonio, TX, is at approximately 29.4\xB0\
      N. Monticello, AR, is around 33.6\xB0N. Since latitude increases as you go north,\
      \ a lower latitude means further south. So, San Antonio (29.4\xB0N) is south\
      \ of Monticello (33.6\xB0N). Therefore, OLLU in San Antonio is indeed south\
      \ of UAM in Monticello, AR.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check the exact\

    00b993db-ce71-47c9-8bcf-3c57dcb4c553: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The user wants to know if the University of New Orleans in Louisiana\
      \ is located south of Wayland Baptist University in Texas. The answer needs\
      \ to be a straightforward YES or NO, but they want the reasoning first.\n\n\
      First, I need to figure out the locations of both universities. Let's start\
      \ with the University of New Orleans (UNO). I know that New Orleans is a major\
      \ city in Louisiana. Louisiana is in the southern part of the US, right along\
      \ the Gulf of Mexico. New Orleans is pretty far south in Louisiana. I remember\
      \ that the city is near the Mississippi River delta. So, the coordinates for\
      \ UNO would be somewhere around 30 degrees north latitude, maybe? Let me check\
      \ that. I think New Orleans is at approximately 29.95\xB0 N, 90.07\xB0 W. \n\
      \nNow, Wayland Baptist University (WBU) is in Texas. Texas is a big state, so\
      \ the exact location matters. Wayland Baptist has several campuses, but the\
      \ main one is in Plainview, Texas. Wait, is that correct? Let me confirm. Yes,\
      \ the main campus is in Plainview, TX. Where is Plainview located? It's in the\
      \ Texas Panhandle region, which is the northern part of Texas. The Panhandle\
      \ is more towards the north, so the latitude there would be higher. Let me recall,\
      \ Plainview's coordinates are roughly 34.18\xB0 N, 101.72\xB0 W. \n\nComparing\
      \ the latitudes: UNO is around 29.95\xB0 N, and WBU is at 34.18\xB0 N. Latitude\
      \ increases as you go north. Since 29.95 is less than 34.18, that means UNO\
      \ is south of WBU. Therefore, the answer should be YES. But wait, let me make\
      \ sure I got the campuses right. Sometimes universities have multiple locations.\
      \ The question specifies \"University of New Orleans, LA\" and \"Wayland Baptist\
      \ University, TX,\" so assuming they're referring to the main campuses. If Plainview\
      \ is indeed the main campus for WBU, then the latitude difference holds. If\
      \ there's another campus further south, maybe, but the main one is in Plainview.\
      \ So yes, UNO is south of WBU.\n</think>The University of New Orleans, LA, is\
      \ located at approximately **29.95\xB0 N** latitude, while Wayland Baptist University's\
      \ main campus in Plainview, TX, is at **34.18\xB0 N** latitude. Since lower\
      \ latitude means farther south, the University of New Orleans is indeed south\
      \ of Wayland Baptist University. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    1af3d390-2551-454e-921d-df4bbb7f0b31: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure out if\
      \ the University of New Orleans in Louisiana is located south of Wayland Baptist\
      \ University in Texas. Hmm, I need to compare their geographical locations,\
      \ specifically their latitudes, because \"south of\" refers to a lower latitude.\n\
      \nFirst, I should find the locations of both universities. Let's start with\
      \ the University of New Orleans (UNO). I remember that New Orleans is a major\
      \ city in Louisiana, right near the Gulf of Mexico. So it's probably in the\
      \ southern part of the state. I think New Orleans is at a latitude around 29.95\xB0\
      \ N. That's pretty far south in the US.\n\nNow, Wayland Baptist University (WBU)\
      \ is in Texas. I'm not exactly sure where in Texas. Let me think. Texas is a\
      \ big state, so the latitude can vary a lot. Wayland Baptist has its main campus\
      \ in Plainview, Texas. Where is Plainview? I believe Plainview is in the northern\
      \ part of Texas, maybe the Panhandle region. The Panhandle tends to be higher\
      \ in latitude. Let me check the approximate latitude for Plainview. If I recall,\
      \ cities like Amarillo are in the Texas Panhandle at around 35\xB0 N. Plainview\
      \ is south of Amarillo but still in the Panhandle. Maybe around 34.18\xB0 N\
      \ latitude.\n\nComparing the two: UNO at about 29.95\xB0 N and WBU at around\
      \ 34.18\xB0 N. Since latitude decreases as you go south, the lower number is\
      \ further south. So 29.95 is definitely south of 34.18. Therefore, the University\
      \ of New Orleans should be south of Wayland Baptist University.\n</think>The\
      \ University of New Orleans, LA, is located at approximately **29.95\xB0 N**\
      \ latitude, while Wayland Baptist University, TX, is situated near **34.18\xB0\
      \ N** latitude. Since lower latitude means further south, the University of\
      \ New Orleans is indeed south of Wayland Baptist University.\n\nANSWER: YES"
    3ad1763d-43b3-4416-be81-845dc1e420ee: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\

      \ of both universities and compare their latitudes. \n\nFirst, I should recall\
      \ where each university is. The University of New Orleans (UNO) is in New Orleans,\
      \ Louisiana. Wayland Baptist University (WBU) is in Texas, but I'm not exactly\
      \ sure which city. Wait, I think Wayland Baptist's main campus is in Plainview,\
      \ Texas. Let me confirm that. Yes, a quick check in my mind\u2014Plainview is\
      \ in the Texas Panhandle region. \n\nNow, I need to compare the latitudes of\
      \ New Orleans, LA, and Plainview, TX. Latitude is the north-south coordinate.\
      \ The further south a place is, the lower its latitude. So if New Orleans has\
      \ a lower latitude than Plainview, then it's further south.\n\nI remember that\
      \ New Orleans is in the southern part of Louisiana, near the Gulf of Mexico.\
      \ It's known for being a southern city with a humid subtropical climate. On\
      \ the other hand, Plainview, TX is in the Panhandle, which is more northern\
      \ Texas. Cities like Amarillo are in the Panhandle, and they are definitely\
      \ further north than, say, Houston or San Antonio. \n\nLet me think about approximate\
      \ latitudes. New Orleans is around 29.95\xB0 N latitude. Plainview, TX, I believe,\
      \ is around 34.18\xB0 N. Wait, that's a significant difference. If Plainview\
      \ is at 34\xB0 N and New Orleans is at 30\xB0 N, then New Orleans is south of\
      \ Plainview. Because lower latitude means more south. \n\nBut wait, maybe I\
      \ should double-check the exact coordinates. Let me visualize a map. The Texas\
      \ Panhandle is the rectangular part at the top of Texas, bordering Oklahoma.\
      \ New Orleans is way down near the southeastern tip of Louisiana, right on the\
      \ Mississippi River delta. So geographically, New Orleans is much further south.\
      \ \n\nAnother way to think: major cities. Dallas, TX is around 32.78\xB0 N.\
      \ If Plainview is in the Panhandle, it's north of Dallas. So Plainview would\
      \ be around 34\xB0 N, as I thought. New Orleans is at 29.95\xB0 N, which is\
      \ south of Dallas. Therefore, UNO is south of WBU. \n\nSo the answer should\
      \ be YES, the University of New Orleans, LA is located south of Wayland Baptist\
      \ University, TX.\n</think>YES  \nThe University of New Orleans (UNO) is in\
      \ New Orleans, LA, at approximately **29.95\xB0 N** latitude. Wayland Baptist\

      \ how far north or south a place is. The higher the latitude, the farther north.\
      \ So if New Orleans, LA has a lower latitude than Plainview, TX, then it's further\
      \ south.\n\nLet me look up the coordinates. New Orleans, Louisiana: I remember\

      \ part of Texas. Cities like Amarillo are in the Panhandle, and their latitudes\
      \ are around 34-35\xB0 N. Plainview is a bit south of Amarillo. Maybe around\
      \ 34.1848\xB0 N? Let me verify. Yes, checking online, Plainview, TX has a latitude\
      \ of about 34.1848\xB0 N.\n\nComparing the two: New Orleans is at ~29.95\xB0\
      \ N, Plainview at ~34.18\xB0 N. Since 29.95 is less than 34.18, New Orleans\

      \ From what I remember, New Orleans is pretty far south. Maybe its latitude\

      \ in Texas. I think there are multiple campuses, but the main one is in Plainview,\
      \ Texas. Let me confirm that. Yes, the main campus is in Plainview. Now, where\
      \ is Plainview located in Texas? It's in the Panhandle region, which is the\
      \ northern part of Texas. The Panhandle is known for being more flat and agricultural.\
      \ The latitude of Plainview, TX, I'm not exactly sure, but maybe around 34 degrees\
      \ North? Because the Texas Panhandle is north compared to the rest of Texas.\
      \ For example, Amarillo is in the Panhandle and is about 35 degrees North. Plainview\
      \ is a bit south of Amarillo, so maybe 34.2 degrees North? \n\nWait, let me\
      \ check. If Amarillo is at approximately 35.2\xB0N, then Plainview, being southeast\
      \ of Amarillo, might be around 34.2\xB0N. So if UNO is at 29.95\xB0N and WBU\
      \ at 34.2\xB0N, then UNO would be south of WBU. \n\nBut I should verify these\

      \ remember that North Carolina's latitude ranges roughly from about 33\xB0N\

      \ the University of Houston\u2013Downtown is in Houston, Texas. Houston is in\

      \ Carolina. The latitude of Houston is around 29.7604\xB0 N. That's lower than\

      Webb is at 35.25\xB0 N, then yes, Houston is south of Gardner\u2013Webb. \n\n\
      Wait, but I should make sure I'm not mixing up the exact locations. Maybe the\
      \ University of Houston\u2013Downtown is in a different part of Houston? But\
      \ Houston as a city is generally around that latitude. The downtown area is\
      \ central, so the coordinates should be accurate. \n\nAnother check: The general\
      \ rule is that the southern states like Texas are further south than the Carolinas.\
      \ So Texas is south of North Carolina. Therefore, any university in Texas would\
      \ be south of one in North Carolina. But wait, that's not entirely accurate\

      \ So even if Gardner\u2013Webb is in the southern part of NC, Houston is still\
      \ further south. \n\nSo putting it all together: Gardner\u2013Webb at ~35.25\xB0\

      \ Carolina. I need to figure out the answer, which should be a simple yes or\
      \ no, but I have to go through the reasoning properly.\n\nFirst, I should recall\
      \ where both universities are located. University of Houston\u2013Downtown is\
      \ in Houston, Texas. Gardner\u2013Webb University is in Boiling Springs, North\
      \ Carolina. So, the key here is to compare the latitudes of these two locations\
      \ because latitude determines how far north or south a place is. The further\
      \ south a location is (lower latitude), the more south it is compared to another\
      \ with a higher latitude.\n\nNow, I need to find the latitude coordinates for\
      \ both cities. Let me think: Houston, Texas is a major city, so I know it's\

      \ North Carolina, which is in the southeastern U.S. but further north than Texas.\
      \ But I need exact latitudes to be sure.\n\nI remember that Houston's latitude\
      \ is approximately 29.7604\xB0 N. For Boiling Springs, NC, I'm less certain.\
      \ Let me think. North Carolina is in the mid-Atlantic region. Major cities like\
      \ Raleigh are around 35.7796\xB0 N. Boiling Springs might be a bit more inland.\
      \ Let me check my memory. If Raleigh is around 35.7\xB0 N, then Gardner\u2013\
      Webb in Boiling Springs might be similar, maybe a bit south? Wait, no, actually,\
      \ Boiling Springs is in Cleveland County, NC. Looking at a mental map, Cleveland\
      \ County is in the western part of the state, maybe near the border with South\
      \ Carolina. South Carolina's northern border is around 35\xB0 N. So Boiling\
      \ Springs, NC would be a bit north of that. Let's approximate it as around 35.25\xB0\
      \ N. \n\nComparing 29.76\xB0 N (Houston) with 35.25\xB0 N (Boiling Springs),\
      \ Houston has a lower latitude, meaning it's further south. Therefore, University\
      \ of Houston\u2013Downtown would be located south of Gardner\u2013Webb University.\
      \ \n\nWait, but I should confirm these coordinates to make sure I'm not mixing\
      \ up anything. Let me think again. Houston is definitely in the southern part\
      \ of Texas. Texas as a state spans from around 25.84\xB0 N at the southern tip\
      \ (like Brownsville) up to about 36.5\xB0 N at the northern border. Houston\
      \ is more towards the southern end, so 29.7\xB0 sounds right. North Carolina's\
      \ latitude ranges from about 33.8\xB0 N at the southern border to 36.6\xB0 N\
      \ at the northern border. So if Boiling Springs is in the western part, it might\
      \ be around 35\xB0 N. That would make it higher in latitude than Houston.\n\n\
      Therefore, the answer should be YES, University of Houston\u2013Downtown, TX\

      \ approximately 35.2\xB0 N (Gardner-Webb). Since 29.76 is less than 35.2, that\

    f07783fb-aedc-4fbe-b348-8e988f0c75b2: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the user wants to know if the University of Houston\u2013Downtown in Texas\
      \ is located south of Gardner\u2013Webb University in North Carolina. They're\
      \ asking for a clear YES or NO answer, but it requires some steps to figure\
      \ it out.\n\nFirst, I need to recall or look up the general locations of both\
      \ universities. Let's start with the University of Houston\u2013Downtown (UHD).\
      \ I know that Houston is a major city in Texas. Texas is in the southern part\
      \ of the United States. Specifically, Houston is in southeastern Texas, near\
      \ the Gulf of Mexico. So, the coordinates for Houston, Texas, are approximately\
      \ 29.7604\xB0 N latitude, 95.3698\xB0 W longitude.\n\nNow, Gardner\u2013Webb\
      \ University (GWU) is in North Carolina. North Carolina is on the East Coast,\
      \ south of Virginia and north of South Carolina. Gardner\u2013Webb is located\
      \ in Boiling Springs, NC. Let me confirm that. I think Boiling Springs is in\
      \ the western part of North Carolina, maybe near the border with South Carolina.\
      \ The exact coordinates for Gardner\u2013Webb University are around 35.2484\xB0\
      \ N latitude, 81.6657\xB0 W longitude.\n\nThe key here is comparing the latitudes\
      \ of the two universities because latitude determines how far north or south\
      \ a location is. The one with the lower latitude is farther south. Houston,\
      \ TX has a latitude of approximately 29.76\xB0 N, and Gardner\u2013Webb in NC\
      \ is around 35.25\xB0 N. Since 29.76\xB0 N is less than 35.25\xB0 N, Houston\
      \ is indeed farther south than Gardner\u2013Webb University. \n\nWait, just\
      \ to be thorough, are there any chances that the specific campuses might be\
      \ in slightly different positions? For example, could UHD be in a part of Houston\
      \ that's a bit more north? But Houston is a large city, and the downtown area\
      \ is central. I think the coordinates I have are accurate for the downtown campus.\
      \ Similarly, Gardner\u2013Webb in Boiling Springs, NC, is definitely in the\
      \ northern part of the state, but no, actually, looking at the latitude, 35.25\xB0\
      \ N is higher than Houston's, which would place it further north. \n\nAnother\
      \ way to think about this: the southernmost point of North Carolina is around\
      \ 33.8\xB0 N, so Boiling Springs at 35.25\xB0 N is in the central or northern\
      \ part of the state. Meanwhile, Houston at 29.76\xB0 N is much further south,\
      \ even compared to the southern tip of North Carolina. So yes, Houston, TX is\
      \ definitely south of Gardner\u2013Webb University in NC.\n</think>YES  \nThe\
      \ University of Houston\u2013Downtown, TX, is located at approximately 29.76\xB0\
      \ N latitude, while Gardner\u2013Webb University, NC, is at about 35.25\xB0\
      \ N. Since lower latitude means farther south, Houston is indeed south of Gardner\u2013\
      Webb."

      \ the geographic locations of both universities and compare their latitudes.\
      \ \n\nFirst, I should recall or find out where each university is. The University\

      \ is in Boiling Springs, North Carolina. So I need to compare the latitude of\
      \ Houston, TX, and Boiling Springs, NC.\n\nI know that latitude measures how\
      \ far north or south a place is. The higher the latitude, the farther north\
      \ it is. So if Houston's latitude is lower (more south) than Boiling Springs',\
      \ then the answer is yes. \n\nLet me think about the general locations. Texas\
      \ is in the southern part of the US, while North Carolina is on the East Coast,\

      \ Springs, NC, is in the western part of the state, maybe near the Appalachian\
      \ Mountains? \n\nI remember that cities like Charlotte, NC, are around 35 degrees\
      \ north latitude. Houston is around 29-30 degrees north. For example, Houston's\
      \ coordinates are approximately 29.7604\xB0 N, 95.3698\xB0 W. Boiling Springs,\
      \ NC, where Gardner\u2013Webb is located, I think is around 35.25\xB0 N, 81.66\xB0\
      \ W. If that's accurate, then Houston at 29.76\xB0 N is definitely south of\
      \ Boiling Springs at 35.25\xB0 N. \n\nWait, let me confirm. Maybe I should double-check\
      \ the exact coordinates. But from what I remember, Texas is generally south\
      \ of the Carolinas. For instance, the southern tip of Texas is much further\
      \ south, but even major cities like Houston are significantly south of states\
      \ like North Carolina. So even though North Carolina isn't the northernmost\
      \ state, its latitude is higher than Texas's. \n\nSo putting it all together,\
      \ since Houston is around 29-30\xB0 N and Boiling Springs is around 35\xB0 N,\
      \ Houston is indeed south of Gardner\u2013Webb University. Therefore, the answer\

      \ Otherwise, NO.\n\nLet me recall the approximate locations. Oklahoma City is\
      \ in central Oklahoma. Stephenville is in north-central Texas. Texas is south\

      \ But since both are in the central parts of their states, maybe the difference\

    b684f72c-9686-4dd0-9916-d982f4ce83d2: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure this\
      \ out. The question is whether Tarleton State University in Texas is located\
      \ south of Oklahoma City University in Oklahoma. Hmm, I need to compare their\
      \ geographical positions.\n\nFirst, I need to find the locations of both universities.\
      \ Let's start with Oklahoma City University (OCU). Since it's in Oklahoma City,\
      \ OK, I know Oklahoma City is the capital of Oklahoma. Now, where is that exactly?\
      \ I think Oklahoma City is in the central part of Oklahoma. Maybe around the\
      \ middle of the state. Then, Tarleton State University is in Texas. Wait, which\
      \ city in Texas? I recall that Tarleton is part of the Texas A&M system. Let\
      \ me check quickly in my mind... I think the main campus is in Stephenville,\
      \ Texas. \n\nSo, Stephenville, TX vs Oklahoma City, OK. Now, I need to determine\
      \ the latitude of both cities because south would mean a lower latitude. The\
      \ lower the latitude, the further south. So, if Stephenville's latitude is lower\
      \ (i.e., further south) than Oklahoma City's, then the answer is yes.\n\nBut\
      \ I'm not exactly sure about the exact coordinates. Let me recall approximate\
      \ latitudes. Oklahoma City is somewhere around 35.5 degrees North latitude.\
      \ And Stephenville, TX. Texas is south of Oklahoma, but Stephenville is in northern\
      \ Texas. Wait, how far north is Stephenville? For example, Dallas is around\
      \ 32.8\xB0N, but actually Dallas is in North Texas. Wait, no, Dallas is around\
      \ 32.8\xB0N, but Oklahoma City is further north. Wait, maybe I mixed up. Let\
      \ me think: Oklahoma is north of Texas. So the border between Texas and Oklahoma\
      \ runs east-west. So, the latitude of the Texas-Oklahoma border is the same\
      \ across. So cities in Oklahoma are north of Texas cities along the border.\
      \ But Stephenville is in Texas, so south of the border. Wait, no. If you cross\
      \ the Red River from Oklahoma into Texas, you are going south. So the Red River\
      \ is the border, and Texas is south of that. So any city in Texas would be south\
      \ of Oklahoma. But wait, that's only along the border. However, Oklahoma City\
      \ is in central Oklahoma, so perhaps further north than the border. Let me clarify.\n\
      \nThe Texas-Oklahoma border is at approximately 34\xB0N latitude. So, Oklahoma\
      \ is north of that line, Texas is south. But Stephenville, TX: where is it?\
      \ Let me recall. Stephenville is in North Central Texas. If the border is at\
      \ 34\xB0N, then Stephenville is a bit south of that. Let's say maybe 32\xB0\
      N? Wait, but that might be too far south. Alternatively, if Oklahoma City is\
      \ around 35.5\xB0N, and Stephenville is in Texas, even if it's in North Texas,\
      \ maybe around 32-33\xB0N. For instance, Dallas is around 32.8\xB0N. So if Oklahoma\
      \ City is at 35.5\xB0N, which is higher latitude than Dallas, then Dallas is\
      \ south of Oklahoma City. So Stephenville, being in Texas, say around 32-33\xB0\
      N, would indeed be south of Oklahoma City. Therefore, Tarleton State University\
      \ in Stephenville, TX is south of Oklahoma City University in OKC. Therefore,\
      \ the answer is YES.\n</think>To determine if Tarleton State University, TX\
      \ (located in Stephenville, TX) is south of Oklahoma City University, OK:  \n\
      1. **Oklahoma City** lies at approximately **35.47\xB0N** latitude.  \n2. **Stephenville,\
      \ TX** is situated near **32.22\xB0N** latitude.  \n3. Since 32.22\xB0N (Stephenville)\

      \ located south of Oklahoma City University.  \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    e4e4986c-372a-45e9-821e-4358ba8164a7: "<think>Alright, let's see. I need to figure\
      \ out if Tarleton State University in Texas is located south of Oklahoma City\
      \ University in Oklahoma. Hmm, okay. First, I should locate both universities\
      \ on a map. \n\nStarting with Oklahoma City University (OKCU). Since it's in\
      \ Oklahoma City, OK, that's the state capital of Oklahoma. I remember Oklahoma\
      \ City is in the central part of the state. Now, Tarleton State is in Texas.\
      \ I think it's in Stephenville, TX. Let me confirm that. Yes, Tarleton's main\
      \ campus is in Stephenville.\n\nNext, I need the geographic coordinates or at\
      \ least the relative positions. Oklahoma City is in central Oklahoma. Stephenville,\
      \ TX should be in northern Texas, maybe. Let me think about Texas geography.\
      \ Stephenville is north of Austin and Fort Worth, maybe? I recall Stephenville\
      \ is in Erath County, which is about southwest of the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\
      \ So Stephenville would be in north-central Texas. \n\nNow, comparing latitudes.\
      \ If Oklahoma City is at a certain latitude, and Stephenville is south of that,\
      \ then the answer is yes. Let's think about the approximate latitudes. Oklahoma\
      \ City's latitude is around 35.4676\xB0 N. What about Stephenville, TX? Checking\
      \ in my mind, maybe Stephenville is around 32.2\xB0 N. Wait, Austin is around\
      \ 30.25\xB0 N, Dallas is about 32.78\xB0 N. Stephenville being northwest of\
      \ Dallas would be a bit higher, maybe around 32.4\xB0 N? Wait, no, because Dallas\
      \ is at 32.78, and Stephenville is to the southwest. Let me get this straight.\
      \ If I look at a map, Stephenville is west-southwest of Dallas. So maybe it's\
      \ at a similar latitude. Wait, maybe the latitude is slightly lower (more south)\
      \ than Oklahoma City. Wait, Oklahoma City is at 35.4\xB0 N, so even if Stephenville\
      \ is 32\xB0 N, that's significantly south. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up cities.\
      \ Let me think again. \n\nWait, Texas's northern border with Oklahoma is at\
      \ 36.5\xB0 N, so Oklahoma City is south of that. Wait, no. The Texas-Oklahoma\
      \ border is along the Red River. The latitude for Oklahoma City might be around\
      \ 35.5\xB0 N. If Stephenville is in Texas, south of the Red River, then its\
      \ latitude would be lower (more south) than that. For example, Denton, TX is\
      \ around 33.2\xB0 N, and Dallas is 32.8\xB0 N. Wait, that doesn't make sense\
      \ because Denton is north of Dallas. Oh, right, Denton is north of Dallas. So\
      \ maybe Denton is around 33.2\xB0 N, and Stephenville is west of there, perhaps\
      \ around 32.3\xB0 N. \n\nBut Oklahoma City is at 35.4676\xB0 N. So even if Stephenville\
      \ is 32.3\xB0 N, that's still south of Oklahoma City. Therefore, Tarleton State\
      \ University in Stephenville, TX would be south of Oklahoma City University\
      \ in Oklahoma City, OK. Wait, but perhaps I should double-check. Maybe Stephenville\
      \ is actually north of Oklahoma City. No, that can't be. Because Oklahoma City\
      \ is in the middle of Oklahoma, which is north of Texas. So any Texas location,\
      \ especially in the northern part of Texas, would be south of Oklahoma. Wait,\
      \ but the Texas panhandle is the very top part, which is at similar latitudes\
      \ to parts of Oklahoma. But Oklahoma City is in central Oklahoma, so the panhandle\
      \ is to the west of Oklahoma. So Stephenville is not in the panhandle; it's\
      \ in north-central Texas. So, latitude-wise, Stephenville is around 32\xB0 N,\

      \ So, the user wants to know if the State University of New York at Cortland,\
      \ NY is located south of Minot State University in North Dakota. Hmm, okay.\
      \ First, I need to figure out the locations of both universities. \n\nLet me\
      \ start with SUNY Cortland. I know that SUNY stands for State University of\
      \ New York, and Cortland is a city in New York. I'm not exactly sure where in\
      \ NY Cortland is, but I think New York State is in the northeastern part of\
      \ the US. Maybe Cortland is somewhere upstate, like central or northern NY.\n\
      \nThen there's Minot State University in North Dakota. North Dakota is a northern\
      \ state, bordering Canada. Minot is a city there. I remember that Minot is in\
      \ the northern part of North Dakota, maybe near the border. So, comparing the\
      \ two, I need to check their latitudes to see which is further south.\n\nWait,\
      \ latitude is the key here. The higher the latitude, the further north a place\
      \ is. So if Cortland, NY has a lower latitude than Minot, ND, then it's south\
      \ of it. But I need the actual coordinates. Let me think. New York State is\
      \ generally south of North Dakota, but I'm not sure. Wait, North Dakota is in\
      \ the Upper Midwest, pretty far north. New York is more east, but how do their\
      \ latitudes compare?\n\nFor example, New York City is around 40.7\xB0 N latitude.\
      \ But Cortland is upstate. Let me recall: Syracuse, NY is around 43\xB0 N. Cortland\
      \ is near Syracuse, maybe a bit south. So maybe around 42.5\xB0 N? \n\nMinot,\
      \ ND: I think it's around 48\xB0 N. Because North Dakota's northern border is\
      \ at 49\xB0 N, which is the border with Canada. Minot is a bit south of that,\
      \ maybe 48.2\xB0 N. If that's the case, then Cortland at 42.5\xB0 N would be\
      \ south of Minot. But wait, I need to confirm the exact coordinates.\n\nAlternatively,\
      \ maybe I can think of major cities. For example, Minneapolis is around 44.9\xB0\
      \ N. If Minot is north of Minneapolis, then it's higher than 45\xB0 N. Cortland,\
      \ NY, being in upstate NY, maybe around 42-43\xB0 N. So yes, Cortland would\
      \ be south of Minot. \n\nBut I should verify. Let me try to recall or estimate.\
      \ Let's see: The 45th parallel is the halfway point between the equator and\
      \ the North Pole. It passes through the northern US. So, states like Oregon,\
      \ Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, etc. So Minot, ND is\
      \ north of the 45th parallel. Cortland, NY is in New York, which is further\
      \ east. The 45th parallel in NY would be up near the Adirondacks, maybe. So\
      \ if Cortland is south of the Adirondacks, then it's below 45\xB0 N. \n\nSo\
      \ if Minot is at 48\xB0 N and Cortland at 42.5\xB0 N, then Cortland is definitely\
      \ south. Therefore, the answer would be YES. But I need to make sure I'm not\
      \ mixing up the locations. Maybe I should check approximate coordinates.\n\n\
      Alternatively, think about the states' positions. North Dakota is way up north,\
      \ while New York, even upstate, is more to the east and a bit lower in latitude.\
      \ For example, Buffalo, NY is around 42.9\xB0 N. Rochester, NY is 43.1\xB0 N.\
      \ Syracuse is 43.0\xB0 N. Cortland is a bit southeast of Syracuse, so maybe\
      \ around 42.6\xB0 N. \n\nMinot, ND's coordinates: I think Minot is at approximately\
      \ 48.2324\xB0 N, 101.2963\xB0 W. So that's about 48.2\xB0 N. Comparing that\
      \ to Cortland, NY, which is around 42.6\xB0 N. Since 42.6 is less than 48.2,\
      \ Cortland is indeed south of Minot. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>To\

      \ is located. Let's start with SUNY Cortland. I know that SUNY stands for State\
      \ University of New York, and Cortland is a city in New York. But where exactly\
      \ is Cortland, NY? I think it's in upstate New York, maybe central part? Then\
      \ Minot State is in North Dakota. Minot, ND is a city in the northern part of\
      \ the state, if I recall correctly. \n\nNext, I need to get the approximate\
      \ latitudes of both cities because latitude determines how far north or south\
      \ a place is. The higher the latitude, the further north it is. So, if Cortland's\
      \ latitude is lower (smaller number) than Minot's, then Cortland is south of\
      \ Minot; if it's higher, then it's north.\n\nI might need to look up the exact\
      \ coordinates. But since I don't have that info memorized, maybe I can estimate\
      \ based on known cities. For example, New York City is around 40.7\xB0 N. Cortland\
      \ is upstate, which would be north of NYC. Let me think... Syracuse, NY is around\
      \ 43\xB0 N, and Cortland is near Syracuse. So maybe Cortland is around 42.6\xB0\
      \ N or so. \n\nNow, Minot, ND. North Dakota is a northern state. Let's see,\
      \ the northern border of the US with Canada is at 49\xB0 N, and Minot is in\
      \ the north-central part of ND. I think Minot's latitude is around 48.2\xB0\
      \ N. \n\nComparing 42.6\xB0 N (Cortland) to 48.2\xB0 N (Minot), Cortland is\
      \ definitely south of Minot. But wait, are my estimated latitudes accurate?\
      \ Let me confirm. Maybe I should think of other reference points. For instance,\
      \ Minneapolis is around 44.9\xB0 N. If Cortland is in central NY, which is north\
      \ of NYC but south of, say, the Canadian border, then yes, maybe around 42-43\xB0\
      \ N. Minot being in North Dakota, which is further north than Minnesota (which\
      \ is north of Iowa, etc.), would have a higher latitude.\n\nAlternatively, I\
      \ can think about state positions. New York is in the northeastern US, but not\
      \ the northernmost. North Dakota is one of the northernmost states, right below\
      \ Canada. So Minot, being in ND, is definitely further north than any part of\
      \ New York. Therefore, Cortland, NY must be south of Minot, ND.\n\nSo putting\
      \ it all together, since the latitude of Cortland, NY is lower than that of\
      \ Minot, ND, the answer should be YES, SUNY Cortland is south of Minot State\
      \ University.\n</think>To determine if SUNY Cortland, NY is south of Minot State\
      \ University, ND:  \n1. **Cortland, NY** is in central New York State, approximately\
      \ **42.6\xB0 N** latitude.  \n2. **Minot, ND** is in northern North Dakota,\
      \ near the Canadian border, approximately **48.2\xB0 N** latitude.  \n3. Since\
      \ 42.6\xB0 N (Cortland) is less than 48.2\xB0 N (Minot), Cortland lies **south**\
      \ of Minot.  \n\nANSWER: YES"

      \nFirst, I need to figure out the locations of both universities. Let's start\

      \ Let me start with Dallas Baptist University (DBU) in Texas. I know Dallas\
      \ is a major city in Texas, so I can look up its approximate latitude. Similarly,\
      \ the Academy of Chinese Culture and Health Sciences (ACCHS) is in California.\
      \ I'm not exactly sure where in California, but maybe it's in a city like San\
      \ Francisco or Los Angeles. Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, the Academy of Chinese\
      \ Culture and Health Sciences\u2014I think I've heard of that. Let me check.\
      \ Oh right, ACCHS is located in Oakland, California. Oakland is in the San Francisco\
      \ Bay Area, right? So now I need the latitudes of Dallas, TX, and Oakland, CA.\n\
      \nLatitude is the key here because that determines how far north or south a\
      \ place is. The higher the latitude, the farther north. So if Dallas has a lower\
      \ latitude than Oakland, then it's further south, which would mean YES. If it's\
      \ higher, then NO.\n\nLet me recall the approximate latitudes. Dallas, Texas\u2014\
      I think Dallas is around 32\xB0N latitude. San Francisco/Oakland area is around\
      \ 37\xB0N to 38\xB0N. Wait, San Francisco is roughly 37.7\xB0N, and Oakland\
      \ is nearby, so maybe similar. Dallas is around 32.8\xB0N. So 32.8 versus 37.8.\
      \ Since 32.8 is less than 37.8, Dallas is further south. Therefore, Dallas Baptist\
      \ University would be south of ACCHS in Oakland, CA.\n\nWait, let me double-check\
      \ these coordinates to be sure. Maybe I should look up the exact coordinates\
      \ of each institution. \n\nLooking up Dallas Baptist University's coordinates:\
      \ According to a quick search, DBU is located at 32.7072\xB0 N, 96.9653\xB0\
      \ W. \n\nNow, the Academy of Chinese Culture and Health Sciences in Oakland:\
      \ Let's check. ACCHS's address is 1601 Clay St, Oakland, CA. Searching for the\
      \ coordinates of Oakland, CA: Oakland's latitude is approximately 37.8044\xB0\
      \ N, 122.2712\xB0 W. \n\nComparing 32.7072\xB0 N (DBU) with 37.8044\xB0 N (ACCHS).\
      \ Since 32.7 is less than 37.8, Dallas is indeed further south. Therefore, the\

      \nFirst, I need to figure out the locations of both institutions. Let's start\
      \ with Dallas Baptist University (DBU) in Texas. I know Dallas is a major city\
      \ in Texas, so I should confirm its approximate latitude. Texas is in the southern\
      \ part of the US, and Dallas is in the northern part of Texas. Wait, but how\
      \ far north exactly? For example, cities like Austin and San Antonio are more\
      \ central/south in Texas. Dallas is closer to the Oklahoma border, right? So\
      \ Dallas is in the northern region of Texas, which is generally a southern state.\
      \ But latitude-wise, how does that compare to a location in California?\n\n\
      Now, the Academy of Chinese Culture and Health Sciences (ACCHS) is in California.\
      \ Let's find out where exactly. A quick check (or recall) might tell me that\
      \ ACCHS is located in Oakland, California. Oakland is in the San Francisco Bay\
      \ Area, which is in Northern California. So Oakland's latitude is around 37.8\xB0\
      \ N. Dallas, on the other hand, has a latitude of approximately 32.8\xB0 N.\
      \ Wait, if Dallas is at 32.8\xB0 N and Oakland is at 37.8\xB0 N, then Dallas\
      \ is actually further south because lower latitude means more southern. So Dallas\
      \ would be south of Oakland, CA.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let me double-check\
      \ the coordinates. Dallas, TX latitude: about 32.7767\xB0 N. Oakland, CA: approximately\
      \ 37.8044\xB0 N. Comparing these, 32.7767 is less than 37.8044, so Dallas is\

      \ N latitude.\n\nNow, comparing the latitudes. Latitude measures how far north\
      \ or south a location is. The higher the latitude, the farther north it is.\
      \ So if DBU in Dallas has a latitude of approximately 32.78\xB0 N and ACCHS\
      \ in Oakland has a latitude of about 37.80\xB0 N, Dallas is at a lower latitude.\
      \ Lower latitude means it's farther south. Therefore, Dallas is south of Oakland.\
      \ \n\nWait, let me confirm the exact locations. Dallas, TX is indeed around\
      \ 32.8\xB0 N, and Oakland, CA is around 37.8\xB0 N. Since 32.8 is less than\
      \ 37.8, Dallas is south of Oakland. So, Dallas Baptist University would be south\

      \ think of the state borders. The northern border of Wisconsin is at 45 degrees\
      \ N, so River Falls is south of that. But how far south?\n\nAlternatively, maybe\
      \ I can recall that Madison, WI is at 43.07\xB0 N. If River Falls is north of\
      \ Madison, then it's higher latitude. Since River Falls is in the western part,\
      \ near Minnesota, which is north of Madison. So maybe around 44.5\xB0 N to 45\xB0\
      \ N. Let's say approximately 44.8\xB0 N.\n\nSo if Benton Harbor, MI is around\
      \ 42.1\xB0 N and River Falls, WI is around 44.8\xB0 N, then Benton Harbor is\

      \ but maybe I got the latitudes wrong. Let me try to think of other reference\

      \ Milwaukee, WI is at 43.04\xB0 N. So River Falls is north of Milwaukee. So\
      \ if River Falls is at 44.8\xB0 N, and Benton Harbor is at 42.1\xB0 N, then\
      \ yes, Benton Harbor is south. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look up approximate\
      \ coordinates. Let me try to recall. Benton Harbor, MI: I think it's around\
      \ 42.1167\xB0 N latitude. University of Wisconsin-River Falls is in River Falls,\
      \ WI, which is at approximately 44.8575\xB0 N latitude. So 42.1 vs 44.85. That's\
      \ a difference of about 2.75 degrees, which is roughly 190 miles. Since each\

      ANSWER: YES"
    470b0bb3-abdc-4f04-b927-959cff685742: "<think>Alright, so I need to figure out\
      \ if Lake Michigan College in Michigan is located south of the University of\
      \ Wisconsin\u2013River Falls in Wisconsin. Let me break this down step by step.\n\
      \nFirst, I should probably locate both institutions on a map. Let's start with\
      \ the University of Wisconsin\u2013River Falls. River Falls is a city in Wisconsin,\
      \ right? I know Wisconsin is north of Illinois and borders Lake Michigan to\
      \ the east. The University of Wisconsin\u2013River Falls is likely in the city\
      \ of River Falls, WI. Now, where exactly is River Falls in Wisconsin? I think\
      \ it's in the western part of the state, near the Minnesota border. Maybe near\
      \ the Twin Cities area? Because I recall that the St. Croix River is near there,\
      \ separating Minnesota and Wisconsin. So River Falls might be in that region,\
      \ which is in the northwest part of Wisconsin.\n\nNow, Lake Michigan College\
      \ is in Michigan. Michigan has two main peninsulas: the Lower Peninsula and\
      \ the Upper Peninsula. Lake Michigan College\u2014since it's named after the\
      \ lake, perhaps it's near Lake Michigan. Let me check where exactly it is. A\
      \ quick mental note: Lake Michigan College is in Benton Harbor, Michigan. Benton\
      \ Harbor is in the southwestern part of Michigan's Lower Peninsula, right along\
      \ the eastern shore of Lake Michigan. So that's in the southwest part of Michigan,\
      \ near the Indiana border. Cities like St. Joseph are there, and it's across\
      \ the lake from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nSo now I need to compare the latitudes\
      \ of Benton Harbor, MI (Lake Michigan College) and River Falls, WI (University\
      \ of Wisconsin\u2013River Falls). Latitude determines how far north or south\
      \ a location is. The higher the latitude, the farther north.\n\nI think River\
      \ Falls, WI is quite far north. Let's approximate. The approximate latitude\
      \ for River Falls, WI might be around 44\xB0 51' N. Benton Harbor, MI is around\
      \ 42\xB0 07' N. Latitude is measured in degrees, minutes, seconds. Each degree\
      \ is about 69 miles. So, 44\xB051' would be 44.85 degrees, and 42\xB007' is\
      \ about 42.12 degrees. The difference is roughly 2.73 degrees. Since each degree\
      \ is about 69 miles, that's a significant distance. Since 42.12 is less than\
      \ 44.85, Benton Harbor (Lake Michigan College) is south of River Falls (UW\u2013\
      River Falls). Therefore, yes, Lake Michigan College is located south of the\
      \ University of Wisconsin\u2013River Falls.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\
      \ Maybe I have the coordinates wrong. Let me think again. If River Falls is\
      \ near Minneapolis-St. Paul, which is around 44\xB058'N, so that's about 45\
      \ degrees. Benton Harbor, MI, being in the southwest of Michigan, near the Indiana\
      \ border, Indiana's latitude is around 41.5\xB0N at its northern border, so\
      \ Benton Harbor would be a bit north of that. Let's say around 42.1\xB0N. So\
      \ 42.1 versus 44.85. Yes, 42.1 is definitely south of 44.85. So the answer is\
      \ YES.\n</think>To determine if Lake Michigan College, MI is south of University\
      \ of Wisconsin\u2013River Falls, WI:  \n1. **Locate the universities**:  \n\

      \ the Minnesota border (~44\xB051'N latitude).  \n   - **Lake Michigan College**\

      \ Michigan College, MI is located south of University of Wisconsin\u2013River\

      \ of both institutions. Lake Michigan College is in Michigan, and the University\
      \ of Wisconsin\u2013River Falls is in Wisconsin. I remember that Michigan is\
      \ to the east of Wisconsin, but I'm not entirely sure about their exact positions\
      \ relative to each other. \n\nI know that Wisconsin is west of Lake Michigan,\
      \ and Michigan's Lower Peninsula is the part that's shaped like a mitten. Lake\
      \ Michigan College's main campus is in Benton Harbor, Michigan, I think. Let\
      \ me confirm that. Yes, Benton Harbor is a city in southwestern Michigan, right\

      On the other hand, the University of Wisconsin\u2013River Falls is in River\
      \ Falls, Wisconsin. Where is River Falls located? I believe it's in the western\

      \ is with Illinois, but River Falls is in the northwest part, near cities like\
      \ Minneapolis-St. Paul, which is in Minnesota. \n\nSo, now I need to compare\
      \ the latitudes. Latitude determines how far north or south a place is. If Benton\
      \ Harbor, MI is at a lower latitude (more south) than River Falls, WI, then\
      \ the answer is yes. Let me think about the approximate latitudes. \n\nBenton\
      \ Harbor, MI: I think it's around 42 degrees north. For example, Chicago is\
      \ around 41.88\xB0N, so Benton Harbor, being a bit north of there, maybe 42.1\xB0\
      N. \n\nRiver Falls, WI: Let me check. Minneapolis is about 44.98\xB0N, but River\
      \ Falls is a bit east of Minneapolis. Wait, River Falls is actually in western\
      \ Wisconsin, near the St. Croix River. Let me recall that the Twin Cities (Minneapolis-St.\

      \ around 44.8\xB0N? Or perhaps lower. Wait, maybe I should look up specific\
      \ coordinates. \n\nAlternatively, I can think about major cities. Milwaukee,\
      \ WI is around 43\xB0N. Madison, WI is around 43.07\xB0N. River Falls is northwest\
      \ of Madison, so it's probably higher in latitude. Let's say around 44.8\xB0\
      N. \n\nIf Benton Harbor is at 42.1\xB0N and River Falls is at 44.8\xB0N, then\
      \ Benton Harbor is significantly further south. Therefore, Lake Michigan College\

      Looking up Benton Harbor, MI's latitude: According to a quick search, Benton\
      \ Harbor's latitude is approximately 42.1167\xB0 N. \n\nRiver Falls, WI's latitude:\

      \ I think it's in the southwestern part of Michigan. Maybe Benton Harbor? Yes,\
      \ I believe Lake Michigan College's main campus is in Benton Harbor, MI. \n\n\
      Then the University of Wisconsin\u2013River Falls is in River Falls, Wisconsin.\
      \ Where is River Falls? I know that Wisconsin is to the west of Michigan, and\

      \ right near the border with Minnesota, so that's pretty far north.\n\nNow,\
      \ I need to compare the latitudes. Benton Harbor, MI: I should find its latitude.\
      \ From what I remember, Benton Harbor is along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan,\
      \ in the lower peninsula of Michigan. The southern part of Michigan is around\
      \ the same latitude as northern Indiana. For example, cities like South Bend,\
      \ IN are at around 41.7\xB0 N. Benton Harbor is nearby, so maybe similar latitude.\
      \ Let me check mentally\u2014Chicago is around 41.8\xB0 N. Benton Harbor is\
      \ a bit northeast of Chicago, but still, maybe around 42\xB0 N? Wait, no, Chicago\
      \ is 41.8, and Benton Harbor is a bit north of that. Maybe 42.1\xB0 N?\n\nOn\
      \ the other hand, River Falls, WI. Let's think. The Twin Cities (Minneapolis-St.\
      \ Paul) are around 44.9\xB0 N. River Falls is about 30 miles east of Minneapolis,\
      \ so maybe a bit lower? Wait, no, actually, River Falls is east of the Twin\
      \ Cities, but still in the same general latitude. Let me check. If Minneapolis\
      \ is 44.9\xB0 N, then River Falls might be slightly south, but not by much.\
      \ Maybe around 44.8\xB0 N? Wait, but I might be mixing up. Alternatively, maybe\
      \ River Falls is at about 44.85\xB0 N. \n\nWait, perhaps I should recall specific\
      \ coordinates. Let me think. Benton Harbor, MI: According to my memory, its\
      \ coordinates are approximately 42.1167\xB0 N latitude. For River Falls, WI:\
      \ The University of Wisconsin-River Falls is located at 44.9536\xB0 N latitude.\
      \ Wait, that's higher than I thought. If that's the case, then River Falls is\
      \ at around 44.95\xB0 N, and Benton Harbor is at 42.12\xB0 N. \n\nSo, 42.12\xB0\
      \ N vs. 44.95\xB0 N. Since latitude increases as you go north, 42.12 is south\
      \ of 44.95. Therefore, Lake Michigan College (Benton Harbor, MI) is indeed south\
      \ of University of Wisconsin\u2013River Falls (River Falls, WI). \n\nWait, but\
      \ let me make sure I didn't mix up the coordinates. Maybe I should double-check.\
      \ If I'm correct about Benton Harbor being around 42\xB0 N and River Falls around\
      \ 45\xB0 N, then yes, 42 is south of 45. So the answer would be YES. But I need\
      \ to be careful. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I confused the\
      \ locations. For example, is there a chance that River Falls is actually further\
      \ south? If River Falls were in southern Wisconsin, like near Madison, which\
      \ is around 43\xB0 N, then Benton Harbor at 42.1\xB0 N would be slightly south.\
      \ But I think River Falls is in western Wisconsin, closer to the Twin Cities,\
      \ which are around 45\xB0 N. So River Falls is indeed north of Benton Harbor.\

      \ I need to compare the latitudes. Benton Harbor, MI: I should find its latitude.\
      \ From what I remember, Benton Harbor is along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan,\

      \ is 44.9\xB0 N, then River Falls might be slightly south, but not by much.\
      \ Maybe around 44.8\xB0 N? Wait, but I might be mixing up. Alternatively, maybe\
      \ River Falls is at about 44.85\xB0 N. \n\nWait, perhaps I should recall specific\

      \ The University of Wisconsin-River Falls is located at 44.9536\xB0 N latitude.\
      \ Wait, that's higher than I thought. If that's the case, then River Falls is\

      \ N vs. 44.95\xB0 N. Since latitude increases as you go north, 42.12 is south\

      \ If I'm correct about Benton Harbor being around 42\xB0 N and River Falls around\
      \ 45\xB0 N, then yes, 42 is south of 45. So the answer would be YES. But I need\
      \ to be careful. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I confused the\

      \ south? If River Falls were in southern Wisconsin, like near Madison, which\
      \ is around 43\xB0 N, then Benton Harbor at 42.1\xB0 N would be slightly south.\
      \ But I think River Falls is in western Wisconsin, closer to the Twin Cities,\
      \ which are around 45\xB0 N. So River Falls is indeed north of Benton Harbor.\

      \ So that's pretty far north. Colorado, being further west, but where exactly?\
      \ Alamosa is in southern Colorado, near the New Mexico border. Southern Colorado\

      \ about whether one is south of the other, latitude is key. The further south\
      \ a location is, the lower its latitude. \n\nLet me recall approximate latitudes.\
      \ Milwaukee, WI is around 43\xB0N latitude. St. Louis, MO is further south.\
      \ I think St. Louis is around 38\xB0N. If Waukesha is near Milwaukee, then its\
      \ latitude is about 43\xB0N. So St. Louis at 38\xB0N would be significantly\
      \ south of that. \n\nWait, but I should double-check the exact coordinates.\
      \ Let me think. Waukesha, WI: I can look up its coordinates. Let's see, Waukesha\
      \ is at approximately 43.0117\xB0 N, 88.2315\xB0 W. Concordia Seminary in St.\
      \ Louis, MO: St. Louis is around 38.6270\xB0 N, 90.1994\xB0 W. So comparing\
      \ 38.6\xB0 N vs. 43.0\xB0 N. Since 38.6 is less than 43, that means St. Louis\
      \ (Concordia Seminary) is indeed south of Waukesha (University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Waukesha). \n\nTherefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step\

      \ might be around the same latitude as southern Kansas? Wait, no. Kansas is\
      \ directly north of Oklahoma, which is north of Texas. So the northern border\

      \ south of the Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs in Ohio. Hmm, okay.\
      \ First, I need to figure out where each of these institutions is located.\n\
      \nStarting with Ohio Valley University (OVU). I know that's in West Virginia.\
      \ Let me recall... I think OVU is in Vienna, WV. Vienna is a city in Wood County,\
      \ right? Now, I should confirm the exact location. Maybe I can check the coordinates\
      \ or the general area. Vienna, WV is in the northern part of West Virginia,\
      \ near the Ohio River. That makes sense because the Ohio River forms the border\
      \ between West Virginia and Ohio there.\n\nNext, the Maxine Goodman Levin College\
      \ of Urban Affairs. That's part of Cleveland State University in Ohio. So, it's\
      \ located in Cleveland, OH. Now, where is Cleveland? It's in northeastern Ohio,\
      \ on the southern shore of Lake Erie. So, Cleveland is in the northern part\
      \ of Ohio, near the lake.\n\nNow, comparing the latitudes of Vienna, WV and\
      \ Cleveland, OH. Since Cleveland is in the northern part of Ohio and Vienna\
      \ is in the northern part of West Virginia, but I need to see which is further\
      \ south. Let me think about the general geography. West Virginia is south of\
      \ Pennsylvania and borders Ohio to the west. However, the northern panhandle\
      \ of West Virginia (where Vienna is) is actually at a similar latitude to parts\
      \ of Ohio. But Cleveland is way up north, near Lake Erie. So, Vienna, WV is\
      \ likely south of Cleveland, OH. \n\nWait, let me double-check. If I recall,\
      \ the latitude of Cleveland is approximately 41.4993\xB0 N. Vienna, WV's latitude\
      \ is around 39.3270\xB0 N. Since latitude increases as you go north, 39.3\xB0\

      \ south of the Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs in Ohio. They need\
      \ a clear YES or NO answer, but it requires some steps to figure out. Let me\
      \ start breaking it down.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the exact locations of\
      \ both institutions. Ohio Valley University (OVU) is in West Virginia. I remember\
      \ that OVU is in Vienna, WV. Wait, is that correct? Let me confirm. A quick\
      \ mental check: I think Vienna is a city in West Virginia, yes. So OVU is in\
      \ Vienna, WV.\n\nNext, the Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs. That's\
      \ part of Cleveland State University in Ohio, right? So the college is located\
      \ in Cleveland, OH. I believe Cleveland is in the northeastern part of Ohio,\
      \ near Lake Erie. \n\nNow, I need to compare the latitudes of Vienna, WV and\
      \ Cleveland, OH to determine which is further south. Latitude measures how far\
      \ north or south a place is. The lower the latitude, the further south it is.\
      \ So if Vienna's latitude is lower than Cleveland's, then OVU is south of Levin\
      \ College.\n\nLet me recall the approximate latitudes. Cleveland, OH is around\
      \ 41.4995\xB0 N. Vienna, WV, let me think... West Virginia is south of Ohio,\
      \ but not all parts. Vienna is in the northwestern part of West Virginia, near\
      \ the Ohio River. Maybe its latitude is similar to the southern part of Ohio.\
      \ Wait, but Cleveland is in the northern part of Ohio. So even if Vienna is\
      \ in West Virginia, which is generally south of Ohio, its exact position matters.\n\
      \nAlternatively, maybe Vienna, WV is actually north of Cleveland. Wait, that\
      \ seems unlikely. Let me think of cities in the area. For example, Pittsburgh,\
      \ PA is at around 40.4406\xB0 N. Cleveland is around 41.5\xB0 N. So Pittsburgh\
      \ is south of Cleveland. Vienna, WV is near the border with Ohio. Let me check\
      \ approximate coordinates. If Vienna, WV is at around 39.33\xB0 N, then that's\
      \ definitely south of Cleveland's 41.5\xB0 N. But I need to be precise.\n\n\
      Wait, maybe I should think about the Ohio River. The Ohio River forms the border\
      \ between Ohio and West Virginia in that area. Vienna, WV is just across the\
      \ river from Ohio. So if the river is the boundary, then Vienna is in WV, south\
      \ of the river. But Cleveland is way up north in Ohio. So even though Vienna\
      \ is in the northern part of WV, it's still south relative to Cleveland, which\
      \ is in northern Ohio. Therefore, Vienna, WV would be south of Cleveland, OH.\

      \ Arkansas State University-Newport in Arkansas is located south of the University\
      \ of Hartford in Connecticut. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst,\
      \ I should probably find the locations of both universities. Let me start with\
      \ Arkansas State University-Newport (ASU-Newport). I know that Newport is a\
      \ city in Arkansas. Where exactly is Newport in Arkansas? Arkansas is a state\
      \ in the southern United States. Newport is in the northeast part of Arkansas,\
      \ I think. Maybe near the border with Missouri? I remember that the White River\
      \ runs through Newport. So, the coordinates... maybe I should look up the latitude\
      \ of Newport, AR. Latitude determines how north or south a place is.\n\nThen,\
      \ the University of Hartford in Connecticut. Hartford is the capital of Connecticut,\
      \ which is in the northeastern US, part of New England. Connecticut is north\
      \ of New York. So Hartford's latitude is probably higher (more north) than places\
      \ in Arkansas. But I need to confirm the exact coordinates.\n\nLet me recall:\
      \ latitude lines run horizontally, and the higher the latitude number, the farther\
      \ north a place is. For example, New York City is around 40.7\xB0 N, and Miami\
      \ is around 25.7\xB0 N. So if I can get the latitudes of both cities, I can\
      \ compare.\n\nLooking up ASU-Newport's location: Newport, AR. Let me think.\
      \ Newport, AR's latitude is approximately 35.6\xB0 N. I'm not 100% sure, but\
      \ I think that's right. Maybe 35\xB035'N? Let's say around 35.6\xB0N.\n\nHartford,\
      \ CT: Its latitude is higher. Hartford is around 41.7\xB0 N. For example, Hartford's\
      \ coordinates are approximately 41.76\xB0 N latitude. So comparing 35.6\xB0\
      N vs 41.7\xB0N. Since 35.6 is less than 41.7, that would mean Newport, AR is\
      \ south of Hartford, CT. Therefore, yes, ASU-Newport is south of University\
      \ of Hartford.\n\nWait, need to make sure the exact coordinates. Let me double-check.\
      \ Maybe I can recall some nearby cities. For example, Little Rock, AR is around\
      \ 34.7\xB0N. So Newport being in northeast Arkansas would be a bit north of\
      \ Little Rock, so maybe 35.6\xB0N makes sense. And Hartford, CT being further\
      \ north, yes. For instance, Boston is around 42.3\xB0N, so Hartford a bit south\
      \ of Boston would be around 41.7. That checks out.\n\nTherefore, since 35.6\xB0\
      N (Newport, AR) is less than 41.7\xB0N (Hartford, CT), Newport is indeed south\
      \ of Hartford. So the answer should be YES.\n</think>To determine if Arkansas\

      N**.  \n- **Hartford, CT** is at approximately **41.7\xB0N**.  \n\nSince lower\

      \ the city. Now, where is Hartford, CT in terms of latitude? I remember that\
      \ states in the Northeast like Connecticut are generally at a higher latitude\
      \ (more north) compared to southern states like Arkansas. But I need to be specific.\n\
      \nNext, Arkansas State University-Newport. Newport is a city in Arkansas. Arkansas\
      \ is in the southern United States. But where exactly is Newport, AR located?\
      \ Is it in the northern part of Arkansas or the southern part? Because even\
      \ within a state, the latitude can vary. For example, the northern part of Arkansas\
      \ might be at a higher latitude than the southern part. So I need to check the\
      \ actual coordinates.\n\nI think I should compare the latitudes of both cities.\
      \ The one with the lower latitude is further south. So if Newport, AR has a\
      \ lower latitude than Hartford, CT, then the answer is yes. Let me recall approximate\
      \ latitudes. Hartford, CT is around 41.76\xB0 N. Newport, AR... I'm not exactly\
      \ sure. Let me think. Arkansas as a state ranges from about 33\xB0 N to 36.5\xB0\
      \ N latitude. So Newport, AR would be somewhere in that range. Let's say, maybe\
      \ around 35.5\xB0 N? Because Newport is in the eastern part of Arkansas, perhaps\
      \ central or northern part? Wait, wait. Let me think. Arkansas's northern border\
      \ is at 36.5\xB0 N, so if Newport is in the northern part, it might be around\
      \ 35.5\xB0 to 36\xB0 N. But even 36\xB0 N is still south of Hartford's 41.76\xB0\
      \ N. Because 36 is less than 41, so 36\xB0 N is further south.\n\nWait, 36\xB0\
      \ N would be 5 degrees south of 41\xB0 N. Each degree is about 69 miles, so\
      \ that's about 345 miles difference. So even if Newport, AR is in the northern\
      \ part of Arkansas, it's still significantly south of Hartford, CT. Therefore,\
      \ unless I'm mixing up the latitudes, the answer should be yes.\n\nBut let me\
      \ verify. Maybe Newport, AR is at a specific latitude. Let me try to recall\
      \ or logically deduce. For example, Little Rock, the capital of Arkansas, is\
      \ around 34.74\xB0 N. That's more towards the center. Newport is in Jackson\
      \ County, Arkansas. Looking up in my mind's map, Jackson County is in northeastern\
      \ Arkansas. So perhaps Newport is around 35.5\xB0 N, which is still well south\
      \ of Hartford. Because 35.5 is still lower than 41.76. So yes, Arkansas State\
      \ University-Newport is indeed south of University of Hartford.\n</think>To\

      \nNow, Arkansas State University-Newport is in Arkansas. Newport is a city in\

      \ further south.\n\nFirst, I should confirm where each university is located.\
      \ The University of Virginia (UVA) is in Charlottesville, Virginia. The Center\
      \ for Politics is part of UVA, so it's in Charlottesville too. Ball State University\
      \ is in Muncie, Indiana. \n\nNow, I need to find the latitude of both cities.\
      \ Latitude measures how far north or south a place is. The higher the latitude,\
      \ the further north. So if Charlottesville's latitude is lower than Muncie's,\
      \ then it's further south.\n\nLet me recall or maybe estimate. Virginia is in\
      \ the southeastern U.S., while Indiana is more in the Midwest, north of Kentucky.\
      \ Charlottesville, VA is somewhere in the central part of Virginia. Muncie,\
      \ IN is in the east-central part of Indiana. \n\nI think Indiana is generally\
      \ north of Virginia. For example, the southern border of Indiana is along the\
      \ Ohio River, which separates it from Kentucky. Virginia's northern border is\
      \ with Maryland and West Virginia, which are further north than Indiana? Wait,\
      \ no. Wait, Maryland is east of West Virginia. Let me think about the map. Indiana\
      \ is west of Ohio, which is north of Kentucky. Virginia is east of Kentucky\
      \ and Tennessee. So, Virginia is south of Pennsylvania and Maryland, but Indiana\
      \ is further west but how far north?\n\nAlternatively, maybe compare the actual\
      \ latitudes. Let me try to remember approximate latitudes. For example, Indianapolis,\
      \ IN is around 39.77\xB0 N. Charlottesville, VA is around 38.03\xB0 N. If that's\
      \ accurate, then Charlottesville is south of Indianapolis. But Ball State is\
      \ in Muncie, IN. Where is Muncie compared to Indianapolis? Muncie is northeast\
      \ of Indianapolis. So maybe Muncie's latitude is a bit higher than Indianapolis.\
      \ Let's say Indianapolis is 39.77\xB0 N, Muncie might be around 40.19\xB0 N.\
      \ If Charlottesville is 38.03\xB0 N, then yes, Charlottesville is south of Muncie.\
      \ \n\nBut wait, I should verify these numbers. Let me think. Charlottesville,\
      \ VA: I recall that Richmond, VA is around 37.54\xB0 N, and Charlottesville\
      \ is northwest of Richmond, so maybe a bit higher latitude. But maybe 38 degrees.\
      \ Muncie, IN: Indiana's latitude ranges from about 37.77\xB0 N at the southern\
      \ border to 41.7\xB0 N at the northern border. Muncie is in the east-central\
      \ part, so maybe around 40\xB0 N. \n\nIf Charlottesville is at approximately\
      \ 38\xB0 N and Muncie at 40\xB0 N, then Charlottesville is indeed south of Muncie.\

      \ So, I need to determine if the University of Virginia Center for Politics\
      \ in Virginia is located south of Ball State University in Indiana. Hmm. Let\
      \ me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should find the locations of\
      \ both universities. The University of Virginia Center for Politics is part\
      \ of the University of Virginia, right? So, where is the main campus of the\
      \ University of Virginia? I think it's in Charlottesville, Virginia. Then Ball\
      \ State University is in Muncie, Indiana. So, the key is to compare the latitudes\
      \ of Charlottesville, VA, and Muncie, IN, because latitude determines how far\
      \ north or south a place is.\n\nNext, I need to figure out the approximate latitudes\
      \ of both cities. Let me recall. Virginia is a southern state compared to Indiana,\
      \ but I'm not exactly sure about the specific cities. Let me think... Indiana\
      \ is in the Midwest, and Muncie is in the eastern part of Indiana. Virginia\
      \ is on the East Coast, more to the south. Charlottesville is in central Virginia.\
      \ Wait, but maybe their latitudes are similar? Or is Virginia actually further\
      \ south?\n\nI might be mixing this up. Let me visualize a map of the US. Indiana\
      \ is north of Kentucky, which is south of Indiana. Virginia is east of Kentucky\
      \ and Tennessee. Wait, Kentucky borders Virginia to the south? No, actually,\
      \ Kentucky is south of the Ohio River, and Virginia is to the east. Let me get\
      \ this straight. Virginia's northern border is with Maryland and West Virginia.\
      \ West Virginia is to the west of Virginia. Kentucky is south of West Virginia\
      \ and Indiana is north of Kentucky. So, Charlottesville, VA, compared to Muncie,\
      \ IN. Muncie is in Indiana, which is north of Kentucky. Virginia is east of\
      \ Kentucky and West Virginia. So, maybe Charlottesville is actually further\
      \ south than Muncie? Or not?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the actual\
      \ latitudes. Let me think from memory. For example, the latitude of Indianapolis,\
      \ Indiana is around 39.7684\xB0 N. Muncie is a bit northeast of Indianapolis,\
      \ so maybe a similar or slightly higher latitude. Let's say around 40\xB0 N.\
      \ Charlottesville, VA, I believe is around 38\xB0 N. For example, Richmond,\
      \ VA is about 37.5407\xB0 N, and Charlottesville is a bit northwest of Richmond,\
      \ so maybe around 38.03\xB0 N. If that's the case, then Charlottesville's latitude\
      \ is lower (more south) than Muncie's. Therefore, University of Virginia Center\
      \ for Politics would be south of Ball State University.\n\nWait, but I'm not\
      \ entirely sure about the exact latitudes. Maybe I should think of another way.\
      \ For example, the Mason-Dixon line is the border between Pennsylvania and Maryland,\
      \ which is around 39\xB043' N. That's the traditional boundary between the North\
      \ and South. So, if Muncie, IN is north of that line and Charlottesville is\
      \ south of it, then yes. Let me check. The Mason-Dixon line is at approximately\
      \ 39\xB043' N. Charlottesville's latitude is about 38.03\xB0 N, which is definitely\
      \ south of the Mason-Dixon line. Muncie, IN's latitude is around 40.1934\xB0\
      \ N, which is north of the Mason-Dixon line. Therefore, Charlottesville is south\
      \ of Muncie. So, the answer would be YES.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm mixing Muncie's\
      \ location. Let me confirm. Ball State University is in Muncie, Indiana. Muncie's\
      \ coordinates are approximately 40.1934\xB0 N, 85.3864\xB0 W. University of\
      \ Virginia in Charlottesville is at approximately 38.0336\xB0 N, 78.4935\xB0\
      \ W. So, comparing 38.03\xB0 N vs. 40.19\xB0 N. Since 38 is less than 40, Charlottesville\
      \ is indeed south of Muncie. Therefore, YES, the University of Virginia Center\
      \ for Politics is located south of Ball State University.\n</think>To determine\
      \ if the University of Virginia Center for Politics, VA (UVA) is south of Ball\

      \ Webb Institute is a specialized engineering college. Maybe it's in Long Island?\
      \ Let me confirm. Yes, Webb Institute is located in Glen Cove, New York, which\

      \ New York State is generally north of North Carolina. For example, New York\
      \ City is around 40.7\xB0 N. Glen Cove is a bit north of NYC, maybe around 40.8\xB0\

      \ NC is located south of Webb Institute in NY. I need to break this down step\
      \ by step.\n\nFirst, I should find the locations of both institutions. Let me\
      \ start with Webb Institute. I remember that Webb Institute is a specialized\
      \ engineering college, and I think it's in New York. Let me confirm where exactly.\
      \ A quick search in my mind tells me Webb Institute is located in Glen Cove,\
      \ New York. So, Glen Cove, NY is the place. \n\nNext, the University of North\
      \ Carolina at Pembroke (UNC Pembroke) is in Pembroke, North Carolina. So, both\
      \ cities are on the East Coast, but in different states. Now, I need to compare\
      \ their latitudes to see which is further south.\n\nI know that generally, the\
      \ southern states are below the northern states. North Carolina is south of\
      \ New York, so logically, a university in NC should be south of one in NY. But\
      \ to be precise, maybe checking the exact coordinates would help. \n\nFor Webb\
      \ Institute in Glen Cove, NY. Glen Cove is on Long Island. Long Island's latitude\
      \ is around 40.8 degrees north. Let me recall: New York City is around 40.7\xB0\
      N, so Glen Cove being on the north shore of Long Island might be a bit higher,\
      \ maybe 40.8 or 40.9\xB0N.\n\nUNC Pembroke is in Pembroke, NC. North Carolina\
      \ is further south. Let me think about the latitude of Pembroke. North Carolina's\
      \ general latitude range is about 33\xB0N to 36.5\xB0N. For example, Charlotte,\
      \ NC is around 35.2\xB0N. Pembroke is in the southeastern part of NC, near the\
      \ South Carolina border. So maybe around 34.7\xB0N? Let me check that. If I\
      \ recall correctly, Pembroke's coordinates are approximately 34.6849\xB0 N latitude.\
      \ \n\nComparing the two: Webb at ~40.8\xB0N and UNC Pembroke at ~34.7\xB0N.\
      \ Since latitude increases as you go north, a lower latitude means further south.\
      \ 34.7 is definitely lower than 40.8, so UNC Pembroke is south of Webb Institute.\
      \ \n\nTherefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES. The University of North\

      \ Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify the locations\
      \ of both universities. Let me start with Elizabeth City State University (ECSU)\
      \ in North Carolina. Elizabeth City is a city in northeastern North Carolina,\
      \ right? I think it's near the coast, maybe close to the border with Virginia.\
      \ ECSU is part of the University of North Carolina system. Now, where exactly\
      \ is Elizabeth City? I remember that it's on the Pasquotank River, near the\
      \ Albemarle Sound. Geographically, I believe it's in the northeastern part of\
      \ NC, so its latitude is probably higher (more north) than a lot of other places\
      \ in the state.\n\nNext, Florida A&M University (FAMU) and Florida State University\
      \ (FSU) College of Engineering. Wait, I think that's a joint college between\
      \ FAMU and FSU, located in Tallahassee, Florida. So the College of Engineering\
      \ is part of both universities, but physically located in Tallahassee. Where\
      \ is Tallahassee in Florida? It's the state capital, in the northern part of\
      \ Florida, right? Florida is a peninsula that goes southward, so the northern\
      \ part of Florida is closer to Georgia and Alabama. Tallahassee is in the panhandle\
      \ region, which is the northwestern part of Florida.\n\nNow, I need to compare\
      \ the latitudes of Elizabeth City, NC and Tallahassee, FL. Since latitude determines\
      \ how far north or south a location is. If Tallahassee is at a lower latitude\
      \ (more south) than Elizabeth City, then the answer is YES. If not, then NO.\n\
      \nLet me recall approximate latitudes. Elizabeth City, NC: I don't remember\
      \ the exact number, but since it's in the northeastern part of NC, maybe around\
      \ 36.3\xB0 N? Tallahassee, FL: being in northern Florida, perhaps around 30.4\xB0\
      \ N? Wait, Florida's panhandle is at a lower latitude than the rest of the northern\
      \ parts of Florida. For example, Jacksonville is around 30.3\xB0 N. Tallahassee\
      \ is a bit west of Jacksonville but still in the northern part. Let me confirm.\
      \ Yes, Tallahassee's latitude is approximately 30.4383\xB0 N. Elizabeth City,\
      \ NC is around 36.2956\xB0 N. \n\nComparing 30.4383\xB0 N (Tallahassee) and\
      \ 36.2956\xB0 N (Elizabeth City). Since 30.4383 is less than 36.2956, Tallahassee\
      \ is further south. Therefore, Florida A&M/FSU College of Engineering in Tallahassee\
      \ is indeed south of Elizabeth City State University in NC.\n\nWait, but maybe\
      \ I should double-check the exact locations. Let me think of major cities. Elizabeth\
      \ City is in NC, near the Virginia border. Norfolk, VA is at around 36.85\xB0\
      \ N, and Raleigh, NC is about 35.77\xB0 N. Elizabeth City being in northeastern\
      \ NC, maybe around 36.3\xB0 N. Tallahassee, FL is in the Florida Panhandle,\
      \ which is definitely in the northern part of Florida but still, Florida is\
      \ a southern state. So yes, even northern Florida is south of North Carolina.\
      \ Because North Carolina is a more northern state compared to Florida. So any\
      \ point in Florida is going to be south of any point in North Carolina? Wait,\
      \ is that true?\n\nWait, no. States can have overlapping longitudes but different\
      \ latitudes. For example, the western part of North Carolina is around 35\xB0\
      \ N to 36.5\xB0 N, while Florida's northern border is at 31\xB0 N (the FL-GA-AL\
      \ line). Wait, actually, the northern border of Florida is at 31\xB0 N approximately.\
      \ So Tallahassee is at 30.43\xB0 N, which is just a bit south of the Florida-Georgia\
      \ border. But Elizabeth City, NC is at 36.3\xB0 N, which is significantly north.\
      \ Therefore, yes, Tallahassee is much further south. So the answer would be\
      \ YES.\n</think>To determine if Florida A&M University \u2013 Florida State\

      \ City, North Carolina. So I need to compare the latitudes of Tallahassee, FL,\
      \ and Elizabeth City, NC. The one with the lower latitude is further south.\
      \ \n\nI recall that Florida is a southern state, and North Carolina is further\
      \ north compared to Florida. But specific cities might vary. Let me think about\
      \ the approximate positions. Tallahassee is in the Florida Panhandle, which\
      \ is the northern part of Florida, but still Florida is generally south of North\
      \ Carolina. Elizabeth City is in northeastern North Carolina, near the coast.\
      \ \n\nTo get precise coordinates, I need to check. Let me recall or estimate.\
      \ Tallahassee's latitude is around 30.45\xB0 N. Elizabeth City, NC's latitude\
      \ is approximately 36.29\xB0 N. Since latitude increases as you go north, the\
      \ lower number is further south. Therefore, 30.45\xB0 N (Tallahassee) is south\
      \ of 36.29\xB0 N (Elizabeth City). \n\nWait, wait, but maybe I should verify\
      \ these coordinates. If I'm not sure, I might make a mistake. Let me think again.\
      \ Tallahassee is definitely in northern Florida, but Florida is a peninsula\
      \ that extends southward. The Florida Panhandle, where Tallahassee is, is the\

      \ is above South Carolina and Georgia, so Elizabeth City, being in NC, should\
      \ be at a higher latitude than any part of Florida. \n\nFor example, Miami is\
      \ around 25.76\xB0 N, which is much further south, but Tallahassee is more north.\
      \ However, even the northernmost point in Florida is still south of the southernmost\
      \ point in North Carolina. Because Florida is a southern state, and North Carolina\
      \ is in the southeastern U.S. but further north. \n\nSo yes, Tallahassee, FL\

      \ the locations of both universities. Let me start with Elizabeth City State\
      \ University (ECSU) in North Carolina. I know that Elizabeth City is in the\
      \ northeastern part of North Carolina, near the coast. If I recall correctly,\
      \ Elizabeth City is close to the Virginia border and the Albemarle Sound. Maybe\

      \ 36 degrees North, maybe? Let me check... I think cities like Norfolk, VA are\
      \ around 36.85\xB0N, and Elizabeth City is a bit south of that. Maybe around\
      \ 36.3\xB0N.\n\nNow, Florida A&M University (FAMU) \u2013 Florida State University\
      \ (FSU) College of Engineering. Both FAMU and FSU are in Tallahassee, Florida,\
      \ right? Tallahassee is the capital of Florida, located in the northern part\

      \ near the Georgia border. The latitude of Tallahassee is about 30.43\xB0N.\
      \ Let me confirm that... Yes, Tallahassee's coordinates are approximately 30\xB0\
      26' North, 84\xB017' West.\n\nSo comparing the two latitudes: Elizabeth City,\
      \ NC is around 36.3\xB0N and Tallahassee, FL is around 30.4\xB0N. Since latitude\
      \ decreases as you go south, a lower latitude means a more southern location.\
      \ Therefore, Tallahassee at 30.4\xB0N is indeed south of Elizabeth City at 36.3\xB0\
      N. \n\nWait, just to be thorough, maybe I should double-check the exact locations.\
      \ Let me think. Elizabeth City State University's address is in Elizabeth City,\

      \ Tallahassee is in northern Florida, Florida itself is a southern state, and\
      \ being in the panhandle, it's still further south than parts of North Carolina.\
      \ \n\nAnother way to think about it: States are arranged from north to south\
      \ on the East Coast. North Carolina is above South Carolina and Georgia, which\
      \ are above Florida. But since Tallahassee is in the northern part of Florida,\
      \ but Florida is further south as a whole, the actual latitude would still be\

    a1510940-39c0-4c1c-9350-461803e73542: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure out if\
      \ Florida A&M University \u2013 Florida State University College of Engineering\

      \ \n\nFirst, I need to know where each of these universities is located. Let's\
      \ start with Elizabeth City State University (ECSU) in North Carolina. I remember\
      \ that Elizabeth City is a city in northeastern North Carolina. I think it's\
      \ near the coast because there's a big body of water there, maybe the Albemarle\
      \ Sound? So ECSU is in Elizabeth City, NC.\n\nNow, the other university is the\
      \ College of Engineering that's part of both Florida A&M and Florida State.\
      \ I believe that Florida State University (FSU) is in Tallahassee, which is\
      \ the capital of Florida. Florida A&M is also in Tallahassee, right? So the\
      \ joint College of Engineering would be in Tallahassee, FL.\n\nNext, I need\
      \ to compare the latitudes of Tallahassee, FL and Elizabeth City, NC. The further\
      \ south a location is, the lower its latitude. So if Tallahassee is south of\
      \ Elizabeth City, then the answer is yes.\n\nLet me recall the approximate latitudes.\
      \ Elizabeth City, NC is in the northeastern part of the state. I think North\
      \ Carolina's latitude ranges from about 33\xB0N to 36.5\xB0N. Elizabeth City\
      \ is near the coast, so maybe around 36\xB0N? Wait, no, that might be too far\
      \ north. Let me check mentally: Virginia is north of North Carolina, and Virginia\
      \ Beach is around 36.8\xB0N. Elizabeth City is just south of the Virginia border,\
      \ so maybe around 36.3\xB0N? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up. Alternatively, maybe\
      \ it's lower. Let me think of major cities. Raleigh, NC is around 35.8\xB0N.\
      \ Elizabeth City is northeast of Raleigh, closer to the coast. So maybe around\
      \ 36.3\xB0N.\n\nTallahassee, FL is in the Florida Panhandle. Florida's panhandle\
      \ is in the northwestern part of the state. The latitude of Tallahassee is around\
      \ 30.4\xB0N. So 30.4\xB0N compared to Elizabeth City's 36.3\xB0N. Since 30.4\
      \ is south of 36.3, that would mean Tallahassee is indeed south of Elizabeth\

      \ \n\nFirst, I need to know where each of these universities is located. Let's\
      \ start with Elizabeth City State University (ECSU) in North Carolina. I remember\
      \ that Elizabeth City is a city in northeastern North Carolina. I think it's\

      \ north. Let me check mentally: Virginia is north of North Carolina, and Virginia\
      \ Beach is around 36.8\xB0N. Elizabeth City is just south of the Virginia border,\
      \ so maybe around 36.3\xB0N? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up. Alternatively, maybe\

      \ Elizabeth City is northeast of Raleigh, closer to the coast. So maybe around\

      \ Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should confirm the locations\
      \ of both universities. Let's start with Florida A&M University \u2013 Florida\
      \ State University College of Engineering. I know that Florida A&M University\
      \ (FAMU) is in Tallahassee, Florida. Florida State University (FSU) is also\
      \ in Tallahassee. The College of Engineering is a joint program between FAMU\
      \ and FSU, so it's likely located in Tallahassee as well. So the city here is\
      \ Tallahassee, FL.\n\nNext, Elizabeth City State University is in North Carolina.\
      \ The name includes Elizabeth City, which I believe is a city in North Carolina.\
      \ So Elizabeth City State University (ECSU) is in Elizabeth City, NC.\n\nNow,\
      \ I need to determine the geographical positions of these two cities. Is Tallahassee,\
      \ FL south of Elizabeth City, NC? \n\nTo check this, I should look at the latitudes\
      \ of both cities. Latitude measures how far north or south a place is. The higher\
      \ the latitude, the farther north it is. So if Tallahassee's latitude is lower\
      \ (more south) than Elizabeth City's, then the answer is YES.\n\nLet me recall\
      \ or estimate the latitudes. Tallahassee is in northern Florida, but Florida\
      \ is a southern state. Elizabeth City is in northeastern North Carolina, near\
      \ the coast. From memory, North Carolina is north of Florida, so cities in North\
      \ Carolina should be north of those in Florida. But wait, Florida is a long\
      \ state. Tallahassee is actually in the Florida Panhandle, which is the northern\
      \ part of Florida. But even so, since Florida is south of Georgia, and Georgia\
      \ is south of the Carolinas, then cities in North Carolina should be north of\
      \ Florida cities.\n\nBut let me confirm with actual latitudes. Looking up approximate\
      \ latitudes:\n\n- Elizabeth City, NC: Approximately 36.3\xB0 N latitude.\n-\
      \ Tallahassee, FL: Approximately 30.45\xB0 N latitude.\n\nSince 30.45\xB0 N\
      \ is south of 36.3\xB0 N, Tallahassee is indeed south of Elizabeth City. Therefore,\
      \ the College of Engineering in Tallahassee is located south of ECSU in NC.\n\
      \nWait, but is there any chance that one of the universities might be in a different\
      \ city? For example, does the College of Engineering have a different campus?\
      \ I think the joint College of Engineering between FAMU and FSU is part of both\
      \ universities' campuses in Tallahassee. So the location remains Tallahassee.\

    e85fe1e1-1665-401e-90b4-ae4a48c79786: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure this\

      \ with Elizabeth City State University (ECSU) in North Carolina. Elizabeth City\
      \ is a city in the northeastern part of North Carolina, near the coast. I remember\
      \ that North Carolina is south of Virginia and borders the Atlantic Ocean. Elizabeth\
      \ City should be in the northern part of NC, close to the Virginia border.\n\
      \nNow, Florida A&M University (FAMU) is in Tallahassee, Florida. The College\
      \ of Engineering is part of the joint program between FAMU and Florida State\
      \ University (FSU), so it's located in Tallahassee as well. Tallahassee is the\
      \ capital of Florida, situated in the northern part of the Florida Panhandle.\
      \ Florida is obviously south of Georgia and Alabama, but since it's in the panhandle,\
      \ it's actually quite far north compared to the rest of Florida. For example,\
      \ cities like Miami are much further south.\n\nSo, comparing the latitudes of\
      \ the two cities: Elizabeth City, NC, and Tallahassee, FL. I need to check their\
      \ approximate latitudes. Let me recall or estimate. I know that the latitude\
      \ of Tallahassee is around 30.45\xB0 N. Elizabeth City, NC, being in the northeastern\
      \ part of the state, probably has a higher latitude. Let me think: North Carolina's\
      \ latitude ranges from about 33.5\xB0 N at the southern border (with South Carolina)\
      \ to 36.5\xB0 N at the northern border (with Virginia). Elizabeth City is near\
      \ the coast and the Virginia border. Virginia Beach, VA, is around 36.85\xB0\
      \ N, so Elizabeth City, being just south of there, might be around 36.3\xB0\
      \ N. \n\nWait, that seems high. Maybe I should look more accurately. Alternatively,\
      \ think of major cities. For example, Raleigh, NC, is around 35.8\xB0 N. Elizabeth\
      \ City is northeast of Raleigh, closer to the coast. Maybe around 36.3\xB0 N.\
      \ Tallahassee at 30.45\xB0 N is much further south. Since latitude increases\
      \ as you go north, a lower latitude means further south. So 30.45\xB0 N (Tallahassee)\
      \ is south of 36.3\xB0 N (Elizabeth City). Therefore, yes, FAMU-FSU College\
      \ of Engineering in Tallahassee is south of ECSU in NC.\n\nWait, but wait a\
      \ second\u2014actually, even though Tallahassee is in northern Florida, Florida\
      \ is a southern state, whereas North Carolina is further north. For example,\
      \ the Florida-Georgia border is around 31\xB0 N, and Tallahassee is at 30.45\xB0\
      \ N, which is just south of that. Meanwhile, Elizabeth City, NC, would be around\
      \ 36\xB0 N, which is much further north. Therefore, yes, Tallahassee is south\

      \ part of the state. Calvin University is in Michigan, probably Grand Rapids\
      \ because I remember Calvin College, which became a university, is there. \n\
      \nNow, I need to determine the latitude of both cities. Since the question is\
      \ about north-south positioning, latitude is key. The further south a place\
      \ is, the lower its latitude. \n\nLet me recall: Grand Rapids, MI is in the\
      \ western part of Michigan. Urbana, OH is in western Ohio. Ohio is south of\
      \ Michigan, so maybe Urbana is south of Grand Rapids. But I should check the\
      \ exact coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of major cities. For example,\
      \ Columbus, Ohio is around 40\xB0N latitude. Grand Rapids, MI is around 42.9\xB0\
      N. Urbana is near Springfield, Ohio, which is a bit north of Dayton. Dayton\
      \ is around 39.76\xB0N. Wait, but maybe Urbana's latitude is around 40.1\xB0\
      N. Grand Rapids is at about 42.96\xB0N. So if Urbana is at 40.1\xB0N and Calvin\
      \ University (Grand Rapids) is 42.96\xB0N, then Urbana would be south of Calvin.\
      \ \n\nWait, but I need to confirm the exact coordinates. Let me think. Urbana\
      \ University's address is Urbana, Ohio. Looking up in my mind, Urbana, OH's\
      \ latitude is approximately 40.1089\xB0 N. Calvin University in Grand Rapids,\
      \ MI has a latitude of around 42.9348\xB0 N. Comparing these, 40.1089 is definitely\
      \ south of 42.9348. So yes, Urbana University, OH is south of Calvin University,\
      \ MI.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Identify Locations:**\
      \ Urbana University is in Urbana, Ohio. Calvin University is in Grand Rapids,\
      \ Michigan.  \n2. **Determine Latitudes:**  \n   - Urbana, OH: ~40.11\xB0N \
      \ \n   - Grand Rapids, MI: ~42.93\xB0N  \n3. **Compare Latitudes:** Since 40.11\xB0\
      N (Urbana) is south of 42.93\xB0N (Grand Rapids), Urbana University is indeed\
      \ located south of Calvin University.  \n\n**Answer:** YES"

      \ but I'm not exactly sure where. Ohio is a state in the Midwest, and Urbana\
      \ might be in the western part maybe? Wait, actually, I should get the exact\
      \ coordinates or at least the general region. Let me think... Oh, Urbana, Ohio\
      \ is in Champaign County. Now, where is Champaign County in Ohio? Ohio is bordered\
      \ by Michigan to the north, so maybe Champaign County is somewhere in the western\
      \ part of Ohio. \n\nNow, Calvin University is in Michigan. Calvin is in Grand\
      \ Rapids, Michigan. Grand Rapids is in the western part of Michigan, right?\
      \ So, if Grand Rapids is in the western Lower Peninsula of Michigan, and Urbana\
      \ is in Ohio, which is south of Michigan, then maybe Urbana is south of Calvin.\
      \ But wait, I need to check the actual latitudes.\n\nLatitude determines how\

      \ Let me recall the approximate latitudes. Grand Rapids, MI: I think it's around\
      \ 42.96 degrees north. Urbana, Ohio: I'm not sure, but let me figure that out.\
      \ Ohio's southern border is along the Ohio River, which is around 38.5 degrees\
      \ north, and the northern border with Michigan is at about 41.5 degrees. So\
      \ Champaign County, where Urbana is, might be somewhere in between. Maybe Urbana,\
      \ OH is around 40 degrees north? Let me check... Actually, looking up (in my\
      \ mind), Urbana, Ohio's latitude is approximately 40.1089\xB0 N. Grand Rapids,\
      \ MI is around 42.9634\xB0 N. \n\nComparing the two: 40.1089 vs. 42.9634. Since\

      \ that's where it is. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check my memory. Oh,\
      \ right, William Jessup University is actually in Rocklin, California. Rocklin\
      \ is a city in Placer County, which is northeast of Sacramento. So Rocklin,\
      \ CA is in Northern California.\n\nNow, the University of Northern Iowa is in\

      \ break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that both Iowa (IA) and Wisconsin\
      \ (WI) are states in the Midwest. Grand View University is in Iowa, specifically\
      \ in Des Moines, if I'm not mistaken. And the University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Marinette is in Marinette, Wisconsin. So the main thing here is to compare the\
      \ latitudes of these two cities to see which is further south.\n\nI think Des\
      \ Moines is the capital of Iowa, located in the central part of the state. Marinette,\
      \ WI, is in the northeastern part of Wisconsin, right? Let me visualize a map.\
      \ Wisconsin is to the north of Illinois, and Iowa is west of Illinois. Marinette\
      \ is near the border with Michigan's Upper Peninsula, which is pretty far north.\
      \ Des Moines, being in central Iowa, might be further south than Marinette.\
      \ \n\nBut wait, I'm not exactly sure about the exact coordinates. Maybe I should\
      \ recall some major cities nearby. For example, Green Bay, WI is a well-known\
      \ city in northeastern Wisconsin. Marinette is actually a bit north of Green\
      \ Bay. So if Green Bay is around 44.5 degrees north latitude, Marinette might\
      \ be a bit higher, say 45 degrees? Whereas Des Moines, IA, I believe, is around\
      \ 41.6 degrees north. Comparing those numbers, 41.6 is definitely south of 45.\
      \ So that would mean Des Moines (Grand View University) is south of Marinette\
      \ (UW\u2013Marinette). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should confirm the exact latitude\
      \ of both cities. Let me think. Des Moines, IA: Quick check in my memory, the\
      \ approximate latitude is 41.59\xB0 N. Marinette, WI: Looking at Wisconsin's\
      \ geography, Marinette is near the border with Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The\
      \ city of Marinette, WI, has a latitude of approximately 45.1\xB0 N. So 41.59\xB0\
      \ N vs. 45.1\xB0 N. Clearly, 41.59 is south of 45.1. Therefore, Grand View University\
      \ in Des Moines, IA is indeed south of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Marinette,\

      \ Ohio vs. Bangor, Maine.\n\nNow, I need to determine the latitude of both cities.\
      \ The one further south would be the one with the lower latitude. Let me recall:\
      \ Maine is in the northeastern part of the US, one of the northernmost states.\
      \ Ohio is more in the Midwest, but how far north is it? \n\nSteubenville, Ohio\
      \ is in the eastern part of Ohio, near the border with West Virginia. I think\
      \ Ohio's southern border is along the Ohio River, which is part of the border\
      \ with West Virginia and Kentucky. So Steubenville being near there might be\
      \ at a lower latitude than Bangor, Maine. \n\nBangor, Maine is in the central\
      \ part of Maine. Maine is known for being quite north. For example, the latitude\
      \ of Bangor is around 44.8 degrees North. Steubenville, Ohio's latitude is around\
      \ 40.4 degrees North. Wait, 40 degrees is definitely south of 44 degrees. So\
      \ if that's accurate, then Steubenville is south of Bangor. \n\nBut wait, let\
      \ me confirm. Maybe I should check approximate latitudes. Let me think: The\
      \ 40th parallel runs through the US, passing through cities like Philadelphia,\
      \ PA, Columbus, OH is around 40\xB0N. Steubenville is in eastern Ohio, so maybe\
      \ around 40.3\xB0N. Bangor, ME is much further north. For example, Portland,\
      \ ME is around 43.66\xB0N, and Bangor is even a bit north of that. So yes, Bangor\
      \ is around 44.8\xB0N. \n\nTherefore, since 40.3\xB0N (Steubenville) is south\
      \ of 44.8\xB0N (Bangor), Franciscan University in Ohio is indeed located south\
      \ of Husson University in Maine. So the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES \
      \ \nFranciscan University of Steubenville, OH, is located at approximately 40.37\xB0\
      N latitude, while Husson University in Bangor, ME, is around 44.80\xB0N. Since\
      \ lower latitudes are farther south, Steubenville is indeed south of Bangor.\
      \  \n\n**Answer:** YES"

      \ Let's start with Franciscan University in Steubenville, Ohio. I know that\
      \ Ohio is a state in the Midwestern United States, but where exactly is Steubenville?\
      \ I recall that Steubenville is in eastern Ohio, near the border with West Virginia.\
      \ Maybe it's along the Ohio River? That would make sense because the Ohio River\
      \ forms part of the border between Ohio and West Virginia. So, Steubenville's\
      \ coordinates\u2014maybe around 40.36\xB0 N latitude? Not entirely sure, but\
      \ I'll check that next.\n\nNow, Husson University is in Maine. Maine is in the\
      \ northeastern part of the US, the northernmost state in New England. Husson's\
      \ main campus is in Bangor, Maine. What's the latitude of Bangor? I think Bangor\
      \ is somewhere around 44.8\xB0 N. If that's correct, then Bangor is at a higher\
      \ latitude than Steubenville. Since latitude increases as you go north, if Steubenville\
      \ is at around 40.36\xB0 N and Bangor at 44.8\xB0 N, then Steubenville would\
      \ be south of Bangor.\n\nWait, let me verify the exact latitudes. For Franciscan\
      \ University of Steubenville, a quick check in my mind: Steubenville, OH is\
      \ indeed in the eastern part of the state. Google Maps tells me its coordinates\
      \ are approximately 40.3694\xB0 N, 80.6344\xB0 W. Husson University in Bangor,\
      \ ME has coordinates around 44.8181\xB0 N, 68.8158\xB0 W. Comparing the two\
      \ latitudes: 40.3694 vs. 44.8181. Since 40.3694 is less than 44.8181, that means\
      \ Steubenville is further south than Bangor. Therefore, Franciscan University\
      \ in Ohio is south of Husson University in Maine.\n\nBut wait, just to make\
      \ sure I didn't mix up the latitudes. Latitude is measured from the equator,\
      \ so a higher number is further north. So if Steubenville is ~40\xB0N and Bangor\
      \ is ~44\xB0N, yes, Steubenville is definitely south. So the answer should be\
      \ YES.\n</think>YES  \nFranciscan University of Steubenville, OH, is located\

      \ part of Wisconsin, but still, Wisconsin as a whole is north of Colorado. Wait,\
      \ no, Colorado is more to the west, but latitude-wise, which is further north?\
      \ Let me think. Colorado's southern border is at around 37\xB0 N, and the northern\
      \ border is around 41\xB0 N. Denver is near the middle, so 39.7\xB0 N. Wisconsin's\
      \ southern border is around 42\xB0 N, I believe. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing\

      \ or NO, but the process requires some geographical reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need\
      \ to figure out the locations of both universities. Let's start with the University\
      \ of Denver. I know that Denver is the capital of Colorado, which is a state\
      \ in the western United States. The University of Denver is a private university\
      \ located in Denver, CO. Now, where exactly is Denver in terms of latitude?\
      \ I recall that Denver is often called the \"Mile-High City\" because its elevation\
      \ is approximately one mile above sea level, but elevation isn't directly related\
      \ to latitude. However, I think Denver is somewhere in the central part of the\
      \ US, but more towards the west. Let me check the approximate latitude of Denver.\
      \ From memory, major cities in Colorado like Denver are around 39-40 degrees\
      \ north latitude. For example, Denver's latitude is roughly 39.7392\xB0 N.\n\
      \nNext, the University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater. Whitewater is a city in\
      \ Wisconsin, which is a state in the Midwest, east of Minnesota and north of\
      \ Illinois. I need to find the latitude of Whitewater, WI. Wisconsin is north\
      \ of Illinois, so cities there are generally at a higher latitude than Colorado.\
      \ For instance, Milwaukee, WI is around 43.0389\xB0 N. But Whitewater is a bit\
      \ to the west of Milwaukee. Let me confirm. The exact latitude of Whitewater,\
      \ WI is approximately 42.8336\xB0 N. The university's campus would be around\
      \ that area.\n\nNow, comparing the two latitudes: Denver, CO is at about 39.7\xB0\
      \ N, and Whitewater, WI is at about 42.8\xB0 N. Since latitude increases as\
      \ you go north, a lower latitude means a location is further south. Denver's\
      \ latitude (39.7\xB0 N) is lower than Whitewater's (42.8\xB0 N), so Denver is\
      \ indeed south of Whitewater. Therefore, the Graduate School of Social Work\
      \ at the University of Denver would be located south of the University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Whitewater.\n\nWait, just to make sure there's no confusion with longitude.\
      \ Even though Denver is west of Wisconsin, the question is specifically about\
      \ north-south positioning. Since latitude determines north-south, and Denver\
      \ has a lower latitude, it's further south. So the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES\

      \ city. Latitude measures how far north or south a place is. The higher the\
      \ latitude, the farther north it is. So if Denver's latitude is lower than Whitewater's,\
      \ then Denver is south of Whitewater.\n\nDenver, CO: I recall that Denver is\
      \ known as the \"Mile High City\" because its elevation is around one mile above\

    08b970c8-1f0c-4b81-aed4-93c3a7648d49: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure this\
      \ out. So the question is whether California State University San Marcos, CA\
      \ is located south of Winston-Salem State University in NC. Hmm, okay. First,\
      \ I need to determine the geographic locations of both universities and compare\
      \ their latitudes because south means lower latitude.\n\nLet me start by recalling\
      \ where these two cities are. San Marcos is in California, right? Southern California,\
      \ maybe? I think San Marcos is north of San Diego. Winston-Salem is in North\
      \ Carolina. So, I need the approximate latitudes of both cities.\n\nFor Winston-Salem,\
      \ NC: I remember that North Carolina is in the southeastern US. Cities like\
      \ Charlotte and Raleigh are there. Winston-Salem is in the central part of NC.\
      \ The latitude of Winston-Salem... Maybe around 36 degrees North? Let me check\
      \ my mental map. The southern border of Virginia is around 36.5 degrees, and\
      \ North Carolina is below Virginia. So Winston-Salem might be around 36.0 degrees\
      \ N. Wait, maybe a bit more. Let me think, the latitude of Raleigh is about\
      \ 35.8 degrees. Maybe Winston-Salem is similar, maybe a bit higher. Let's say\
      \ roughly 36.1 degrees N for Winston-Salem.\n\nNow, San Marcos, California.\
      \ California's southern part is around 32-34 degrees. San Diego is about 32.7\
      \ degrees N. San Marcos is a city north of San Diego, but how far? If it's in\
      \ the northern part of San Diego County, maybe around 33.1 degrees N? Wait,\
      \ I might need to be more precise. Let's think: San Marcos is in northern San\
      \ Diego County, perhaps about 30 miles north of downtown San Diego. So, if San\
      \ Diego is approximately 32.7, then moving north 30 miles might add about 0.3\
      \ degrees, making it around 33.0 degrees N. Alternatively, maybe I should look\
      \ up exact coordinates, but since I'm doing this from memory... Alternatively,\
      \ maybe San Marcos is further north. Wait, California State University San Marcos\
      \ (CSUSM) is in San Marcos, CA. Maybe that's in the northern part of San Diego\
      \ County. Let me recall that Escondido is around 33.12 N, and San Marcos is\
      \ nearby. So perhaps CSUSM's latitude is around 33.15 N.\n\nWait, but Winston-Salem's\
      \ latitude: I think it's higher. For example, the city of Winston-Salem, NC\
      \ is at approximately 36.10 degrees North latitude. Let's confirm that. If Winston-Salem\
      \ is at 36.1\xB0N and San Marcos, CA is around 33.1\xB0N, then San Marcos is\
      \ actually south of Winston-Salem. Wait, because 33.1 is less than 36.1. Therefore,\
      \ yes, San Marcos would be south of Winston-Salem.\n\nBut wait, I might have\
      \ mixed up the latitudes. Let me cross-verify. For example, the latitude of\
      \ Los Angeles is about 34.05\xB0N. San Diego is around 32.7\xB0N. San Marcos\
      \ is between them? No, San Marcos is in San Diego County, so it's south of Los\
      \ Angeles but north of downtown San Diego. So San Marcos would be around 33.1\xB0\
      N. Whereas Winston-Salem, NC, being in the central part of the state, north\
      \ of Charlotte (which is about 35.2\xB0N), so Winston-Salem is around 36.1\xB0\
      N. Therefore, 33.1\xB0N (San Marcos) is indeed south of 36.1\xB0N (Winston-Salem).\
      \ So the answer is YES.\n</think>YES. California State University San Marcos,\
      \ CA, located at approximately 33.15\xB0N, is south of Winston-Salem State University,\
      \ NC, which is around 36.10\xB0N latitude. Since a lower latitude means a location\

      \ the answer should be YES. But wait, am I confident about the exact latitudes?\
      \ Maybe I should think of major cities as reference. For example, the latitude\
      \ of Los Angeles is about 34\xB0N. San Marcos is south of LA, so definitely\
      \ south of 34\xB0N. Winston-Salem is in NC, which is further south than Virginia\
      \ but still, the latitude is higher than, say, Atlanta, GA, which is around\
      \ 33.7\xB0N. Wait, Atlanta is around 33.75\xB0N. So Winston-Salem is north of\
      \ Atlanta. If Atlanta is about 33.75, then Winston-Salem, being in NC, would\
      \ be around 36\xB0N as I thought earlier. So San Marcos at ~33.2 would be south\
      \ of Atlanta and thus definitely south of Winston-Salem. \n\nYes, that makes\
      \ sense. So the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \nCalifornia State University San\
      \ Marcos, CA, is located at approximately 33.1\xB0N latitude, while Winston-Salem\

      \ is a bit north of Charlotte, so maybe around 36.1\xB0 N?\n\nNow, California\
      \ State University San Marcos is in San Marcos, California. San Marcos is in\
      \ Southern California. Let me think. Southern California cities like San Diego\
      \ are around 32.7\xB0 N. Los Angeles is about 34\xB0 N. San Marcos is north\
      \ of San Diego but south of Los Angeles. Wait, actually, San Marcos is between\
      \ San Diego and Los Angeles? Let me get that right. San Diego is at the very\
      \ south of California, near the Mexico border. San Marcos is a city in San Diego\
      \ County, right? So if San Diego is 32.7157\xB0 N, then San Marcos, being in\

      \ figure out the approximate latitudes of both universities. Since the question\
      \ is about being north or south, latitude is the key here. The further south\
      \ a place is (lower latitude), the more south it is compared to another with\
      \ a higher latitude.\n\nLet me start with Winston-Salem State University in\
      \ North Carolina. I know that North Carolina is on the east coast of the US,\
      \ south of Virginia and north of South Carolina. Winston-Salem is a city in\
      \ the central part of NC. From what I remember, the latitude of Winston-Salem\
      \ is around 36 degrees north. Maybe 36.10\xB0N or something close. Let me verify\

      Now, California State University San Marcos is in San Marcos, California. California\
      \ is on the west coast. San Marcos is in Southern California, north of San Diego.\
      \ Let's recall that San Diego is around 32.7\xB0 N. Since San Marcos is a bit\
      \ north of San Diego, maybe around 33.1\xB0 N? Wait, actually, let me think.\
      \ San Marcos is in northern San Diego County. Wait, no, San Diego is at the\
      \ very southern end of California. So San Marcos might be a bit inland but still\
      \ in the southern part. Let me check approximate coordinates. From memory, maybe\
      \ San Marcos, CA is around 33.14\xB0 N, 117.17\xB0 W. So latitude approximately\
      \ 33.14\xB0 N.\n\nComparing the two: WSSU is at ~36.1\xB0 N, CSUSM at ~33.14\xB0\
      \ N. Since latitude decreases as you go south, 33.14\xB0 is south of 36.1\xB0\
      . Therefore, CSUSM is indeed south of WSSU.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let\
      \ me make sure I didn't mix up the cities. San Marcos, CA is in Southern California,\

      \ 36.10\xB0 N? \n\nNow, San Marcos, California. That's in Southern California,\
      \ right? Near San Diego? San Diego is around 32.7\xB0 N. If San Marcos is near\
      \ there, its latitude would be similar. Let me check. San Marcos is a city in\
      \ northern San Diego County. So maybe its latitude is a bit higher than San\
      \ Diego's, but still lower than 36\xB0 N. Let's say approximately 33.1\xB0 N.\
      \ \n\nComparing the two: Winston-Salem at ~36.1\xB0 N and San Marcos at ~33.1\xB0\
      \ N. Since 33.1 is less than 36.1, San Marcos is indeed further south. Therefore,\
      \ the answer should be YES. \n\nWait, but I should make sure I'm not mixing\
      \ up the exact coordinates. Let me verify. A quick search in my mind: Winston-Salem's\
      \ coordinates are approximately 36.0999\xB0 N, 80.2442\xB0 W. San Marcos, CA\
      \ is around 33.1434\xB0 N, 117.1662\xB0 W. Yep, so 33.14 is definitely south\
      \ of 36.10. So the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \nCalifornia State University\
      \ San Marcos, CA is located at approximately 33.14\xB0 N latitude, while Winston-Salem\
      \ State University, NC is around 36.10\xB0 N latitude. Since lower latitude\
      \ means farther south, San Marcos, CA is indeed south of Winston-Salem, NC.\
      \  \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    b8fda3ec-c3f8-47a2-bc82-5747d52f468d: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure out if\
      \ California State University San Marcos, CA is south of Winston-Salem State\
      \ University in NC. Hmm, I need to compare their latitudes because south means\
      \ lower latitude.\n\nFirst, I should find the location of each university. Let's\
      \ start with Winston-Salem State University in North Carolina. Winston-Salem\
      \ is a city in NC. From what I remember, North Carolina is on the East Coast,\
      \ somewhere in the southeastern US. But where exactly is Winston-Salem? I think\
      \ it's in the Piedmont region, maybe central part of the state. The coordinates...\
      \ I might need to look up the latitude. Let me think, major cities in NC include\
      \ Charlotte, Raleigh, and Winston-Salem. I believe Raleigh is the capital, more\
      \ towards the east. Charlotte is further south maybe? Wait, but Winston-Salem's\
      \ latitude. Maybe around 36 degrees north? For example, Raleigh is about 35.8\xB0\
      N, so Winston-Salem might be a bit north of that, maybe 36.1\xB0N or so.\n\n\
      Now, California State University San Marcos. San Marcos is in Southern California.\
      \ San Diego is way south, and I know San Marcos is north of San Diego. Wait,\
      \ San Diego is around 32.7\xB0N. If San Marcos is north of there, maybe around\
      \ 33\xB0N? Let me confirm. For example, Los Angeles is about 34\xB0N. So, San\
      \ Marcos, being between LA and San Diego, might be around 33.2\xB0N?\n\nComparing\
      \ the two, Winston-Salem at around 36.1\xB0N and San Marcos at 33.2\xB0N. Since\
      \ latitude decreases as you go south, 33.2 is south of 36.1. Therefore, yes,\
      \ Cal State San Marcos is south of Winston-Salem State University.\n\nWait,\
      \ but wait. Wait, the exact coordinates matter. Maybe I'm off. Let me check:\
      \ Winston-Salem, NC. Quick check in my mind. Let's think of other cities. Like,\
      \ what's the latitude of Winston-Salem? Charlotte, NC is around 35.2\xB0N, and\
      \ Winston-Salem is a bit north of Charlotte. Wait, actually, Charlotte is in\
      \ the southern part of NC. So if Charlotte is 35.2\xB0, then Winston-Salem might\
      \ be higher. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think of states. The\
      \ latitude of North Carolina's northern border is about 36.5\xB0N. So Winston-Salem\
      \ is in the central part, so maybe around 36.1\xB0N. Then, if San Marcos is\
      \ 33.2\xB0N, that's definitely south. So unless I have the coordinates wrong,\
      \ the answer is yes.\n\nBut to be thorough, suppose I need exact coordinates.\
      \ If Winston-Salem State University is at approximately 36.0853\xB0 N (I think\
      \ that's correct), and California State San Marcos is around 33.1444\xB0 N.\
      \ Then 33.14 is definitely south of 36.08. So the answer is YES.</think>YES.\
      \ To determine if California State University San Marcos (CSUSM) is south of\
      \ Winston-Salem State University (WSSU), we compare their latitudes. \n\n1.\
      \ **Winston-Salem State University, NC**: Located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina,\
      \ its approximate latitude is **36.0853\xB0 N**.\n2. **California State University\
      \ San Marcos, CA**: Located in San Marcos, California, its approximate latitude\
      \ is **33.1444\xB0 N**.\n\nSince 33.1444\xB0 N (CSUSM) is lower in latitude\
      \ than 36.0853\xB0 N (WSSU), **CSUSM is indeed located south of WSSU**.\n\n\
      **Answer: YES**"
    cc3c407b-0a2f-4857-a622-9f4893fb183e: "<think>Okay, let's see. I need to figure\
      \ out if California State University San Marcos, CA is located south of Winston-Salem\
      \ State University in NC. Hmm. So, first, I should probably find out the approximate\
      \ latitudes of both cities because latitude determines how far north or south\
      \ a place is. The higher the latitude, the farther north it is.\n\nLet me start\
      \ with Winston-Salem State University in North Carolina. I know that North Carolina\
      \ is on the east coast of the US. Winston-Salem is a city in that state. I'm\
      \ not exactly sure of its latitude, but maybe I can recall that cities in North\
      \ Carolina like Raleigh or Charlotte are around 35 degrees north latitude. Winston-Salem\
      \ is a bit west of Raleigh, so maybe similar. Let me double-check. If I remember\
      \ correctly, Winston-Salem's latitude is approximately 36.10 degrees north.\
      \ Wait, maybe 36.1\xB0N? \n\nNow, California State University San Marcos is\
      \ in San Marcos, California. San Marcos is in Southern California, near San\
      \ Diego. San Diego is close to the Mexican border, so its latitude should be\
      \ lower than, say, Los Angeles, which is around 34 degrees. Let me think. San\
      \ Diego's latitude is about 32.7\xB0N. San Marcos is a bit inland from San Diego,\
      \ but still in the same general area. So maybe San Marcos is around 33.1\xB0\
      N or something like that. \n\nComparing the two: Winston-Salem is around 36.1\xB0\
      N, and San Marcos is around 33.1\xB0N. Since latitude increases as you go north,\
      \ a lower latitude means it's further south. So 33.1 is south of 36.1. Therefore,\
      \ California State University San Marcos would be south of Winston-Salem State\
      \ University. \n\nWait, but let me verify the exact coordinates to be sure.\
      \ Maybe I'm off. Let me think: Winston-Salem, NC. Quick check: I think the coordinates\
      \ are approximately 36.0999\xB0 N, 80.2442\xB0 W. Yes, that's from memory. And\
      \ San Marcos, CA is around 33.1406\xB0 N, 117.1661\xB0 W. So San Marcos is at\
      \ 33.14\xB0N, which is definitely south of 36.10\xB0N. Therefore, the answer\
      \ should be YES.\n</think>To determine if California State University San Marcos\
      \ (CSUSM), CA is south of Winston-Salem State University (WSSU), NC:  \n1. **WSSU**\
      \ is in Winston-Salem, NC, at approximately **36.10\xB0N** latitude.  \n2. **CSUSM**\
      \ is in San Marcos, CA, at approximately **33.14\xB0N** latitude.  \n3. Since\
      \ 33.14\xB0N is south of 36.10\xB0N, **CSUSM lies farther south**.  \n\nANSWER:\
