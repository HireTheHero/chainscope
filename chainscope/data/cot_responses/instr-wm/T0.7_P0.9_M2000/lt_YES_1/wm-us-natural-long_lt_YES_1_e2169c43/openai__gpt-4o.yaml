      1. The Oregon Coast Range is a mountain range that runs north-south along the

      2. The range is divided into three sections: the Northern Oregon Coast Range,
      the Central Oregon Coast Range, and the Southern Oregon Coast Range.

      3. The Northern Oregon Coast Range is the northernmost section of the Oregon
      Coast Range.

      4. The entire Oregon Coast Range, including its northern section, runs parallel

      geographical locations of both places.


      1. **Locate the Wellsville Mountains:** The Wellsville Mountains are located
      in northern Utah, primarily in Cache County and extending into Box Elder County.
      They are situated to the west of the city of Logan, Utah.


      2. **Locate Otter Creek Reservoir:** Otter Creek Reservoir is located in southern
      Utah, specifically in Piute County. It is situated northeast of the town of
      Antimony and southeast of the town of Richfield.


      3. **Compare their locations:** The Wellsville Mountains are in northern Utah,
      while Otter Creek Reservoir is in southern Utah. Given the relative north-south
      orientation of these two locations, Otter Creek Reservoir is actually far south
      of the Wellsville Mountains.


      Based on the relative positioning, Otter Creek Reservoir is located south and
      slightly east of the Wellsville Mountains.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: **NO.** Otter Creek Reservoir is not

      1. **Locate Lac des Allemands, LA:** Lac des Allemands is a lake in southern
      Louisiana, situated roughly west of New Orleans.


      2. **Locate Misquah Hills, MN:** The Misquah Hills are located in northeastern

      3. **Compare the longitudinal positions:** Louisiana is generally south of Minnesota.
      However, for the east-west comparison, we need to look at their longitudinal
      positions. Louisiana, being further west compared to the typical east-west alignment
      of Minnesota, means Lac des Allemands is further west in terms of longitude

      1. **Sangre de Cristo Mountains**: This term typically refers to a larger mountain
      system that spans southern Colorado and northern New Mexico.


      2. **Sangre de Cristo Range**: This is a subrange of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains
      located specifically in Colorado.


      With this understanding, the Sangre de Cristo Range is part of the broader Sangre
      de Cristo Mountains within Colorado. Therefore, the Sangre de Cristo Mountains
      encompass the Sangre de Cristo Range.


      Thus, the Sangre de Cristo Mountains (as a whole) are not located west of the
      Sangre de Cristo Range since the range is part of the mountains.

      term that refers to a range of mountains extending from southern Colorado into
      northern New Mexico. The "Sangre de Cristo Range" specifically refers to the
      portion of these mountains located in Colorado.

    fd9a5c6d-f61c-4059-8efb-65644fa5985d: 'To determine whether the Raft River Mountains
      are located west of the House Range in Utah, we need to consider the geographic
      locations of both mountain ranges:


      1. **Identify the location of the Raft River Mountains:** The Raft River Mountains
      are located in the northwestern part of Utah, primarily in Box Elder County.


      2. **Identify the location of the House Range:** The House Range is located

      the House Range is generally further east compared to the Raft River Mountains.


      Thus, the Raft River Mountains are indeed located west of the House Range.

      is located west of Lake Delton, WI, we need to consider the following:


      1. **Understand what Glacial Lake Wisconsin was:** Glacial Lake Wisconsin was
      a prehistoric lake that existed during the last Ice Age. It was formed as a
      result of glacial meltwater being blocked by an ice dam, creating a large lake
      in the central part of what is now Wisconsin.


      2. **Location of Glacial Lake Wisconsin:** The lake covered a large area in
      central Wisconsin, primarily in what are now the counties of Adams, Juneau,
      and Sauk. It was a vast body of water, so its boundaries extended over a large
      region.


      3. **Location of Lake Delton, WI:** Lake Delton is a village located in Sauk
      County, Wisconsin. It is near the Wisconsin Dells, which is a well-known region
      in the central part of the state.


      4. **Geographic relationship:** Given that Glacial Lake Wisconsin covered a
      broad area in the central part of the state, including parts of Sauk County
      where Lake Delton is located, it would be accurate to say that portions of Glacial

      dam burst, and it no longer exists as a standing body of water. Its former location
      covered parts of what is now central Wisconsin.

      just north of Mount Eisenhower, and Mount Monroe is located just north of Mount
      Franklin.


      4. **Evaluate the East/West Positioning**: Given that the range runs in a southwest
      to northeast direction, the mountains are aligned more linearly rather than
      strictly east or west of each other. However, in the general layout, Mount Franklin
      is positioned slightly northeast of Mount Monroe.

      2. **Identify the Location of the Peloncillo Mountains**: The Peloncillo Mountains
      are a range that extends along the border between Arizona and New Mexico, primarily
      located in Hidalgo County, New Mexico.


      3. **Determine Relative Positioning**: Since Luna Lake is in eastern Arizona
      and the Peloncillo Mountains are on the Arizona-New Mexico border, especially
      stretching into New Mexico, we need to consider their relative longitudinal
      positions.


      4. **Conclusion**: Luna Lake is situated to the northwest of the Peloncillo
      Mountains. Given that the Peloncillo Mountains are primarily east of the Arizona-New
      Mexico state line, which is east of Luna Lake, Luna Lake is indeed west of the
      Peloncillo Mountains.
