      4) Drawing an imaginary line between them:

      - Bouquet Reservoir is more to the east

      - Baldwin Hills is more to the west


      Therefore: NO, Bouquet Reservoir is not located west of Baldwin Hills - it''s
      actually east of Baldwin Hills.'

      3) Since Kansas is west of Texas, and both locations are in the central parts
      of their respective states, Cheyenne Bottoms must be west of Inks Lake.

      1) Ozette Lake is located on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state, very
      close to the Pacific coast


      2) Siltcoos Lake is located in Oregon, also near the Pacific coast


      3) Since both lakes are coastal:

      - Ozette Lake being in Washington (more northern state)

      - Siltcoos Lake being in Oregon (more southern state)

      - And both being near the Pacific coast

      - The north-south relationship determines the east-west relationship


      4) Washington is north of Oregon, and since both lakes are near the coast, Ozette
      Lake must be directly north of Siltcoos Lake, not east or west of it


      Therefore: NO, Ozette Lake is not west of Siltcoos Lake. It is north of it.'

      1) First, let me identify the locations:

      - Bitterroot Range is in Montana, along the Montana-Idaho border

      - Vulture Mountains are in Arizona, west of Phoenix


      2) To determine relative east-west positioning, I can compare their locations:

      - Bitterroot Range is in the northern Rockies, near the Idaho border

      - Montana and Idaho are significantly west of Arizona in general


      3) Looking at the map of the US:

      - Montana is in the northwest part of the continental US

      - Arizona is in the southwest part of the continental US

      - Both states are in the western US, but Montana is further west


      4) Therefore, since Bitterroot Range is on the western edge of Montana, and
      Vulture Mountains are in central Arizona, Bitterroot Range is indeed west of
      Vulture Mountains.

    69f5843a-ae6e-45ea-bb9d-e5c92b752116: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) Mirror Lake (California) is located in California, which is on the west coast
      of the United States.


      2) Soap Lake is located in central Washington state, which is also on the west
      coast but further north.


      3) Both California and Washington are coastal states along the Pacific Ocean.


      4) When comparing east-west positions of locations in these states, we need
      to look at their positions relative to each other within their states.


      5) Mirror Lake (CA) is in the Sierra Nevada mountains, which is in the eastern
      part of California.


      6) Soap Lake (WA) is located in central Washington state, roughly in the middle
      between the Pacific coast and Idaho border.


      7) Looking at a map, even though Mirror Lake is in California (a more western
      state overall), its location in eastern California puts it at roughly the same
      longitude as central Washington.


      8) Soap Lake''s position in central Washington actually puts it slightly west
      of Mirror Lake''s position in eastern California.


      NO'

      1) First, let me identify the locations:

      - Mirror Lake (California) is in California

      - Soap Lake is in Washington state


      2) Looking at the general geography:

      - Washington state is north of California

      - Both states are on the west coast of the US


      3) Looking at the east-west positioning:

      - Soap Lake, WA is in central Washington state

      - Mirror Lake, CA is in the Sierra Nevada mountains in eastern California


      4) Comparing their positions:

      - Soap Lake, WA is more towards the center of the state

      - Mirror Lake, CA is on the eastern side of California

      - Since Washington is directly north of California, and both locations are relatively
      eastern in their respective states, Mirror Lake would be slightly east of Soap
      Lake

      central Wisconsin

      - Lake Delton is a man-made lake in Sauk County, Wisconsin


      2. Looking at the geography:

      3. Comparing their relative positions:

      - Since Glacial Lake Wisconsin was primarily east of the Wisconsin River, and
      Lake Delton is west of it, Glacial Lake Wisconsin must have been east of Lake
      Delton, not west.
