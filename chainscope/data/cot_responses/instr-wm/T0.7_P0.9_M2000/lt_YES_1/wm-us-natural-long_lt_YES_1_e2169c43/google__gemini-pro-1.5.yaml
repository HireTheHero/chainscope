      is not directly west, but it *is* west of Baldwin Hills.


      4. **Consider the phrasing:** The question asks if the reservoir is *west* of
      the Baldwin Hills. While northwest is not strictly west, it is still in a westerly
      direction.


      Therefore, although not due west, Bouquet Reservoir is located in a generally
      westerly direction from Baldwin Hills.

      Lake is in Lake County, Oregon.  Oregon is a Pacific state.


      2. **Locate Eastman Lake (California):** Eastman Lake is in Madera County, California.
      California is also a Pacific state.


      3. **Relative location of Oregon and California:** Oregon is north of California
      on the west coast of the US.


      4. **West/East implications:** Since both states are on the Pacific Coast, and
      Oregon is *north* of California, the question of "west" becomes a question of
      whether Alkali Lake is significantly far west *within* Oregon compared to Eastman
      Lake''s location *within* California.  However, given the general north/south
      orientation of the states, Oregon being north of California generally means
      locations in Oregon will be west of locations in California.


      5. **Conclusion:** Alkali Lake, being in Oregon, is generally west of Eastman
      Lake, which is in California.

      eastern California, near the Nevada border.

      2. **Locate Crazy Lake:**  I need to find information about a "Crazy Lake" in
      California.  A quick search reveals no prominent lake with this name. There
      may be a small, unnamed lake locally referred to as "Crazy Lake," but without
      more specific information, I can''t pinpoint it.

      3. **Compare Locations:** Since I cannot reliably locate "Crazy Lake, CA" I
      can''t determine its position relative to Mono Lake.


      Therefore, I cannot answer YES or NO.

      is in North Carolina.  North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States.


      2. **Locate Lake Washington, FL:** Lake Washington is in Florida. Florida is
      also on the east coast of the United States, but generally south of North Carolina.


      3. **West vs. East:**  Since both are on the east coast, and North Carolina
      is north of Florida, Lake Norman would be *north-west* of Lake Washington if
      it were west at all. However, the question is whether it''s *directly* west.  The
      longitudinal lines run north-south.  Something directly west would have to be
      on the same latitude.


      4. **Conclusion:** Due to the curvature of the Earth and the layout of the states,
      Lake Norman is very unlikely to be directly west of Lake Washington.  It is
      more likely to be north and slightly west.

      asking if Rattlesnake Lake (WA) is *geographically west* of Trillium Lake (OR).  Washington

      4. **Lake Worth''s position within Texas:**  While Texas is west of Oklahoma,
      Lake Worth isn''t necessarily on the western edge of the state.  We need to
      determine if it''s far enough west to be west of Lake Stanley Draper, which
      is in central Oklahoma. A more precise location is needed.


      Looking at a map, Lake Worth is in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, which is
      in North Central Texas, relatively close to the Oklahoma border. Lake Stanley
      Draper is near Oklahoma City, which is also centrally located in Oklahoma.  Lake
      Worth is actually slightly *east* of Lake Stanley Draper.

      2. **Locate Lake Stanley Draper, OK:** Lake Stanley Draper is near Oklahoma
      City, Oklahoma.


      3. **Compare their longitude:** Oklahoma is directly north of Texas. Therefore,
      for Lake Worth to be west of Lake Stanley Draper, it would need to be significantly
      west of the Texas/Oklahoma border.  Lake Worth is not that far west.


      4. **Conclusion:** Lake Worth, TX is *east* of Oklahoma, and therefore east
      of Lake Stanley Draper, OK.
