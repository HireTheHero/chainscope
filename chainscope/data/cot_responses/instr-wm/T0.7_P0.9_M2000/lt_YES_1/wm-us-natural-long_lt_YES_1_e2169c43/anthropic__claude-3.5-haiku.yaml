      - These locations are in different states and quite far apart


      4. Determine relative positioning:

      - South Dakota is north of Texas

      - Therefore, Horse Thief Lake is geographically north of Christmas Mountains,
      not west


      5. Conclusion:

      The statement that Horse Thief Lake is west of Christmas Mountains is FALSE.

      - The Wapack Range is in southern New Hampshire/Massachusetts border region


      To definitively answer, I would need to confirm their precise coordinates. However,
      based on the general geographic information, it seems Brooks Pond is likely
      WEST of the Wapack Range.


      Therefore, my answer is: YES.'

      1. First, I''ll locate Brooks Pond in Massachusetts

      2. Then, I''ll locate the Wapack Range in New Hampshire

      3. Then I''ll determine their relative positions


      Step 1: Brooks Pond is located in the north-central part of Massachusetts, specifically
      in the Worcester County region.


      Step 2: The Wapack Range is a mountain range that runs from southern New Hampshire
      near the Massachusetts border, roughly from Mount Watatic in Massachusetts to
      North Pack Monadnock in New Hampshire.


      Step 3: Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Brooks Pond is located east of the Wapack Range

      - The Wapack Range runs generally north-south and is west of Brooks Pond


      Therefore, Brooks Pond is NOT located west of the Wapack Range.


      The answer is: NO.'

      \ eastern Iowa\n\u2022 These are in different states and different geographical\
      \ regions\n\n4. Determine their relative positions:\n\u2022 The Ouachita Mountains\
      \ are significantly south and west of the Iowa River\n\u2022 They are not west\
      \ of the Iowa River, but rather southwest of it\n\n5. Therefore, the answer\
