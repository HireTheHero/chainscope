      \ Locations**: First, we need to know the locations of Henry Hagg Lake and Boundary\
      \ Pass.\n   - Henry Hagg Lake is located in Washington County, Oregon.\n   -\

      \ Islands of Washington from the Gulf Islands of British Columbia.\n\n2. **Understand\
      \ Geography**: Boundary Pass is in the Pacific Northwest region, which includes\
      \ the states of Washington, Oregon, and parts of British Columbia.\n\n3. **Specific\
      \ Locations**: \n   - Henry Hagg Lake is in the western part of Oregon, closer\

      west of the Dix Range in New York, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Lake Oscawana is a lake in Putnam County, New
      York. The Dix Range is a group of mountains located in the Adirondack Mountains
      in Essex County, New York.


      2. **Understand the geography**: The Adirondack Mountains are a mountain range
      in northeastern New York State. Lake Oscawana is located in the Hudson Highlands,
      which is a mountainous region in the southeastern part of New York State.


      3. **Consider the relative positions**: The Adirondack Mountains are located
      to the north of the Hudson Highlands. The Dix Range, being part of the Adirondack
      Mountains, would be north of Lake Oscawana.


      4. **Determine the direction**: Based on the geographical positions of Lake
      Oscawana and the Dix Range, we can conclude that Lake Oscawana is located south
      of the Dix Range.


      5. **Answer**: Since west is not the direction of Lake Oscawana relative to

      west of Seneca Lake, NY, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: Lake Artemesia is located in Prince George''s County,
      Maryland, while Seneca Lake is located in the Finger Lakes region of New York.


      2. **Determine States'' Positions**: Maryland is located on the eastern coast
      of the United States, and New York is north of Maryland.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Lake Artemesia is near College Park, MD, which is
      near the east coast. Seneca Lake is in the central part of New York, but it''s
      relatively eastward compared to the western parts of New York.


      4. **Consider Latitude**: Both Maryland and New York are at similar latitudes,
      so the main difference is in their east-west positions.


      5. **Compare East-West Positions**: Given the locations of the lakes, Lake Artemesia
      in Maryland is closer to the east coast, while Seneca Lake in New York is further
      westward.


      Based on these steps, considering the relative east-west positions of Maryland
      and New York, and the specific locations of Lake Artemesia and Seneca Lake,
      it can be concluded that Lake Artemesia, MD is **NOT** located west of Seneca
      Lake, NY.

      west of Lake Wawasee, IN, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Barbee Lake and Lake Wawasee are both in Indiana,
      USA.


      2. **Understand the geography of Indiana**: Indiana is a Midwestern state in
      the United States. It''s bordered by Michigan to the north, Ohio to the east,
      Kentucky to the south, and Illinois to the west.


      3. **Specific locations of the lakes**: Barbee Lake and Lake Wawasee are both
      located in Kosciusko County, Indiana.


      4. **Relative positions**: Both lakes are in the same county, but we need to
      determine their specific positions relative to each other.


      5. **Comparison**: Without precise coordinates, we rely on general knowledge
      of the area. Both lakes are popular recreational spots in northern Indiana.
      Lake Wawasee is known as the largest natural lake in Indiana, and it''s often
      referred to as a major destination in the region.


      6. **Inference**: Given the information available, it''s likely that Barbee
      Lake is east of Lake Wawasee, as Lake Wawasee is often highlighted as a major
      attraction in the northern part of the state, and Barbee Lake is not as widely
      known or mentioned.

      1. **Identify the locations**: The Sawtooth Range is a mountain range located
      in central Idaho, while the Boise Mountains are a smaller range also located
      in central Idaho.


      2. **Determine the general geographic positions**: Both the Sawtooth Range and
      the Boise Mountains are part of the Rocky Mountains, which run north to south
      through central Idaho.


      3. **Consider the specific locations within Idaho**: The Sawtooth Range is situated
      in the central part of Idaho, while the Boise Mountains are located to the southwest
      of the Sawtooth Range.


      4. **Compare their positions**: Since the Sawtooth Range is more central and
      the Boise Mountains are to the southwest, the Sawtooth Range would be east of
      the Boise Mountains.


      Based on this step-by-step reasoning, the answer to whether the Sawtooth Range
      (Idaho) is located west of the Boise Mountains, ID, is: **NO**'

      of California, while the Santa Rosa Range is a mountain range in Nevada.


      2. **Understand Geography**: Rogers Dry Lake is located in the Mojave Desert,
      which is in the southern part of California. The Santa Rosa Range is in northern
      Nevada, east of the Sierra Nevada mountains.


      3. **Determine Relative Positions**: California is west of Nevada, but the specific
      locations within these states matter. Rogers Dry Lake is in the southern part
      of California, and the Santa Rosa Range is in the northern part of Nevada.


      4. **Compare Locations**: The Mojave Desert, where Rogers Dry Lake is located,
      is in the southern part of California, which is west of Nevada. However, the
      Santa Rosa Range is in the northern part of Nevada, which is generally north

      refers to the entire group of mountains or the overarching geographical feature.


      3. **Specific locations within the range**: The Sangre de Cristo Range is a
      large mountain range with various peaks and areas. Specific locations within
      the range might have more localized names.

      are located west of the Sangre de Cristo Range, we need to consider the geography
      and naming conventions of these mountainous areas in Colorado.


      1. **Identify Locations**: Both the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and the Sangre
      de Cristo Range are located in southern Colorado, USA.


      2. **Understand the Geography**: The Sangre de Cristo Mountains are a mountain
      range that extends from southern Colorado into northern New Mexico. They are
      part of the larger Sangre de Cristo Range, which includes the Sangre de Cristo
      Mountains in Colorado and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in New Mexico.


      3. **Naming Convention**: The "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" can refer to the
      entire range or specifically to the Colorado portion. In this case, we can assume
      that "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" refers to the Colorado portion, given the
      context of the question.


      4. **Comparison**: If "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" refers to the Colorado portion,
      then it is part of the larger Sangre de Cristo Range. The Colorado portion is
      not located west of the entire Sangre de Cristo Range because the range extends
      into New Mexico.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the geography and naming convention, the Sangre de
      Cristo Mountains in Colorado are not located west of the Sangre de Cristo Range,
      as the range includes the Colorado portion.
