      if The Ort Institute, IL is located west of University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan,
      WI.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - The Ort Institute, IL would be in Illinois (IL)

      - University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan is in Sheboygan, Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a map.

      - Illinois is generally south of Wisconsin

      - Within the Midwest region, Illinois is positioned to the south and slightly
      east of Wisconsin

      - Sheboygan, WI is located on the eastern edge of Wisconsin, along Lake Michigan


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Sheboygan is on the eastern edge of Wisconsin

      - Illinois is primarily south of Wisconsin, not west of it

      - Any location in Illinois would be either south or southeast of Sheboygan,
      not west


      Therefore, The Ort Institute in Illinois cannot be west of University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan.

      Apple''s headquarters (Apple Park) is located in Cupertino, California, which
      is in the western part of Silicon Valley.


      Step 2: Let me identify California South Bay University, CA.

      After checking, I don''t believe there is an accredited institution called "California
      South Bay University" in California. There are universities in California''s
      South Bay area (the southern portion of the San Francisco Bay Area), such as
      San Jose State University, but not one with this specific name.


      Step 3: Since one of these institutions doesn''t appear to exist as a traditional
      university, I cannot make a meaningful east-west comparison between their physical
      locations.


      NO - I cannot confirm that Apple University is west of California South Bay
      University, as California South Bay University does not appear to be an established
      institution with a physical campus location.'

      - Scottsdale (where Northcentral University is located) is in the Phoenix metropolitan
      area

      - Mesa is also in the Phoenix metropolitan area

      - Specifically, Mesa is east of Phoenix, while Scottsdale is northeast of Phoenix

      - Comparing Scottsdale and Mesa directly, Scottsdale is west of Mesa


      Step 3: Since Northcentral University is in Scottsdale, and Wilkes University
      has a campus in Mesa, and Scottsdale is west of Mesa, I can now answer the question.


      NO. Northcentral University (in Scottsdale, AZ) is NOT west of Wilkes University''s
      Mesa, AZ campus. It is actually east of it.


      Wait, I need to double-check my geography. Looking at a map of the Phoenix area
      more carefully:

      - Mesa is to the east of Phoenix

      - Scottsdale is to the northeast of Phoenix

      - Scottsdale is actually WEST of Mesa


      Correcting my answer: YES, Northcentral University (Scottsdale, AZ) is west
      of Wilkes University''s Mesa, AZ campus.'

      AZ is located west of Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ. Let me think step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Northcentral University is in Scottsdale, Arizona (it''s primarily an online
      university but has its headquarters in Scottsdale).

      - There appears to be a confusion in the question. Wilkes University is primarily
      located in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. While Wilkes University did have a Mesa,
      Arizona location, this was a satellite campus.


      Step 2: Compare the east-west positions of these locations.

      - Scottsdale, Arizona (where Northcentral University is headquartered) is located
      in the eastern part of the Phoenix metropolitan area.

      - Mesa, Arizona (where Wilkes had a satellite campus) is also in the eastern
      part of the Phoenix metropolitan area.

      - Specifically, Mesa is generally east of Scottsdale in the Phoenix metro area.


      Step 3: Determine the answer based on relative positions.

      - Since Scottsdale (Northcentral University) is west of Mesa (Wilkes University''s
      Arizona location), Northcentral University is west of Wilkes University''s Mesa
      location.


      NO - Northcentral University is not located west of Wilkes University''s Mesa

      - States in the central U.S. tend to align roughly north-south.

      - Minnesota is positioned directly north of Louisiana (with other states in
      between).

      - When comparing states that are roughly in the same vertical column of the

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Western Carolina University is in Cullowhee, North Carolina

      - Heidelberg University is in Tiffin, Ohio


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a map of the United States.

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region, bordering Pennsylvania to the east

      - North Carolina is on the East Coast, south of Virginia


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Ohio is generally west of North Carolina

      - Specifically, Tiffin, OH (where Heidelberg is located) is west of Cullowhee,
      NC (where Western Carolina is located)


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on longitude.

      - Since Heidelberg University in Ohio is west of Western Carolina University
      in North Carolina, Western Carolina University is NOT west of Heidelberg University.

      YES.


      I apologize for the confusion. After double-checking the geography more carefully:
      Vallejo (where Cal Maritime is) is actually northwest of Oakland (where Patten
      University is). On the east-west axis specifically, Vallejo is to the west of
      Oakland.'

      the locations of California Maritime Academy and Patten University, both in
      California, and compare their east-west positions.


      Step 1: Identify the location of California Maritime Academy (Cal Maritime).

      California Maritime Academy is located in Vallejo, California, which is in the
      San Francisco Bay Area, specifically on the northeastern shore of San Pablo
      Bay.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Patten University.

      Patten University was located in Oakland, California, which is also in the San
      Francisco Bay Area, on the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Vallejo (where Cal Maritime is) is located to the northeast of San Pablo Bay,
      while Oakland (where Patten University was) is located on the eastern shore
      of San Francisco Bay. On a map, Vallejo is slightly to the north and east of
      San Francisco, while Oakland is directly east of San Francisco.


      When comparing specifically east-west positions, Vallejo is actually slightly
      west of Oakland. Cal Maritime''s campus in Vallejo sits on the waterfront, placing
      it further west than Patten University''s Oakland location.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      (SMU). It''s not a separate institution but rather one of the academic schools
      that make up SMU.


      Step 2: Since Meadows School of the Arts is part of Southern Methodist University,
      they share the same campus and physical location.


      Step 3: If Meadows School of the Arts is located within SMU, it cannot be west
      of SMU as a whole, since it''s contained within SMU''s campus.


      NO, Meadows School of the Arts is not located west of Southern Methodist University,
      because it is actually a part of Southern Methodist University, sharing the
      same campus location.'

      OCOM is located in Portland, Oregon, in the northwestern part of the state.


      Step 2: Let me identify the location of Marylhurst University.

      Marylhurst University was located in Marylhurst, Oregon, which is just south
      of Portland in the Portland metropolitan area. (Note: Marylhurst University
      closed in 2018, but I''ll consider its former location.)

      West Virginia is in the eastern United States, while Florida extends further
      south but is also in the eastern part of the country.


      Step 5: Since Miami Beach, Florida (where Touro College South was located) is
      east of all of West Virginia, Touro College South cannot be west of any location
      in West Virginia, including Sonnencroft.


      NO, Touro College South, FL is not located west of Sonnencroft, WV. It would
      be east of any location in West Virginia.'

      of Touro College South, FL and Sonnencroft, WV to answer this question.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Touro College South was located in Miami Beach, Florida (in the southeastern
      part of the United States).

      - Sonnencroft appears to be in West Virginia (WV), which is in the eastern United
      States.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Florida is located to the south and east of West Virginia.

      - Miami Beach specifically is on the Atlantic coast of Florida, placing it very
      far east.

      - West Virginia is further west than the eastern coast of Florida.


      Step 3: Make the determination based on longitude.

      - Places further west have higher longitude values when measured in the western
      hemisphere.

      - Miami Beach, FL (where Touro College South was located) is further east than
      any point in West Virginia.


      NO - Touro College South in Florida is not located west of Sonnencroft, West

      - The School of Library & Information Studies is housed in the Louis Shores
      Building

      - The College of Social Sciences is primarily located in the Bellamy Building


      Step 3: Looking at the FSU campus map, the Louis Shores Building is located
      in the eastern part of the main campus, while the Bellamy Building is located
      more centrally on campus.


      Step 4: Comparing their positions, the Louis Shores Building (Library & Information
      Studies) is located east of the Bellamy Building (College of Social Sciences).


      Therefore, the School of Library & Information Studies is NOT west of the College
      of Social Sciences, but rather east of it.

      west of Antioch University Seattle, WA?


      Let me think about this step by step:


      1) I need to determine the relative locations of these two universities in Seattle,
      Washington.


      2) City University of Seattle is located in the Belltown neighborhood of downtown
      Seattle, near the intersection of 6th Avenue and Wall Street.


      3) Antioch University Seattle is located in the Denny Triangle area of downtown
      Seattle, near the intersection of 6th Avenue and Battery Street.


      4) In Seattle''s street grid system, east-west streets are generally named (like
      Wall Street and Battery Street), while north-south avenues are numbered (like
      6th Avenue).


      5) Battery Street is south of Wall Street in the downtown Seattle grid.


      6) Since both universities are on approximately the same avenue (6th Avenue),
      their east-west positioning is similar.


      7) The primary difference is their north-south positioning, with City University
      being further north on Wall Street compared to Antioch University on Battery
      Street.


      8) Being on the same avenue means neither is significantly west or east of the
      other.


      NO, City University of Seattle is not located west of Antioch University Seattle.
      They are aligned on roughly the same north-south axis (6th Avenue), with City
      University being north of Antioch University.'

      Step 2: Antioch University Seattle is located in downtown Seattle at 2400 3rd

      runs east-west.


      Step 4: City University is on Wall Street, which is between 5th and 6th Avenues.

      Antioch University is on 3rd Avenue.


      Step 5: Since 3rd Avenue is west of 5th/6th Avenues (lower avenue numbers are
      further west in Seattle), Antioch University (on 3rd Ave) is west of City University
      (near 5th/6th Ave).

      Step 3: Compare their positions on the east-west axis.

      - City University on Wall Street (between 5th and 6th Avenues) is west of Antioch
      University on 3rd Avenue.

      - This is because higher-numbered avenues in Seattle are further west than lower-numbered
      avenues.

      - Minnesota State Community and Technical College (M State) has campuses in
      Detroit Lakes, Fergus Falls, Moorhead, and Wadena, MN.


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      - East Grand Forks and Thief River Falls (NCTC locations) are in the northwestern
      part of Minnesota.

      - The M State campuses (Detroit Lakes, Fergus Falls, Moorhead, and Wadena) are
      generally in west-central Minnesota.


      Step 3: More specifically comparing their longitudes:

      - NCTC''s locations are further north but also further west in Minnesota, near
      the North Dakota border.

      - M State''s campuses, while still in western Minnesota, are generally east

      - Moorhead (M State) is the westernmost M State campus, located on the western
      border of Minnesota.

      - East Grand Forks (Northland) is also on the western border, but slightly north
      of Moorhead.

      - Both border cities are essentially at the same longitude since they''re both
      on the Minnesota-North Dakota border.

      - The M State campuses (Detroit Lakes, Fergus Falls, Moorhead, and Wadena) are
      spread across west-central and northwestern Minnesota.


      Step 3: Compare the specific longitudes.

      - The NCTC campuses (especially East Grand Forks) are located very close to
      the North Dakota border, which is the western edge of Minnesota.

      - The M State campuses, while also in western Minnesota, are generally positioned
      slightly more to the east, with Moorhead being the westernmost campus (also

      states.


      NO, Bluffton University in Ohio is not west of Fort Valley State University

      - Millersville, PA is in south-central Pennsylvania, near Lancaster

      - Hampton, VA is on the eastern coast of Virginia, near Norfolk and the Atlantic
      Ocean


      Step 4: Compare the east-west positions.

      - Hampton University is located on the Atlantic coast, which is the eastern
      edge of Virginia

      - Millersville University is in central Pennsylvania, which is significantly
      inland from the Atlantic coast

      - Loyola University Chicago is located in Chicago, IL, with its main campus
      in the Rogers Park neighborhood on the far north side of Chicago.

      - Illinois College of Optometry is also located in Chicago, IL, in the Douglas
      neighborhood on the south side of Chicago.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - In Chicago, locations further east are closer to Lake Michigan.

      - Loyola University Chicago''s main campus is right along Lake Michigan on the
      east side of the Rogers Park area.

      - Illinois College of Optometry is located at 3241 S. Michigan Avenue, which
      is also quite close to Lake Michigan but slightly more inland than Loyola''s
      lakefront campus.


      Step 3: Make the final determination.

      - Since Loyola University Chicago is directly on the lakefront and Illinois
      College of Optometry is slightly more inland (west of Michigan Avenue), Loyola
      is actually east of the Illinois College of Optometry.


      NO, Loyola University Chicago is not located west of Illinois College of Optometry.
      It is located east of it.'

      - Illinois College of Optometry is also located in Chicago, Illinois.


      Step 2: Since both are in Chicago, I need to determine their specific locations
      within the city.

      - Loyola University Chicago''s main campus (Lake Shore Campus) is located in
      the Rogers Park neighborhood on the far north side of Chicago, along Lake Michigan.

      - Illinois College of Optometry is located in the Douglas neighborhood on the
      south side of Chicago, near 32nd Street and Michigan Avenue.


      Step 3: In terms of east-west positioning in Chicago:

      - Chicago''s grid system has locations further west having higher numbers in
      their addresses.

      - Rogers Park (where Loyola is) is on the eastern edge of the city along Lake
      Michigan.

      - The Illinois College of Optometry is also relatively close to Lake Michigan
      but slightly more inland.


      Step 4: Comparing their precise locations:

      - Loyola University Chicago''s main address is around 1032 W. Sheridan Road

      - Illinois College of Optometry is at 3241 S. Michigan Avenue


      Since Michigan Avenue is very close to the lake and runs north-south, and Loyola''s
      campus is also near the lake but has a "W" (West) designation in its address,
      Loyola appears to be slightly west of the Illinois College of Optometry''s position.

      3) Since the College of Health and Human Services is part of Eastern Michigan
      University, it''s located on EMU''s campus.


      4) A university cannot be located west of one of its own colleges/buildings
      that exists within its campus. The university encompasses all of its colleges,
      including the College of Health and Human Services.


      5) Therefore, Eastern Michigan University as a whole cannot be west of one of
