      3. **Geographical orientation**: The University of Michigan College of Pharmacy
      is located at 428 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI. The University of Michigan School
      of Public Health is located at 1415 Washington Heights, Ann Arbor, MI.


      4. **Compare the locations**: By looking at a map, you can determine the relative
      positions of these buildings. The College of Pharmacy is situated to the west
      of the School of Public Health.


      Considering these steps, the answer to the question is YES, the University of
      Michigan College of Pharmacy is located west of the University of Michigan School

      1. **Identify the location of Loyola University Chicago:** Loyola University
      Chicago''s main campus, known as the Lake Shore Campus, is located in the Rogers

      2. **Identify the location of the Illinois College of Optometry:** The Illinois
      College of Optometry is located in the Near South Side neighborhood of Chicago,

      3. **Compare their longitudinal positions:** The Rogers Park neighborhood (Loyola
      University Chicago) is situated north of downtown Chicago, while the Near South
      Side (Illinois College of Optometry) is located just south of downtown Chicago.
      Given that both locations are in the city of Chicago, the primary difference
      in their geographic positions will be along the north-south axis rather than
      the east-west axis.


      4. **Determine the relative east-west positions:** Both locations are within
      the city limits of Chicago, and Chicago''s layout means that the city is more
      elongated north to south than east to west. Therefore, while there may be minor
      differences in the exact longitudinal coordinates, the primary difference is
      north-south.


      From this analysis, we can conclude that Loyola University Chicago is not significantly
      west or east of the Illinois College of Optometry, but rather primarily north
      of it.

      2. **Ottawa University, KS**: Ottawa University is located in Ottawa, Kansas.
      Ottawa is situated in the eastern part of Kansas.


      Now, we compare the relative longitudinal positions:


      - **Texas vs. Kansas**: In general, Texas extends further west than Kansas,
      but since both institutions are located in the eastern parts of their respective
      states, the comparison might be closer.


      - **Jacksonville, TX vs. Ottawa, KS**: Jacksonville, TX, being in eastern Texas,

      Ottawa, KS, being in eastern Kansas, is also located to the east of the central
