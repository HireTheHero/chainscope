      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Saint Joseph''s University is located in Philadelphia,
      Pennsylvania, and the University of the Sciences is also located in Philadelphia,
      Pennsylvania.


      2. **Determine the geographical positions**: Philadelphia is a city located
      in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, near the border with New Jersey.


      3. **Compare the east-west positions**: Both universities are in the same city,
      Philadelphia. Since Philadelphia is in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, it''s
      unlikely that one institution is significantly west of the other within the
      city.


      4. **Consider the city layout**: Philadelphia is a relatively large city with
      various neighborhoods and districts. While it''s possible that one university
      is slightly west of the other within the city, the difference is unlikely to
      be significant enough to warrant the term "west" in a broader geographical sense.


      Given these steps, we can conclude that Saint Joseph''s University in Philadelphia,
      Pennsylvania, is not located west of the University of the Sciences, also in
      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

      2. **Understand the question**: The question asks if Saint Joseph''s University
      is located west of the University of the Sciences. Since both universities are
      in Philadelphia, we need to consider their specific locations within the city
      to determine their relative positions.


      3. **Determine the directions within Philadelphia**: Without specific addresses,
      it''s challenging to definitively say which university is west of the other.
      However, knowing that both are in Philadelphia, if Saint Joseph''s University
      is not significantly east of the University of the Sciences, there''s a possibility
      it could be west or in a similar longitudinal position.


      4. **Conclusion based on available data**: Given the lack of precise location
      data (e.g., exact addresses or GPS coordinates) for both universities within
      Philadelphia, it''s not possible to definitively conclude their relative positions
      (east-west) without further specific information. However, for the sake of providing
      a YES/NO answer based on the most likely scenario given the information that
      both are in Philadelphia, PA, and without precise locations, one might lean
      towards a "no" due to the assumption that both could be relatively close or
      the question might imply a significant geographical difference that isn''t present.


      Given these steps and acknowledging the need for a definitive YES/NO answer,
      and considering both institutions are located in Philadelphia, PA, which suggests
      they are relatively close and not significantly west-east of each other, the

      located in New York City, specifically on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.


      2. **Location of Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education**: Sophie Davis
      School of Biomedical Education is also located in New York City, specifically
      in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan.


      3. **Comparison**: Both institutions are in New York City, but they are in different
      neighborhoods within the city. The Rockefeller University is on the Upper East
      Side, while Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education is in Harlem.


      4. **Relative Positions**: The Upper East Side and Harlem are both located on
      the island of Manhattan. The Upper East Side is generally considered to be the
      eastern part of Manhattan, while Harlem is in the northern part of the island.
      Since the question asks if The Rockefeller University is located west of Sophie
      Davis School of Biomedical Education, we need to consider their relative positions
      in terms of east-west orientation.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on their locations, The Rockefeller University is located
      east of Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education. The Upper East Side is
      generally to the east of Harlem within Manhattan. Therefore, The Rockefeller
      University is not located west of Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education.


      The answer is: **NO**'

      \ of Professional Psychology (MSPP) is located in Newton, Massachusetts.\n \
      \  - Newton College of the Sacred Heart was also located in Newton, Massachusetts.\
      \ (Note: Newton College of the Sacred Heart is now closed and was absorbed into\
      \ Boston College, but for the purpose of this question, we consider its original\
      \ location.)\n\n2. **Understand the question**: The question asks if MSPP is\
      \ located west of Newton College of the Sacred Heart. Since both institutions\
      \ are in Newton, Massachusetts, we need to consider their specific locations\
      \ within Newton to determine if one is west of the other.\n\n3. **Determine\
      \ directions within Newton, MA**:\n   - Without exact addresses, it's challenging\
      \ to definitively say which institution is west of the other. However, knowing\
      \ that both are in Newton, if MSPP is not significantly east of Newton College\
      \ of the Sacred Heart, there's a possibility it could be west or in a similar\
      \ longitudinal position.\n\n4. **Conclusion based on available data**:\n   -\
      \ Given the lack of precise location data (e.g., exact addresses or GPS coordinates)\
      \ for both institutions during their operational overlap, it's not possible\
      \ to definitively conclude their relative positions (east-west) without further\
      \ specific information. However, for the sake of providing a YES/NO answer based\
      \ on the most likely scenario given the information that both are in Newton,\
      \ MA, and without precise locations, one might lean towards a \"no\" due to\
      \ the assumption that both could be relatively close or the question might imply\
      \ a significant geographical difference that isn't present.\n\nGiven these steps\
      \ and acknowledging the need for a definitive YES/NO answer, and considering\
      \ both institutions were located in Newton, MA, which suggests they are relatively\
      \ close and not significantly west-east of each other, the answer would be:\

      part of the United States, while Virginia is in the southeastern part. Given
      these general positions, we can determine that Pennsylvania is generally to
      the north and west of Virginia.


      4. **Specific locations**: Clarion, Pennsylvania, is in the northwestern part
      of the state, while Buena Vista, Virginia, is in the central part of the state.
      This means that Clarion is both north and west of Buena Vista.


      Based on these steps and the geographical positions of both institutions, we
      can conclude that PennWest Clarion in Pennsylvania is indeed located west of
      Southern Virginia University in Virginia.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      Given that they are in the same city, it''s reasonable to infer that one is
      not significantly west of the other in terms of large geographical distances.
      However, without precise addresses or knowing the exact layout of these institutions
      within the city, it''s a bit challenging to determine their relative positions.


      But considering they are both in Athens, it''s reasonable to infer that one
      is not significantly west of the other in terms of large geographical distances,
      as they are both contained within the same city limits.


      Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location in
      Athens, Georgia, would lean towards a "NO" because they are not in different
      geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of the other
      in a broader sense. However, this answer assumes that their locations within
      Athens do not have one significantly to the west of the other, which is a reasonable
      assumption given the context of the question.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

      are in the same city or region, they are not considered to be "west" of each
      other in a geographical sense that implies a significant distance.


      Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location in
      the Portland area, Oregon, would lean towards a "NO" because they are not in
      different geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of
      the other in a broader sense. However, this answer assumes that their locations
      within the Portland area do not have one significantly to the west of the other,

      1. **Identify the locations**: Columbus Technical College and Columbus State
      University are both located in Columbus, Georgia.


      2. **Understand the question**: The question asks if Columbus Technical College
      is located west of Columbus State University. Since both institutions are in
      the same city, we need to consider their specific locations within Columbus.


      3. **Determine the directions within Columbus**: Without precise addresses or
      GPS coordinates for both institutions, it''s challenging to definitively say
      which one is west of the other within the city limits of Columbus, GA.


      4. **Consider the geographical context**: Given that both institutions are in
      the same city, it''s unlikely that one is significantly west of the other in
      a way that would be obvious without specific location details. Generally, institutions

      1. **Identify the locations**: Both Columbus Technical College and Columbus
      State University are located in Columbus, Georgia.


      2. **Consider the geography of Columbus, Georgia**: Columbus is a city located
      in western Georgia, near the border with Alabama. It''s positioned in the eastern
      part of the state.


      3. **Compare the relative positions**: Since both institutions are located in
      the same city, their relative positions are more about their specific locations
      within Columbus rather than their positions relative to each other in terms
      of being east or west of one another.


      4. **Assess the significance of "west" in the question**: The question asks
      if Columbus Technical College is located west of Columbus State University.
      Since they are in the same city, the use of "west" likely refers to a more localized
      perspective within the city rather than a broader geographical context.


      5. **Consider the specific locations within Columbus**: Without knowing the
      exact addresses of both institutions, it''s challenging to determine their precise
      locations within the city. However, if they are both in Columbus, it''s reasonable
      to assume that one is not significantly west of the other in a way that would
      imply a large geographical distance.


      Given these steps and the requirement for a definitive YES/NO answer:


      Considering that both institutions are in the same city (Columbus, Georgia)
      and without specific addresses to determine their exact relative positions,
      it''s a close call. But typically, when two locations are in the same city,
      they are not considered to be "west" of each other in a geographical sense that
      implies a significant distance.


      Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location in
      Columbus, Georgia, would lean towards a "NO" because they are not in different
      geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of the other
      in a broader sense. However, this answer assumes that their locations within
      Columbus do not have one significantly to the west of the other, which is a
      reasonable assumption given the context of the question.

      the same city (Columbus), they are geographically close to each other. To determine
      if one is west of the other, we need to consider their specific locations within
      Columbus.


      3. **Consider the city''s layout**: Columbus, Georgia, is a city with a north-south
      orientation along the Chattahoochee River. The city is divided into different
      districts and neighborhoods. The relative positions of Columbus Technical College
      and Columbus State University within these districts would determine if one

      coordinates, it''s challenging to definitively say if Columbus Technical College
      is west of Columbus State University. However, we can make some assumptions
      based on the general layout of Columbus.


      5. **Assumptions**: Given that both institutions are in the same city and are

      1. **Identify the locations**: The Florida State University School of Library
      & Information Studies (FSU SLIS) and the Florida State University College of
      Social Sciences (FSU CSS) are both part of Florida State University (FSU), which
      is located in Tallahassee, Florida.


      2. **Understand the question**: The question asks if the School of Library &
      Information Studies is located west of the College of Social Sciences. Since
      both are part of the same university, they are likely located on the same campus
      or in close proximity.


      3. **Consider the campus layout**: Without knowing the specific layout of the
      FSU campus and the locations of these two schools, it''s challenging to determine
      if one is west of the other. However, given that they are both part of the same
      university, it''s reasonable to assume that they are not significantly west-east
      of each other on the campus.


      4. **Conclusion based on available information**: Since both schools are part
      of the same university and likely located on the same campus, it''s unlikely
      that one is significantly west of the other in a way that would make a clear
      geographical distinction. Therefore, for the sake of providing a YES/NO answer

      3. **Consider the geography of Des Moines**: Des Moines is a city in central
      Iowa. Without knowing the exact locations of the two institutions within Des
      Moines, it''s challenging to determine if one is west of the other. However,
      we can make some assumptions based on the general layout of the city.


      4. **Assumptions**: Given that both institutions are in Des Moines, it''s reasonable
      to assume they are not significantly separated by distance within the city.
      Des Moines is not a vast city, and educational institutions are often located
      relatively close to each other.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the available information and the assumptions made,
      it''s reasonable to conclude that Des Moines University is not located significantly
      west of Drake University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences within Des
      Moines, Iowa.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'
    e55c6e5c-c926-4a4d-8213-66e408c1f4ac: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Des Moines University is located in Des Moines,
      Iowa, and Drake University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences is also located
      in Des Moines, Iowa.


      2. **Consider the geographical position**: Both universities are in Des Moines,
      which is a city in central Iowa. The specific locations of the universities
      within the city would determine their relative positions.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Given that both institutions are in
      the same city, it''s likely that they are not significantly west or east of
      each other in terms of large geographical distances. However, without precise
      addresses or knowing the exact layout of the universities within the city, it''s
      a bit challenging to say definitively.


      4. **Logical deduction**: Considering that both universities are in the same
      city, it''s reasonable to infer that one is not significantly west of the other
      in terms of large geographical distances. Typically, when two locations are
      in the same city, they are not considered to be "west" of each other in a geographical
      sense that implies a significant distance.


      Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location in
      Des Moines, Iowa, would lean towards a "NO" because they are not in different
      geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of the other
      in a broader sense. However, this answer assumes that their locations within
      Des Moines do not have one significantly to the west of the other, which is
      a reasonable assumption given the context of the question.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

      a "NO" because they are not in different geographical areas that would clearly
      define one as being west of the other in a broader sense. However, this answer

      Lafayette, it''s reasonable to infer that one is not significantly west of the
      other in terms of large geographical distances, as they are both contained within
      the same city limits.


      However, for the sake of providing a clear YES or NO answer based on the most

      - If Purdue University College of Health and Human Sciences and Purdue University
      College of Agriculture are in the same city (West Lafayette), and without specific
      addresses to determine their exact relative positions, it''s a close call. But
      typically, when two locations are in the same city, they are not considered
      to be "west" of each other in a geographical sense that implies a significant
      distance.


      Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location in
      West Lafayette, Indiana, would lean towards a "NO" because they are not in different
      geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of the other
      in a broader sense. However, this answer assumes that their locations within
      West Lafayette do not have one significantly to the west of the other, which
      is a reasonable assumption given the context of the question.

      1. **Location of Corcoran College of Art and Design**: Corcoran College of Art

      2. **Location of Strayer University**: Strayer University has multiple campuses,

      are essentially in the same location. However, the question asks if Corcoran
      College of Art and Design is located west of Strayer University.


      Given that they are in the same city and likely very close to each other, the
      specific locations within Washington, D.C., would determine their relative positions.
      However, without precise addresses or knowing the exact layout of these institutions

      But considering they are both in Washington, D.C., it''s reasonable to infer
      that one is not significantly west of the other in terms of large geographical
      distances, as they are both contained within the same city limits.


      However, for the sake of providing a clear YES or NO answer based on the most

      - If Corcoran College of Art and Design and Strayer University are in the same
      city (Washington, D.C.), and without specific addresses to determine their exact
      relative positions, it''s a close call. But typically, when two locations are
      in the same city, they are not considered to be "west" of each other in a geographical
      sense that implies a significant distance.


      Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location in
      Washington, D.C., would lean towards a "NO" because they are not in different
      geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of the other
      in a broader sense. However, this answer assumes that their locations within
      Washington, D.C., do not have one significantly to the west of the other, which
      is a reasonable assumption given the context of the question.

      3. **Comparison**: Since both institutions are based in Washington, D.C., they
      are essentially in the same location. However, the question asks if Corcoran
      College of Art and Design is located west of Strayer University.


      Given that they are in the same city and likely very close to each other, the
      specific locations within Washington, D.C. would determine their relative positions.
      However, without precise addresses or knowing the exact layout of these institutions
      within the city, it''s a bit challenging. But considering they are both in Washington,
      D.C., it''s reasonable to infer that one is not significantly west of the other
      in terms of large geographical distances, as they are both contained within
      the same city limits.


      However, for the sake of providing a clear YES or NO answer based on the most
      logical deduction given the information:


      - If Corcoran College of Art and Design and Strayer University are in the same
      city (Washington, D.C.), and without specific addresses to determine their exact
      relative positions, it''s a close call. But typically, when two locations are
      in the same city, they are not considered to be "west" of each other in a geographical
      sense that implies a significant distance.


      Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location in
      Washington, D.C., would lean towards a "NO" because they are not in different
      geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of the other
      in a broader sense. However, this answer assumes that their locations within
      Washington, D.C. do not have one significantly to the west of the other, which
      is a reasonable assumption given the context of the question.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Corcoran College of Art and Design is located
      in Washington, D.C., and Strayer University is also located in Washington, D.C.


      2. **Consider the geographical positions**: Both institutions are in the same
      city, which means they are in the same general location. To determine if one
      is west of the other, we need to consider their specific addresses or locations
      within Washington, D.C.


      3. **Determine specific addresses**: Without specific addresses for both institutions,
      it''s challenging to determine their exact positions relative to each other.
      However, since they are both in Washington, D.C., they are likely in close proximity.


      4. **Reasonable assumption**: Given that both institutions are in the same city,
      it''s reasonable to assume that they are not significantly west of each other
      in a geographical sense that implies a large distance. Typically, when two locations
      are in the same city, they are not considered to be "west" of each other in
      a way that would imply a substantial separation.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided, and considering that both
      institutions are located in Washington, D.C., it''s safe to conclude that Corcoran
      College of Art and Design is not located west of Strayer University. Instead,
      they are likely in relatively close proximity within the city.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: California State University (CSU) is a system
      of public universities in California. The Art Center College of Design is located
      in Pasadena, California.


      2. **Consider the geographical context**: California is a large state with a
      diverse geography. To determine whether CSU is located west of the Art Center
      College of Design, we need to consider the specific location of CSU and the
      Art Center College of Design within California.


      3. **Specific locations**: CSU has multiple campuses throughout California,
      but the question doesn''t specify which CSU campus is being referred to. For
      simplicity, let''s consider the main CSU campus, which is California State University,
      Long Beach, located in Long Beach, California.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Long Beach is located in Southern California,
      while Pasadena is also in Southern California, but slightly more inland. Both
      cities are in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Long Beach (CSU, Long Beach) is west of Pasadena

      is part of the Phoenix metropolitan area.


      2. **Location of Grand Canyon University**: Grand Canyon University is also

      New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences is located west of Grand

      Given that they are in the same metropolitan area, the specific locations within

      distance.


      Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location in
      the Phoenix metropolitan area would lean towards a "NO" because they are not
      in different geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west
      of the other in a broader sense. However, this answer assumes that their locations

      the locations of Loyola University Chicago and the Illinois College of Optometry,
      and then compare their positions relative to each other.


      1. **Location of Loyola University Chicago**: Loyola University Chicago is located
      in Chicago, Illinois. It has multiple campuses in the Chicago area, including
      the main campus in Rogers Park, the Lake Shore Campus in Edgewater, and the
      Water Tower Campus in the Near North Side.


      2. **Location of Illinois College of Optometry**: The Illinois College of Optometry
      is located in Chicago, Illinois, specifically in the Near South Side neighborhood.


      3. **Comparison**: Since both institutions are located in Chicago, Illinois,
      they are essentially in the same city. However, the question asks if Loyola
      University Chicago is located west of the Illinois College of Optometry.


      Given that they are both in Chicago, it''s reasonable to assume that one is
      not significantly west of the other in terms of large geographical distances,
      as they are both contained within the city limits. However, without specific
      addresses or knowing the exact layout of these institutions within Chicago,
      it''s a bit challenging to determine their relative positions precisely.


      But considering they are both in Chicago, it''s reasonable to infer that one
      is not significantly west of the other in terms of large geographical distances,
      as they are both contained within the same city limits. Therefore, for the sake
      of providing a clear YES or NO answer based on the most logical deduction given
      the information:


      - If Loyola University Chicago and the Illinois College of Optometry are in
      the same city (Chicago), and without specific addresses to determine their exact
      relative positions, it''s a close call. But typically, when two locations are
      in the same city, they are not considered to be "west" of each other in a geographical
      sense that implies a significant distance.


      Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location in
      Chicago, Illinois, would lean towards a "NO" because they are not in different
      geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of the other
      in a broader sense. However, this answer assumes that their locations within
      Chicago do not have one significantly to the west of the other, which is a reasonable
      assumption given the context of the question.

    a6f95d6d-0369-4ba7-9abd-0ae7e5defc84: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: DePaul University is located in Chicago, Illinois.
      The University of Illinois at Chicago College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (UIC
      CLAS) is also located in Chicago, Illinois.


      2. **Determine the geographical positions**: Since both institutions are located
      in Chicago, we need to consider their relative positions within the city.


      3. **Chicago''s layout**: Chicago is a large city with various neighborhoods
      and areas. The specific locations of DePaul University and UIC CLAS within the
      city are crucial to determining their relative east-west positions.


      4. **DePaul University''s location**: DePaul University has campuses in the
      Lincoln Park and Loop areas of Chicago.


      5. **UIC CLAS location**: The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University
      of Illinois at Chicago is located in the University Village area, which is near
      the Near West Side and Little Italy neighborhoods.


      6. **Comparison**: DePaul University''s Lincoln Park campus is generally considered
      to be in the northwestern part of Chicago. The UIC CLAS campus is more centrally
      located within the city, closer to the downtown area. Given these locations,
      DePaul University''s Lincoln Park campus is indeed located west of the UIC CLAS
      campus.


      Based on these steps, the answer is: **YES**'
