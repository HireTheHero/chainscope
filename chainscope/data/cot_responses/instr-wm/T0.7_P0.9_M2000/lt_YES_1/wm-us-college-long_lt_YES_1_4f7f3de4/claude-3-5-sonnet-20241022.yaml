      4. Since one university''s location is unclear (Wilkes) and the other has moved
      to California, it''s not possible to make a valid east-west comparison of these
      institutions in Arizona.


      Given these facts, I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer as the premise
      of the question contains incorrect or outdated location information.'

      - Northcentral University is located in Scottsdale, Arizona

      - There appears to be an error in the question - Wilkes University''s Arizona
      location is in Mesa, not Wilkes University, Mesa (it''s just Wilkes University)


      2. Now I need to determine the relative positions:

      - Scottsdale and Mesa are both suburbs of Phoenix, Arizona

      - Scottsdale is located east of Phoenix

      - Mesa is located east of Phoenix and Scottsdale


      3. Therefore:

      - Northcentral University (in Scottsdale) is actually EAST of Wilkes University''s

      - Escondido is northeast of San Diego

      - Scripps Ranch is in northeastern San Diego

      - Escondido is east of Scripps Ranch

      1. First, let me identify the locations:

      - California State University system has multiple campuses across California

      - Art Center College of Design is located in Pasadena, California


      2. Since there are multiple CSU campuses, I need to consider them all:

      - CSU campuses range from Humboldt in the north to San Diego in the south

      - All CSU campuses are spread across California


      3. Art Center College of Design''s exact location:

      - Pasadena is in Los Angeles County

      - Some CSU campuses (like Long Beach, Los Angeles, Dominguez Hills) are west
      of Pasadena


      4. Final reasoning:

      - Since there are multiple CSU campuses, and some are west while others are
      east of Art Center College of Design, I cannot give a definitive answer for
      "California State University" as a single location.


      The question cannot be answered with a simple YES or NO because California State
      University is not a single location - it''s a system of multiple campuses throughout

      2) Let me think about the relative positions of these states:

      - Ohio is east of Kentucky

      - The state border between Kentucky and Ohio runs north-south


      3) Since Kentucky is west of Ohio, and these universities are in their respective
      states:

      - Any point in Kentucky must be west of any point in Ohio


      4) Therefore, Kentucky Christian University, being in Kentucky, must be west
      of Ohio Dominican University, which is in Ohio.

      - Millersville University is in Millersville, Pennsylvania

      - Hampton University is in Hampton, Virginia


      2. Looking at their positions on a map:

      - Millersville, PA is in south-central Pennsylvania

      - Hampton, VA is on the eastern coast of Virginia, near Norfolk
