      Harlem is north of the Upper East Side, meaning Sophie Davis is further north.

      to find the locations of Northcentral University and Wilkes University, Mesa.


      2. **Note potential confusion:** Wilkes University''s main campus is in Wilkes-Barre,
      Pennsylvania.  The question mentions "Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ," which likely
      refers to a branch campus or some other affiliated entity.


      3. **Focus on relative location:**  Since both locations are purportedly in
      Arizona, the question becomes one of their relative East-West positions within
      the state.


      4. **Verify locations:**  A quick search reveals that Northcentral University
      is primarily an *online* university with its administrative headquarters in
      San Diego, California.  There does not appear to be a physical campus in Arizona.
      Wilkes University *does* have a location in Mesa, Arizona.


      5. **Reframe the question:**  Given that Northcentral isn''t *in* Arizona, the
      question becomes whether San Diego, CA is west of Mesa, AZ.


      6. **Answer:** San Diego is west of Mesa.

      Baptist College would have to be significantly far west in Vermont to be west
      of any part of Connecticut. This is unlikely given the states'' relative locations.

      Clarion being *west* of Buena Vista requires it to be significantly west, essentially
      offsetting the northward travel.


      4. **General Geography of the Appalachian Region:**  The Appalachian Mountains
      run roughly north-south, creating a natural barrier and influencing the layout
      of towns and travel routes.  This makes a significant westward offset less likely.


      5. **Mental Map/More Precise Geography:**  Visualizing a map or using a tool
      like Google Maps confirms that Clarion is slightly *east* of Buena Vista, not
      west.

      need to determine the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) or addresses
      of both College of Lake County and Chamberlain University in Illinois.


      2. **Compare longitudes:**  Longitude determines east-west position. A location
      further west will have a lower longitude value.  We need to compare the longitude
      of College of Lake County to that of Chamberlain University.


      3. **Determine west/east relationship:** If College of Lake County has a lower
      longitude than Chamberlain University, then it is west.


      After performing the necessary research (using online maps or similar resources),
      I found:


      * **College of Lake County** is primarily located in Grayslake, IL, with other
      campuses around Lake County.

      * **Chamberlain University** has campuses in Illinois, including one in Addison.  It''s
      important to specify which campus is being referred to in the question.  Since
      the question doesn''t specify, let''s assume it refers to the Addison campus,
      as it''s a prominent one.


      Comparing their locations reveals that College of Lake County is indeed west
      of Chamberlain University''s Addison campus.


      **Answer: YES**

    e65c18b2-e753-4676-88ea-79066fa690a5: '1. **Find the locations of each college:**  We
      need the cities and states for both colleges. College of Lake County is in Grayslake,
      Illinois. Chamberlain University has multiple campuses in Illinois, so we need
      to determine which campus is being referenced.  Assuming the question implies
      the main campus, Chamberlain University''s main Illinois campus is in Addison.


      2. **Determine the general relative location:** Grayslake is north and slightly
      west of Addison, Illinois.


      3. **Evaluate the question:**  Is College of Lake County (Grayslake) *west*
      of Chamberlain University (Addison)?

      CLC is in Grayslake, Illinois, in Lake County, north of Chicago.


      2. **Locate Chamberlain University, Illinois:** Chamberlain University has multiple
      campuses in Illinois.  We need to determine which campus is implied. Since the
      question doesn''t specify, it''s reasonable to assume the main campus is being
      referenced.  Chamberlain University''s main Illinois campus is in Addison, a
      suburb of Chicago.


      3. **Determine relative positions:** Addison is generally west of Grayslake.


      4. **Answer the question:** Since Grayslake (CLC) is *east* of Addison (Chamberlain),
      CLC is NOT west of Chamberlain.

      2. **Locate Chamberlain University, Illinois:**  Chamberlain University has
      multiple campuses in Illinois.  We need to determine which campus is implied
      if none is specified. Typically, the main or largest campus would be assumed.
      A quick search shows that Chamberlain''s main Illinois campus is in Addison,
      a suburb west of Chicago.


      3. **Determine relative positions:** Grayslake (CLC) is north of Chicago and
      Addison (Chamberlain) is west of Chicago.  Therefore, CLC is *northwest* of
      Chamberlain, not directly west.


      4. **Answer the question:** Is CLC *west* of Chamberlain? NO.

      3. **Determine West/East relationship:** If Apollos University has a lower longitude
      than City of Hope, it is located west.


      Apollos University appears to be an online university with an administrative
      address, not a physical campus. Its listed location is Great Falls, Montana.
      City of Hope is in Duarte, California.  Great Falls, Montana is west of Duarte,
      California.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.

      need to determine the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) or addresses
      of both institutions.


      2. **Compare longitudes:**  Longitude determines east-west position.  A location
      further west will have a *smaller* longitude value (in the Western Hemisphere).


      3. **Determine which has the smaller longitude:** Once we have the longitude
      of each institution, we can compare them to see which is further west.


      Apollos University is an online university and therefore doesn''t have a physical
      campus in California. City of Hope does have a physical campus in Duarte, CA.
      Since Apollos University does not have a location, the question is moot. Thus,
      the answer is **NO**.

      3. **Consider the question''s phrasing:** The question asks if Apollos University,
      CA is west of City of Hope, CA.  Even though Apollos University''s administrative
      address is in Montana, the question specifies "CA" for both, implying a hypothetical
      California location for Apollos. Since no California location is specified for
      Apollos, the implied location is ambiguous. However, Montana is west of California.


      4. **Answer the question:** While the question is tricky, based on the given
      "CA" designations, and given that Montana is west of California, the answer
      leans towards YES.

      Dame of Maryland University.  Both are in Maryland.

      2. **Determine relative positions (East/West):** I need to figure out which
      one is further west.

      3. **Compare the positions:** Based on their locations, I can then answer the
      question.


      A quick search shows Coppin State is in West Baltimore and Notre Dame of Maryland
      is in North Baltimore.  Generally, West Baltimore is west of North Baltimore.
