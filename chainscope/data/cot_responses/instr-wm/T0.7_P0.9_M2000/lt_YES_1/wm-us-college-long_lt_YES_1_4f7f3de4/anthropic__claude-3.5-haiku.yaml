      1. First, I''ll locate Heritage University in Washington state

      - Heritage University is located in Toppenish, Washington

      - Toppenish is in the southeastern part of Washington state


      2. Next, I''ll locate Madera Community College in California

      - Madera Community College is located in Madera, California

      - Madera is in central California


      3. Compare their geographical positions

      - Toppenish, WA is in eastern Washington

      - Madera, CA is in central California

      - Looking at a map, Madera, CA is actually east of Toppenish, WA


      4. So if Madera, CA is east of Toppenish, WA, then Toppenish, WA (where Heritage
      University is) is west of Madera, CA


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      VA


      4. Reasoning about their relative positions:

      - PennWest Clarion is not just west of Southern Virginia University, it is also
      north of it

      - The location of PennWest Clarion is northwest of Southern Virginia University


      5. Conclusion:

      - Since PennWest Clarion is indeed west of Southern Virginia University, the
      answer is YES.

      1. First, I''ll locate Woodbury University in California

      - Woodbury University is located in Burbank, CA, which is in the San Fernando
      Valley northwest of downtown Los Angeles


      2. Next, I''ll locate Los Angeles Recording School

      - Los Angeles Recording School is located in Hollywood, which is in Los Angeles
      proper


      3. Comparing their geographic locations

      - Burbank (where Woodbury University is) is northwest of Hollywood (where Los
      Angeles Recording School is)

      - Being northwest means it is west of the other location


      4. Therefore, Woodbury University is west of Los Angeles Recording School

      4. The question asks: "Is Furman University, SC located west of Marshall University,
      WV?"

      - Since Furman University is east of Marshall University, it is NOT west of
      Marshall University


      Therefore, the answer is:


      NO'

      1. First, I''ll confirm that Eastern Michigan University and its College of
      Health and Human Services are located in the same place (Ypsilanti, Michigan).


      2. Since they are at the same location, they cannot be west or east of each
      other.


      3. Therefore, the question cannot be answered with a simple "Yes" or "No" as
      stated.


      However, the instructions require a YES or NO answer. In this case, the most
      appropriate response is:


      NO

    dc83f374-71e3-4a67-b795-5777df1c1ac7: 'Let''s solve this step by step:

      University relative to its College of Health and Human Services.


      2. Eastern Michigan University and its College of Health and Human Services
      are both located in Ypsilanti, Michigan.


      3. In fact, they are located on the same campus.


      4. This means they are essentially at the same location, so neither is truly
      "west" or "east" of the other.


      5. However, the question specifically asks if the university is west of the
      college.

      west of the college.

      2. The question is asking whether the main campus of Eastern Michigan University
      is located west of its College of Health and Human Services.

      positioning is likely very close.

      6. But given the context of a campus layout, it''s most likely that different
      buildings and colleges are located near each other.
