      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Apple
      University and California South Bay University. Apple University is not a traditional
      university but rather an internal training program for Apple Inc. employees,
      located in Cupertino, California. California South Bay University does not seem
      to be a recognized or accredited institution in the traditional sense, but for
      the sake of this question, let''s consider "South Bay" as referring to the southern
      part of the San Francisco Bay Area, which includes cities like San Jose and
      areas around it.


      2. **Geographical Context**: The South Bay area of California refers to the
      southern portion of the San Francisco Bay Area, which includes cities like Mountain
      View, Sunnyvale, and San Jose. Cupertino, where Apple University is located,
      is also within the larger Silicon Valley area but is more specifically situated
      in the western part of the Santa Clara Valley, which is part of the South Bay
      area.


      3. **Comparative Location**: Since both Apple University (in Cupertino) and
      the general area of the South Bay (which includes Cupertino) are in the same
      broader geographical area, the question essentially asks if Cupertino is west
      of the South Bay area. The South Bay is a large area that includes Cupertino,
      so Cupertino is not west of the South Bay; it is within it.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the information and the understanding that both are
      essentially within the same general area (the South Bay being a broader region
      that encompasses Cupertino), the question seems to be based on a misunderstanding
      of the locations. However, if we interpret "California South Bay University"
      as being anywhere in the South Bay area, then Apple University in Cupertino
      would not be west of the entire South Bay area but rather within it.


      Based on these steps and interpretations, the answer to whether Apple University
      is located west of California South Bay University (considering the geographical
      context provided) would be **NO**, because Apple University is within the South
      Bay area, not west of it.'
    7dba376d-6770-4bc8-bc7b-01c4d468e7f8: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step.


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to understand the locations involved.
      "Apple University" is not a traditional university in the sense of an educational
      institution like Harvard or Stanford. Apple University is actually the name
      given to Apple Inc.''s internal training program for its employees, located
      at the company''s headquarters in Cupertino, California.


      2. **California South Bay University**: There isn''t a well-known or accredited
      university by the name "California South Bay University" in the public domain
      or in lists of recognized universities in California. However, the term "South
      Bay" refers to a region in the San Francisco Bay Area, which includes parts
      of Santa Clara County and San Mateo County. This region is home to several universities
      and colleges but not specifically one named "California South Bay University."


      3. **Location of Apple University**: Given that Apple University is in Cupertino,
      which is in the heart of Silicon Valley and considered part of the San Jose-San
      Francisco-Oakland, CA Combined Statistical Area, it is indeed in the greater
      Bay Area.


      4. **Comparative Location**: Without an exact location for "California South
      Bay University" since it doesn''t appear to be a real institution, we can''t
      directly compare. However, if we consider the "South Bay" area as the reference
      point, Cupertino (where Apple University is located) is also within the broader
      South Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area.


      5. **West of**: Since both locations are essentially within the same general
      area (the South Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area), determining if one is west
      of the other requires precise locations. Cupertino, where Apple''s headquarters
      (and thus Apple University) is located, is not significantly west of the general
      South Bay area, as it is part of it.


      Given the confusion and the fact that "California South Bay University" does
      not seem to be a real university, the question''s premise is flawed. However,
      assuming the intent was to compare locations within the South Bay area or considering
      Cupertino''s location within the South Bay, Apple University would not be west
      of the South Bay in a meaningful sense, as it is part of the South Bay.


      **YES / NO Answer**: Given the above reasoning and the fact that "California
      South Bay University" is not a recognized institution, providing a definitive
      yes or no is challenging. However, based on the understanding that both are
      essentially within the same region (if we were to hypothetically place "California
      South Bay University" somewhere in the South Bay), the answer would lean towards
      **NO**, as Apple University is not west of the general South Bay area but rather

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Apple University and California South Bay University. Apple University is known
      to be located in Cupertino, California, which is in the Silicon Valley area,
      near the San Francisco Bay. California South Bay University doesn''t appear
      to be a real university with a widely recognized location, which could imply
      it''s either a fictional institution or not well-known under this name. However,
      assuming it might be referring to an institution in the South Bay area of the
      San Francisco Bay, this would still place it relatively close to Cupertino but
      potentially to the east or south, depending on the exact location within the
      South Bay.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Given Cupertino''s location (where
      Apple University is) and assuming California South Bay University is somewhere
      in the South Bay area, we would then determine the geographic relationship.
      The South Bay includes areas like San Jose, which is east of Cupertino. If California
      South Bay University were in San Jose or another part of the South Bay, it would
      likely be east or southeast of Cupertino, not west.


      3. **Consider the Question''s Premise**: The question asks if Apple University
      is west of California South Bay University. Given that Apple University is in
      Cupertino and considering the likely location of California South Bay University
      (if it were real and in the South Bay area), Apple University would not be west
      of it but rather north or northwest, depending on the exact location of the
      hypothetical California South Bay University.


      4. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Since Apple University is
      in Cupertino, and if California South Bay University were in the South Bay area
      (east or southeast of Cupertino), Apple University would not be west of California
      South Bay University. The premise of the question relies on the existence and

    d2293880-9bff-46fa-8cb4-e33b83fc3f35: 'To answer this question, we need to follow
      these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to understand the locations of
      both Apple University and California South Bay University. Apple University
      is not a traditional university but rather an internal training program for
      Apple Inc. employees, located at the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California.
      California South Bay University does not appear to be a recognized or accredited
      institution in the traditional sense, but for the sake of this question, let''s
      consider "South Bay" as referring to the Southern part of the San Francisco
      Bay Area, which includes areas like San Jose and parts of Silicon Valley.


      2. **Determine geographical positions**: Cupertino, where Apple University is
      located, is in the northern part of the Silicon Valley, within the San Francisco
      Bay Area. The "South Bay" area, as mentioned, refers to the southern part of
      the Bay Area, including cities like San Jose, which is south of Cupertino.


      3. **Compare locations**: Since Cupertino (Apple University) is north of the
      general area considered the "South Bay" (which would include areas like San
      Jose), it means that Apple University is not located west of California South
      Bay University but rather north of it, assuming California South Bay University
      is considered to be in the southern part of the Bay Area.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical analysis, Apple University (in
      Cupertino) is not west of the area that would be considered the location of
      a hypothetical California South Bay University (in the South Bay area of the
      San Francisco Bay). Therefore, the answer to the question of whether Apple University,
      CA is located west of California South Bay University, CA is **NO**.'
    dae66387-141b-4dd6-a028-9d9b4574ea64: 'To answer this question, we need to consider
      the locations of both institutions.


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify where Apple University
      and California South Bay University are located. Apple University is not a traditional
      university but rather an internal training program for Apple Inc. employees,
      and it''s based in Cupertino, California, which is in the San Francisco Bay
      Area, but more specifically, it''s in the South Bay region of the San Francisco
      Bay Area.


      2. **California South Bay University**: There isn''t a well-known university
      by the exact name "California South Bay University." However, given the context,
      it seems to refer to a university located in the South Bay area of California.
      The South Bay refers to the southern portion of the San Francisco Bay Area and
      includes cities like San Jose, Sunnyvale, and Santa Clara.


      3. **Determine the relative locations**: Since Apple University (or its equivalent,
      considering it as part of Apple''s operations in Cupertino) is in Cupertino,
      and if we consider California South Bay University to be in the broader South
      Bay area, Cupertino itself is within the South Bay region. This means both are
      essentially in the same general area, the South Bay of the San Francisco Bay
      Area.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that both are in the South Bay area of California,
      it''s not possible for one to be significantly west of the other in a way that
      would apply to a comparison across different regions of California. However,
      considering the exact question and the fact that Cupertino (where Apple is based)
      and other parts of the South Bay like San Jose or areas further south are all
      within the same general region, the question seems to be asking for a comparison
      within a relatively small geographic area.


      Therefore, considering the spirit of the question and the fact that both institutions
      are essentially in the same region (South Bay), the concept of one being "west"
      of the other in a statewide or regional context doesn''t apply as it would if
      comparing locations across different parts of California.


      Given this analysis, the answer to whether Apple University is located west
      of California South Bay University, considering the intent might be to understand
      their relative positions within the same general area, would be **NO**, as they
      are not in distinctly different locations that would make one clearly west of
      the other in a broader geographic sense.'
    f32e9c4c-68b0-44b8-8cf9-6f8c77135ffd: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Apple University and California South Bay University. Apple University is not
      a traditional university but rather an internal training program for Apple Inc.
      employees, and it''s located at Apple''s headquarters in Cupertino, California.
      California South Bay University doesn''t seem to be a recognized or accredited
      institution by standard academic directories, so we''ll assume it''s a fictional
      or non-standard institution for the sake of this exercise. However, the "South
      Bay" refers to a region in the San Francisco Bay Area, which includes parts
      of Santa Clara County and San Mateo County, where Cupertino (and thus Apple
      University) is also located.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Since both are in the same general
      area (the South Bay), we need to consider their exact locations. Cupertino,
      where Apple University is, is located west of the general area considered the
      "South Bay" if we''re considering the South Bay as a whole region that includes
      parts of San Jose and areas east of Cupertino. However, without a specific location
      for "California South Bay University," we can only consider the general area.
      Given that Cupertino is within the South Bay area, it''s not definitively west
      of the entire South Bay region but rather within it.


      3. **Conclusion**: Without a precise location for California South Bay University
      and considering Apple University''s location within Cupertino, it''s challenging
      to definitively say Apple University is west of California South Bay University,
      especially since Apple University is already within the broader South Bay area.


      Given the information and the steps considered, the answer to whether Apple
      University, CA is located west of California South Bay University, CA would
      be: **NO**. This conclusion is based on the understanding that Apple University
      is within the South Bay area, and without specific details on California South
      Bay University''s location, we cannot accurately place one as being west of
      the other in a way that would be geographically meaningful.'

      \ are in Arizona. To determine if one is west of the other, we need to consider\

    2d017ae1-c31a-459f-a61c-5f75565d9feb: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into the necessary steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Northcentral University and Wilkes University. Northcentral University is based
      in Arizona (AZ), and Wilkes University has a location in Mesa, Arizona.


      2. **Geographical Context**: Next, we need to understand the geographical context.
      Arizona is a state in the southwestern United States. Mesa is a city within
      Arizona.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Since both universities are mentioned with Arizona
      as their state, the question essentially asks us to compare their relative positions
      within Arizona, not across different states.


      4. **Specific Locations**: Northcentral University is based in San Diego, California,
      but it has an online presence and was previously headquartered in Arizona (specifically,
      in Prescott, AZ, before moving its headquarters). However, for the sake of this
      question, let''s consider it as associated with Arizona. Wilkes University,
      on the other hand, has a location in Mesa, AZ.


      5. **Comparison**: Given that both are in Arizona, to determine if Northcentral
      University is west of Wilkes University in Mesa, we need to consider the geography
      of Arizona. Prescott, where Northcentral University was previously based, is
      northwest of Mesa.


      6. **Conclusion**: Considering Prescott (as a reference point for Northcentral
      University''s historical Arizona presence) is northwest of Mesa (where Wilkes
      University is located), and given that "west" encompasses a broad direction
      that includes northwest, we can conclude that Northcentral University, in its
      historical Arizona context, is indeed west (or more specifically northwest)
      of Wilkes University in Mesa, AZ.

    ffe2a711-eeeb-45b2-aae9-9bf78a4b15a0: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Northcentral University and Wilkes University in relation to each other. Northcentral
      University is based in Arizona (AZ), and Wilkes University has a location in
      Mesa, AZ.


      2. **Understand Geographical Positions**: Since both universities are mentioned
      with "AZ" (Arizona), we can infer that both are located within the state of
      Arizona. The key is understanding their relative positions within the state.


      3. **Mesa, AZ**: Wilkes University''s location in Mesa, AZ, gives us a specific
      city to consider. Mesa is a city located in the eastern part of the Phoenix
      metropolitan area.


      4. **Northcentral University, AZ**: Northcentral University is headquartered
      in San Diego, California, but it also has a presence in Arizona. However, the
      primary location and headquarters are in California, not Arizona. For the sake
      of this question and assuming it refers to any Arizona operations or considering
      a hypothetical Arizona main location, we would still compare it to Mesa, AZ.


      5. **Relative Positions**: Without the exact location of Northcentral University''s
      operations in Arizona (assuming it has any), we can''t directly compare. However,
      considering the question might imply a comparison based on the state level or
      assuming Northcentral has a significant presence in Arizona (which might not
      be the case), we must rely on the general geography of Arizona.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given that Mesa, AZ, is in the eastern part of the Phoenix
      area, for Northcentral University (or its operations) to be west of Wilkes University
      in Mesa, AZ, it would need to be located west of Mesa within Arizona. Without
      specific details on Northcentral University''s Arizona location, the question
      simplifies to understanding that if Northcentral University has any presence
      in Arizona, being "west" would mean being in the western part of the state relative
      to Mesa.


      However, considering Northcentral University''s main operations are actually
      based in California, which is west of Arizona, and not specifically within Arizona,
      this introduces confusion. The question seems to imply a comparison within Arizona.
      If we strictly interpret the question as asking about locations within Arizona,
      without knowing the exact location of Northcentral University within the state
      (if it has one), we cannot definitively say. But considering the spirit of the
      question and typical geographical comparisons, the answer hinges on understanding
      the relative positions within Arizona or considering the broader geographical
      context.


      Given the potential for misunderstanding based on the actual location of Northcentral
      University''s main campus (California) and the question''s framing, the most
      direct interpretation based on typical geographical comparisons would consider
      the main locations or the general understanding of "west" in a state context.
      But since the question specifically mentions "AZ" for both, implying an in-state
      comparison, and without clear evidence of Northcentral''s specific location
      within Arizona, the question''s premise may be flawed or based on incorrect
      assumptions about the universities'' locations.


      **Answer**: Given the complexities and potential inaccuracies in the question''s
      premise, and focusing strictly on the information provided and typical geographical
      interpretations, a definitive YES or NO answer requires clarification on Northcentral

    52e49a82-53a2-4700-a33c-38599dd8091d: 'To answer this question, let''s analyze
      the locations step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We have two colleges to consider - Northeastern
      Baptist College in Vermont (VT) and the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut
      (CT).


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: West means a location is to the left
      when facing north on a map. Therefore, to determine if Northeastern Baptist
      College is west of the University of Bridgeport, we need to consider their relative
      positions on a map.


      3. **Consider state locations**: Vermont (VT) is located north of Connecticut
      (CT) in the northeastern United States.


      4. **Specific college locations**: Although the exact addresses aren''t provided,
      knowing that Northeastern Baptist College is in Vermont and the University of
      Bridgeport is in Connecticut gives us enough information for a general comparison.
      Typically, locations in Vermont are north and slightly east of locations in
      Connecticut due to the states'' positions.


      5. **Comparison**: Given Vermont''s position north and slightly east of Connecticut,
      it''s unlikely that a college in Vermont would be directly west of a college
      in Connecticut. However, the question specifically asks about being "west of,"
      which requires considering the longitudinal positions (east-west positioning)
      rather than just the north-south positioning.


      6. **Longitudinal comparison**: Connecticut is generally east of Vermont when
      considering their longitudinal positions. This means that a location in Vermont
      would typically be west of a location in Connecticut, given the east-west line
      of comparison.


      7. **Conclusion**: Given that Vermont is generally west of Connecticut in terms
      of longitudinal positioning, it''s reasonable to conclude that Northeastern
      Baptist College in Vermont is indeed west of the University of Bridgeport in
      Connecticut.


      The final answer is: **YES**'

    3b497f90-dfb6-456f-b19f-16389cec9670: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology (MSPP) and
      Newton College of the Sacred Heart (NCSH), and then compare their positions
      relative to each other, specifically in terms of east-west orientation.


      1. **Identify the location of Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology
      (MSPP):** MSPP is located in Newton, Massachusetts. Newton is a city in Middlesex
      County, Massachusetts, and it is part of the Greater Boston Area.


      2. **Identify the location of Newton College of the Sacred Heart (NCSH):** NCSH
      was also located in Newton, Massachusetts. It''s known that NCSH merged with
      Boston College in 1974, but historically, it was situated in Newton.


      3. **Determine the relative locations:** Since both institutions are in Newton,
      Massachusetts, their east-west positioning relative to each other depends on
      their specific addresses within Newton. However, without exact addresses, we
      can consider the general layout of Newton and any historical information about
      the colleges'' locations.


      4. **Consider historical context and geography:** Newton is not a large city,
      and both institutions being in Newton suggests their locations are relatively
      close to each other. However, to determine if one is west of the other, we need
      specific locations or historical placements.


      5. **Conclusion based on available data:** Without exact addresses or a detailed
      map showing the precise locations of MSPP and the historical location of NCSH
      within Newton, it''s challenging to definitively say which one is west of the
      other. However, since both are in Newton and considering the question asks for
      a yes or no answer, we must consider if there''s any information that might
      sway the answer one way or the other.


      Given the lack of specific information on their relative east-west positions
      within Newton and acknowledging that the question requires a definitive yes
      or no answer, we should consider the general possibility based on their shared
      location in Newton. If MSPP and the historical location of NCSH are both in
      Newton, without more specific information, we cannot accurately determine their
      relative east-west positions. However, the question''s nature implies we should
      attempt a reasoned guess based on available data, which might not be fully accurate
      without more detailed location information.


      Given this, and considering the need for a definitive answer without access
      to detailed maps or specific addresses at this moment, the most straightforward
      approach is to acknowledge the question''s requirement for a yes or no answer
      and provide a response based on the information that both institutions are located
      in Newton, Massachusetts, implying proximity but not necessarily providing a
      clear indication of which is west of the other without more detailed geographical
      information.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{YES}$'

      Virginia, on the campus of the University of Virginia. The International Residential
      College is also a part of the University of Virginia.


      2. **Campus Map**: To understand the relative positions, we would ideally consult
      a map of the University of Virginia''s campus. However, without access to a
      specific map at this moment, we can rely on general knowledge about the campus
      layout.


      3. **Relative Positions**: The University of Virginia Center for Politics is

      northwest part of the campus. The International Residential College, on the
      other hand, is situated on the grounds of the historic Lambeth estate, near
      the northwest part of the campus as well but closer to the western edge.

      campus.


      4. **Relative Locations**: Without exact addresses or a detailed map, determining
      the precise locations of these two entities relative to each other (east-west
      orientation) can be challenging. However, considering that both are part of
      UVA and likely located on or very near the main campus, their locations are
      probably relatively close to each other.


      5. **Charlottesville Geography**: Charlottesville, VA, where UVA is located,
      is situated in the eastern part of the United States, but when considering locations
      within the city or the university campus, east-west distinctions are more about
      local geography than overall national or regional orientation.


      6. **Final Consideration**: Given the lack of specific information on the exact
      locations of these two entities within the university and assuming they are
      both on the main campus, it''s difficult to definitively say which is west of
      the other without more detailed geographical information.


      However, since I need to provide a YES or NO answer based on the information
      given and typical campus layouts (where specific building locations can vary
      and are not always publicly detailed in relation to each other in a way that''s
      easily accessible), I will proceed with the understanding that without explicit
      location details, this question leans towards a guess.


      Given the nature of the question and the steps outlined, and acknowledging that
      I don''t have real-time or detailed campus maps to reference the exact locations
      of these entities relative to each other, the answer would typically require
      specific knowledge of the UVA campus layout that isn''t provided here.


      Therefore, based on the process and the need for a definitive YES or NO without
      further information:


      NO'

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations of
      both the University of Virginia Center for Politics and the International Residential
      College within the context of the University of Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville,

      3. **International Residential College Location**: The International Residential
      College (IRC) is also on the UVA Grounds. The IRC is known to be located on
      the West Grounds of the University of Virginia.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Knowing that the IRC is on the West Grounds gives
      us a clue about its relative position. If the Center for Politics is in the

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: The University of Virginia Center for Politics
      and the International Residential College are both located in Virginia, but
      we need to determine their specific locations relative to each other.


      2. **Understand the geography of the University of Virginia (UVA)**: UVA is
      located in Charlottesville, Virginia. The university''s main campus is situated
      on the west side of Charlottesville, with various facilities and colleges spread
      around the area.


      3. **Determine the location of the University of Virginia Center for Politics**:
      The Center for Politics is based at the University of Virginia and is known
      for its nonpartisan analysis and civic education efforts. Without specific details
      on its exact location within the university, we can assume it''s likely situated
      on or near the main campus in Charlottesville.


      4. **Determine the location of the International Residential College (IRC)**:
      The IRC is a residential college at the University of Virginia designed to foster
      a global community. It is located on the university''s grounds but specifically
      where in relation to other buildings or centers requires more detailed information.


      5. **Consider the directional layout of UVA**: Charlottesville and the UVA campus
      are generally laid out with the main campus to the west of the city''s downtown
      area. However, without precise locations for both the Center for Politics and
      the IRC, determining if one is west of the other requires specific knowledge
      of their positions on the campus map.


      6. **Research or knowledge of UVA campus map**: To give a definitive answer,
      one would ideally need to consult a detailed map of the University of Virginia''s
      campus to understand the relative positions of the Center for Politics and the
      International Residential College.


      Since I don''t have access to real-time or the most current maps and specific
      details about the exact locations of these entities on the UVA campus, I must
      consider general geographical knowledge and the layout of the university.


      Given the lack of specific information about the relative east-west positions
      of the University of Virginia Center for Politics and the International Residential
      College within the university''s campus, and without current, detailed mapping
      data, the question poses a challenge. However, considering that both are part
      of the University of Virginia and likely within a relatively compact area, the
      question seems to hinge on very specific spatial relationships that are not
      universally known without consulting a detailed campus map.


      Therefore, based on general knowledge and without specific details on their
      locations relative to each other, the most informed answer I can provide, given
      the constraints, would be speculative. But, to adhere to the request for a YES

      west of State University of New York at Purchase, NY, we need to consider the
      geographical locations of both institutions.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we identify the locations. Mildred Elley has
      campuses in New York State, including one in Albany. State University of New
      York at Purchase (SUNY Purchase) is located in Purchase, New York.


      2. **Geographical Reference**: Next, we need a geographical reference point.
      Albany, where Mildred Elley is located, is in the eastern part of New York State,
      near the Hudson River. Purchase, New York, where SUNY Purchase is located, is
      also near the Hudson River but is situated in Westchester County, which is south
      of Albany and closer to New York City.


      3. **Determine Direction**: To determine the direction from SUNY Purchase to
      Mildred Elley in Albany, we consider that Albany is north and slightly west
      of Purchase, New York. However, the primary difference in their locations is
      more north-south than east-west, given the layout of New York State.


      4. **Conclusion**: Considering the geographical layout and the fact that Albany
      is generally north of Purchase, NY, but also slightly west, we must determine
      if the westward direction is significant enough to classify Mildred Elley as
      being west of SUNY Purchase. Given that the difference in their locations is
      more pronounced in the north-south axis, the question hinges on whether the
      slight western difference is enough to categorize one as west of the other.


      Given the steps and considering typical geographical interpretations, the answer
      would be based on whether the slight westward position of Albany relative to
      Purchase is considered significant enough for this classification.

      within California or considering the general area of operation for Apollos University
      in relation to California institutions.


      3. **City of Hope Location**: City of Hope Graduate School of Biological Sciences
      is in Duarte, California, which is in Los Angeles County.


      4. **Comparison**: Since Apollos University''s main operations are not physically
      based in California (despite the question''s premise), and assuming we are to
      consider its operational scope or a hypothetical California location for the
      sake of argument, we must determine if this hypothetical location or its general
      area of online operation is west of Duarte, California.


      5. **Geographical Orientation**: Duarte, California, is located in the western
      United States, in the state of California. Given the state''s geography, locations
      can be either north, south, east, or west of Duarte within the state. However,
      since Apollos University is actually based in Montana and offers online programs,
      it doesn''t have a specific California location to compare directly.


      Given these steps and the misunderstanding about Apollos University''s location,
      the question''s premise seems flawed. However, if we were to humor the scenario
      and consider "west" in a broad, geographical sense within California or relative
      to California institutions, the answer would depend on the specific location
      within California we''re comparing to Duarte. But since Apollos University is
      not physically located in California, and for the sake of providing a clear
      answer:


      The final answer is: **NO**'

      \ To determine if Apollos University is west of City of Hope Graduate School\

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of California
      Maritime Academy (CA) and Patten University (CA). California Maritime Academy
      is located in Vallejo, California. Patten University is located in Oakland,
      California.


      2. **Determine the relative positions**: Next, we need to determine the relative
      positions of these two locations. Vallejo is generally north and slightly east
      of Oakland, but when considering "west" as the criterion, we focus on the longitudinal
      aspect. Both cities are relatively close in terms of longitude, but Vallejo
      is slightly west or very close in longitudinal position compared to Oakland.


      3. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical positions of California Maritime
      Academy in Vallejo and Patten University in Oakland, considering the question
      asks if California Maritime Academy is located west of Patten University, the
      answer is yes because Vallejo is indeed west or at least not significantly east
      of Oakland in a broad geographical sense.


      The final answer is: YES'

      2. **California Maritime Academy Location**: California Maritime Academy is
      located in Vallejo, California. Vallejo is situated in the northern part of
      the San Francisco Bay Area.


      3. **Patten University Location**: Patten University is located in Oakland,
      California. Oakland is also in the San Francisco Bay Area but is situated on
      the eastern shore of the Bay, relatively close to Vallejo.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Both institutions are in the San Francisco Bay Area,
      but their relative positions need to be considered in terms of east-west orientation.
      Vallejo (Cal Maritime) is north of Oakland (Patten University) but also slightly
      west due to the geography of the Bay Area.


      5. **Determine East-West Orientation**: Given the geography of the San Francisco
      Bay, locations on the western side of the Bay are generally considered "west"
      of locations on the eastern side. Since Vallejo (where Cal Maritime is located)
      is on the northwestern side of the Bay and Oakland (where Patten University
      is located) is on the eastern side of the Bay, Vallejo is indeed west of Oakland.


      Based on these steps, the conclusion is:

    c04a5047-b44f-4135-a735-a1f08e1dafde: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of California Coast University and Rancho Santiago Community College
      District and then compare their positions relative to each other.


      1. **Identify the location of California Coast University (CCU):** California
      Coast University is located in Santa Ana, California. Although it''s an online
      university, its administrative headquarters are in Santa Ana.


      2. **Identify the location of Rancho Santiago Community College District (RSCCD):**
      The Rancho Santiago Community College District is also located in Orange County,
      California, with its main colleges, Santa Ana College and Santiago Canyon College,
      both situated in the city of Santa Ana and Orange, respectively.


      3. **Determine the relative locations:** Since both institutions are essentially
      in the same general area (Santa Ana), we must consider their exact positions.
      However, given that they are both in the same city or very close, the question
      of which is west might depend on their exact addresses rather than their city
      locations.


      4. **Conclusion:** Considering that both institutions are in essentially the
      same area (with California Coast University and parts of the Rancho Santiago
      Community College District being in Santa Ana), the question might seem to require
      precise geographical coordinates for an accurate answer. However, since the
      question asks for a simple yes or no regarding whether California Coast University
      is west of Rancho Santiago Community College District, and given the close proximity
      of these institutions, without exact addresses or coordinates, one might initially
      think this is a tricky question. But, knowing that Santa Ana College (part of
      RSCCD) is in the heart of Santa Ana and considering the general layout of the
      area, if California Coast University is also in Santa Ana, it''s not definitively
      west without more specific location data.


      However, given the spirit of the question and the need for a definitive answer,
      we should recognize that both institutions are so close geographically (in the
      same city or very nearby) that the question seems to be testing understanding
      of the relative positions of these institutions. But, without more precise location
      information (like exact street addresses or GPS coordinates), the most straightforward
      approach is to consider their general locations.


      Given the close proximity and assuming no significant difference in their east-west
      positioning within the same general area (Santa Ana), one might lean towards
      a "no" due to the lack of clear evidence that CCU is definitively west of RSCCD,
      considering their shared general location.

      the locations of Hartford International University for Religion and Peace (CT)
      and Vermont Studio Center (VT) in relation to each other, specifically considering
      their east-west positioning.


      1. **Identify the location of Hartford International University for Religion
      and Peace**: This university is located in Connecticut (CT). Connecticut is
      a state in the northeastern United States.


      2. **Identify the location of Vermont Studio Center**: This center is located
      in Vermont (VT). Vermont is also a state in the northeastern United States,
      situated north of Connecticut.


      3. **Compare their east-west positions**: To determine if Hartford International
      University for Religion and Peace (CT) is west of Vermont Studio Center (VT),
      we need to consider the general geography of the northeastern United States.
      Vermont is directly north of Connecticut, but in terms of east-west positioning,
      Vermont is generally east of or directly north (not significantly west) of Connecticut.


      Given these considerations, since Connecticut (where Hartford International
      University for Religion and Peace is located) is generally south and slightly
      west or directly south of Vermont (where Vermont Studio Center is located),
      but not significantly west in a way that would place it clearly west of Vermont,
      we must conclude based on typical geographical understandings.


      However, it''s essential to note that "west of" in geographical terms usually
      refers to a direct westward direction. Given the north-south alignment of these
      states, Connecticut is more accurately described as being south of Vermont rather
      than west. But considering the question''s framing, which asks for a straightforward
      YES or NO regarding the east-west relationship without accounting for the north-south
      aspect, we simplify our answer based on direct comparison.


      Considering the direct line and geographical relationship, Hartford, CT, would
      generally be southwest of Vermont locations, making it not directly west but
      rather south and slightly west. However, the question simplifies to a basic
      directional query without considering the nuanced north-south relationship.

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to know the locations of Lincoln College,
      IL, and Lincoln Christian University, IL.


      2. **Lincoln College, IL Location**: Lincoln College is located in Lincoln,
      Illinois. Lincoln, Illinois, is situated in the central part of the state.


      3. **Lincoln Christian University, IL Location**: Lincoln Christian University
      is also located in Lincoln, Illinois, which means it is in the same city as
      Lincoln College.


      4. **Determine Direction**: Since both institutions are in Lincoln, Illinois,
      they are essentially in the same location in terms of city. However, to determine
      if one is west of the other, we need to consider their exact addresses or positions
      within the city.


      5. **Conclusion**: Without the exact addresses or a detailed map showing their
      relative positions within Lincoln, Illinois, it''s challenging to definitively
      say which one is west of the other based solely on the information given. However,
      considering typical college campus layouts and the fact that they share the
      same city, if there''s any difference, it would likely be minor and dependent
      on the specific locations within Lincoln.


      Given the shared city and without further detail on their exact locations within
      Lincoln, the most accurate answer based on the information provided would lean
      towards "NO" because they are in the same city, implying their locations are
      not significantly different in terms of cardinal directions like west. However,
      this answer assumes that the question is asking for a significant geographical
      difference, which might not be the case given their shared city.

      2. **Determine their geographical positions** relative to each other, specifically
      in terms of east-west orientation.


      **Step 1: Identify Locations**


      - **Georgian Court University** is located in Lakewood, New Jersey.

      - **William Paterson University** is located in Wayne, New Jersey.


      **Step 2: Determine Geographical Positions**


      To understand if GCU is west of WPU, we need to know the general geography of
      New Jersey. New Jersey is a state in the northeastern United States, and its
      geography can be somewhat complex due to its small size and irregular shape.
      However, for the purpose of this question, we''re focusing on the relative east-west
      positions of two locations within the state.


      - **Lakewood, NJ (GCU)** is situated in Ocean County, which is towards the eastern
      part of New Jersey, closer to the Atlantic coast.

      - **Wayne, NJ (WPU)** is located in Passaic County, which is more towards the
      northern part of the state but inland from the coast.


      Considering New Jersey''s layout, moving from the coast (east) towards the western
      parts of the state, we generally see that areas closer to the coast are more
      to the east, and as you move inland, you could be considered moving westward
      in a broad sense.


      Given these locations:

      - Lakewood (GCU) is near the coast and thus more to the east.

      - Wayne (WPU) is inland and more to the northwest of Lakewood.


      **Conclusion:**


      Based on the geographical positions, since Lakewood (where GCU is located) is
      more eastward compared to Wayne (where WPU is located), which is more inland
      and to the northwest, **Georgian Court University is NOT west of William Paterson
      University**.

      these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to identify the locations of the University
      of Georgia (UGA) and Franklin College of Arts and Sciences (FCAS). The University
      of Georgia is located in Athens, Georgia. Franklin College of Arts and Sciences
      is also located at the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia. It is a college
      within the University of Georgia.


      2. **Determine the relevance of "west of"**: The question asks if the University
      of Georgia is located west of Franklin College of Arts and Sciences. Given that
      both institutions are based in Athens, Georgia, and Franklin College of Arts
      and Sciences is a part of the University of Georgia, we''re essentially comparing
      the location of the university as a whole to one of its constituent colleges.


      3. **Conclusion based on location**: Since Franklin College of Arts and Sciences
      is a part of the University of Georgia and both are located in Athens, Georgia,
      it doesn''t make geographical sense to say the university is west of one of
      its colleges. The university and its college are in the same location, not separate
      entities that can be compared in terms of cardinal directions in this context.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to whether the University of Georgia is
      located west of Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, GA is **NO**.'
    ffe4abaa-f842-48a1-b4d1-009e1e13c3f6: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of University of Georgia and Franklin College of Arts and Sciences.


      1. **University of Georgia (UGA)**: This is a public research university located
      in Athens, Georgia. Athens is in the northeastern part of the state.


      2. **Franklin College of Arts and Sciences**: This is a college within the University
      of Georgia itself, also located in Athens, Georgia. It is one of the university''s
      schools and does not have a separate location from the University of Georgia.


      Given that both institutions are essentially located in the same place (Athens,
      Georgia), and considering the question asks if the University of Georgia is
      located west of Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, we must conclude based
      on their geographical positions relative to each other.


      Since they are in the same location, the concept of one being west of the other
      does not apply in the context of separate geographical locations. However, the
      question seems to be asking for a geographical comparison assuming they might
      be in different locations.


      Given the information and the nature of the question, the answer is **NO**,
      because they are not in separate locations that would allow for a "west of"
      comparison in the way the question implies. They are essentially in the same
      place, with Franklin College of Arts and Sciences being a part of the University
      of Georgia.'

      To answer this question, I''ll break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to understand the locations of
      both the University of West Los Angeles (UWLA) and Columbia College Hollywood
      (CCH). The University of West Los Angeles is located in Inglewood, California,
      which is in Los Angeles County. Columbia College Hollywood is located in Tarzana,
      California, also in Los Angeles County.


      2. **Determine the geographical relationship**: To determine if UWLA is west
      of CCH, we need to understand the geography of Los Angeles County. Generally,
      the city layout of Los Angeles and its surrounding areas is often described
      in terms of direction (north, south, east, west) from the city center or significant
      landmarks.


      3. **Compare locations**: Inglewood (where UWLA is located) is generally south
      and slightly west of the city center of Los Angeles. Tarzana (where CCH is located)
      is in the San Fernando Valley, which is north of the city center of Los Angeles.


      4. **Determine westward location**: Since Inglewood is south and slightly west
      of the central LA area, and Tarzana (San Fernando Valley) is more to the north,
      Inglewood would be southwest of Tarzana, not directly west.


      Based on these steps, considering the geographical layout and the relative positions
      of Inglewood and Tarzana, the University of West Los Angeles is not directly
      west of Columbia College Hollywood but rather southwest. However, since the
      question asks if UWLA is located west of CCH, and given that "west" can encompass
      a range of directions including southwest, the answer could be considered YES
      in a broad geographical sense, but it''s more accurate to say southwest. Given
      the constraints of the question format, the most straightforward interpretation
      would lean towards a YES, considering the general direction from Tarzana to
      Inglewood involves moving in a westerly direction, albeit not due west.

    5b4ad12b-25ec-4d2c-a95c-ebd8ec6dbe27: 'To determine if Washington State University
      Spokane, WA is located west of Gonzaga University, WA, we need to consider the
      geographical locations of both institutions within Spokane, Washington.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Both Washington State University Spokane and
      Gonzaga University are located in Spokane, Washington. This means we are comparing
      locations within the same city.


      2. **Understand the layout of Spokane**: Spokane is a city located in the eastern
      part of Washington State. The city''s layout and the specific locations of these
      universities within it will be crucial for determining their relative positions.


      3. **Gonzaga University''s location**: Gonzaga University is situated near the
      Spokane River, closer to the downtown area of Spokane. Its exact address is
      502 E Boone Ave, Spokane, WA 99258.


      4. **Washington State University Spokane''s location**: Washington State University
      Spokane, also known as WSU Spokane or WSU Health Sciences Spokane, is located
      in the University District of Spokane, near the intersection of Riverside Avenue
      and Spokane Falls Boulevard, but more specifically, its address is 412 E Spokane
      Falls Blvd, Spokane, WA 99202.


      5. **Compare the locations**: Given that both universities are in the same city
      and relatively close to each other, with Gonzaga being slightly more to the
      north and closer to the river, and WSU Spokane being in the University District,
      which might extend a bit further to the south or be more central, the key factor
      is their east-west positioning.


      6. **Determine east-west orientation**: Since both institutions are essentially
      in the central part of Spokane, with Gonzaga slightly north and WSU Spokane
      in the University District, which can be considered central or slightly south,
      the east-west distinction in this context might not significantly differ given
      the close proximity and the fact that they''re both serving the Spokane area
      without a notable east-west spread.


      However, considering the precise question of whether WSU Spokane is west of
      Gonzaga University, we must look at their exact locations:

      - Gonzaga University is at 502 E Boone Ave.

      - WSU Spokane is at 412 E Spokane Falls Blvd.


      Both addresses are on the east side of the Spokane River, given the "E" (for
      East) in their street addresses. The critical aspect to consider here is not
      necessarily their north-south alignment but their east-west positioning relative
      to each other. Given that both are in the eastern part of Spokane (as indicated
      by their "E" addresses), and without precise GPS coordinates or a detailed map
      showing their exact positions relative to each other in an east-west line, one
      might initially think this comparison could go either way based on minor differences
      in their central locations.


      However, knowing that both universities are essentially central and considering
      typical city layouts, the distinction comes down to their specific street locations.
      WSU Spokane, being in the University District, does not necessarily imply a
      significant westward positioning compared to Gonzaga''s location near the downtown
      area.


      Given this analysis, the crucial factor is recognizing that both institutions
      are relatively central and that the "west" designation in Spokane''s context
      refers to areas west of the river or significantly further west in the city,
      which is not the case here given their central, eastern locations.


      Therefore, considering the central and relatively close locations of both universities
      within Spokane, and given that the question hinges on a straightforward geographical
      comparison that might not fully account for the nuances of city layouts or the
      specific, potentially similar east-west alignments of central locations, the
      determination of "west" in this context might not accurately reflect a significant
      geographical difference between the two.

    92de07d7-f677-4eb2-846f-9f871b7968a7: 'To answer this question, let''s analyze
      the locations step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to determine the locations of Washington
      State University Spokane and Gonzaga University in relation to each other.


      2. **Gonzaga University Location**: Gonzaga University is located in Spokane,
      Washington. Specifically, its address is 502 E Boone Ave, Spokane, WA 99258.


      3. **Washington State University Spokane Location**: Washington State University
      has a campus in Spokane, known as WSU Spokane or Washington State University
      Spokane. Its address is 412 E Spokane Falls Blvd, Spokane, WA 99202.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Both institutions are located in Spokane, Washington.
      To determine if one is west of the other, we need to consider their geographical
      positions within the city.


      5. **Geographical Orientation**: Generally, in the city of Spokane, the area
      near the Spokane Falls (where WSU Spokane is located) is more central. Gonzaga
      University is situated a bit northwest of downtown Spokane but still within
      the city limits.


      6. **Relative Positions**: Given that both universities are in Spokane and relatively
      close to each other, the question of which one is west of the other can depend
      on the exact locations and how one defines "west" in the context of the city''s
      layout. However, considering typical city grid layouts, being "west" usually
      means being to the west on a map.


      7. **Final Analysis**: Gonzaga University (502 E Boone Ave) and WSU Spokane
      (412 E Spokane Falls Blvd) are both on the east side of the Spokane River, which
      runs through the city. The key is their relative east-west positioning. Since
      Gonzaga is slightly more north and potentially could be seen as west or northwest
      of WSU Spokane depending on the interpretation of their positions relative to
      the city''s grid and the river, a precise determination requires considering
      their exact geographical coordinates or a detailed map. However, for simplicity,
      we can consider their general locations within the city.


      Given this analysis, the answer to whether Washington State University Spokane
      is located west of Gonzaga University is based on their relative positions within
      Spokane. If WSU Spokane is more to the east or central part of the city compared
      to Gonzaga''s position, then it would not be west. Considering typical map orientations
      and without precise GPS coordinates for a definitive answer, we rely on the
      general understanding that both institutions are closely located within the
      city, with their positions relative to each other (east-west) dependent on the
      specific map or grid interpretation.

    8170fb65-0c33-417d-9210-471ff58f98ef: 'To answer this question, let''s analyze
      the locations step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to know the locations of Wentworth Institute
      of Technology (WIT) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), both in
      Massachusetts.


      2. **Location of MIT**: Massachusetts Institute of Technology is located in
      Cambridge, Massachusetts. Cambridge is situated just across the Charles River
      from Boston, essentially to the north and slightly west of downtown Boston but
      generally considered part of the Boston metropolitan area.


      3. **Location of WIT**: Wentworth Institute of Technology is located in Boston,
      Massachusetts. Specifically, it''s situated in the Fenway-Kenmore and Back Bay
      neighborhoods of Boston.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Since both institutions are in the Boston area,
      we need to determine their relative positions. Boston is generally considered
      to be east of Cambridge, given the Charles River''s flow into Boston Harbor
      to the east.


      5. **Determine if WIT is west of MIT**: Given that MIT is in Cambridge, which
      is generally northwest of Boston, and WIT is within Boston, we need to consider
      their exact positions relative to each other. However, considering the city
      layout and geography, WIT in Boston would likely be southeast or south of MIT
      in Cambridge.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the relative positions of Boston (where WIT is located)
      and Cambridge (where MIT is located), Wentworth Institute of Technology is not
      west of Massachusetts Institute of Technology; it''s more accurately described
      as being south or southeast.

      consider the locations of both institutions.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Wentworth Institute of Technology (WIT) is located
      in Boston, Massachusetts. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is also
      located in Boston, Massachusetts, specifically in Cambridge, which is part of
      the Boston metropolitan area but on the opposite side of the Charles River from
      where Wentworth is situated.


      2. **Understand the geography**: Boston and Cambridge are adjacent cities, with
      the Charles River forming part of the boundary between them. Cambridge, where
      MIT is located, is northwest of Boston''s city center but is generally considered
      to be part of the greater Boston area.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Since both institutions are in the
      Boston area, we need to consider their specific locations. Wentworth Institute
      of Technology is in the Fenway-Kenmore neighborhood of Boston, which is more
      central and southern compared to Cambridge. MIT is located in Cambridge, across
      the Charles River from Boston''s central areas.


      4. **Westward consideration**: The question asks if Wentworth is located west
      of MIT. Given that MIT is in Cambridge, which is generally north and slightly
      west of Boston''s central areas but definitely northwest of the Fenway-Kenmore
      area where Wentworth is, the critical aspect is the "west" direction in relation
      to MIT''s location.


      Considering these points, since Wentworth Institute of Technology is located
      in a part of Boston that is more southerly and somewhat easterly compared to
      MIT''s location in Cambridge, the answer to whether Wentworth is west of MIT
      would be **NO**.'

      3. **Determine Direction**: Without exact addresses or a map, we can consider
      that to be west of a location means to be situated in the direction of the setting
      sun relative to that location. In urban settings like Baltimore, this translates
      to comparing the street addresses or the general area of the city where each

    d07f61ce-c403-4323-8a43-c325ae20284e: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations** of both Coppin State University and Notre Dame
      of Maryland University.

      2. **Compare their locations** in relation to each other, specifically focusing
      on their longitudinal positions (east-west orientation).


      - **Coppin State University** is located in Baltimore, Maryland.

      - **Notre Dame of Maryland University** is also located in Baltimore, Maryland.


      Given that both universities are in the same city, the difference in their locations
      would be relatively small. However, to determine if one is west of the other,
      we need to look at their exact locations within Baltimore.


      - **Coppin State University** is situated at 2500 West North Avenue, Baltimore,
      MD 21216.

      - **Notre Dame of Maryland University** is located at 4701 North Charles Street,
      Baltimore, MD 21210.


      Now, let''s consider the general layout of Baltimore. North Charles Street and
      West North Avenue are both significant streets in Baltimore, but they run in
      different directions. North Charles Street runs north-south, and West North
      Avenue, as the name suggests, runs east-west.


      Given the addresses:

      - Coppin State University is on West North Avenue, which implies it is somewhat
      westward, considering the "West" in its address and the general geography of
      Baltimore.

      - Notre Dame of Maryland University is on North Charles Street, which does not
      inherently imply a western or eastern location without considering the street''s
      orientation and the university''s position relative to Coppin State.


      However, knowing Baltimore''s layout:

      - North Charles Street is more towards the north and slightly east of the central
      part of the city.

      - West North Avenue, where Coppin State is located, is indeed west of the central
      area of Baltimore but considering both universities are relatively close and
      in the same city, we must look at the specifics of their addresses.


      To determine the exact relationship, we can look at the map or consider the
      general directions:

      - Coppin State University (West North Avenue) is indeed located west of the
      area where Notre Dame of Maryland University (North Charles Street) is situated,
      given the geography of Baltimore and the fact that "West" North Avenue places
      Coppin State University to the west of the downtown area and likely west of
      North Charles Street''s position.


      **Conclusion**: Based on their locations within Baltimore, Maryland, Coppin
      State University is indeed located west of Notre Dame of Maryland University.


      The answer is: **YES**'
    ebeedd98-7367-4363-b818-8d7c2d7d4147: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Coppin
      State University and Notre Dame of Maryland University. Coppin State University
      is located in Baltimore, Maryland. Notre Dame of Maryland University is also
      located in Baltimore, Maryland.


      2. **Understand the geography of Baltimore, MD**: Baltimore is a city located
      in the state of Maryland. Understanding its layout, we know that it is situated
      in the northern part of the state, near the Chesapeake Bay.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Since both universities are in Baltimore,
      we need to determine their relative positions within the city to establish if
      one is west of the other.


      4. **Specific locations within Baltimore**: Coppin State University is situated
      in the northwest part of Baltimore. Notre Dame of Maryland University is located
      in the north part of the city, but more towards the center or slightly northeast
      compared to Coppin State.


      5. **Conclusion based on geography**: Given that Coppin State University is
      in the northwest part of Baltimore, and Notre Dame of Maryland University is
      more towards the north or northeast part of the city, Coppin State University
      would be considered west of Notre Dame of Maryland University.


      The final answer is: **YES**'

      institutions. OCOM is located in Portland, Oregon, and Marylhurst University
      was also located in Marylhurst, Oregon, just south of Portland.


      2. **Geographical Orientation**: Next, we need to understand the geographical
      layout. Portland, where OCOM is located, is generally situated in the northern
      part of the Oregon metropolitan area, while Marylhurst, the location of Marylhurst
      University, is south of Portland.


      3. **East-West Orientation**: Considering the east-west orientation, Portland
      (OCOM''s location) is west of the areas directly east of it but to determine
      its position relative to Marylhurst, we must consider their specific locations.
      Marylhurst University is located southwest of Portland, not directly east or
      west but rather in a southwest direction from Portland.

      \ \n   - Portland, where OCOM is located, is in the northern part of Oregon.\n\
      \   - Marylhurst, where Marylhurst University was located, is south of Portland.\n\
      \n5. **Determining Direction**: Since Portland (OCOM's location) is north of\
      \ Marylhurst (Marylhurst University's location), and considering the geography\
      \ of Oregon, Portland is west and slightly north of Marylhurst. However, the\
      \ key aspect here is whether OCOM is west of Marylhurst University.\n\nGiven\
      \ that Marylhurst is somewhat south and slightly east of Portland, the question\
      \ hinges on the relative east-west positioning rather than the north-south axis.\n\
      \n6. **Conclusion**: Portland, where OCOM is located, is generally west and\
      \ slightly north of Marylhurst. Therefore, considering the question's focus\
      \ on westward positioning, OCOM is indeed west of Marylhurst University.\n\n\
      The final answer is: **YES**"

      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know the exact locations of
      both Columbus Technical College and Columbus State University within Georgia.


      2. **Compare locations**: Once we have their locations, we can compare them
      to determine their relative positions, specifically whether Columbus Technical
      College is west of Columbus State University.


      3. **Geographical reference**: Knowing that Columbus, Georgia, is the city where
      both institutions are based, we can use the city''s layout as a reference. Typically,
      in the United States, streets and addresses are organized in a grid-like pattern,
      with east-west and north-south orientations. However, without specific addresses
      or a map, we rely on general knowledge about the area.


      4. **Institutional knowledge**: Columbus Technical College and Columbus State
      University are both in Columbus, Georgia. Columbus State University is located
      at 4225 University Ave, Columbus, GA 31907. Columbus Technical College''s main
      campus is at 928 Manchester Expy, Columbus, GA 31904.

      are on major expressways in Columbus. Manchester Expressway (where Columbus
      Technical College is located) and University Avenue (where Columbus State University
      is located) can give us clues about their relative positions.


      6. **Final determination**: Without a detailed map but knowing the general layout
      of U.S. cities and how addresses are structured, it''s challenging to give a
      definitive answer based solely on the addresses provided. However, considering
      the typical layout and assuming University Avenue runs somewhat east-west and
      Manchester Expressway north-south (though this can vary), we would still need
      to check a map to confirm their exact positions relative to each other.

      Florida State University School of Library & Information Studies and Florida
      State University College of Social Sciences. Both are part of Florida State
      University (FSU), which is located in Tallahassee, Florida.


      2. **Understand the geography of FSU**: FSU is a large university with various
      colleges and schools, but it''s primarily located in one area of Tallahassee.
      The specific buildings or locations of different colleges within the university
      can vary, but generally, they are not spread out over large distances.


      3. **Compare locations**: Without specific building addresses, we can''t determine
      the exact location of each school relative to the other. However, since both
      are part of FSU and located in Tallahassee, the question essentially asks if
      one part of the university is west of another part.


      4. **Consider the context of "west"**: Given that both entities are within the
      same university and likely in close proximity, the direction "west" becomes
      less relevant as it would be in comparing locations across a larger geographical
      area.


      5. **Conclusion based on available information**: Without specific addresses
      or a detailed map of the FSU campus showing the exact locations of the School
      of Library & Information Studies and the College of Social Sciences, we cannot
      definitively say which is west of the other. However, since the question requires
      a YES or NO answer, we must consider the likelihood based on typical university
      layouts.


      Given the lack of specific information about the relative positions of these
      two colleges within the FSU campus and considering that universities often have
      closely situated buildings, it''s reasonable to infer that determining which
      is west of the other might not be straightforward without more detailed information.
      However, for the purpose of this question, we must choose based on the assumption
      that such specific spatial relationships can be known.


      **YES or NO Answer**: Since both colleges are located within the same university
      and likely in a relatively small geographic area, and without specific information
      to the contrary, it''s not feasible to definitively answer this question based
      on the steps provided. However, acknowledging the requirement for a YES or NO
      answer, the most informed response, given the constraints, would lean towards
      the understanding that specific buildings within a university campus can indeed
      have directional relationships, but without explicit information, this becomes
      speculative.


      Given this, a speculative but necessary answer for the purpose of this exercise
      would be: **NO**. This answer is chosen with the understanding that without
      explicit spatial information, we''re making an educated guess based on the typical
      layout of university campuses and the potential proximity of the mentioned colleges.'
    5f0b5248-3b5d-4adc-aa54-dac2a7f431b0: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to understand that both the Florida
      State University School of Library & Information Studies and the Florida State
      University College of Social Sciences are part of Florida State University (FSU),
      which is located in Tallahassee, Florida.


      2. **Understand Campus Layout**: Typically, different colleges or schools within
      a university might be located in different buildings or areas of the campus,
      but they are generally within the same broader campus area unless specified
      otherwise.


      3. **Directional Analysis**: The question asks if the School of Library & Information
      Studies is located west of the College of Social Sciences. Without specific
      details on the exact locations of these schools within the FSU campus, one might
      assume that they could be in different parts of the campus. However, the question
      essentially asks for a spatial relationship (west of) that requires knowing
      the exact or relative locations of these two entities.


      4. **Consideration of Shared Campus**: Given that both are part of FSU and likely
      located on or near the main campus in Tallahassee, without specific building
      locations or a map, it''s challenging to definitively say one is west of the
      other. However, universities often have their colleges and schools in close
      proximity, and the directional difference (west) might not be significant enough
      to make a general assumption without more detailed information.


      5. **Final Consideration**: The question seems to imply a need for specific
      knowledge about the layout of FSU''s campus and the relative locations of its
      schools. Without access to a campus map or more detailed information about the
      specific locations of these schools, one cannot definitively answer the question
      based on general knowledge.


      However, since I need to provide a YES or NO answer and considering that both
      schools are likely within the same campus or very close to each other, making
      a definitive directional assessment without specific location data is challenging.
      But, for the sake of providing an answer based on the steps considered:


      The answer would have to be a guess without specific information. Given the
      nature of the question, I would lean towards "NO" because, typically, schools
      within a university are not described in relation to each other directionally
      unless there''s a significant distance involved, and even then, it''s more about
      the building or area name rather than directional relationship. But, this is
      a reasoned guess rather than a fact-based answer.


      ANSWER: NO'
    7f04166e-75ee-402c-8a86-c08edbd7b18c: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Both the Florida State University School of Library
      & Information Studies and the Florida State University College of Social Sciences
      are part of Florida State University (FSU), which is located in Tallahassee,
      Florida.


      2. **Understand the geography of FSU**: Florida State University has a main
      campus in Tallahassee. The specific locations of schools within the university
      can vary, but they are generally situated on or near the main campus.


      3. **Consider the directional question**: The question asks if the School of
      Library & Information Studies is located west of the College of Social Sciences.
      This requires knowing the relative positions of these two entities on the FSU
      campus.


      4. **Research or assumption**: Without specific information on the exact locations
      of the School of Library & Information Studies and the College of Social Sciences
      within FSU, one might assume they are relatively close, given they are part
      of the same university. However, the exact directional relationship (west, east,
      etc.) cannot be determined without more detailed information about their locations
      on campus.


      5. **Conclusion based on typical university layout**: Universities often have
      departments and colleges located in close proximity to each other, sometimes
      in the same building or adjacent buildings. Without specific information indicating
      otherwise, it''s reasonable to consider that these two entities could be located
      in such a way that one might be west of the other, depending on the campus layout.


      6. **Final consideration**: The question is asking for a definitive yes or no
      answer based on the premise of their locations relative to each other. Given
      that both are located within the same university and without specific details
      on their exact locations, the question seems to require an assumption about
      their relative positions.


      Given the steps and considering that both entities are part of the same university
      and likely located on or near the main campus in Tallahassee, Florida, the answer
      to whether the Florida State University School of Library & Information Studies
      is located west of the Florida State University College of Social Sciences would
      typically require more specific information about their locations. However,
      since the question demands a yes or no answer and implies a need for a direct
      response without the ability to clarify or seek additional information, the
      most straightforward approach based on the information given and typical university
      layouts would be to consider the possibility based on the layout of a typical
      university campus.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$'
    9809fdf4-484b-4712-8899-4b0816758caf: 'To answer this question, we need to consider
      the locations of the two entities mentioned: the Florida State University School
      of Library & Information Studies and the Florida State University College of
      Social Sciences, both located in Florida.


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify where these two entities
      are located in relation to each other. Since both are part of Florida State
      University (FSU), we should consider if they are in the same building, adjacent
      buildings, or entirely different parts of the campus.


      2. **Understand FSU Campus Layout**: Florida State University''s main campus
      is located in Tallahassee, Florida. The university''s campus is spread out,
      with various colleges and schools located in different buildings. However, without
      specific details on the exact locations of the School of Library & Information
      Studies and the College of Social Sciences, we must consider general geographical
      directions.


      3. **Geographical Consideration**: The question asks if the School of Library
      & Information Studies is located west of the College of Social Sciences. In
      a typical university setting, buildings are often clustered by department or
      college, but without a map or specific directional information, we can''t accurately
      determine their relative positions solely based on their names or the fact that
      they are both part of FSU.


      4. **Research and Data**: To give an accurate answer, one would ideally need
      to consult a map of the FSU campus or contact the university directly for information
      on the specific locations of these two entities. However, given the constraints
      of this format, let''s proceed with a logical deduction based on available general
      knowledge.


      5. **Logical Deduction**: Without specific information on the locations, any
      answer would be speculative. However, considering that both entities are part
      of the same university and likely located on or near the main campus in Tallahassee,
      the possibility of one being significantly west of the other depends on the
      campus layout and the specific buildings where these colleges are housed.


      Given the lack of specific information about the relative locations of the Florida
      State University School of Library & Information Studies and the Florida State
      University College of Social Sciences, and considering that universities often
      have campuses with buildings in close proximity to each other, it''s challenging

      \ at the specific addresses, Des Moines University (3200 Grand Ave) is south\
      \ of Drake University (2507 University Ave), considering the grid layout of\
      \ Des Moines where avenues run east-west.\n   - To determine east-west positioning,\
      \ we compare the street numbers. A lower street number generally indicates a\
      \ position more to the west on the same avenue or in the same general area,\
      \ considering the grid system of many US cities.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given\
      \ that both institutions are on avenues that run east-west and considering their\
      \ addresses, Des Moines University, being on Grand Avenue, and Drake University,\
      \ being on University Avenue slightly north but with a lower street number (2507\
      \ vs. 3200), suggests Drake is more to the west in terms of the numbering system\
      \ used in the city grid. However, the actual determination of east-west positioning\
      \ in this context requires precise geographic or mapping data, which might not\
      \ be directly inferred from street numbers alone without considering the overall\
      \ layout and how streets and avenues intersect and are numbered in Des Moines.\n\
      \nGiven the complexity and the reliance on specific geographic details that\
      \ might not be accurately represented by street numbers alone, the task simplifies\
      \ to understanding the relative positions based on available data. However,\
      \ without explicit geographic coordinates or a detailed map, one might incorrectly\
      \ assume the relationship based solely on street numbers and general knowledge\
      \ of city grids.\n\n**Answer**: \nGiven the specific addresses and considering\
      \ a typical grid system where lower numbers are to the west (but acknowledging\
      \ this might not always accurately reflect the true geographic relationship\
      \ without a map), and recognizing both institutions are in close proximity within\
      \ the same city, a definitive answer requires precise geographic information.\
      \ However, based on typical assumptions and the information provided, if we\
      \ were to make an educated guess based on street numbers alone (which is not\
      \ a reliable method for determining east-west relationships without more context),\
      \ one might lean towards \"NO\" due to the complexities and potential inaccuracies\
      \ in determining directional relationships solely by street numbers and general\
      \ grid knowledge. But, acknowledging the need for precise geographic data for\
      \ an accurate answer, the correct approach is to consult a map or geographic\

      the locations of Des Moines University and Drake University College of Pharmacy
      and Health Sciences, both of which are in Des Moines, Iowa.


      1. **Identify the city:** Both universities are located in Des Moines, Iowa.
      This means they are in the same city, which simplifies the comparison since
      we don''t have to consider different city locations.


      2. **Understand directions in Des Moines:** To determine if one is west of the
      other, we need to understand the layout of Des Moines and where these universities
      are in relation to each other.


      3. **Location of Des Moines University:** Des Moines University is located in
      Des Moines, Iowa. Without a specific address, we know it''s in the city, but
      we need to consider its general area.


      4. **Location of Drake University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences:**
      Drake University, which includes its College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences,
      is also in Des Moines, Iowa. Knowing that Drake University is situated near
      the downtown area and has a specific address can help in determining its exact
      location.


      Given these steps, without exact addresses but knowing both are in Des Moines
      and considering typical layouts and the fact that both institutions are well-established
      in the city:


      - **Drake University** is generally known to be located near the downtown area
      of Des Moines.

      - **Des Moines University** (formerly known as the University of Osteopathic
      Medicine and Health Sciences) is also in Des Moines but not directly associated
      with the downtown area in the same way Drake is.


      However, to give an accurate answer, we must consider the geography of Des Moines.
      Both universities are relatively central, but their exact positions relative
      to each other (east-west) depend on their specific locations within the city.


      After considering the need for specific locations:

      - Drake University is at 2507 University Ave, Des Moines, IA 50311.

      - Des Moines University is at 3200 Grand Ave, Des Moines, IA 50312.


      Given these addresses, Drake University is more to the north and slightly east
      of Des Moines University, considering the grid layout of Des Moines. However,
      the question asks if Des Moines University is west of Drake University.


      Based on the addresses:

      - Des Moines University (3200 Grand Ave) is indeed west and slightly south of
      Drake University (2507 University Ave), given the typical grid system of Des
      Moines where University Avenue is north of Grand Avenue, and considering the
      numbering system which generally indicates westward movement as the numbers
      increase in the context of this city layout.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'

      and Technical College (MSCTC) within Minnesota.


      2. **Northland Community & Technical College (NCTC)**: NCTC has campuses in
      Thief River Falls and East Grand Forks, Minnesota. Both of these locations are
      in the northwestern part of Minnesota.


      3. **Minnesota State Community and Technical College (MSCTC)**: MSCTC has campuses
      in Detroit Lakes, Fergus Falls, Moorhead, and Wadena, Minnesota. These locations
      are also in the northwestern and partially in the central part of Minnesota,
      but generally, they are more centrally located compared to NCTC''s locations.


      4. **Comparison**: Given that both colleges have locations in the northwestern
      part of Minnesota, we need to determine if NCTC is west of MSCTC. Thief River
      Falls and East Grand Forks (NCTC locations) are relatively north and west, while
      MSCTC''s locations, such as Moorhead and Detroit Lakes, are also in the western
      to northwestern part but slightly more to the southeast compared to NCTC''s

      University College of Health and Human Sciences and Purdue University College
      of Agriculture are part of Purdue University, which is located in West Lafayette,
      Indiana.


      2. **Understand the Geography of Purdue University**: Purdue University''s main
      campus, where both colleges are situated, is relatively compact. However, without
      specific details on the exact buildings or facilities for each college, we can
      infer based on typical university layouts that different colleges might be located
      in different parts of the campus.


      3. **Consider the Question''s Implication**: The question implies a comparison
      of the geographical locations of two colleges within the same university, asking
      if one is west of the other. This requires knowing the specific layout of Purdue
      University''s campus.


      4. **Purdue University Campus Layout**: Purdue University''s campus is laid
      out with various colleges and departments in different buildings and areas.
      Without specific information on the exact locations of the College of Health
      and Human Sciences and the College of Agriculture, we can''t directly answer
      the question based on general knowledge.


      5. **Research or Knowledge of Purdue University''s Campus**: Given that the
      question requires specific knowledge about the relative locations of these two
      colleges on Purdue''s campus, and without access to real-time or specific data
      about the campus layout, we must consider if there''s a general understanding
      or a typical arrangement that could apply.


      However, since both colleges are part of Purdue University and located on its
      main campus in West Lafayette, Indiana, and without specific details on their
      exact locations relative to each other, we can make an educated guess based
      on the assumption that the question is testing knowledge of the campus''s geography.


      Given the lack of specific information about the relative locations of these
      two colleges within Purdue University, the most straightforward answer, without
      additional context or a detailed map of Purdue University''s campus, would lean
      towards a general understanding that might not accurately reflect the precise
      locations of these colleges relative to each other.


      But, considering we are to provide a YES or NO answer and acknowledging the
      question''s specificity about the relative locations within the same campus,
      the answer would hinge on detailed campus knowledge which isn''t provided here.

      to whether Purdue University College of Health and Human Sciences, IN is located
      west of Purdue University College of Agriculture, IN, without specific campus

      Indiana.


      2. **Campus Layout**: Purdue University has a single main campus in West Lafayette,
      Indiana. Both colleges (Health and Human Sciences, and Agriculture) are located
      on this campus.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Since both colleges are on the same campus, their
      relative positions (east or west of each other) depend on the specific buildings
      or areas where they are housed. However, without specific information on the
      exact locations of these colleges within the campus, one might assume they could
      be in different parts of the campus.


      4. **General Knowledge**: Generally, universities organize their colleges and
      departments in a way that groups related disciplines together, but without a
      map or specific details, determining the exact location of one college relative
      to another requires specific knowledge of Purdue''s campus layout.

      specific building names or exact locations within the campus.


      4. **Interpretation of "West Of"**: The phrase "west of" in geographical terms
      means that one location is situated to the west of another. Given that both

      straightforward approach to answering this question accurately would be to consider
      the general location of Purdue University and its colleges. Both colleges are

    bd38dad5-980d-4297-806c-e692243f4521: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to understand that both the Purdue
      University College of Health and Human Sciences and the Purdue University College
      of Agriculture are part of Purdue University.


      2. **Purdue University Location**: Purdue University is located in West Lafayette,
      Indiana.


      3. **Campus Layout**: Since both colleges are part of the same university, they
      are located on the same campus or very close to each other in West Lafayette,
      IN.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Without specific details on the exact buildings or
      locations within the campus, we can''t directly determine if one is west of
      the other based solely on their names or the general information provided.


      5. **Campus Map Reference**: Normally, to determine the exact location, one
      would refer to a campus map. However, given the information available, we should
      consider if there''s a general understanding or common knowledge about the layout
      that might influence their positioning.


      6. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Since both colleges are within
      the same university and presumably on the same campus, and without specific
      information on their relative positions, the question seems to imply a need
      for detailed geographical knowledge of the Purdue University campus.


      However, considering the nature of the question and typical campus layouts,
      it''s unlikely that the colleges would be significantly distant in a way that
      one would be distinctly "west" of the other in a manner that''s widely recognized
      or relevant outside of specific campus navigation. But, for the purpose of this
      exercise and without a campus map or more detailed information, we must consider
      the possibility based on the question''s framing.


      Given that both are on the Purdue University campus and without specific details
      to the contrary, it''s reasonable to consider that they could be in close proximity,
      but the question''s specificity about "west" suggests a need for a precise answer
      that typically would require a map.


      Since the question demands a YES or NO answer without the ability to clarify
      or seek additional information like a campus map, and considering the colleges
      are part of the same campus, a definitive answer would typically depend on the
      exact locations of their respective buildings or facilities within the campus.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$'
    cc4764a5-3dc8-4867-8440-4a9b7d313ceb: 'To determine if Purdue University College
      of Health and Human Sciences is located west of Purdue University College of
      Agriculture, we need to understand the geographical layout of Purdue University
      and the relative locations of its colleges.


      1. **Purdue University Location**: Purdue University is located in West Lafayette,
      Indiana. This is our starting point.


      2. **Colleges'' Locations**: Both the College of Health and Human Sciences and
      the College of Agriculture are part of Purdue University. However, Purdue University
      is a large campus, and different colleges can be located in different areas.


      3. **Campus Layout**: Without specific details on the exact buildings or areas
      where these colleges are housed, we can consider the general layout of Purdue
      University. The university''s campus is not strictly divided by college in a
      linear fashion (e.g., all agriculture buildings in one area and all health sciences
      in another). However, certain colleges or departments might be clustered together
      based on their needs (e.g., agricultural fields for the College of Agriculture).


      4. **Geographical Reference**: To answer the question, we need a geographical
      reference point. Purdue University''s main campus is situated in West Lafayette,
      Indiana, with the Wabash River forming its western boundary. The campus itself
      is relatively compact, with various colleges and departments spread across it.


      5. **Relative Positions**: Without exact GPS coordinates or a detailed campus
      map indicating the specific locations of the College of Health and Human Sciences
      and the College of Agriculture, it''s challenging to definitively state their
      relative east-west positions. However, given the compact nature of the campus,
      significant east-west separation between colleges is unlikely.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of detailed geographical information about
      the specific locations of these two colleges within Purdue University and considering
      the compact nature of the campus, it''s reasonable to infer that the difference
      in their locations might not be significantly west-east oriented, as both are
      part of the same university campus. However, without explicit information on
      their locations, we must rely on general knowledge about university campuses
      and the relative compactness of Purdue''s layout.


      Given these considerations and the lack of specific information on the exact
      locations of the Purdue University College of Health and Human Sciences and
      the Purdue University College of Agriculture, it''s challenging to provide a
      definitive YES or NO answer without making assumptions. However, for the purpose
      of this exercise and based on the compact nature of the campus, a reasoned guess
      might lean towards a "NO" due to the unlikely significant westward separation
      on a relatively compact campus. But remember, this is a speculative answer based
      on general principles rather than specific geographical data.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, identify the locations of both institutions
      in Washington, D.C.

      2. **Map Reference**: Use a map or a mapping service to pinpoint the exact locations
      of Corcoran College of Art and Design and Strayer University in Washington,
      D.C.

      3. **Determine Direction**: Once the locations are identified, determine the

      Corcoran is to the west of Strayer, the answer is YES. If it''s to the east,
      north, or south, the answer is NO.


      **Locations**:

      - Corcoran College of Art and Design is located at 500 17th St NW, Washington,
      DC 20006.

      - Strayer University has multiple locations, but for simplicity, let''s consider
      its main campus or a significant location in D.C., which could be around 1133
      15th St NW, Washington, DC 20005, for example.


      **Map Reference**:

      Using a mapping service, we can see that:

      or similar). The grid system of Washington, D.C., makes it relatively straightforward
      to determine directions based on street numbers and compass directions.


      Therefore, based on this analysis, the answer is: **YES**'
    d9cb4d5e-8ba3-49d4-89d1-da7f757f521a: 'To answer this question, let''s first identify
      the locations of Corcoran College of Art and Design and Strayer University in
      Washington, D.C.


      1. **Corcoran College of Art and Design**: Historically, the Corcoran College
      of Art and Design was located in downtown Washington, D.C. Specifically, its
      main campus was situated near the White House, which places it roughly in the
      center of the city.


      2. **Strayer University, DC**: Strayer University has multiple locations, but
      focusing on its Washington, D.C. campus, it is essential to note that Strayer
      University is known for having campuses in various parts of the city. However,
      one of its main locations in D.C. is in the downtown area as well.


      Given these are general locations and without specific addresses, we must consider
      the geography of Washington, D.C.:

      - Downtown Washington, D.C., where both institutions have been known to have
      locations, is not typically considered "west" in the broader geographical context
      of the United States. However, within the city itself, "west" can refer to areas
      west of the center.

      - Without exact addresses, the question becomes about the relative positions
      of these institutions within the city.


      Considering the need for precise locations to definitively answer this question
      and acknowledging that both institutions could be considered as being in the
      central part of the city (with the understanding that "west" in D.C. terms could
      mean anything west of the Anacostia River or more specifically within the context
      of downtown areas), we must rely on general knowledge of D.C.''s layout.


      Given this, and the fact that Corcoran College of Art and Design was historically
      located near the White House (which is more central) and Strayer University''s
      downtown location could also be central but potentially extending into areas
      that might be considered more "west" in a local context, the question hinges
      on the specific addresses of these institutions at the time of consideration.


      However, since Corcoran College of Art and Design is now part of George Washington
      University (following its merger in 2014) and operates under a different structure,
      its original location''s relevance to this question may be historical rather
      than current.


      **Conclusion**: Without current, specific addresses for both institutions and
      considering the historical context and general locations provided, it''s challenging
      to give a definitive YES or NO answer based solely on the information given.

    388bf019-d11b-40cd-937c-23924b93a9f2: 'To determine if California State University
      (CSU) is located west of Art Center College of Design (ACCD), we need to establish
      the locations of both institutions.


      1. **Location of California State University (CSU):** CSU is a large university
      system with 23 campuses across California. Without specifying which CSU campus,
      it''s broad to pinpoint an exact location. However, considering the system spans
      the state, some CSU campuses are indeed in the western part of California.


      2. **Location of Art Center College of Design (ACCD):** ACCD is located in Pasadena,
      California. Pasadena is situated in Los Angeles County, which is in the southern
      part of California but considered to be on the western side of the United States,
      given California''s westernmost position among the contiguous states.


      Given that Pasadena (where ACCD is located) is in the western part of the United
      States and California, to determine if a CSU campus is west of ACCD, we need
      to consider the geography of California. Since California stretches from the
      Pacific Ocean (west) to the eastern borders of the state, and Pasadena is already
      on the western side of the state (though not directly on the coast, it''s still
      in the western part of the state), we are essentially comparing locations within
      the western part of California.


      For a CSU campus to be west of ACCD in Pasadena, it would need to be either
      directly west (towards the Pacific Ocean) or in a part of the state that is
      farther west than Pasadena. Given the geography, several CSU campuses (like
      CSU Long Beach, CSU Los Angeles, or even CSU Northridge) could be considered
      "west" of Pasadena in a broad geographical sense, but it''s critical to note
      the specific orientation and proximity to the Pacific Ocean or the relative
      position within the Los Angeles metropolitan area.


      Since Pasadena is somewhat inland and not directly on the coast, and considering
      the vastness of the CSU system with campuses spread out, there are indeed CSU
      campuses that are located west of Pasadena (for example, campuses in the Los
      Angeles area that are closer to the Pacific Ocean than Pasadena is).


      **Conclusion:** Given the broad distribution of CSU campuses across California
      and the fact that Pasadena, where ACCD is located, is not on the coast but rather
      inland within Los Angeles County, it is reasonable to conclude that some CSU
      campuses could indeed be located west of Art Center College of Design, considering
      the geography and layout of California.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      California State University (CSU) and Art Center College of Design (ACCD) in
      California.


      2. **California State University (CSU)**: California State University is a public
      university system with 23 campuses across California. Without specifying which
      campus, it''s broad. However, since the question is about location relative
      to Art Center College of Design, we''ll consider the general area where most
      CSU campuses are located. Many CSU campuses are spread throughout the state,
      but a significant number are in the southern and central parts of California.


      3. **Art Center College of Design (ACCD)**: Art Center College of Design is
      located in Pasadena, California. Pasadena is in Los Angeles County, which is
      in the southern part of California.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Since Pasadena (where ACCD is located) is in the
      southern part of California, and considering that many CSU campuses are also
      in the southern and central parts of the state, we need to determine if any
      CSU campus is west of Pasadena.


      5. **Geographical Consideration**: Pasadena is relatively east in the Los Angeles
      metropolitan area, near the San Gabriel Valley. Any location west of Pasadena
      would be more towards the Pacific coast or the western parts of Los Angeles
      County.


      6. **CSU Campuses Near Pasadena**: There are several CSU campuses in the Los
      Angeles area, such as California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA), and
      California State University, Northridge (CSUN). CSULA is east of Pasadena, and
      CSUN is northwest but still relatively close in proximity.


      7. **Conclusion**: Given that Pasadena (ACCD) is not directly on the coast but
      rather inland, and considering the spread of CSU campuses, there are indeed
      CSU campuses that could be considered west of Art Center College of Design,
      especially if we consider the broader geographical area of Los Angeles and the
      fact that "west" in this context doesn''t necessarily mean directly on the coast
      but rather in a westerly direction from Pasadena.

      down into the necessary steps of reasoning:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Cordoba University and Army Logistics University in Virginia.


      2. **Cordoba University, VA**: We need to determine if Cordoba University exists
      in Virginia and its exact location. After research, it appears that there might
      be confusion or a lack of information on a university named "Cordoba University"
      in Virginia. Typically, institutions with this name are not found in the context
      of well-known universities in the United States. However, for the sake of argument,
      let''s proceed as if it could potentially exist or be a lesser-known or new
      institution.


      3. **Army Logistics University, VA**: The Army Logistics University (ALU) is
      located at Fort Lee, Virginia. It is a reputable institution focused on providing
      instruction on logistics and other related military specialties.


      4. **Geographical Comparison**: Without the specific location of Cordoba University,
      directly comparing its location to that of Army Logistics University is challenging.
      However, knowing that Army Logistics University is in Fort Lee, Virginia, we
      can consider the general geography of Virginia. Virginia stretches from the
      eastern seaboard westward. Fort Lee, where ALU is located, is more towards the
      eastern part of the state.


      5. **Determining "West"**: To say one location is west of another, it must be
      further in the western direction on the map. Without the exact location of Cordoba
      University, we cannot definitively say its position relative to Army Logistics
      University.


      6. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Given the information available
      and the steps of reasoning, we cannot accurately determine the location of Cordoba
      University in relation to Army Logistics University without more specific details
      about Cordoba University''s location.


      However, the question demands a YES or NO answer, and based on the lack of specific
      information about Cordoba University and its potential non-existence in the
      context provided, we lean towards a scenario where we cannot confirm the relationship.
      Thus, the safest assumption, given the information at hand, is to not affirm
      the statement due to insufficient data.

      \ of \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes**: Historically, \xC9cole libre des\
      \ hautes \xE9tudes was located in New York City. It was a French-language university\
      \ that operated from 1941 to 1946. Although the exact address might not be immediately\
      \ available, knowing it was in NYC is sufficient for our purposes.\n\n3. **Location\
      \ of New York University Graduate School of Arts and Science**: This is located\
      \ in Manhattan, New York City. New York University (NYU) has several campuses,\
      \ but its main campus, including the Graduate School of Arts and Science, is\
      \ in Greenwich Village, Manhattan.\n\n4. **Determine the relative locations**:\
      \ To determine if \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes is west of New York University\
      \ Graduate School of Arts and Science, we need to know the specific addresses\
      \ or areas where they are located. However, given that both institutions are\
      \ or were located in Manhattan, we can consider Manhattan's grid system for\
      \ a rough estimation. Greenwich Village, where NYU is located, is in the western\
      \ part of Manhattan but not as far west as the Hudson River. Without the exact\
      \ address of \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes, we can't make a precise comparison,\
      \ but traditionally, many academic institutions were clustered in areas like\
      \ the Upper East Side or Midtown, which could be east or north of Greenwich\
      \ Village.\n\n5. **Historical Context and Address**: After further consideration,\
      \ it's crucial to note that the \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes, during\
      \ its operation, was indeed located in Manhattan, and given the nature of Manhattan's\
      \ geography, being \"west\" of NYU would imply being closer to the Hudson River\
      \ than NYU's main campus in Greenwich Village. Without a precise address for\
      \ \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes, this step relies heavily on historical\
      \ documentation which might place it in various locations around Manhattan during\
      \ its existence.\n\nGiven these steps and acknowledging the lack of a specific\
      \ address for \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes, we must consider the historical\
      \ context and the possibility that its location could have varied. However,\
      \ for a definitive answer, we must rely on known historical locations:\n\nGiven\
      \ the information and the steps to consider, the answer to whether \xC9cole\
      \ libre des hautes \xE9tudes is located west of New York University Graduate\
      \ School of Arts and Science would depend on the exact location of \xC9cole\
      \ libre des hautes \xE9tudes during its operation. If it was located, for example,\
      \ in the Upper East Side or further east in Manhattan, it would not be west\
      \ of NYU. However, without a precise location and considering Manhattan's layout,\
      \ it's challenging to provide a definitive YES or NO without more specific information\
      \ about the \xC9cole's exact address during its operational years.\n\nBut considering\
      \ historical records and the common areas for such institutions, a likely scenario\
      \ based on typical locations of academic institutions in Manhattan might suggest\
      \ that \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes could have been located in areas\
      \ that are not necessarily west of NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Science.\
      \ \n\nTherefore, the answer, based on the assumption that we are considering\
      \ general locations within Manhattan and without specific addresses, would lean\
      \ towards NO, acknowledging that a precise answer requires more detailed historical\
      \ location data. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{NO}$"

    6e173803-f2d5-4108-9f37-0d83bad5e1a6: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Widener
      University and Delaware State University. Widener University has a campus in
      Delaware, and Delaware State University is also located in Delaware.


      2. **Specific locations within Delaware**: Widener University''s Delaware campus
      is located in Wilmington, Delaware. Delaware State University has its main campus
      in Dover, Delaware.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Now, we need to compare the locations of these
      two universities in terms of their geographical positions within Delaware. Wilmington,
      where Widener University is located, is in the northern part of Delaware, near
      the Pennsylvania border. Dover, where Delaware State University is located,
      is more centrally located in Delaware but is south of Wilmington.


      4. **Determine east-west orientation**: Delaware is a relatively narrow state,
      oriented north-south. Wilmington (Widener University) is north of Dover (Delaware
      State University). However, the question asks about the east-west orientation.
      Delaware''s width from east to west is much less than its length from north
      to south, but generally, the eastern part of Delaware would be closer to the
      Delaware Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, while the western part would be closer
      to the Maryland border.


      5. **Conclusion based on geography**: Given that Wilmington is north of Dover
      and considering Delaware''s geography, Wilmington (and thus Widener University)
      is not significantly west of Dover (Delaware State University) in terms of east-west
      orientation. The difference in their locations is more pronounced in the north-south
      axis than in the east-west axis. However, to answer the question directly regarding
      whether Widener University is west of Delaware State University, we must consider
      the specific latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates or the general geographical
      layout of Delaware.


      Given the north-south orientation of Delaware and the locations of these universities,
      Widener University in Wilmington is generally east or northeast of Dover, where
      Delaware State University is located, due to Delaware''s geography and the relative
      positions of Wilmington and Dover. Therefore, Widener University is not west
      of Delaware State University.

      \ near the Pennsylvania border, while Dover is more central but slightly to\
      \ the south.\n\n3. **Compare Longitudes**: To determine if one is west of the\
      \ other, we need to compare their longitudes. In the United States, as you move\
      \ west, the longitude increases (becomes more positive or less negative, depending\
      \ on the reference point).\n\n4. **Apply to Delaware**: Delaware is an east\
      \ coast state with a relatively small size. Wilmington's longitude is approximately\
      \ 75.5\xB0 W, and Dover's is about 75.5\xB0 W as well. However, given the precision\
      \ required for such a comparison, it's essential to consider the exact longitudes\
      \ or relative positions based on maps.\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on Geography**:\
      \ Without precise longitudes, we consider the general geography. Widener University\
      \ in Wilmington is generally north of Delaware State University in Dover. The\
      \ question of being \"west\" depends on the exact longitudes, but given the\
      \ close proximity in longitude and the north-south alignment of the two cities,\
      \ the difference in longitude would be minimal.\n\nGiven these steps and without\
      \ exact longitude values, it might seem challenging to provide a definitive\
      \ answer. However, considering typical map orientations and the fact that both\
      \ cities are relatively close in terms of east-west positioning but differ more\

      4. **Directional Relationship**: Considering the north-south orientation, Wilmington
      (where Widener University''s Delaware campus is located) is north of Dover (where

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      universities. Widener University has a campus in Wilmington, Delaware, but it
      also has a campus in Chester, Pennsylvania. However, since the question specifies
      Delaware (DE), we will focus on the Wilmington or possibly the Dover campus
      if it exists, but primarily Wilmington is known.


      2. **Delaware State University Location**: Delaware State University is located
      in Dover, Delaware.


      3. **Geographical Orientation**: Dover, Delaware, is generally considered to
      be in the central part of the state, moving towards the southern part. Wilmington,
      on the other hand, is in the northern part of Delaware.


      4. **Westward Orientation**: When considering what is west of a location in
      Delaware, given the state''s narrow width from west to east, we are essentially
      looking at areas that are more to the west within the state or possibly just
      over the border into neighboring states like Maryland or Pennsylvania.


      5. **Comparison**: Since both universities are within Delaware, and considering
      Wilmington (where Widener University''s DE campus is primarily located) is north

      in the same building or immediate area.


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations
      of both the University of Michigan College of Pharmacy and the University of
      Michigan School of Public Health within Ann Arbor, Michigan.


      2. **Compare Locations**: Once we have their exact locations, we can compare
      them to determine their relative positions. If one is located west of the other,
      it means that one institution is situated to the west of the other on a map.


      Given the information available and without specific addresses or a detailed
      map of the University of Michigan''s campus layout, we must rely on general
      knowledge or accessible data about these institutions. Both the College of Pharmacy
      and the School of Public Health are part of the University of Michigan and are
      located in Ann Arbor. However, without precise locations, we cannot directly
      determine their relative east-west positioning.


      But, considering the University of Michigan''s campus is relatively compact
      and both schools are part of the university, if they are in different locations,
      the difference might not be significant enough to definitively say one is west
      of the other without exact addresses or a campus map.


      Given the general nature of this question and the lack of specific details about
      their locations, the most straightforward approach is to look up their addresses
      or consult a campus map. However, for the sake of providing an answer based
      on typical reasoning:


      - The University of Michigan College of Pharmacy is located at 428 Church St,
      Ann Arbor, MI 48109.

      - The University of Michigan School of Public Health is located at 1415 Washington
      Heights, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.


      Without a detailed map or further information, and based on the addresses provided,
      it seems that both are within the same general area of Ann Arbor, but their
      exact east-west relationship depends on the specific geography of the area and
      the orientation of the streets and buildings.

    ab4075c2-3614-40f8-bde4-c68c03bb156b: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of the University of Michigan College of Pharmacy and the University
      of Michigan School of Public Health, both in Michigan, and then compare their
      locations to see if the College of Pharmacy is west of the School of Public
      Health.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Both the College of Pharmacy and the School of
      Public Health are part of the University of Michigan. The University of Michigan
      has two main campuses: the Ann Arbor campus, which is the largest and most well-known,
      and the Dearborn campus, as well as the Flint campus. However, the primary location
      for both of these schools is typically the Ann Arbor campus.


      2. **Specific locations within Ann Arbor**: The University of Michigan''s campus
      in Ann Arbor is not extremely large but is significant, with various buildings
      and facilities spread across it. The College of Pharmacy is located in the North
      Campus area, which is on the northern part of the Ann Arbor campus. The School
      of Public Health is situated in the Crossroads area of the campus, closer to
      the central campus.


      3. **Geographical orientation**: In Ann Arbor, the University of Michigan''s
      campus layout can be thought of in terms of its cardinal directions (north,
      south, east, west) relative to the city and the campus itself. The North Campus
      is, as the name suggests, on the northern part of the campus. The central campus
      area, where the School of Public Health is located, is more towards the south
      relative to the North Campus.


      4. **Comparison**: Given that the College of Pharmacy is in the North Campus
      and the School of Public Health is more towards the central part of the campus,
      we can infer that the College of Pharmacy is generally north (and possibly a
      bit east or west depending on the exact buildings) of the School of Public Health.
      However, the question specifically asks if the College of Pharmacy is west of
      the School of Public Health.


      5. **Conclusion**: Without precise GPS coordinates or a detailed map showing
      the exact locations of these schools within the Ann Arbor campus, it''s challenging
      to provide a definitive "yes" or "no" based solely on the information given.
      However, considering the general layout and assuming the School of Public Health
      is centrally located and the College of Pharmacy is in the North Campus, the
      College of Pharmacy could potentially be northwest or north of the School of
      Public Health. But to determine if it is specifically west, we would need more
      precise information about their locations relative to each other.


      Given the above reasoning and without more detailed location information, it''s
      not straightforward to provide a definitive answer. However, the question seems
      to simplify the campus layout into a straightforward directional query, which
      might not fully capture the complexity of the campus''s geography.

      1. **Location of Loyola University Chicago**: Loyola University Chicago is located
      in Chicago, Illinois. Chicago is situated in the northeastern part of the state.


      2. **Location of Illinois College of Optometry (ICO)**: The Illinois College
      of Optometry is also located in Chicago, Illinois. Specifically, it is situated
      on the South Side of Chicago.


      3. **Comparing Locations**: Since both institutions are in Chicago, we need
      to consider their relative positions within the city. The South Side of Chicago,
      where ICO is located, is generally south and slightly east of many other areas
      of the city, including the neighborhoods where Loyola University Chicago has
      its campuses (Loyola has campuses on the North Side and the Water Tower Campus
      downtown, but neither is directly west of the South Side).


      Given these locations:

      - Loyola University Chicago''s main campuses are located on the North Side and

    9530baa9-4bde-46ed-acf4-7c5fadc1ac68: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Loyola University Chicago and the Illinois College of Optometry. Loyola University
      Chicago is located in Chicago, Illinois. The Illinois College of Optometry is
      also located in Chicago, Illinois.


      2. **Relative Positions**: Next, we determine their relative positions within
      Chicago. Loyola University Chicago has campuses on the North Side of Chicago.
      The Illinois College of Optometry is located on the South Side of Chicago.


      3. **Westward Direction**: Considering the layout of Chicago, moving westward
      from any point in the city would mean going further inland from Lake Michigan,
      which borders Chicago to the east.


      4. **Comparison**: Since both institutions are in Chicago, we compare their
      specific locations. The North Side, where Loyola University is, and the South
      Side, where the Illinois College of Optometry is, run generally parallel to
      the lake shore. However, the question is about being "west" of each other, not
      north or south.


      5. **Geographical Orientation**: Chicago''s grid system is aligned with the
      lake shore to the east. Both institutions, being in different parts of the city,
      could potentially be at similar latitudes (north-south positions) but are likely
      to be at different longitudes (east-west positions) due to the city''s layout.
      However, the critical factor here is their relative east-west positioning.


      6. **Conclusion**: Without exact addresses or coordinates, we might initially
      think this is a complex question. However, considering the question asks if
      Loyola University Chicago is west of the Illinois College of Optometry, and
      given that both are in Chicago but on different sides (North vs. South), the
      question simplifies to understanding that "west" in this context refers to the
      cardinal direction, not the side of the city (North Side vs. South Side).


      Given these steps and understanding that the question pertains to geographical
      direction rather than the city''s internal divisions (North Side, South Side),
      we can proceed to the answer:


      Loyola University Chicago, being on the North Side, and the Illinois College
      of Optometry, being on the South Side, doesn''t directly answer the west-east
      question without knowing their exact locations relative to each other in terms
      of longitude. However, considering typical city layouts and assuming no significant
      longitudinal difference that would place one decisively west of the other based
      on their north-south division, the answer hinges on the precise locations.


      But since Loyola University Chicago is generally north and the Illinois College
      of Optometry is south, without specific longitudinal data, we must consider
      the general geography of Chicago. If Loyola University is north and assuming
      a similar east-west line, it''s not necessarily west just because it''s north.
      The Illinois College of Optometry, being on the South Side, could still be east
      or west depending on its exact location relative to Loyola''s.


      Given this complexity and without exact coordinates or a detailed map showing
      their precise locations relative to each other in an east-west direction, the
      question seems to require specific geographical knowledge that isn''t provided.
      However, considering the aim is for a YES or NO answer and assuming a straightforward
      interpretation of the question based on typical understandings of city geography:


      The final answer is: YES'

      Chicago is located in Chicago, Illinois. The Illinois College of Optometry is

      Chicago, we need to consider their exact locations within the city to determine
      if one is west of the other.


      3. **Loyola University Chicago''s location**: Loyola University Chicago has
      several campuses, but its main campus is located on the North Side of Chicago,
      along Lake Michigan.


      4. **Illinois College of Optometry''s location**: The Illinois College of Optometry
      is located on the South Side of Chicago.


      5. **Compare locations**: Considering the general layout of Chicago, the North
      Side is generally north and east of the South Side. However, the specific east-west
      positioning can vary depending on the exact locations within these areas.


      6. **Conclusion based on typical Chicago geography**: Without precise addresses,
      we can make an educated guess based on the general areas. The North Side (where
      Loyola University Chicago is located) can extend westward, but it starts from
      the lake and moves inland. The South Side (where the Illinois College of Optometry
      is located) also extends westward from the lake. Given that both are in Chicago
      and considering the layout of the city, it''s possible for Loyola to be north
      and slightly east or at a similar longitudinal position as the Illinois College
      of Optometry, depending on their exact locations.


      However, to give a definitive YES or NO answer without exact addresses or a
      map requires assuming typical geographical knowledge of Chicago. Loyola University
      Chicago''s main campus is near Lake Michigan on the North Side, and the Illinois
      College of Optometry is on the South Side, also near Lake Michigan but farther
      south. This doesn''t necessarily mean one is directly west of the other, as
      their positions relative to each other (north-south) are more significant than
      their east-west alignment in this context.


      Given the information and the need for a clear YES or NO answer, and considering
      that both institutions are essentially along the same north-south line (Lake
      Michigan) but differ significantly in their north-south positioning, the question
      of whether Loyola University Chicago is located west of the Illinois College
      of Optometry depends on their exact addresses. However, based on general knowledge,
      it''s less about being directly west of each other and more about their north-south
      alignment in the city.


      **YES or NO answer**: Given the complexity and without exact locations, the
      most straightforward answer based on typical geographical assumptions would
      be **NO**, as Loyola University Chicago and the Illinois College of Optometry

      \ Oklahoma, could potentially be either east or west of Concordia University\
      \ Texas, depending on their specific longitudes. However, since Oklahoma is\
      \ north of Texas and the question asks if Phillips University is west of Concordia\
      \ University Texas, we must consider the longitudinal aspect. Given that Phillips\
      \ University would generally be north and potentially at a similar longitude\
      \ or slightly west due to the geographical layout of the United States, the\
      \ answer leans towards a potential \"yes\" if considering just the state positions.\

      \ answer based solely on the information provided. However, typically, Oklahoma\
      \ is to the north of Texas, and depending on the exact locations within the\
      \ states, it's possible for a location in Oklahoma to be west of a location\
      \ in Texas if the Oklahoma location is sufficiently westward.\n\nGiven the lack\
      \ of specific longitudinal data and acknowledging that the question requires\
      \ a definitive YES or NO answer, the most informed response based on typical\

      College of Engineering) is generally at a higher latitude and slightly east
      of Alfred (Alfred University) due to New York''s geography, where moving north
      often means moving slightly east due to the state''s shape.


      Based on this analysis, Alfred University is not west of the Kate Gleason College
      of Engineering; rather, it is south and slightly west but primarily south due

      the locations of Woodbury University and Los Angeles Recording School in relation
      to each other, specifically in terms of their positions relative to Los Angeles.


      1. **Identify the location of Woodbury University, CA**: Woodbury University
      is located in Burbank, California. Burbank is directly north of Los Angeles.


      2. **Identify the location of Los Angeles Recording School, CA**: The Los Angeles
      Recording School is, as the name suggests, located in Los Angeles, California.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Given that Woodbury University is in
      Burbank, which is north of Los Angeles, and the Los Angeles Recording School
      is in Los Angeles, we need to establish if Burbank (where Woodbury University
      is located) is west of Los Angeles.


      4. **Geographical relationship**: Burbank is generally considered to be northeast
      of the central part of Los Angeles, not directly west. The city of Los Angeles
      is large and sprawling, but Burbank''s location relative to the main part of
      Los Angeles is more to the north and slightly east rather than directly west.

      the geographical locations of Furman University in South Carolina (SC) and Marshall
      University in West Virginia (WV) and compare their positions relative to each
      other, specifically in terms of east-west orientation.


      1. **Identify the states'' general locations**: South Carolina is located in
      the southeastern United States, and West Virginia is located in the eastern
      United States, more specifically in the Mid-Atlantic or Appalachian region.


      2. **Compare the states'' east-west positions**: Generally, West Virginia is
      west of South Carolina. This is because if you move westward from South Carolina,
      you would eventually reach West Virginia, passing through or near other states
      like North Carolina and Virginia along the way.


      3. **Consider the universities'' locations within their states**: Furman University
      is in Greenville, South Carolina, which is in the northwestern part of the state.
      Marshall University is in Huntington, West Virginia, which is in the western
      part of the state.


      4. **Determine the relative east-west positions of the universities**: Given
      that West Virginia is generally west of South Carolina, the question becomes
      whether the specific locations of these universities alter this general east-west
      relationship.

      part of its state and Marshall is in the western part of its state.

      a public university located in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The College of Health and
      Human Services (CHHS) is one of the colleges within Eastern Michigan University.


      2. **Location Consideration**: Since the College of Health and Human Services

      same place or at least on the same campus. EMU''s main campus, where most of
      its colleges including CHHS are situated, is in Ypsilanti, Michigan.


      3. **Geographical Analysis**: The question asks if Eastern Michigan University
      is located west of the College of Health and Human Services. Given that both
      entities are part of the same university and presumably on the same campus or
      very close to each other, the concept of one being "west" of the other doesn''t
      apply in a way that would imply a significant geographical difference. However,
      if we consider the precise locations of buildings or facilities within the campus,
      it''s possible for one building to be west of another, but this would be a matter
      of campus layout rather than a significant geographical difference.


      4. **Conclusion Based on Given Information**: Since both are essentially in
      the same location (Ypsilanti, Michigan) and part of the same university, the
      question seems to be testing understanding of the relationship between the university

    f9b0674b-5385-4cec-8484-0155402595ab: 'To determine if Eastern Michigan University
      (EMU) is located west of the Eastern Michigan University College of Health and
      Human Services, we need to consider the following steps:


      1. **Understanding Locations**: First, we must understand that Eastern Michigan
      University College of Health and Human Services is a part of Eastern Michigan
      University. Colleges within a university are typically located on or near the
      main campus of the university.


      2. **Same Location**: Given that the College of Health and Human Services is
      a part of EMU, it is reasonable to conclude that both are located on the same
      campus or at least in very close proximity to each other in Ypsilanti, Michigan.


      3. **Relative Positions**: The question of one being west of the other implies
      a comparison of their locations. However, since they are essentially in the
      same location (with the college being a part of the university), the concept
      of one being west of the other does not apply in the way it would if they were
      separate entities located in different parts of the state or country.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the understanding that Eastern Michigan University
      College of Health and Human Services is part of Eastern Michigan University
      and likely located on the same campus, it does not make geographical sense to
      say that Eastern Michigan University is located west of its own college.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: **NO**'

      locations of both universities.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Florida National University is located in the
      state of Florida, and Pfeiffer University is located in the state of North Carolina.


      2. **Consider geographical directions**: The United States is typically divided
      into regions based on direction (north, south, east, west). Florida is generally
      southeast of North Carolina.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Since Florida is southeast of North Carolina,
      any location in Florida would be south and potentially east of a location in
      North Carolina, depending on the specific positions within the states.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Florida is to the south (and slightly east) of
      North Carolina, it is not possible for Florida National University to be west
      of Pfeiffer University, as "west" would imply a location that is in a direction
      opposite to where Florida is in relation to North Carolina.

      FL is located west of Pfeiffer University, NC, we need to establish the geographical
      locations of both universities and then compare their positions relative to

      1. **Location of Florida National University (FL):** Florida National University
      is located in the state of Florida. Florida is situated in the southeastern
      United States.


      2. **Location of Pfeiffer University (NC):** Pfeiffer University is located
      in the state of North Carolina. North Carolina is also in the southeastern United
      States but is located north of Florida.


      3. **Determining Westward Location:** To be west of Pfeiffer University, a location
      must be to the left (or west) of it on a map when facing north. Given that Florida
      is generally south of North Carolina and considering the eastern part of the
      United States where these states are located, the question becomes whether Florida
      extends westward enough to be west of any part of North Carolina.


      4. **Comparison:** North Carolina and Florida share a border to the southwest

      the geographical locations of Tuskegee University in Alabama (AL) and Bellarmine
      University in Kentucky (KY) and then compare their positions relative to each
      other, specifically in terms of east-west orientation.


      1. **Identify the states'' general locations**: Alabama is located in the southeastern
      United States, and Kentucky is located in the eastern United States, more specifically
      in the region often referred to as the South-Central or Upper South.


      2. **Consider the states'' relative positions**: Generally, Alabama is southeast
      of Kentucky. This means that Alabama is typically east and slightly south of
      Kentucky.


      3. **Understand east-west orientation**: When considering if one location is
      west of another, we are looking at whether the first location is to the left
      (west) of the second on a standard map where north is up.


      4. **Apply to the universities**: Given that Alabama (where Tuskegee University
      is located) is generally east and slightly south of Kentucky (where Bellarmine
      University is located), Tuskegee University would not be west of Bellarmine
      University. Instead, it would be east or southeast.

    6f98a6f2-24af-4705-b652-a0d0f47dbb1c: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to identify the locations of DePaul University
      and the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) College of Liberal Arts and
      Sciences. Both institutions are in Illinois.


      2. **DePaul University Location**: DePaul University is located in Chicago,
      Illinois. Specifically, it has several campuses, but its main campus is in the
      Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago.


      3. **UIC College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Location**: The University of
      Illinois at Chicago (UIC) College of Liberal Arts and Sciences is part of UIC,
      which is also located in Chicago, Illinois. UIC''s main campus is near the Loop
      and the West Loop, closer to the center of the city but on the west side of
      the Chicago River.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Given that both universities are in Chicago, to determine
      if DePaul University is west of UIC''s College of Liberal Arts and Sciences,
      we need to consider the relative positions of their campuses within the city.
      DePaul''s main campus in Lincoln Park is generally north of the city center,
      while UIC is more centrally located but to the west of the Chicago River.


      5. **Determine Direction**: Lincoln Park, where DePaul University''s main campus
      is located, is north of the city center. UIC, being closer to the city center
      and west of the Chicago River, means DePaul is not directly west but rather
      more north in relation to UIC''s location.


      6. **Conclusion**: Considering the geographical layout of Chicago and the locations
      of these two institutions, DePaul University is not west of the University of
      Illinois at Chicago College of Liberal Arts and Sciences but rather more to
      the north.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$'

      \ the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the locations**:\n   - DePaul University is located\
      \ in Chicago, Illinois.\n   - University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) College\
      \ of Liberal Arts and Sciences is also located in Chicago, Illinois.\n\n2. **Determine\
      \ the relative positions**:\n   - Both institutions are in the same city, so\
      \ we need to consider their specific locations within Chicago to determine if\
      \ one is west of the other.\n\n3. **Chicago's geography**:\n   - Chicago is\
      \ laid out in a grid pattern with the intersection of State and Madison Streets\
      \ considered the zero point (0,0). Addresses increase as you move north, south,\
      \ east, or west from this point.\n   - The University of Illinois at Chicago\
      \ is located near the Loop, the central business district of Chicago, and its\
      \ main address is 1200 West Harrison Street. This places UIC just west of the\
      \ Loop.\n   - DePaul University has two main campuses in Chicago: the Lincoln\
      \ Park Campus and the Loop Campus. The Loop Campus is, as the name suggests,\
      \ near the Loop, similar to UIC but more to the east. The Lincoln Park Campus\
      \ is north of the Loop.\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - Given that UIC is at 1200\
      \ West Harrison Street, it is west of the Loop.\n   - DePaul's Loop Campus is\
      \ east of UIC since it's closer to the Loop and further east in the grid system\
      \ of Chicago. The Lincoln Park Campus, while north, does not extend far enough\
      \ west to be west of UIC's location.\n\nBased on these steps, since DePaul University's\
      \ main campuses (especially considering the Loop Campus for direct comparison)\
      \ are not west of the University of Illinois at Chicago's College of Liberal\
      \ Arts and Sciences, the answer is:\n\nNO"
