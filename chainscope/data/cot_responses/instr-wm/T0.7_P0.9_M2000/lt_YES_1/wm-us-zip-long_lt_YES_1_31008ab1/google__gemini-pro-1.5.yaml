      state and OR is Oregon state.

      2. **General US geography:** Washington is located north of Oregon, and both
      are on the West Coast.

      3. **West/East relationship:**  Since Washington is directly north of Oregon,
      the west/east relationship between two zip codes in these states is primarily
      determined by their longitude.

      4. **Assumption:** We are assuming the question refers to the central point
      or centroid of each zip code area.


      Therefore, a location in WA will almost certainly be west of a location in OR.

      more westerly longitude.

      3. **Specific zip code locations:** While generally Washington is west of Oregon,
      zip codes can be irregular and a northern WA zip code could potentially be at
      a similar longitude to a zip code in central or eastern Oregon.  We need more
      specific location information.

      4. **Longitude and West/East:**  Longitude determines the east/west position.
      Lower longitude values are further west.  Since Washington is north of Oregon,
      and the Pacific Ocean is to the west of both, a location in Washington would
      have to be significantly north of a location in Oregon to also be east of it.  It''s
      much more likely for a location in Washington to be west of a location in Oregon.

      5. **General Knowledge:** In general, the Pacific coast runs roughly north-south.  It''s
      highly likely 98580, WA is west of 97233, OR.

      2. **West Coast Geography:** Washington is located north of Oregon on the West
      Coast of the United States.  Generally, locations further north will be further
      west on this part of the coast.

      3. **Specific Zip Codes:**  Even though Washington is generally west of Oregon,
      the curvature of the coastline means we can''t rely on just the states. We need
      more specific location information.  However, the general direction combined
      with the fact that 98580 is significantly further north than 97233 makes it
      highly probable that 98580, WA is west of 97233, OR.  A quick map check confirms
      this.

      states:** Pennsylvania (PA) is generally west of New York (NY).


      2. **Consider the zip codes within the states:** Zip codes increase from east
      to west.  15904 in PA is a higher number than 14214 in NY.


      3. **Combine the information:** Since PA is west of NY, and the PA zip code
      is higher than the NY zip code, this reinforces the idea that 15904, PA is west
      of 14214, NY.

      3. **Determine if the general west-east relationship of the states outweighs
      the zip code progression:** In this case, the difference in longitude between

      2. **US Geography:** Oregon is located south of Washington.  While there is

      further south, not necessarily west, of locations in Washington.

      3. **West implies Longitude:** The question asks about "west", which relates
      to longitude.  A location further west would have a lower longitude value.

      4. **Zip code locations are not precise, but indicative of general area.**  We
      can use zip codes to approximate location.


      Therefore, simply being in Oregon doesn''t automatically make 97223 west of

      2. **General US Geography:** Oregon is south of Washington, and both are on
      the West Coast.  However, the western border of Oregon and the western border
      of Washington are roughly aligned along the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, latitude
      isn''t the primary factor here, longitude is.

      3. **Relative position of the states:**  Washington is located north of Oregon.  While
      most of Oregon is east of most of Washington, locations on Oregon''s north border
      might be west of some locations in Washington state.  We need to consider the
      specific zip codes.
