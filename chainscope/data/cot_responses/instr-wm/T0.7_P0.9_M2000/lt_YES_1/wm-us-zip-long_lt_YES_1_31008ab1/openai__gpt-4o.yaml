      1. **Locate 46561**: Osceola, IN is a town in St. Joseph County, located in
      the northern part of Indiana near South Bend.


      2. **Locate 46237**: This zip code is in Indianapolis, which is in the central
      part of Indiana.


      3. **Compare the Longitudes**: Since we are interested in whether one location
      is west of another, longitude is the relevant measure. Locations with smaller
      longitude values are further west.


      - Osceola is in the northern part of Indiana, whereas Indianapolis is more central.
      However, northern Indiana is not necessarily more west than central Indiana.


      4. **Determine Relative Position**: By looking at a map or using a tool to check
      their longitudinal coordinates, we can determine their east-west relationship.


      - Osceola (46561) is actually east of Indianapolis (46237).

      (Mantua, NJ) is located west of the zip code 08318 (Elmer, NJ), we can follow
      these steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: Start by identifying the general areas of both zip
      codes. Zip code 08051 is in Mantua, NJ, and zip code 08318 is in Elmer, NJ.


      2. **Determine Geographic Orientation**: Look at the relative positions of these
      two locations. Using a map or geographical tool will help in identifying their
      longitudinal positions.


      3. **Compare Longitudes**: Longitude determines east-west positioning. Check
      the longitudes to see which location is further west.


      Upon checking a map or using geographical coordinates:


      - Mantua (08051) is located at a longitude of approximately -75.1741.

      - Elmer (08318) is located at a longitude of approximately -75.1727.


      4. **Conclusion**: Compare the longitudes. A more negative longitude indicates
      a location further west.


      Since -75.1741 (Mantua) is slightly more negative than -75.1727 (Elmer), Mantua
      is indeed slightly west of Elmer.


      Therefore, the answer is YES, 08051 is located west of 08318.'
