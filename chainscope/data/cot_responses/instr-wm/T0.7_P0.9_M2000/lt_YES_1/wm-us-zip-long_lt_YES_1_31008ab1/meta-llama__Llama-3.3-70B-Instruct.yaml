      \ \n   - 98580, WA refers to a zip code in the state of Washington.\n   - 97233,\
      \ OR refers to a zip code in the state of Oregon.\n\n2. **General Geographic\
      \ Location**:\n   - Washington (WA) is generally located north of Oregon (OR),\
      \ but since both states are in the Pacific Northwest, their longitudinal positions\
      \ (east-west) are relatively similar. However, we need to consider their specific\
      \ locations.\n\n3. **Specific Locations**:\n   - The zip code 98580 is associated\
      \ with the area around Rochester, Washington, which is southwest of Olympia,\
      \ the state capital.\n   - The zip code 97233 is associated with the Portland,\
      \ Oregon area.\n\n4. **Longitude Comparison**:\n   - To determine if one is\
      \ west of the other, we need to compare their longitudes. \n   - Without exact\
      \ longitude values, we can use general knowledge: Portland, OR, and the area\
      \ around Rochester, WA, are both in the Pacific Time Zone and are relatively\
      \ close in terms of east-west positioning, given their proximity.\n\n5. **Final\
      \ Consideration**:\n   - Given that the question is about being \"west of,\"\
      \ we need to consider that the longitudinal difference between these two locations\

      \ a whole is slightly west of Oregon due to the curvature of the coastline and\
      \ the general geography of the region.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Considering\
      \ that 98580, WA, is in the state of Washington, and given the general geography,\
      \ it's reasonable to conclude that it is indeed located west of 97233, OR, based\

      \n2. **General geographical knowledge:**\n   - Washington state is located north\
      \ of Oregon state.\n\n3. **Comparing the positions:**\n   - Since 98580, WA\
      \ is in Washington and 97233, OR is in Oregon, and considering that Washington\
      \ is generally north of Oregon, we cannot directly conclude east-west positions\
      \ based solely on the states. However, knowing the general geography of the\
      \ region:\n     - The western part of Oregon and the western part of Washington\

      \ think it's not possible to determine the east-west relationship. However,\
      \ considering the general layout of the two states, most of Washington is west\
      \ or northwest of most of Oregon, due to the shape and orientation of these\
      \ states along the Pacific coast.\n\n4. **Specific zip code locations:**\n \
      \  - 98580, WA corresponds to the area around Tumwater, Washington, which is\

      \ located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Washington is\
      \ situated north of Oregon.\n\n2. **Zip Code Structure**: US zip codes are 5-digit\

      follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations associated with the zip codes 02145 and 01864.**

      2. **Determine the geographical positions (east-west) of these locations relative
      to each other.**


      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - **02145** is associated with Boston, MA.

      - **01864** is associated with North Reading, MA.


      Next, we need to consider their geographical positions. Boston, MA (02145),
      is generally located near the eastern coast of Massachusetts. North Reading,
      MA (01864), is also in Massachusetts but located northwest of Boston.


      Given these positions:

      - Boston (02145) is near the coast, to the east.

      - North Reading (01864) is inland and to the northwest of Boston.


      Since northwest includes a component of "west," we can infer that North Reading
      (01864) is west of Boston (02145).


      Therefore, considering the question of whether 02145, MA is located west of
      01864, MA, the answer is **NO**, because 02145 (Boston) is actually east of
      01864 (North Reading).'

      \ of 60406, IL, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding US Zip Code\
      \ Structure**: US zip codes are structured to generally increase as one moves\
      \ west and north. The first digit represents a group of states, the next two\
      \ digits represent a regional area within that group, and the last two digits\
      \ represent a specific post office or area within that region.\n\n2. **Identifying\
      \ the Zip Codes**: We have two zip codes here - 60466 and 60406. Both are in\
      \ Illinois, so they share the same first three digits (\"604\"), which indicates\
      \ they are relatively close to each other geographically, at least at the regional\
      \ level.\n\n3. **Comparing the Last Two Digits**: The last two digits of a zip\
      \ code can provide more precise location information within a smaller geographic\
      \ area. For 60466, the last two digits are \"66\", and for 60406, they are \"\
      06\".\n\n4. **Determining Direction**: Generally, as the last two digits of\
      \ zip codes increase, the location moves further west or north, depending on\
      \ the context. However, this is not a strict rule and can vary significantly\
      \ due to the way zip codes were assigned. The assignment was often based on\
      \ the order in which postal facilities were established and the geographic features\
      \ of the area, rather than a purely grid-based system.\n\n5. **Specific Case\
      \ Analysis**: In the case of Illinois, particularly around the Chicago area\
      \ where these zip codes are likely located (given the \"604\" prefix), the layout\
      \ of zip codes does not strictly follow a linear west-north progression due\
      \ to the lake shore and other geographic features. \n\n6. **Conclusion Based\
      \ on Zip Code Comparison**: Without specific geographic knowledge of these areas,\
      \ one might mistakenly assume that because 66 is greater than 06, 60466 must\
      \ be west of 60406. However, zip code progression does not strictly adhere to\
      \ cardinal directions in all areas, especially near large bodies of water or\
      \ in densely populated regions like the Chicago metropolitan area.\n\n7. **Actual\
      \ Geographic Locations**: \n   - 60406 corresponds to the area around Calumet\
      \ City, IL.\n   - 60466 corresponds to the area around Park Forest, IL.\n\n\
      8. **Final Analysis**: Park Forest (60466) is actually located southwest of\
      \ Calumet City (60406), but given the context of the question (west of), we\
      \ must consider if \"southwest\" qualifies as \"west\". In geographic terms,\
      \ southwest includes a westerly direction, but the question seems to ask for\
      \ a direct westward comparison.\n\nGiven these steps, the question asks for\
      \ a simple YES or NO answer regarding if 60466 is located west of 60406. While\
      \ 60466 is not directly west but rather southwest of 60406, the spirit of the\
      \ question seems to seek a directional relationship rather than an exact cardinal\
      \ direction. However, to adhere strictly to the question's wording and common\
      \ geographic understanding:\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{NO}$"

      of 60406, IL, let''s break down the process step by step:


      1. **Understand the Zip Code Format**: US zip codes are generally divided into
      regions. The first digit represents a group of states, the next two digits represent
      a regional area within that group, and the last two digits represent a specific
      post office or area within that region.


      2. **Identify the Region**: Both zip codes start with "604", which indicates
      they are in the same general region, specifically in Illinois.


      3. **Compare the Next Two Digits**: The next two digits ("66" for 60466 and
      "06" for 60406) can help identify the specific area within the region. However,
      without specific knowledge of Illinois'' zip code layout, we might assume that
      lower numbers could be more eastward or southward and higher numbers more westward
      or northward, but this is not always a reliable method without knowing the specific
      geographic distribution of zip codes in Illinois.


      4. **Research or Knowledge of Illinois Geography**: To accurately determine
      the location, one would ideally need to know the geography of Illinois or have
      access to a map that shows the locations of these zip codes. However, we can
      make an educated guess based on common practices in zip code assignment.


      5. **General Rule of Thumb**: In many areas, zip codes are assigned in a way
      that generally increases as you move west or north. However, this is not a hard
      and fast rule and can vary greatly depending on the area.


      6. **Specific Case of 60466 and 60406**: Without specific knowledge, one might
      guess that 60466 could be west of 60406 based on the higher number, assuming
      the numbering increases as one moves west. However, this is speculative without
      concrete evidence or a map.


      Given these steps and the speculative nature of determining westward location
      based solely on zip code numbers without a map, the most accurate approach would
      be to consult a detailed map of Illinois that includes zip code boundaries.
      However, based on general principles and without specific knowledge of Illinois''
      zip code distribution:

      1. **Understanding Zip Code Structure**: US zip codes are 5-digit numbers. The
      first digit represents a group of states, the next two digits represent a regional
      area within that group, and the final two digits represent a specific post office
      or area within that region.


      2. **Comparing Zip Codes**: When comparing two zip codes, we look at their digits

      the locations are likely to be. However, the exact geographic relationship (north,
      south, east, west) cannot be directly inferred from the zip code alone without
      knowing the specific geographic area they cover.


      3. **Specifics of Nevada Zip Codes**: Both 89509 and 89506 are in Nevada, which
      means they share the same first three digits (895), indicating they are in the

      zip codes are not strictly assigned in a linear geographic pattern (e.g., strictly
      from east to west or north to south), we cannot assume that a higher number
      always means a location is to the west.

      \ County, we need to determine their relative positions. \n\n5. **Geographical\
      \ Comparison**: \n   - Santa Fe Springs (90710) is generally located more inland\
      \ and slightly north compared to Gardena (90247), which is closer to the coast\
      \ and more southwards in the LA metropolitan area.\n\n6. **Westward Comparison**:\
      \ Given the geography of the Los Angeles area, moving westward typically means\
      \ moving towards the Pacific Ocean from inland areas.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\
      \ Based on their locations within Los Angeles County, 90710 (Santa Fe Springs)\
      \ is more inland (east) compared to 90247 (Gardena), which is closer to the\

      the steps needed:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations associated
      with the zip codes 07432 and 07105 in New Jersey.


      2. **07432 Location**: The zip code 07432 is associated with Midland Park, New
      Jersey.


      3. **07105 Location**: The zip code 07105 is associated with Newark, New Jersey.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Now, we need to compare the geographical locations
      of Midland Park (07432) and Newark (07105) in terms of east-west orientation.


      5. **Geographical Orientation**: Newark, New Jersey (07105) is located in Essex
      County, which is in the northeastern part of the state. Midland Park, New Jersey
      (07432), is located in Bergen County, which is also in the northeastern part
      of the state but is situated northwest of Newark.


      6. **Determine Westward Location**: Given that Midland Park is northwest of
      Newark, it is indeed located west (and slightly north) of Newark.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether 07432, NJ is located west of 07105,
      NJ is: **YES**.'

      \ within that group, and the final two digits represent a specific post office\
      \ or area within that region.\n\n2. **New Jersey Zip Code Prefixes**: New Jersey's\
      \ zip codes start with 07, 08, or 09 (with 09 being less common and often associated\

      \ locations.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Considering Pennsylvania is north and\
      \ somewhat west due to its broader geographical span compared to Florida, but\
      \ acknowledging the question's specificity about zip codes, we must consider\
      \ the general geography. However, it's crucial to understand that being \"north\"\
      \ does not inherently mean being \"west\" in this context. The determining factor\
      \ is the longitude of each zip code, but given general knowledge, Pennsylvania\
      \ can extend more to the west than Florida's westernmost point.\n\n7. **Final\
      \ step - considering the geography**:\n   - Since Pennsylvania can be west of\
      \ parts of Florida due to its geographical extent and the shape of the U.S.,\
      \ the specific zip codes must be considered. However, without exact longitude\
      \ comparisons, we rely on general geographical principles. Given Pennsylvania's\
      \ position relative to Florida, it's plausible for parts of Pennsylvania to\
      \ be west of parts of Florida, especially considering their east coast locations\
      \ and the fact that Pennsylvania extends further west than Florida.\n\nBased\
      \ on these steps, the decision hinges on the understanding that while Pennsylvania\
      \ is generally north of Florida, parts of it can indeed be west of Florida due\
      \ to the U.S.'s geography. Therefore, considering the possibility and without\
      \ precise longitude data for each zip code:\n\nThe answer is: YES"

      \ a group of states, the next two digits represent a regional area within that\
      \ group, and the last two digits represent a specific post office or area within\
      \ that region.\n\n2. **Identifying the Location**: Both zip codes (85338 and\
      \ 85395) start with \"853\", which means they are in the same regional area\
      \ (Arizona, in this case). The next two digits (\"3\" for 85338 and \"9\" for\
      \ 85395) further narrow down the location but are still within the same broader\
      \ region.\n\n3. **Comparing the Zip Codes**: \n   - **85338**: The \"38\" suggests\
      \ it is located in a specific area within Arizona.\n   - **85395**: The \"95\"\
      \ suggests it is in another specific area within Arizona.\n\n4. **Determining\
      \ East/West Location**: Generally, as you move west in the US, the zip code\
      \ numbers tend to increase within a state or region when comparing areas that\
      \ are directly east-west of each other. However, zip code assignments don't\
      \ strictly follow latitude or longitude in a simple linear fashion, and there\
      \ can be overlaps and irregularities based on population density, postal routes,\

      Given the process, let''s apply it:


      - Zip code 85338 is associated with the city of Maricopa, Arizona.

      - Zip code 85395 is associated with the city of Goodyear, Arizona.

    8d9236ea-5604-4ef2-825b-44a107306dc2: 'To answer this question, we''ll follow
      these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Determine the general geographic locations associated
      with the zip codes 28804 and 33625.

      2. **Compare locations**: Compare the locations to determine if one is west
      of the other.


      **Step 1: Identify the locations**


      - **28804, NC**: This zip code is located in North Carolina. North Carolina
      is on the East Coast of the United States.

      - **33625, FL**: This zip code is located in Florida. Florida is also on the
      East Coast of the United States, situated to the south of North Carolina.


      **Step 2: Compare locations**


      Given that both zip codes are on the East Coast, we need to consider their relative
      positions:

      - North Carolina (NC) is generally north and slightly west of Florida (FL),
      but when considering the entire states, parts of North Carolina can be west
      of parts of Florida due to the shape and orientation of the states. However,
      the specific locations of these zip codes need to be considered for an accurate
      comparison.


      Since both zip codes are on the eastern seaboard and relatively close in a north-south
      alignment, determining if one is strictly west of the other requires precise
      geographic knowledge. However, in general terms, North Carolina is north of
      Florida, and while parts of North Carolina may extend westward beyond Florida''s
      westernmost point, the question is about these specific zip codes.


      **Conclusion**:


      Given the general geographic information and without precise coordinates or
      maps to determine the exact westward extent of these specific locations, we
      can still reason about their general positions. North Carolina is north of Florida,
      and while it''s possible for parts of North Carolina to be west of parts of
      Florida due to their shapes, the specific zip codes provided would need to be
      directly compared.


      However, considering typical geographic knowledge and the fact that these are
      specific zip codes which likely reflect urban or populated areas within their
      respective states, it''s reasonable to infer that 28804 (Asheville, NC) is indeed
      located west of 33625 (Tampa, FL) when considering their positions on a map.
      Asheville, NC, is in the western part of North Carolina, and Tampa, FL, is on
      the west coast of Florida but more to the south and likely east of Asheville''s
      longitude.

      \ of 20785, MD, we need to understand the general layout of the US zip code\
      \ system and how it applies to Maryland.\n\n1. **Understanding US Zip Codes**:\
      \ US zip codes are assigned based on geographic locations, with the first digit\
      \ representing a group of states. For Maryland, the first digit is always '2'.\
      \ The next two digits represent a regional area within that group, and the last\
      \ two digits represent a specific post office or area within that regional area.\n\
      \n2. **Analyzing the Zip Codes**: \n   - The zip code 21044 is in the '210'\
      \ regional area.\n   - The zip code 20785 is in the '207' regional area.\n\n\
      3. **General Geographic Layout of Maryland Zip Codes**: Generally, as you move\
      \ west in Maryland, the zip codes can change in a way that reflects the geographic\
      \ movement. However, zip codes are not strictly linear and can jump around based\
      \ on the specific post office assignments and historical reasons.\n\n4. **Specific\
      \ Location of 21044 and 20785**:\n   - Without specific geographic knowledge,\
      \ one might assume that lower numbers could be more east or south and higher\
      \ numbers more west or north, but this is not always the case.\n   - Looking\
      \ at a map or knowing the areas, 21044 corresponds to the area around Jacksonsville/Cockeysville,\
      \ Maryland.\n   - 20785 corresponds to the area around Hyattsville, Maryland.\n\
      \n5. **Relative Locations**:\n   - Hyattsville (20785) is located in Prince\
      \ George's County, near Washington D.C., which is more towards the southern\
      \ part of Maryland.\n   - Jacksonsville/Cockeysville (21044) is located in Baltimore\
      \ County, which is more north but can be considered more west than areas directly\
      \ adjacent to Washington D.C. like Hyattsville, given Maryland's shape and orientation.\n\
      \n6. **Conclusion**: Considering the geographic locations and the layout of\
      \ Maryland, 21044, MD (around Jacksonsville/Cockeysville) is generally located\
      \ north and slightly west of 20785, MD (around Hyattsville), especially considering\

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations associated
      with the zip codes 46561 and 46237 in Indiana.


      2. **Geographic Location of 46561**: The zip code 46561 is associated with the
      city of Osceola, Indiana. Osceola is located in St. Joseph County.

      2. **Identifying Locations**:\n   - **46561, IN**: This zip code is located\

      \ The \"4\" again indicates the state group, \"62\" specifies the region within\
      \ Indiana, and \"37\" the specific post office or area.\n\n3. **Comparing Locations**:\n\
      \   - To compare the two locations, we look at the regional area digits (\"\
      65\" for 46561 and \"62\" for 46237). Generally, as you move west in the United\
      \ States, the first digit of the zip code might increase (though this is not\
      \ a hard rule due to the irregular distribution of zip codes), but within the\
      \ same state or region, lower numbers can indicate areas to the east or southeast.\n\
      \   - Specifically, for Indiana, the \"62\" prefix is associated with the Indianapolis\
      \ area, which is in the central part of the state. The \"65\" prefix is associated\
      \ with areas to the north and slightly east of the central part of the state,\
      \ but considering the context of the entire state, areas with the \"65\" prefix\

      \ office or delivery area.\n\n3. **Geographical Orientation**:\n   - Generally,\
      \ as you move west in the United States, the zip code numbers tend to increase.\
      \ However, within a state like New Jersey, which is relatively small and narrow,\
      \ the geographical orientation (east-west) is less straightforward based solely\

      \ or Northeast region, depending on the context.\n   - Florida is located in\
      \ the southeastern United States.\n\n3. **Relative Positions**:\n   - Generally,\
      \ West Virginia is northwest of Florida. However, the question is about being\
      \ \"west,\" which requires a more precise consideration of their geographic\
      \ positions.\n\n4. **Longitude Comparison**:\n   - To determine if one location\
      \ is west of another, we compare their longitudes. Locations with lower longitude\
      \ values are to the west of those with higher longitude values.\n   - The longitude\

    312b739b-88b1-4e13-a810-b291a796ae16: 'To answer this question, I need to follow
      these steps:


      1. Identify the locations of the zip codes 08863 and 07068 in New Jersey.

      2. Determine their relative positions, specifically whether 08863 is west of
      07068.


      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - 08863 corresponds to Fords, New Jersey.

      - 07068 corresponds to Roseland, New Jersey.


      Next, we need to understand the geographical layout of New Jersey to determine
      the relative positions of these locations.


      New Jersey can be divided into several regions, but for simplicity, we can consider
      it in terms of its western, central, and eastern parts. The western part of
      New Jersey is closer to Pennsylvania, while the eastern part is closer to New
      York City and the Atlantic Ocean.


      Fords, NJ (08863), is located in Middlesex County, which is in the central part
      of New Jersey but leans towards the eastern side of the state.


      Roseland, NJ (07068), is located in Essex County, which is also in the northeastern
      part of New Jersey, closer to New York City.


      Given these locations:

      - Fords (08863) is generally east or southeast of Roseland (07068) because Middlesex
      County (where Fords is located) is south and slightly east of Essex County (where
      Roseland is located).


      Therefore, considering the general geography of New Jersey and the locations
      of these zip codes, 08863 (Fords, NJ) is not west of 07068 (Roseland, NJ).


      The answer is: NO'

      of 85745, AZ, we need to understand how US zip codes are structured and what
      their sequence implies about geographical location.


      1. **Understanding Zip Code Structure**: US zip codes are 5-digit codes. The
      first digit represents a group of states, the next two digits represent a regional
      area within that group, and the last two digits represent a specific post office
      or area within that region.


      2. **Geographical Implication**: Generally, zip codes are assigned in a way
      that increases numerically from east to west and north to south, though this
      is not a hard and fast rule due to the irregular boundaries of geographical
      areas and the historical development of postal services. However, within a specific
      region or city, this pattern can often be observed.


      3. **Specific Zip Codes**: The zip codes in question, 85746 and 85745, are both
      in Arizona (AZ), which means they share the first three digits (857) and differ
      only in the last two digits.


      4. **Comparison**: Given that these zip codes are in close proximity (differing
      by only one digit), we can infer that they are likely adjacent or very near
      to each other geographically. However, without specific knowledge of Tucson''s
      zip code layout, we must rely on the general principle that lower numbers tend
      to be east or south of higher numbers in the same prefix.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general principles of zip code assignment, 85746
      would be expected to be west (or possibly north) of 85745 because it has a higher
      number. However, without exact geographical data or a map, this conclusion relies
      on the typical pattern of zip code assignments.

      of 85745, AZ, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Understanding Zip Code Structure**: US zip codes are structured to facilitate
      mail sorting and delivery. The first digit represents a group of states, the
      next two digits represent a regional area within that group, and the final two
      digits represent a specific post office or area within that region. Sometimes,
      the last two digits are sequential for areas that are close to each other.


      2. **Analyzing the Given Zip Codes**: Both zip codes, 85746 and 85745, start
      with "857", which means they are in the same regional area. The difference lies
      in the last two digits: 46 and 45.


      3. **Determining Geographic Location from Zip Codes**: In general, as the last
      two digits of zip codes increase, the location moves eastward or in a direction
      that the postal service has designated for efficient mail delivery, not strictly
      according to geographic coordinates. However, this is a general rule and not
      always strictly applied, as zip code assignments can depend on various factors
      including the existing infrastructure, population density, and the specific
      needs of mail delivery in an area.


      4. **Considering the Specific Case of 85746 and 85745**: Given the sequential
      nature of these zip codes, it suggests they are close to each other. However,
      without specific knowledge of the area, one might infer that 85746 could be
      located east of 85745 based on the general principle that higher numbers often
      (but not always) indicate an area further east within the same prefix.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Reasoning**: Given the sequential increase from 85745
      to 85746, and applying the general principle that higher numbers in zip codes
      can indicate an area that is further east (though this is not a hard and fast
      rule), we can infer that 85746 is likely not west of 85745 but rather could
      be to the east or in a direction that is not strictly west, based on typical
      postal service numbering conventions.

    9e31c6a5-030a-4839-9f4e-fe1554e8e0c6: 'To answer this question, we''ll go through
      the steps of reasoning:


      1. **Understanding Zip Codes**: US zip codes are geographic codes used by the
      United States Postal Service (USPS) to identify specific areas or regions within
      the country. Generally, the first digit of a zip code represents a group of
      states, the next two digits represent a regional area within those states, and
      the final two digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.


      2. **Zip Code Structure**: The structure of zip codes (XXXXX) can give us clues
      about the relative locations of different areas. However, the last two digits
      (in this case, 46 and 45) are assigned based on the post office''s serving area
      and not strictly on geographic location. This means the sequence of numbers
      does not always directly correlate with geographic proximity or direction.


      3. **Specific Locations**: To determine if 85746, AZ is located west of 85745,
      AZ, we need to understand the specific geography of these zip codes. Without
      a detailed map, one might assume that because the numbers are sequential (45
      and 46), they could be close to each other. However, the actual geographic relationship
      depends on how these zip codes were assigned and the layout of the surrounding
      area.


      4. **Zip Code Assignment**: Zip codes are assigned based on the needs of mail
      delivery. They do not follow a strict grid or pattern that directly correlates
      with compass directions (north, south, east, west). Instead, they are often
      assigned in the order in which areas were developed or based on the mail delivery
      routes.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Given Information**: Given that we do not have specific
      geographic details about the layout of these zip codes in relation to each other,
      and knowing that zip code assignments do not strictly follow geographic directions,
      we cannot make an assumption based solely on the numbers. However, for the purpose
      of this exercise, we need to provide a YES or NO answer, which requires actual
      knowledge of the specific zip codes'' locations.


      6. **Actual Location Knowledge**: Without access to a map or database that shows
      the exact boundaries of these zip codes, one cannot definitively say based on
      the zip codes alone. However, in reality, one would consult a map to determine
      the locations. For the sake of providing an answer, let''s proceed under the
      understanding that this step involves recognizing the necessity of external
      knowledge (like a map) to accurately answer the question.

      west of 85745, AZ, let''s break down the steps to understand how zip codes work
      and how they are organized.


      1. **Understanding Zip Codes**: US zip codes are a series of numbers used by
      the United States Postal Service (USPS) to identify geographic locations. They
      are typically 5 digits long, sometimes with an additional 4 digits to specify
      a more precise location within a zip code area.


      2. **Zip Code Layout**: Zip codes are organized in a way that generally corresponds
      to geographic locations from east to west and north to south. The first digit
      represents a group of states, the next two digits more specifically represent
      a regional area within those states, and the final two digits pinpoint a post
      office or a specific area within that region.


      3. **Regional Focus**: For Arizona, the first digit of the zip code is ''8''.
      The next two digits (''57'' in this case) further narrow down the geographic
      area within Arizona. The last two digits (''46'' and ''45'') are what we need
      to focus on for determining the relative locations of these two zip codes.


      4. **Determining Location**: In the context of US geography and zip code organization,
      moving west typically involves moving to a higher number, given the general
      layout of zip codes across the country. However, within a specific region like
      Arizona, the relationship between zip code numbers and geographic location (east-west
      or north-south) can be more complex and depends on the specific allocation of
      zip codes by the USPS.


      5. **Specific Zip Codes in Question**: The zip codes 85746 and 85745 are both
      in Arizona and share the same first three digits (''857''). This indicates they
      are in the same general area. The difference lies in the last digit, with ''6''
      being greater than ''5''.


      Given these steps and considering the general principles of zip code organization,
      we can infer that a higher number typically (but not always) corresponds to
      a location further west within the same general geographic area, assuming the
      allocations follow a logical pattern that mirrors the geographic layout. However,

      3. **Determining Geographic Location**: The last two digits of a zip code can
      give us clues about the relative location of one area to another, but they do
      not directly indicate direction (north, south, east, west). However, in some
      cases, zip codes are assigned in a way that reflects the geographic sequence
      of areas. For instance, in urban areas, lower numbered zip codes might be closer

      4. **Specific Case of 85746 and 85745**: Without specific knowledge of the Tucson,
      AZ area (since 857XX zip codes are associated with Tucson), one might assume
      that the difference in the last digit could indicate a sequence or pattern.
      However, zip code assignments are based on postal routes and efficiency rather
      than strict geographic sequencing.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the information available and without specific geographic
      details about the areas covered by 85746 and 85745, we cannot definitively say

    fff5a33c-e864-4fdc-9b2d-80e6f8c1f692: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Understanding Zip Codes**: US zip codes are geographic codes used by the
      United States Postal Service (USPS) to identify specific areas within the country.
      The first digit of a zip code represents a group of states, the next two digits
      represent a regional area within those states, and the final two digits represent
      a specific post office or area within that region.


      2. **Analyzing the Given Zip Codes**: The zip codes provided are 85746 and 85745,
      both located in Arizona (AZ). Since the first three digits (857) are the same
      for both zip codes, they are in the same general area.


      3. **Determining Geographic Location**: To determine if 85746 is west of 85745,
      we need to understand how zip codes are organized geographically. Generally,
      zip codes increase as you move east and decrease as you move west in the same
      general area, but this is not a strict rule and can vary significantly depending
      on the local geography and how zip codes were originally assigned.


      4. **Specific Case of Tucson, AZ**: Tucson, Arizona, uses zip codes in the 857xx
      range. Without specific knowledge of how these zip codes are laid out in Tucson,
      one might assume that higher numbers could be located to the east due to the
      general eastward increase in zip code numbers. However, actual geographic locations
      can vary based on the city''s layout and how zip codes were assigned.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Logic**: Given the information and the general principle
      that higher zip code numbers might indicate a location further to the east in
      the same region (though this is not always true), one could logically infer
      that 85746 might be east of 85745, assuming the typical pattern holds in this
      specific case. However, this assumption may not always be accurate without specific
      knowledge of the area''s zip code layout.


      Given these considerations and the potential for variation in how zip codes

      \ part of the US, more specifically in northeastern Ohio when considering the\
      \ state.\n   - **44023**: Starts with \"440\", indicating it is also in northeastern\
      \ Ohio but slightly different in the regional area compared to \"446\".\n\n\
      4. **Determine east-west location**: \n   - Generally, as you move west in the\

    61a1b079-54ca-4eff-b4e0-31a4e968552c: "To determine if 97459, OR is located west\
      \ of 98569, WA, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the States**:\
      \ First, we note the states involved. OR stands for Oregon, and WA stands for\
      \ Washington. Both states are in the Pacific Northwest region of the United\
      \ States.\n\n2. **General Geographic Location**: Next, we consider the general\
      \ geographic location of Oregon and Washington. Oregon is located south of Washington.\n\
      \n3. **Specific Zip Code Locations**: \n   - The zip code 97459 is in Oregon.\
      \ To be more precise, we need to look up the specific location. 97459 corresponds\
      \ to North Bend, Oregon, which is on the coast.\n   - The zip code 98569 is\
      \ in Washington. Looking up this zip code, we find it corresponds to Lacey,\
      \ Washington, which is not on the coast but is inland, near the state capital\
      \ Olympia.\n\n4. **Relative Positions**: \n   - Since Oregon is south of Washington,\
      \ any point in Oregon is going to be south of any point in Washington, not west.\
      \ However, we must consider the longitudinal positions as well because \"west\"\
      \ refers to a position in terms of longitude.\n   - Oregon and Washington share\
      \ a border, and their longitudes overlap. The question of whether one is west\
      \ of the other depends on specific longitudes.\n\n5. **Longitudinal Comparison**:\n\
      \   - Without exact longitudes, we can reason generally: for two places to be\
      \ one west of the other, they need to be at different longitudes. Given the\
      \ geography of the region, it's possible for parts of Oregon to be west of parts\
      \ of Washington due to the states' shapes and the fact that they border each\
      \ other.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: \n   - To give a definitive answer, we'd ideally\
      \ compare the longitudes of the two zip codes. However, given that both states\
      \ are in the Pacific Northwest and their geography, the critical factor is not\
      \ just their north-south relationship but their east-west (longitude) relationship.\n\
      \nGiven these steps and without precise longitude data provided here, the most\
      \ straightforward approach to answer the question is to recognize that Oregon\
      \ (OR) is generally south of Washington (WA), but parts of Oregon can indeed\
      \ be west of parts of Washington due to their geographic layout. \n\nHowever,\
      \ the question asks for a YES or NO answer based on the zip codes provided.\
      \ Given that 97459 (Oregon) could potentially be west of 98569 (Washington)\
      \ depending on their exact longitudes, and considering typical geographic knowledge\
      \ might not suffice for a precise longitudinal comparison without looking up\
      \ the exact coordinates, the question essentially tests understanding of geographic\
      \ relationships.\n\nSince Oregon is to the south but can extend westward of\
      \ Washington in some areas due to the irregular borders and the fact that these\
      \ states are adjacent, the possibility exists. But, for a definitive answer,\
      \ one must consider that \"west of\" in geographic terms usually refers to longitude.\
      \ \n\nGiven the typical layout and without specific longitudinal data, the general\
      \ assumption might lean towards considering the relative positions of these\
      \ states and recognizing the potential overlap in their longitudes. \n\nThus,\
      \ considering a general understanding and the steps outlined, the answer to\
      \ whether 97459, OR is located west of 98569, WA, requires specific geographic\
      \ data for a definitive yes or no. However, acknowledging the complexity and\
      \ the fact that parts of Oregon can indeed be west of parts of Washington, the\
      \ inclination based on geographic principles and the nature of the question\
      \ might suggest a potential for \"yes\" if considering longitude alone. \n\n\
      But, to provide a clear YES or NO as requested, and acknowledging the complexity\
      \ of geographic comparisons without exact data:\n\nYES."

      \ zip code locations**:\n   - **97459, OR**: This zip code is associated with\

      \ coast but are in different states and latitudes. To determine if 97459, OR\
      \ is west of 98569, WA, we need to consider their longitudinal positions (east-west).\
      \ Given that Oregon is generally west of Washington, the critical factor here\

      \ the coast, the specific question of whether 97459, OR is west of 98569, WA\

      - 08318, NJ corresponds to the town of Corbin City, New Jersey.


      Step 2: Determine the geographical locations of these towns.

      - Merchantville, NJ is located in Camden County, near Philadelphia, PA.

      - Corbin City, NJ is located in Atlantic County, near the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Merchantville, NJ (08051) is generally northwest of Corbin City, NJ (08318),

      \ represent a regional area within that group, and the last two digits represent\
      \ a specific post office or area within that region.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Given\
      \ Zip Codes**: \n   - 75652, TX\n   - 75601, TX\n\n   Both zip codes start with\
      \ \"756\", which means they are in the same regional area within Texas. The\
      \ difference lies in the last two digits: \"52\" for the first zip code and\
      \ \"01\" for the second.\n\n3. **Determining Location**: \n   - Generally, as\
      \ you move west in the US, the zip code numbers do not necessarily increase\
      \ or decrease in a straightforward manner because zip codes are assigned based\
      \ on the postal service's needs and the geography of the area. However, within\
      \ a specific regional area (as indicated by the first three digits being the\
      \ same), lower numbers often (but not always) indicate more eastern or southern\
      \ locations, while higher numbers might indicate more western or northern locations,\
      \ depending on the specific area's layout and how the postal service chose to\
      \ assign codes.\n\n4. **Specific Case Analysis**:\n   - Without specific knowledge\
      \ of the exact locations of these zip codes, one might infer based on the general\
      \ structure that 75652 could potentially be west of 75601, given that \"52\"\
      \ is a higher number than \"01\". However, this is not a foolproof method for\
      \ determining location, as zip code assignments can be irregular and based on\
      \ many factors, including the order in which areas were developed and the postal\
      \ routes.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the information provided and general\
      \ knowledge about how zip codes work, it's tempting to make an educated guess.\
      \ However, the most accurate way to determine if 75652, TX is west of 75601,\
      \ TX would be to look at a map or consult a database that provides the exact\
      \ locations of these zip codes.\n\nGiven the steps and the need for precise\
      \ location data, the most informed answer without accessing external data would\
      \ be speculative. However, acknowledging the general principle that within the\
      \ same prefix, higher numbers might sometimes indicate a location further west\
      \ (though this is not a reliable rule), one might lean towards a speculative\
      \ \"yes\" based on the higher number of 75652 compared to 75601, but this is\
      \ highly speculative without actual location data.\n\n**YES**"

      1. **Understand the Zip Code Structure**: US zip codes are generally structured

      states, the next two digits represent a regional area within that group, and
      the last two digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.


      2. **Identify the Regional Area**: Both zip codes, 91764 and 91701, start with
      "917", which means they are in the same regional area in California.


      3. **Compare the Last Two Digits**: The difference lies in the last two digits,
      "64" for 91764 and "01" for 91701. Given the structure, lower numbers tend to
      be west or south, and higher numbers tend to be east or north within the same
      regional area.


      4. **Apply Geographical Knowledge**: Knowing that zip codes increase as you
      move east (and in some cases, north), we can deduce that a higher number within
      the same prefix area tends to be further east (or north) than a lower number.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Zip Code Comparison**: Since 91764 has a higher number
      ("64") than 91701 ("01"), it suggests that 91764 is located east (or possibly
      north, depending on the specific geographical layout of the area) of 91701,

      \ Codes**: US zip codes are 5-digit codes that identify specific geographic\
      \ locations within the United States. The first digit represents a group of\
      \ states, the next two digits represent a regional area within that group, and\
      \ the last two digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.\n\

      \ \"7\", which generally represents states in the south-central United States,\
      \ including Texas. The next two digits, \"60\", further narrow down the location\

      \ Northwest, and it is located north of Oregon.\n\n3. **Compare the locations**:\n\
      \   - Since Oregon is south of Washington, any point in Oregon is generally\

    2b9029a0-d589-47ff-8528-1f33644792fd: 'To determine if 03070, NH is located west
      of 03057, NH, we need to understand the structure of US zip codes and how they
      relate to geographic locations. US zip codes are generally assigned in a way
      that increases as you move east and north. The first digit of a zip code represents
      a group of states, the next two digits represent a regional area within that
      group, and the final two digits represent a specific post office or area within
      that region.


      1. **Identify the Region**: Both zip codes (03070 and 03057) start with "03",
      which means they are in the same regional area, specifically New Hampshire.


      2. **Compare the Next Two Digits**: The next two digits ("07" for 03070 and
      "05" for 03057) indicate the specific area within New Hampshire. Since "07"
      is greater than "05", the area represented by 03070 is generally east and/or
      north of the area represented by 03057, given the overall structure of zip code
      assignment.


      3. **Determine the Direction**: Given that 03070 is east and/or north of 03057
      based on the zip code structure, we need to consider if it could also be west.
      However, the zip code system does not directly indicate westward movement with
      increasing numbers in this context. The question is asking specifically about
      westward location.


      Based on the steps above, since 03070 is generally considered to be east and/or
      north of 03057 due to the higher numerical value in the context of US zip code
      structure, it is not west of 03057.

      west of 77029, TX, we need to follow a few steps:


      1. **Understanding Zip Codes**: US zip codes are geographic codes used to identify
      specific areas within the United States. They are usually 5 digits long and
      can provide information about the general location of an area, including its
      state and approximate position within that state.


      2. **Location of Zip Codes**: The first digit of a zip code represents a group
      of states. For both 77075 and 77029, the first digit "7" indicates they are
      in the southern group of states. The next two digits, "70" in both cases, further
      narrow down the location to Texas, specifically the Houston area.


      3. **Specific Location Identification**: The last two digits of a zip code can
      indicate a specific post office, group of streets, or even side of a street
      in urban areas. The difference in these digits between 77075 and 77029 suggests
      they are in different but possibly adjacent areas.


      4. **Determining Direction**: To determine if 77075 is west of 77029, we would
      ideally need a map or detailed knowledge of the Houston area''s zip code layout.
      However, knowing that zip codes are generally assigned in a somewhat sequential
      manner as one moves from east to west or north to south, we might infer the
      relative positions of these zip codes based on their numbers.


      5. **Research or Local Knowledge**: Without specific knowledge of the Houston
      area or access to a detailed map, one might not be able to definitively say
      which direction 77075 is from 77029 based solely on the zip codes. However,
      for the purpose of this exercise, we can consider general knowledge about how
      zip codes are structured and the geography of the area.


      Given these steps, and assuming we don''t have immediate access to a map but
      are familiar with how zip codes are structured and the general layout of the
      Houston area, we can attempt to deduce the relative positions. However, without
      explicit knowledge or a reference, the precise relationship (west, east, north,
      south) between 77075 and 77029 cannot be accurately determined through reasoning
      alone based on the zip codes themselves.


      For an accurate answer, one would typically consult a map or a database that
      correlates zip codes with geographic locations. Assuming such a consultation
      was made and based on the actual geographic locations:

      \ Zip Codes**: Without direct knowledge of the area or specific zip code maps,\
      \ one might assume that lower numbers could be to the west and higher numbers\
      \ to the east, or vice versa, based on some general patterns observed in certain\

      \ US zip codes are geographic codes used by the United States Postal Service\

      \ this assumption does not hold within the same city or region, as zip code\
      \ assignments are based on postal routes and area divisions rather than strict\
      \ geographic progression.\n\n6. **Actual Locations**:\n   - To give a definitive\
      \ answer, one needs to know the exact locations associated with 63111 and 63113.\
      \ \n   - 63111 is associated with St. Louis, MO, specifically areas around the\
      \ city.\n   - 63113 is also in St. Louis, MO, but the exact neighborhood or\
      \ area might differ.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for specific geographic\
      \ knowledge, the general rule of thumb for zip codes increasing as one moves\
      \ west does not apply in a straightforward manner within the same region or\
      \ city. \n\n**Actual Geographic Data**:\n- 63111, MO is located in the city\
      \ of St. Louis, MO.\n- 63113, MO is also in St. Louis, MO, but slightly to the\
      \ east or in a different part of the city.\n\n**Final Step - Determining the\
      \ Answer**:\nGiven that both zip codes are in St. Louis and considering the\
      \ layout of the city, without exact coordinates, one might rely on general knowledge\
      \ or mapping tools to determine their relative positions. \n\nHowever, based\
      \ on typical postal area divisions, 63111 is not strictly west of 63113 based\
      \ on their designations alone without additional geographic context.\n\n**YES\
      \ / NO Answer**:\nNO"
    3c140dac-8dac-45ba-9cba-1e193d9bd5eb: "To answer this question, let's break it\
      \ down into steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to understand\
      \ what the zip codes 63111 and 63113 refer to. Both are zip codes in the state\
      \ of Missouri (MO).\n\n2. **Geographical Context**: Knowing that these zip codes\
      \ are in Missouri, we should consider the general geography of the area. Missouri\
      \ is a state located in the Midwestern United States.\n\n3. **Zip Code Structure**:\
      \ In the United States, zip codes are structured to increase numerically as\
      \ you move east and north. However, the exact geographical location (east-west,\
      \ north-south) within a state or region can depend on the specific zip code\
      \ assignments, which don't always follow a perfect linear progression due to\
      \ historical, logistical, and geographical factors.\n\n4. **Specific Zip Codes**:\
      \ \n   - **63111**: This zip code is associated with Saint Louis, MO.\n   -\
      \ **63113**: This zip code is also associated with Saint Louis, MO.\n\n5. **Relative\
      \ Positions**: Since both zip codes are in Saint Louis, Missouri, we need to\
      \ determine their relative positions within the city. Saint Louis is not a vast\
      \ city in terms of east-west span compared to its north-south dimension, but\
      \ specific neighborhoods and areas can be designated by different zip codes.\n\
      \n6. **Research or Knowledge of Saint Louis Geography**: Without specific knowledge\
      \ of the layout of Saint Louis or access to a detailed map, one might assume\
      \ that the difference in zip codes could indicate different areas of the city.\
      \ However, the actual east-west positioning would depend on the specific assignment\
      \ of these zip codes within the city's layout.\n\n7. **Conclusion Based on Available\
      \ Data**: Given that both zip codes are in Saint Louis and without detailed\
      \ geographical information on the exact locations of 63111 and 63113 within\
      \ the city, one might typically need to consult a map or database that lists\
      \ zip codes by geographical coordinates or relative positions.\n\nHowever, considering\
      \ typical practices in zip code assignment and the fact that these zip codes\
      \ are relatively close in number, it's plausible they could be adjacent or close\
      \ to each other within the same city, rather than being on opposite sides of\
      \ the state or significantly far apart in an east-west direction.\n\nGiven the\
      \ specific nature of the question and without direct access to detailed mapping\
      \ or geographical data that specifies the exact locations of these zip codes\
      \ relative to each other (east-west), the most informed approach would involve\
      \ looking up the precise locations or consulting a local source. However, for\
      \ the purpose of this exercise and based on the general understanding that zip\
      \ codes in close numerical proximity often (but not always) indicate close geographical\
      \ proximity, we might infer that these areas could be relatively close to each\
      \ other within Saint Louis, MO.\n\nBut, to directly answer the question based\
      \ on the most likely scenario without specific geographical data:\n\n**NO**\
      \ \n\nThis answer is based on the assumption that zip codes in close proximity\
      \ numerically are likely to be geographically close, and without specific evidence\
      \ to the contrary, it's less likely that 63111 is significantly west of 63113\
      \ within the same city. However, this reasoning could be flawed without exact\
      \ geographical data or a detailed map of Saint Louis, MO, showing the precise\
      \ locations of these zip codes."

    fa511562-fb70-41de-92fb-e7328b96117e: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Understanding US Zip Codes**: US zip codes are geographic codes used by
      the United States Postal Service (USPS) to identify specific areas within the
      country. Generally, the first digit of a zip code represents a group of states,
      the next two digits represent a regional area within those states, and the final
      two digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.


      2. **Location of Zip Codes**: The zip codes 63111 and 63113 are both located
      in Missouri (MO), as indicated by the "MO" in the question. The first three
      digits "631" indicate they are in the same general area, specifically in or
      around St. Louis, Missouri.


      3. **Determining East/West Relationship**: To determine if 63111 is west of
      63113, we need to understand how zip codes are assigned in relation to geographic
      directions. Generally, as you move west, the zip code numbers tend to increase
      in the western United States. However, within a specific area like a city or
      a small region, the assignment of zip codes can be more complex and does not
      strictly follow a linear east-west pattern. Zip codes are often assigned based
      on the post office that serves the area, the geography of the region, and the
      pattern of development.


      4. **Specific Zip Code Analysis**: Without specific knowledge of the geography
      of St. Louis, Missouri, and how its zip codes are laid out, it''s difficult
      to determine the exact relationship between 63111 and 63113 solely based on
      their numbers. However, since they share the same first three digits, they are
      likely in close proximity to each other.


      5. **Conclusion**: To accurately determine if 63111 is west of 63113, one would
      ideally need to consult a map or a database that provides the geographic locations
      of these zip codes. Given that zip code assignments do not follow a simple linear
      progression from east to west within a small geographic area, and without additional
      information, the relationship between these two zip codes cannot be deduced
      solely from their numbers.


      However, considering the need for a YES or NO answer and assuming no additional
      information is available, I must make an educated guess based on typical zip
      code progression patterns, which might not apply perfectly in all cases, especially
      within a city.


      Given the constraints and based on general principles, I would guess NO, but
      this is a highly uncertain answer without specific geographic data on these
      zip codes.

      \ the States**: The first step is to understand the general geography of the\
      \ two states involved: Florida (FL) and Kentucky (KY). Florida is located in\
      \ the southeastern part of the United States, while Kentucky is located more\
      \ centrally, often considered part of the Eastern United States but further\
      \ inland and north compared to Florida.\n\n2. **Understand Zip Code Geography**:\
      \ Generally, zip codes in the United States increase as you move north and east.\
      \ However, this is not a strict rule and can vary significantly, especially\
      \ when comparing across different regions. The first digit of a zip code represents\
      \ a group of states. For example, zip codes starting with '3' typically represent\
      \ the southeastern states, including Florida and parts of Kentucky.\n\n3. **Specific\
      \ Zip Code Locations**:\n   - **33756, FL**: This zip code is associated with\
      \ Clearwater, Florida, which is on the west coast of Florida, in the Tampa Bay\
      \ area.\n   - **41240, KY**: This zip code is associated with Olive Hill, Kentucky,\
      \ which is in the northeastern part of the state.\n\n4. **Comparative Geography**:\n\
      \   - Florida is generally southeast of Kentucky.\n   - The specific location\
      \ of 33756 (Clearwater, FL) is on the Gulf of Mexico, which places it relatively\
      \ south and, in terms of longitude, potentially east or west depending on the\
      \ specific comparison but generally east of much of Kentucky.\n   - Olive Hill,\
      \ KY (41240), being in northeastern Kentucky, is more north and potentially\
      \ east compared to Clearwater, FL, depending on the exact longitudes.\n\n5.\
      \ **Longitude Comparison**: To determine if 33756, FL is west of 41240, KY,\

      of 41240, KY, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the general locations of the states**: Florida (FL) is located
      in the southeastern part of the United States, while Kentucky (KY) is located
      more centrally, to the north of Florida.


      2. **Consider the geographic layout of the U.S.**: Generally, moving from east
      to west in the United States, you would go from the Atlantic coast (where Florida
      is) towards the Pacific coast. Kentucky is landlocked and is situated west of
      the eastern seaboard states like Florida but is still considered to be in the
      eastern part of the United States.


      3. **Determine the relative east-west positions of FL and KY**: Since Florida
      is on the eastern coast and Kentucky is inland to the west of Florida but still
      east of the central and western parts of the U.S., Kentucky (KY) is west of
      Florida (FL).


      4. **Consider the specific zip codes**: The question asks about specific zip
      codes (33756, FL, and 41240, KY), but the general east-west relationship between
      the states (Florida being east and Kentucky being west of Florida) gives us
      the primary clue. Zip codes themselves don''t change the state''s overall geographic
      position relative to another state.


      Given these steps, the conclusion is that 33756, FL is east of 41240, KY, because
      Florida as a whole is east of Kentucky.

    74274809-8260-4a61-80f1-8866e3fa7deb: 'To determine if 94403, CA is located west
      of 95963, CA, we need to understand what the numbers in a US zip code represent.
      The first digit in a zip code represents a group of states. As we move west,
      the numbers increase from 0 (east) to 9 (west). The next two digits narrow down
      the region within those states, and the final two digits (or more for ZIP+4
      codes) pinpoint even smaller areas such as post offices or streets.


      Given this, let''s analyze the zip codes:


      1. **94403, CA**: This zip code starts with "9", indicating it is in the western
      United States, specifically in California.

      2. **95963, CA**: This zip code also starts with "9", placing it in the same
      general western region of the United States, also in California.


      Since both zip codes start with "9", we know they are both in the western United
      States. To determine their relative east-west positions, we need to look at
      the next digits:


      - **94403**: The next digit is "4".

      - **95963**: The next digit is "5".


      In zip codes, as you move east, the numbers decrease, and as you move west,
      the numbers increase. Therefore, if the second digit (or the set of digits after
      the first) is smaller in one zip code compared to another, it generally indicates
      that the area with the smaller second digit is located west of the area with
      the larger second digit, assuming they are in the same first digit region.


      Given that "4" is less than "5", and considering they are in the same state
      and have the same first digit ("9"), **94403, CA is located west of 95963, CA**.

      \ more to the west on the map than 32220.\n\nGiven the general geography and\

      \ that South Carolina (where 29829 is located) is generally north of Florida\
      \ (where 32220 is located), but both states are in the eastern part of the United\
      \ States. However, to be west, the location in South Carolina would need to\
      \ be significantly west of the location in Florida, considering their state\
      \ boundaries.\n\nSince Florida extends eastward into the Atlantic Ocean and\
      \ South Carolina is directly north of it, also bordering the Atlantic, for a\
      \ location in South Carolina to be west of a location in Florida, it would have\
      \ to be in a part of South Carolina that extends further west than the easternmost\
      \ part of Florida. Given typical state boundaries and assuming the zip codes\
      \ are not in extreme western parts of their respective states (which would be\
      \ unusual for these states), the question essentially becomes one of relative\
      \ east-west positioning within their shared general region.\n\nHowever, considering\
      \ the geography of the southeastern United States, it's clear that both South\
