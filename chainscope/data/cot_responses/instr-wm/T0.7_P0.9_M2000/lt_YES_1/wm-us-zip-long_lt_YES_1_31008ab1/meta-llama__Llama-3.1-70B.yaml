      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations associated
      with the zip codes 11439 and 10583 in New York.


      2. **11439, NY**: This zip code is located in Queens, New York City, New York.
      The "114" indicates it''s part of the New York metropolitan area.


      3. **10583, NY**: This zip code is located in Scarsdale, New York, which is
      in Westchester County, just north of New York City.


      4. **Compare locations**: To determine if 11439 is west of 10583, we need to
      consider the geographical layout of New York City and its surrounding areas.
      Queens (where 11439 is located) is generally east of the Hudson River, which

      5. **Determining East/West Relationship**: Scarsdale (where 10583 is located)
      is north of New York City but still east of the Hudson River, though it is west
      of the city itself.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given that both locations are east of the Hudson River, the
      question becomes a matter of their relative positions to each other rather than
      their absolute positions in the state. Scarsdale (10583) is directly north of
      New York City and slightly west of the city''s easternmost points but is not

      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations associated
      with the zip codes 95148 and 94531 in California.


      2. **95148, CA**: The zip code 95148 is associated with the city of San Jose,

      part of the San Francisco Bay Area.


      3. **94531, CA**: The zip code 94531 is associated with the city of Antioch,
      which is in Contra Costa County, California. Antioch is located on the eastern
      edge of the San Francisco Bay Area.


      4. **Compare locations**: To determine if 95148 is west of 94531, we need to
      consider the geographical layout of the San Francisco Bay Area. San Jose (95148)
      is generally south of the Bay, while Antioch (94531) is east of the Bay.


      5. **Directional Analysis**: Considering the layout, San Jose (95148) is actually

    5ff8abee-4856-49c7-ac0a-8bc8a5a27e90: 'To answer this question, we need to consider
      the geographic locations of the zip codes 85746 and 85745 in Arizona (AZ). Here
      are the steps to determine if 85746 is located west of 85745:


      1. **Identify the locations**: The zip code 85746 is associated with Tucson,
      Arizona, and 85745 is also associated with Tucson, Arizona. Tucson is a city
      located in the southern part of Arizona.


      2. **Understanding zip codes**: In the United States, the first digit of a zip
      code generally represents a group of states. The next two digits represent a
      region within that group, and the last two digits represent a more specific
      area or post office within that region. However, the last two digits do not
      always indicate a strict geographic progression.


      3. **Comparing locations**: Since both zip codes are in the same city (Tucson),
      we need to consider the specific areas they cover within the city. Zip codes
      can cover different neighborhoods, so it''s possible for one zip code to be
      west of another even within the same city.


      4. **Specific locations**: 85746 is associated with the northwest part of Tucson,
      while 85745 is associated with the central part of Tucson. These areas are not
      far apart, and their boundaries can overlap.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the proximity of these zip codes within Tucson and
      the fact that they cover different parts of the city, it''s possible for some
      areas within 85746 to be west of some areas within 85745. However, since we
      don''t have the exact boundaries of these zip codes, it''s challenging to provide
      a definitive answer.


      Therefore, without more precise information, the answer to whether 85746, AZ,
      is located west of 85745, AZ, is **UNCERTAIN**. It depends on the specific locations
      within these zip codes in Tucson.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Both zip codes are located in Arizona. The question
      is about their relative positions within the state.


      2. **Geographical context**: In the United States, west generally means towards
      the Pacific Ocean or towards lower longitudes. However, in the context of a
      specific state, it can be relative to the overall shape and orientation of the
      state.


      3. **Arizona''s geography**: Arizona is a rectangular state, with its long axis
      running roughly north-south. The western border is relatively straight, while
      the eastern border is more irregular.


      4. **Zip code positions**: Without precise coordinates, we can assume that both
      zip codes are within the general area of Tucson, Arizona, given the close proximity
      of their numbers.


      5. **Directional analysis**: If both zip codes are in the same general area
      of Tucson, they are likely not significantly west or east of each other in terms
      of the state''s overall orientation. The numbering system for zip codes doesn''t
      necessarily correspond to a strict east-west progression within a state.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given the above points, it''s unlikely that 85746, AZ, is
      significantly west of 85745, AZ. While the exact coordinates of these zip codes

      1. **Identify the Locations**: The zip codes 85746 and 85745 are both located
      in Arizona (AZ). Arizona is a southwestern state in the United States.


      2. **Geographical Knowledge**: In the United States, the general convention
      is that as you move west, the longitude decreases. Therefore, if a location

      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations associated
      with the two zip codes. 21085, MD refers to a location in Maryland, and 17603,
      PA refers to a location in Pennsylvania.


      2. **General geographic positions**: Maryland is located south of Pennsylvania.
      This gives us an initial clue that the location in Maryland is likely not west
      of the location in Pennsylvania.


      3. **Specific locations**: Without looking up the exact locations, we can''t
      say for sure, but we know that both Maryland and Pennsylvania are in the Northeastern
      United States. This means they are relatively close together in a north-south
      direction, which makes it unlikely that the location in Maryland is significantly
      west of the location in Pennsylvania.


      4. **West/East relationship**: To determine if a location is west of another,

      west of 63113, MO, we need to understand the geography of these zip codes and
      their relative positions.


      1. **Identify the Locations**: Both zip codes are located in Missouri (MO).
      Without specific coordinates, we can''t determine their exact locations. However,
      we can use general knowledge about the state''s geography to reason about their
      positions.


      2. **Geography of Missouri**: Missouri is a midwestern state in the United States.
      It''s generally rectangular in shape, with the eastern border along the Mississippi
      River and the western border along the Missouri River.


      3. **Comparing Zip Codes**: Both 63111 and 63113 are in the St. Louis area,
      which is located in the eastern part of the state, near the Mississippi River.
      Given the rectangular shape of Missouri, it''s unlikely that one of these zip
      codes would be significantly west of the other.


      4. **Consideration of Specific Locations**: Without exact coordinates, we can''t
      say for sure which zip code is west or east of the other. However, given their
      proximity and the general layout of the state, it''s unlikely that one is significantly
      west of the other.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided and the general geography
      of Missouri, it''s unlikely that 63111, MO is located west of 63113, MO. Given

    b166ebc9-ed54-409b-8c4a-2aa3573976ce: 'To determine if 63111, MO is located west
      of 63113, MO, we need to understand the geographical context and the meaning
      of the zip codes.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Both zip codes, 63111 and 63113, are located
      in Missouri (MO). They are in the same state, so we need to compare their positions
      within Missouri.


      2. **Geographical context**: Missouri is a state in the Midwestern United States.
      It is bordered by eight other states: Iowa to the north, Illinois to the east,
      Kentucky to the southeast, Tennessee to the south, Arkansas to the south, Oklahoma
      to the southwest, Kansas to the west, and Nebraska to the northwest.


      3. **Zip code meaning**: In the United States, zip codes are assigned based
      on geographical areas. The first three digits of a zip code often represent
      a sectional center facility, which is a mail processing and distribution center.
      The last two digits represent a specific delivery area within that facility''s
      region.


      4. **Comparing zip codes**: Since both zip codes start with "631," they are
      likely in the same sectional center facility. This means they are in the same
      general area.


      5. **Determining east/west relationship**: To determine if 63111 is west of
      63113, we need to consider the geographical context of Missouri and the specific
      locations within the state.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given the close proximity of the two zip codes and their
      location within the same sectional center facility, it is unlikely that 63111
      is significantly west of 63113. It is more likely that they are in the same
      general area, possibly even overlapping.

      east is generally towards the right on a map, and west is towards the left.
      Since we''re dealing with locations in the United States, which is in the Northern
      Hemisphere, we can use this concept to compare the positions of Florida and
      Kentucky.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Given that Florida is east of Kentucky, we can
      conclude that 33756, FL (Clearwater) is not west of 41240, KY (Inez). In fact,
      it''s east of it.

      of 92108, CA, we need to consider the geographical locations associated with
      these zip codes.


      1. **Identify the locations**: The zip code 92307 is associated with the city
      of Apple Valley, California, which is located in San Bernardino County, California.
      The zip code 92108 is associated with the city of San Diego, California.


      2. **Consider the general geography of California**: California is a long state
      with a north-south orientation. The westernmost part of the state is along the
      Pacific coast.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Apple Valley (92307) is located in the high desert
      region of California, east of the San Bernardino Mountains and northeast of
      Los Angeles. San Diego (92108) is located on the Pacific coast in the southern
      part of California.


      4. **Determine the east-west relationship**: Apple Valley is generally east
      of San Diego. However, the question is about whether 92307 is located west of
      92108.


      5. **Consider the exact location within California**: While Apple Valley is
      generally east of San Diego, it''s not significantly east in terms of the state''s
      overall geography. The distance between the two cities is relatively small compared
      to the state''s overall size.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of California and the locations
      of Apple Valley and San Diego, it''s accurate to say that 92307, CA (Apple Valley),
      is not located west of 92108, CA (San Diego). Instead, it''s more accurate to
      say that 92307 is east or northeast of 92108.
