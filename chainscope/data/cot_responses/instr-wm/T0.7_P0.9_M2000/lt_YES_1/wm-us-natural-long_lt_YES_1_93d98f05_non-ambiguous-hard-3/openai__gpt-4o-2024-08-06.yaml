      - Idaho is generally located to the west of Minnesota. Given that Priest Lake
      is in northern Idaho, it is likely to be west of Lake of the Woods.


      - Minnesota is located east of Idaho. Lake of the Woods, being in Minnesota,
      would therefore be east of Priest Lake.


      Based on these observations, we can conclude that Priest Lake, ID is indeed
      located west of Lake of the Woods, MN.


      The answer is YES.'
