      1. First, locate Wrights Lake, CA:

      - Wrights Lake is located in Alpine County, California

      - It is in the Sierra Nevada mountain range

      - Specifically, it is in the western part of California


      2. Next, locate La Garita Mountains, CO:

      - The La Garita Mountains are located in Colorado

      - They are part of the Rocky Mountains

      - They are situated in the central/southwestern part of Colorado


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Wrights Lake, CA is in western California

      - La Garita Mountains, CO are in central/southwestern Colorado

      - These locations are in different states, separated by several hundred miles


      4. Determine their relative east-west positioning:

      - Colorado is east of California

      - Therefore, La Garita Mountains are east of Wrights Lake


      5. Conclusion:

      Since the La Garita Mountains are east of Wrights Lake, Wrights Lake is NOT
      west of the La Garita Mountains.

      1. First, locate Hueco Mountains, TX:

      - Hueco Mountains are located in western Texas, near El Paso

      - They are in the far western part of Texas, close to the New Mexico border


      2. Next, locate Catahoula Lake, LA:

      - Catahoula Lake is in central Louisiana, in Catahoula Parish

      - It is in the eastern part of Louisiana


      3. Compare their geographic positions:

      - Hueco Mountains are in far western Texas

      - Catahoula Lake is in central/eastern Louisiana

      - These locations are quite far apart, with a significant distance between them

      1. Locate Suisun Bay, CA:

      - Suisun Bay is located in the San Francisco Bay Area in Northern California

      - It is in Solano County, east of San Francisco Bay


      2. Locate La Plata Mountains, CO:

      - The La Plata Mountains are located in southwestern Colorado

      - They are part of the San Juan Mountains range

      - They are in a different state from Suisun Bay


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Suisun Bay is in Northern California

      - La Plata Mountains are in Southwestern Colorado

      - These locations are quite far apart, in different states


      4. Determine relative east-west positioning:

      - Colorado is east of California

      - Therefore, the La Plata Mountains are east of Suisun Bay


      5. Answer the specific question: Is Suisun Bay west of La Plata Mountains?

      - No, Suisun Bay is east of the La Plata Mountains

    b144828e-d104-42a9-9a99-54f556cc37a6: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate Diamond Valley Lake, CA:

      - Diamond Valley Lake is located in Riverside County, California

      - It is in Southern California, specifically in the southwestern part of the
      state


      2. Next, locate Lake Worth, TX:

      - Lake Worth is a city located in Tarrant County, Texas

      - It is in the northern part of Texas, near Fort Worth


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Diamond Valley Lake is in Southern California (west coast)

      - Lake Worth is in Northern Texas (central/south-central part of the US)

      - California is west of Texas


      4. Determine relative positioning:

      - Since Diamond Valley Lake is in California (west coast) and Lake Worth is
      in Texas (more central), Diamond Valley Lake is indeed west of Lake Worth


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      1. First, locate Iowa River, IA:

      - Iowa River is located in Iowa, in the central part of the United States

      - It flows through eastern Iowa, generally from northwest to southeast


      2. Next, locate Ballston Lake, NY:

      - Ballston Lake is located in eastern New York state, near Saratoga Springs

      - This is in the northeastern part of the United States

      1. Central Oregon Coast Range is a mountain range located in western Oregon,
      near the Pacific coast.


      2. Absaroka Range is a mountain range located in northwestern Wyoming, primarily
      in the northwestern part of the state.


      3. Oregon is west of Wyoming on the map of the United States.


      4. Since the Central Oregon Coast Range is in western Oregon and the Absaroka

    f7750039-cb07-48d6-a7ef-ea581e3a4bf9: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Lake Lahontan (reservoir) in Nevada

      - This is a reservoir in western Nevada, in Churchill County


      2. Next, I''ll locate La Poudre Pass Lake in Colorado

      - This lake is located in Rocky Mountain National Park in northern Colorado


      3. Now I''ll compare their geographic positions

      - Lake Lahontan is in western Nevada

      - La Poudre Pass Lake is in northern Colorado

      - Nevada is west of Colorado


      4. Since Nevada is west of Colorado, a reservoir in western Nevada would be
      west of a location in Colorado


      5. Therefore, Lake Lahontan (reservoir) IS located west of La Poudre Pass Lake


      The answer is: YES'
