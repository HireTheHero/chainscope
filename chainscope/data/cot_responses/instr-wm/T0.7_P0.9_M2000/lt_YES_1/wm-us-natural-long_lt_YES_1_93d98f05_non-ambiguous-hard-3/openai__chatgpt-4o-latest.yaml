      1. **Locate Crazy Lake, CA**: Crazy Lake is in the state of California. While
      it is not a widely known or prominent lake, we can infer that since it''s in
      California, it lies within the geographical boundaries of the state of California,
      which is on the west coast of the United States.


      2. **Locate the Sangre de Cristo Range, CO**: The Sangre de Cristo Range is

      In Colorado, it is part of the Rocky Mountains and lies in the south-central

      County, Illinois is located west of West Caroga Lake in New York, we need to
      consider their geographic locations in terms of longitude.


      Step 1: Identify the general location of Loon Lake, Lake County, Illinois.

      - Lake County is in the northeastern part of Illinois, near the border with
      Wisconsin and close to the city of Chicago.

      - Illinois is in the central part of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of West Caroga Lake, New York.

      - West Caroga Lake is in upstate New York, in Fulton County, which is in the
      eastern part of New York State.

      - New York is in the northeastern part of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions of Illinois and New York.

      - Illinois is generally west of New York.

      - Therefore, a location in northeastern Illinois (like Loon Lake) would be west
      of a location in eastern New York (like West Caroga Lake).


      Conclusion:

      Since Illinois is west of New York, and both specific locations are within those
      states, Loon Lake (Lake County, IL) is indeed west of West Caroga Lake (NY).
