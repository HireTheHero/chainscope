      1.  **Locate Siltcoos Lake, OR:** Siltcoos Lake is on the Oregon Coast, near
      Florence. This is clearly in the western part of the continental US.


      2.  **Locate Wind River Range, WY:** The Wind River Range is a major mountain
      range in west-central Wyoming. This is clearly in the intermountain West, east
      of the Pacific coast.


      3.  **Compare their longitudes:** Since Oregon is a Pacific state and Wyoming
      is an interior mountain state, virtually all of Oregon is west of all of Wyoming.


      Therefore, Siltcoos Lake, OR is located west of the Wind River Range, WY.

      is not a well-known or officially recognized natural lake. It might be a very
      small, obscure, or even fictional body of water. However, if we assume it exists
      and is within California, California is entirely *west* of Colorado.

      located in south-central Colorado and extending into northern New Mexico. It
      is indeed in Colorado.


      3.  **Determine relative positions:** Since California is geographically west
      of Colorado, any point within California would be west of any point within Colorado.

      \ Lake, NY is located in the Adirondacks.\n* The Adirondacks region of New York\
      \ is generally around 74-75\xB0 West longitude.\n* A quick search confirms West\
      \ Caroga Lake, NY is approximately at 74.50\xB0 W longitude.\n\n**Step 3: Compare\

      1.  **Locate Lake Lahontan (reservoir), NV:** This is a reservoir in Nevada.
      Nevada is a Western US state.


      2.  **Locate La Poudre Pass Lake, CO:** This lake is in Colorado. Colorado is
      also a Western US state, and specifically, it''s east of Nevada. La Poudre Pass
      Lake is near the Continental Divide in the Rocky Mountains.


      3.  **Determine relative east-west positions:** Since Nevada is west of Colorado,
      any point in Nevada will be west of any point in Colorado, assuming typical
      geography.


      Therefore, Lake Lahontan (reservoir), NV is located west of La Poudre Pass Lake,
      CO.

      3.  **Compare longitudes:** Nevada is generally much further west than Colorado.
      La Poudre Pass Lake is near the Continental Divide in Colorado, which is a significant
      eastern boundary for the western US. Lake Lahontan, being in western Nevada,
