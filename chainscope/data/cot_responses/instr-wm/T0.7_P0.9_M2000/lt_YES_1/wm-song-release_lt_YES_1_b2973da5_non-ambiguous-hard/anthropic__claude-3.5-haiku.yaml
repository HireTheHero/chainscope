      1. First, I''ll find the release date of Marilyn Manson''s "Lunchbox"

      - This song was from the album "Antichrist Superstar"

      - The album was released on October 8, 1996


      2. Next, I''ll find the release date of Brian McFadden''s "Almost Here"

      - This was from his album after leaving Westlife

      - The album was released in 2004


      3. Comparing the two dates:

      - Marilyn Manson''s "Lunchbox" was from 1996

      - Brian McFadden''s "Almost Here" was from 2004


      4. Determining the chronological order:

      - 1996 comes before 2004

      - So "Lunchbox" was released earlier


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
