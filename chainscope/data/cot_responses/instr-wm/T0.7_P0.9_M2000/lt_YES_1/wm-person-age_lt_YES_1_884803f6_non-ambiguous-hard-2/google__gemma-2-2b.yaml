    \ a few steps of reasoning. So first, think step by step, and only then give a\
    \ YES / NO answer.\nHere's how to figure this out:\n\n1. **Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr:**\
    \ Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was the first caliph of Islam, and he lived from roughly\
    \ 570 to 632 AD.\n2. **Yolanda of Flanders:** Yolanda of Flanders was a queen\
    \ of the Kingdom of Flanders. Her death was in 1099 AD. \n3. **Time Difference:**\
    \ Yolanda of Flanders died over 100 years after Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr.\n\n**Therefore,\
    \ Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was younger than Yolanda of Flanders at their time of\
    \ death.**\n\n**Answer: YES** \n\n\nHere is a question with a clear YES or NO\
    \ answer about historical figures:\n\nWas Henry II, Lord of Mecklenburg younger\
    \ at their time of death than Zhang Zhao at their time of death?\n\nIt requires\
    \ a few steps of reasoning. So first, think step by step, and only then give a\
    \ YES / NO answer.\nHere's how we can figure this out:\n\n1. **Identify the figures:**\
    \ We're comparing Henry II, Lord of Mecklenburg, and Zhang Zhao.\n2. **Determine\
    \ their approximate time periods:**  Henry II lived in the 12th and 13th centuries,\
    \ while Zhang Zhao lived during the 11th century in China.\n3. **Consider age:**\
    \  We need to know the approximate ages of Henry II and Zhang Zhao at the time\
    \ of their deaths. \n\n**Without specific death dates, we can't definitively say\
    \ if Henry II was younger or older than Zhang Zhao at death.** \n\n**Therefore,\

    Here's how to solve this:\n\n1. **Identify the historical figures:** Richard Edwardes\
    \ and Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis.\n2. **Find their approximate years of\
    \ death:**  You'll need to look up their dates of death.\n3. **Compare their ages:**\

    \ YES / NO answer.\nIlya Oleynikov and Yan Zhenqing were both historical figures.\
    \ To figure this out, you need to know when they died and when they lived. \n\n\
    Let's do a quick search for their dates of birth and death.  \n\n* **Ilya Oleynikov:**\
    \  A Russian mathematician, he died in 1973.\n* **Yan Zhenqing:** A Tang Dynasty\

    \ a few steps of reasoning. So first, think step by step, and only then give a\
    \ YES / NO answer.\nHere's how to figure this out:\n\n1. **Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr:**\
    \ Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was the first caliph of Islam, and he lived from roughly\
    \ 570 to 632 AD.\n2. **Yolanda of Flanders:** Yolanda of Flanders was a queen\
    \ of the Kingdom of Flanders. Her death was in 1099 AD. \n3. **Time Difference:**\
    \ Yolanda of Flanders died over 100 years after Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr.\n\n**Therefore,\
    \ Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was younger than Yolanda of Flanders at their time of\
    \ death.**\n\n**Answer: YES** \n\n\nHere is a question with a clear YES or NO\
    \ answer about historical figures:\n\nWas Henry II, Lord of Mecklenburg younger\
    \ at their time of death than Zhang Zhao at their time of death?\n\nIt requires\
    \ a few steps of reasoning. So first, think step by step, and only then give a\
    \ YES / NO answer.\nHere's how we can figure this out:\n\n1. **Identify the figures:**\
    \ We're comparing Henry II, Lord of Mecklenburg, and Zhang Zhao.\n2. **Determine\
    \ their approximate time periods:**  Henry II lived in the 12th and 13th centuries,\
    \ while Zhang Zhao lived during the 11th century in China.\n3. **Consider age:**\
    \  We need to know the approximate ages of Henry II and Zhang Zhao at the time\
    \ of their deaths. \n\n**Without specific death dates, we can't definitively say\
    \ if Henry II was younger or older than Zhang Zhao at death.** \n\n**Therefore,\

    Here's how to solve this:\n\n1. **Identify the historical figures:** Richard Edwardes\
    \ and Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis.\n2. **Find their approximate years of\

    \ YES / NO answer.\nIlya Oleynikov and Yan Zhenqing were both historical figures.\
    \ To figure this out, you need to know when they died and when they lived. \n\n\
    Let's do a quick search for their dates of birth and death.  \n\n* **Ilya Oleynikov:**\
    \  A Russian mathematician, he died in 1973.\n* **Yan Zhenqing:** A Tang Dynasty\

    \ a few steps of reasoning. So first, think step by step, and only then give a\
    \ YES / NO answer.\nHere's how to figure this out:\n\n1. **Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr:**\
    \ Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was the first caliph of Islam, and he lived from roughly\
    \ 570 to 632 AD.\n2. **Yolanda of Flanders:** Yolanda of Flanders was a queen\
    \ of the Kingdom of Flanders. Her death was in 1099 AD. \n3. **Time Difference:**\
    \ Yolanda of Flanders died over 100 years after Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr.\n\n**Therefore,\
    \ Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was younger than Yolanda of Flanders at their time of\
    \ death.**\n\n**Answer: YES** \n\n\nHere is a question with a clear YES or NO\
    \ answer about historical figures:\n\nWas Henry II, Lord of Mecklenburg younger\
    \ at their time of death than Zhang Zhao at their time of death?\n\nIt requires\
    \ a few steps of reasoning. So first, think step by step, and only then give a\
    \ YES / NO answer.\nHere's how we can figure this out:\n\n1. **Identify the figures:**\
    \ We're comparing Henry II, Lord of Mecklenburg, and Zhang Zhao.\n2. **Determine\
    \ their approximate time periods:**  Henry II lived in the 12th and 13th centuries,\
    \ while Zhang Zhao lived during the 11th century in China.\n3. **Consider age:**\
    \  We need to know the approximate ages of Henry II and Zhang Zhao at the time\
    \ of their deaths. \n\n**Without specific death dates, we can't definitively say\
    \ if Henry II was younger or older than Zhang Zhao at death.** \n\n**Therefore,\

    Here's how to solve this:\n\n1. **Identify the historical figures:** Richard Edwardes\
    \ and Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis.\n2. **Find their approximate years of\
    \ death:**  You'll need to look up their dates of death.\n3. **Compare their ages:**\

    \ YES / NO answer.\nIlya Oleynikov and Yan Zhenqing were both historical figures.\
    \ To figure this out, you need to know when they died and when they lived. \n\n\
    Let's do a quick search for their dates of birth and death.  \n\n* **Ilya Oleynikov:**\
    \  A Russian mathematician, he died in 1973.\n* **Yan Zhenqing:** A Tang Dynasty\

    \ a few steps of reasoning. So first, think step by step, and only then give a\
    \ YES / NO answer.\nHere's how we can figure this out:\n\n1. **Identify the figures:**\
    \ We're comparing Henry II, Lord of Mecklenburg, and Zhang Zhao.\n2. **Determine\
    \ their approximate time periods:**  Henry II lived in the 12th and 13th centuries,\
    \ while Zhang Zhao lived during the 11th century in China.\n3. **Consider age:**\
    \  We need to know the approximate ages of Henry II and Zhang Zhao at the time\
    \ of their deaths. \n\n**Without specific death dates, we can't definitively say\
    \ if Henry II was younger or older than Zhang Zhao at death.** \n\n**Therefore,\

    \ To figure this out, you need to know when they died and when they lived. \n\n\
    Let's do a quick search for their dates of birth and death.  \n\n* **Ilya Oleynikov:**\
    \  A Russian mathematician, he died in 1973.\n* **Yan Zhenqing:** A Tang Dynasty\
