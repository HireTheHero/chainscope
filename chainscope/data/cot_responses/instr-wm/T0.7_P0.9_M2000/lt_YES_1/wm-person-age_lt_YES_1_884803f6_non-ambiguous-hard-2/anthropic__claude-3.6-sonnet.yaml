      - Age at death: 83 years old


      3. Now I can compare their ages at death:

      - William Cavendish-Bentinck: 71 years

      - Cordelia Edvardson: 83 years

      - 71 is less than 83


      Therefore, William Cavendish-Bentinck was younger at his time of death than
      Cordelia Edvardson at her time of death.

      1. First, let me find when Ptolemy XIV lived and died:

      - Born around 59 BC

      - Died in 44 BC

      - This means he was about 15 years old when he died


      2. Now, let me find when Muhammad al-Jawad lived and died:

      - Born in 811 CE

      - Died in 835 CE

      - This means he was about 24-25 years old when he died


      3. Now I can compare:

      - Ptolemy XIV: died at ~15 years old

      - Muhammad al-Jawad: died at ~24-25 years old

      - 15 is less than 24-25

      YES - Ptolemy XIV was younger at his time of death than Muhammad al-Jawad at
      his time of death.'

      - Hans Staden was born around 1525

      - He died around 1579

      - Hans Staden: ~54 years at death

      - 43-44 is less than 54


      Therefore:

      1. First, let me find when Alexander V died and at what age:

      - Alexander V died in 1410

      - He was born around 1339

      - This means he was approximately 71 years old when he died


      2. Now, let me find when Gerard I of Durbuy died and at what age:

      - Gerard I of Durbuy died in 1298

      - I am not able to find his exact birth year with confidence

      - Without knowing his age at death, I cannot make a direct comparison


      3. Reasoning:

      - I have Alexander V''s age at death (71)

      - I don''t have enough information about Gerard I of Durbuy''s age at death

      - Without both ages, I cannot definitively compare who was younger at their
      time of death


      Therefore, I cannot provide a YES or NO answer with confidence due to insufficient
      information about Gerard I of Durbuy''s age at death.


      I must abstain from giving a YES/NO answer as it would be speculation.'

      1. First, let me find when Ilya Oleynikov lived and died:

      - Born: July 10, 1947

      - Died: November 11, 2012

      - Age at death: 65 years old


      2. Now, let me find when Yan Zhenqing lived and died:

      - Born: 709 CE

      - Died: 785 CE

      - Age at death: 76 years old


      3. Now I can compare their ages at death:

      - Oleynikov: 65 years

      - Yan Zhenqing: 76 years

      - 65 is less than 76


      Therefore, Ilya Oleynikov was younger at his time of death than Yan Zhenqing.


      YES'
