      \ the steps needed:\n\n1. **Identify the Historical Figures**: Humphrey of Hauteville\
      \ and Hippoliet Van Peene are the figures in question. Humphrey of Hauteville\
      \ is known from historical records as a member of the Hauteville family, which\
      \ was prominent in the Norman conquest of southern Italy in the 11th century.\
      \ Hippoliet Van Peene, on the other hand, is less commonly known but can be\
      \ found in historical records as a Flemish painter, active in the 17th century.\n\
      \n2. **Find Dates of Birth and Death**: \n   - **Humphrey of Hauteville**: The\
      \ exact dates of birth and death for Humphrey of Hauteville are not universally\
      \ agreed upon, but he is believed to have died around 1057.\n   - **Hippoliet\
      \ Van Peene**: Active in the 17th century, specific dates for Van Peene are\
      \ not readily available in initial searches, but for the sake of argument, let's\
      \ assume he lived during a period that could overlap with or be later than Humphrey,\
      \ given the time difference between the 11th and 17th centuries.\n\n3. **Analyze\
      \ the Time Periods**: Given that Humphrey of Hauteville lived and died in the\
      \ 11th century and Hippoliet Van Peene was active in the 17th century, it's\
      \ clear that Van Peene lived much later than Humphrey.\n\n4. **Consider the\
      \ Implication of Time Period on Age at Death**: Without exact dates of birth\
      \ and death for both figures, a direct comparison of their ages at the time\
      \ of death is challenging. However, given the significant gap in time between\
      \ their lifetimes, it's reasonable to consider that advancements in medicine,\
      \ living conditions, and other factors could influence life expectancy over\
      \ the centuries.\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Since\
      \ specific dates of birth and death for Hippoliet Van Peene are not provided\
      \ and considering the broad time frames involved, a definitive comparison requires\
      \ precise data. However, if we assume average life expectancies and consider\
      \ historical contexts, it might be possible for someone in the 17th century\
      \ to live longer than someone in the 11th century due to improvements in healthcare\
      \ and living conditions over time.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information\
      \ about the exact ages of Humphrey of Hauteville and Hippoliet Van Peene at\
      \ their times of death, and without precise dates for Van Peene, the question\
      \ cannot be definitively answered based on the provided steps and the general\
      \ information available. However, for the sake of providing a YES or NO answer\

      2. Adam Mickiewicz was born on December 24, 1798, and died on November 26, 1855.


      Now, let''s calculate their ages at the time of death:


      1. Francesco II Sforza died on October 2, 1535. He was born on February 4, 1495.

      Royal.

      2. Determine the time of death for each individual.

      3. Compare their ages at the time of death.


      Step 1: Identification

      - Robert Dowland: This could refer to Robert Dowland (1591-1649), an English
      lutenist and composer, or possibly another figure with less historical prominence.
      Given the context, it seems most likely to refer to the musician.

      - Charlotte, Princess Royal (1709-1757): A German princess and the eldest daughter
      of King George II of Great Britain.


      Step 2: Time of Death

      - Robert Dowland: Assuming we''re referring to the musician, he died in 1649.

      - Charlotte, Princess Royal: She died in 1757.


      Step 3: Ages at Time of Death

      - Robert Dowland: Born in 1591, died in 1649, which makes him 58 years old at
      the time of death.

      - Charlotte, Princess Royal: Born in 1709, died in 1757, which makes her 48

      Step 4: Comparison

      Since Robert Dowland was 58 years old when he died and Charlotte, Princess Royal
      was 48 years old when she died, Robert Dowland was older than Charlotte, Princess
      Royal at their respective times of death.

      1. **Identify Uc Brunet and Vanni Fucci**: Both are historical figures, but
      more context or information about them is needed for a detailed comparison.
      Uc Brunet is known from historical records related to the troubadours of southern
      France, while Vanni Fucci is infamous for his appearance in Dante Alighieri''s
      "The Divine Comedy," specifically in the "Inferno," as a character who is punished
      for his crimes.


      2. **Determine their ages at death**: Without specific dates of birth and death
      for both figures, it''s challenging to directly compare their ages at the time
      of death. However, historical records and literary references can provide some
      clues. Uc Brunet lived in the th century, and while exact dates of birth and
      death are not widely available, troubadours of this era often had careers that
      spanned several decades, suggesting they lived into their s or 60s. Vanni Fucci,

      are less clearly documented, but given the context of the "Inferno," it''s plausible
      he died sometime before or around the time Dante was writing.

      life expectancy of the time.


      Given the lack of specific information on the ages of Uc Brunet and Vanni Fucci

      1. **Identify Uc Brunet and Vanni Fucci**: Both are figures from Dante Alighieri''s
      "The Divine Comedy," specifically from "The Inferno." Uc Brunet is mentioned
      in Canto XXIV, and Vanni Fucci is encountered in Canto XXIV as well.


      2. **Understand the context of their appearances in "The Inferno"**: Both characters
      are placed in the seventh circle of Hell, which is for those who were violent.
      Uc Brunet is among the violent against their neighbors, and Vanni Fucci is punished
      for blasphemy and violence.


      3. **Determine their ages at death**: This requires historical or literary research.
      However, given that both characters are from "The Inferno" and not widely known
      historical figures outside of Dante''s work, we must look into Dante''s time
      and the context he wrote about them. Vanni Fucci is known to have been a real
      person, born around 1240 and died around 1295-1300. Uc Brunet is less documented,
      but since both are mentioned together and considering the time Dante wrote "The
      Inferno" (around 1308-1320), we can assume both lived during the 13th century.


      4. **Compare their ages at death**: Without exact dates for Uc Brunet, direct
      comparison is challenging. However, if we consider the range for Vanni Fucci
      (dying around 55-60 years old, assuming he died around 1295-1300), we need similar
      information for Uc Brunet to make a comparison.


      Given the lack of specific information on Uc Brunet''s birth and death dates,
      and considering that both characters are from the same literary work and roughly
      the same time period, making a definitive comparison based on available data

      circle, where counterfeiters are punished), and Vanni Fucci is found in the
      8th circle as well but in a different section (the 7th bolgia, where thieves
      are punished).


      2. **Determine the Time of Death for Each**: Without specific historical records
      of real individuals named Uc Brunet and Vanni Fucci that match the context of
      Dante''s work, we must rely on the narrative of "The Divine Comedy" itself.
      However, both characters are mentioned as being alive during Dante''s journey
      through Hell, which occurred (in the narrative) in 1300. The question, therefore,
      seems to be asking about their ages at death as depicted in the work, not historical
      records, as these figures are more literary than historical.


      3. **Compare Ages at Death**: The text of "The Divine Comedy" does not provide
      explicit ages for Uc Brunet or Vanni Fucci at their time of death. For historical
      figures or characters from literature without specified ages at death, direct
      comparison is challenging without additional context or historical records.

      Brunet is found in the 8th circle (Cocytus, specifically in the area of the

      blasphemers, sodomites, and usurers, more specifically among the blasphemers
      in the 7th circle when first encountered.


      2. **Determine their dates of death**: Uc Brunet is believed to have been a
      troubadour who died around 1210 or slightly later. Vanni Fucci, also known as
      Fucci dei Raviggi, died around 1295.


      3. **Calculate their ages at death**: To do this accurately, we would need their
      birth dates. However, the historical record doesn''t provide precise birth dates
      for either figure. Uc Brunet is thought to have been active in the late 12th
      and early 13th centuries, and Vanni Fucci in the late 13th century.


      4. **Consider what is known**: Without exact birth dates, determining who was
      younger at the time of death requires assumptions. However, the general periods
      of activity and death can give us a clue. Uc Brunet was active and died in the
      early 13th century, while Vanni Fucci died in the late 13th century.


      Given the lack of precise information about their ages at death and considering

      1. **Identify Uc Brunet and Vanni Fucci**: Both are figures mentioned in Dante
      Alighieri''s "The Divine Comedy," specifically in "The Inferno." Uc Brunet is
      found in Canto XXVIII, and Vanni Fucci is in Canto XXIV.


      2. **Historical Context**: While both characters are placed in Hell by Dante,
      their historical existence and the details of their lives, including their ages
      at death, are not as straightforward. Vanni Fucci is known to have been a real
      person, a noble from Pistoia, who lived in the 13th century. Uc Brunet, on the
      other hand, is less documented in historical records outside of Dante''s work,
      but is believed to refer to a troubadour.


      3. **Ages at Death**: The critical piece of information needed to answer the
      question is the age at which each figure died. For Vanni Fucci, historical records
      suggest he died around 1295, but his exact age at death is not well-documented.
      For Uc Brunet, there''s even less information available regarding his life details,
      including his age at death.


      4. **Dante''s Work as a Source**: Since both figures are mentioned in "The Inferno,"
      we might look to Dante''s work for clues. However, Dante does not provide explicit
      ages for these characters at their time of death.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of specific information on the ages of Uc
      Brunet and Vanni Fucci at their times of death, and considering that historical
      records do not provide clear answers, it''s challenging to definitively compare
      their ages at death.


      However, the question demands a YES or NO answer based on the information available.
      Given the steps above and the nature of the question, without explicit ages
      or a clear historical consensus on their lifespans, the most accurate response
      based on available data would lean towards an inability to confirm. But since

      down into steps.


      1. **Identify Hugh the Great and Jacques Perret**: Hugh the Great, also known
      as Hugh Magnus, was a French noble and the Count of Paris, Duke of the Franks,
      and, from 923 to 936, King of West Francia (modern-day France). Jacques Perret
      was a French professional road racing cyclist.


      2. **Find the birth and death dates for Hugh the Great**: Hugh the Great was
      born in 898 AD and died in 956 AD.


      3. **Find the birth and death dates for Jacques Perret**: Without specific details
      on Jacques Perret in the question, it''s challenging to identify him precisely.
      However, assuming we are referring to a relatively well-known figure, we need
      to find a Jacques Perret who was a cyclist. One Jacques Perret I found was a
      cyclist, but without specific birth and death dates provided in the question,
      I''ll proceed with a general approach.


      4. **Compare ages at death**: To answer the question, we need the ages of both
      individuals at their time of death. Hugh the Great died at the age of 58 (if
      he died in 956 and was born in 898).


      5. **Challenge with Jacques Perret''s data**: Without the exact birth and death
      dates for Jacques Perret, we cannot accurately calculate his age at death. However,
      considering the typical lifespan and the fact that we''re comparing a historical
      figure from the 10th century with a cyclist (which implies a more modern figure),
      it''s reasonable to assume that if Jacques Perret died at an age that is not
      unusually high for modern standards (let''s say, for the sake of argument, under
      80), the comparison would still be valid within a certain range.


      6. **Making an educated guess based on available data**: Given the lack of specific
      information on Jacques Perret, if we consider a typical lifespan for a modern
      individual (let''s assume Jacques Perret lived into his 70s or 80s, which is
      a common range for many people in recent centuries), Hugh the Great, dying at
      58, would indeed be younger at his time of death than many individuals in modern
      times.


      However, without the exact dates for Jacques Perret, we cannot definitively
      answer the question based on actual ages at death. For the purpose of this exercise,
      assuming a typical modern lifespan for Jacques Perret, the answer would lean
      towards YES, considering Hugh the Great''s relatively early death by modern
      standards. But, this is speculative without specific dates for Jacques Perret.

      1. Determine the age of Hatto II at the time of death.

      2. Determine the age of Angelus of Jerusalem at the time of death.

      3. Compare these ages to determine if Hatto II was younger.


      Let''s start with what we know:


      - Hatto II was the Archbishop of Mainz from 968 until his death in 970. The
      exact dates of his birth and death are not universally agreed upon, but it''s
      known he died around 970. Assuming he was at least in his mid-to-late 40s or
      older when he became Archbishop (a reasonable assumption given the time period
      and the nature of such appointments), he would have been around 48 or older
      at the time of his death, but without exact birth dates, this is speculative.


      - Angelus of Jerusalem, also known as Angelus of Jerusalem or Angelus, is less
      commonly referenced in historical texts and may refer to a figure from the Crusades
      or another period. Without specific details on an "Angelus of Jerusalem," it''s
      challenging to determine his age at death accurately. However, assuming the
      reference might be to a figure involved in the Crusades or similar historical
      events, the age at death could vary widely.


      Given the lack of precise information on both figures, particularly Angelus
      of Jerusalem, making a direct comparison is challenging. However, based on the
      information provided and typical assumptions about ages of historical figures
      in positions of power during these time periods:


      If we proceed with the assumption that Hatto II was likely an adult with some
      years of experience (potentially in his 50s or 60s) when he died around 970,
      and without specific information on Angelus of Jerusalem that would clearly
      indicate he died at a significantly older or younger age, it''s difficult to
      definitively say who was younger at the time of death.


      But since I must give a YES or NO answer and considering the speculative nature
      of the ages and the lack of clear information on Angelus of Jerusalem, the most
      straightforward approach, given the constraints of the question and the information
      available, is to consider what we can infer about typical lifespans and the
      ages at which historical figures might have held power during these periods.


      Given these considerations and the speculative nature of the question, the answer
      would have to be based on the information available and the process of elimination
      or comparison where possible.


      The final answer is: YES'

      1. **Identify Hatto II and Angelus of Jerusalem**: Hatto II was the Archbishop
      of Mainz from 968 to 970 and then again from 971 until his death in 976. Angelus
      of Jerusalem, also known as Angelus of Jerusalem or Angelus, is less commonly
      referenced in broad historical texts, but there was a Patriarch of Jerusalem
      named Angelus or Anghelos in the 12th century. However, without more specific
      details, it''s challenging to pinpoint the exact individual referred to as "Angelus
      of Jerusalem" in this context. For the sake of this exercise, let''s proceed
      under the assumption that we''re comparing Hatto II with a historical figure
      named Angelus who was a Patriarch of Jerusalem, acknowledging that specific
      details about Angelus might be scarce or hard to verify.


      2. **Determine the Lifespan of Hatto II**: Hatto II was born around 920 AD and
      died in 976 AD, making him approximately 56 years old at the time of his death.


      3. **Determine the Lifespan of Angelus of Jerusalem**: Without specific information
      on Angelus of Jerusalem''s birth and death dates, we cannot accurately determine
      his age at death. However, for the sake of argument, let''s consider a hypothetical
      scenario where Angelus of Jerusalem lived during a time that could make this
      comparison meaningful. If we were to assume Angelus lived in the 12th century,
      as some patriarchs of Jerusalem did, without exact dates, we cannot proceed
      with a numerical comparison.


      4. **Comparison**: Given the lack of specific information about Angelus of Jerusalem''s
      lifespan, a direct comparison to determine if Hatto II was younger at the time
      of death than Angelus of Jerusalem is not feasible based on the information
      provided.

      he undertook. Angelus of Jerusalem, on the other hand, was a young cleric when
      he was martyred in 1220. The term "young" can vary, but typically, it refers

      texts, but there are records of a 12th-century bishop named Angelus, possibly
      related to the Crusades or the Kingdom of Jerusalem, though specific details
      might be scarce or hard to verify without more context.


      2. **Determine the Lifespan of Hatto II**: Hatto II was born around 920 AD and
      died in 976 AD, making him approximately 56 years old at the time of his death.


      3. **Determine the Lifespan of Angelus of Jerusalem**: Without specific information
      on Angelus of Jerusalem, it''s challenging to determine his exact lifespan or
      age at death. Historical records might be limited or not widely available, making
      this step speculative without further research.


      4. **Comparison**: Given the lack of specific information on Angelus of Jerusalem,
      a direct comparison cannot be made with certainty. However, for the sake of
      providing an answer based on the information provided and typical historical
      contexts, we would need to know more about Angelus of Jerusalem.


      Given the constraints and the need for a YES/NO answer, and considering that
      we cannot accurately determine the age of Angelus of Jerusalem at the time of
      death due to lack of information, a definitive comparison cannot be made. However,
      the question format demands a YES or NO answer, so based on the information
      available (and the lack thereof for Angelus of Jerusalem), the most straightforward
      approach is to acknowledge that without specific details on Angelus, we cannot
      accurately compare their ages at death.


      Since we cannot confirm the age of Angelus of Jerusalem and thus cannot make
      a direct comparison, the question''s premise relies on information that is not
      provided. Therefore, based on the available data, the answer would have to be
      speculative. However, to adhere to the format and considering the nature of
      historical questions which often require precise data for accurate comparison:


      The final answer is: YES'
    c75bbe2c-e223-4b41-b173-a7e12535bb8d: "To answer this question, let's gather information\
      \ about Hatto II and Angelus of Jerusalem.\n\n1. **Identify Hatto II and Angelus\
      \ of Jerusalem**: \n   - Hatto II was the Archbishop of Mainz from 968 to 970\
      \ and then again from 971 until his death in 976. He is known for his role in\
      \ the Holy Roman Empire during the 10th century.\n   - Angelus of Jerusalem,\
      \ also known as Angelus of Jerusalem or Saint Angelus, was a martyr and saint\
      \ who lived in the 14th century. The details about his life are limited, but\
      \ it is known that he was a Carmelite friar who was martyred in Jerusalem around\
      \ 1225, during the Fifth Crusade, not in the 14th century as initially stated.\
      \ This mistake corrects the century in which Angelus lived.\n\n2. **Determine\
      \ the Age at Death**:\n   - For Hatto II, his exact birthdate is not well-documented,\
      \ but given his positions and the time he lived, it's reasonable to estimate\
      \ his age at death. Assuming he was at least in his mid-30s when he first became\
      \ Archbishop (a common age for such positions, considering the time and the\
      \ need for experience), and knowing he died in 976, we can estimate his age\
      \ at death to be around 40 or slightly older, depending on his birth year.\n\
      \   - For Angelus of Jerusalem, since he was a friar and martyred around 1225,\
      \ without specific details on his birth, it's challenging to accurately determine\
      \ his age at death. However, considering the average lifespan and the fact that\
      \ he was a participant in the Fifth Crusade, we can speculate that he might\
      \ have been in his 20s or 30s, given the physical demands of crusading.\n\n\
      3. **Comparison**:\n   - Given the estimated ages, Hatto II was likely in his\
      \ 40s when he died, while Angelus of Jerusalem could have been younger, possibly\
      \ in his 20s or 30s, based on the limited information available.\n\n**Conclusion**:\
      \ Based on the estimated ages at death and considering the historical context\
      \ and typical lifespans of the periods in which they lived, Hatto II was likely\
      \ older than Angelus of Jerusalem at the time of their respective deaths.\n\n\

    7e14fb5a-2c01-4eb8-9f39-ff16b0f3d739: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the ages at death of both Aaron of Lincoln and Bella degli Abati.


      1. **Aaron of Lincoln**: Aaron of Lincoln (c. 1123 - 1186) was an English Jewish
      financier. According to historical records, he was born around 1123 and died
      around 1186. This would make him approximately 63 years old at the time of his
      death.


      2. **Bella degli Abati**: Bella degli Abati (c. 1200 - 1270s) was an Italian
      Jewish woman known for her activity in money-lending in the 13th century. The
      exact dates of her birth and death are not certain, but it is believed she was
      born around 1200 and died sometime in the 1270s. If we consider the earliest
      possible death year in the 1270s (1270), and assuming she was born around 1200,
      she would have been about 70 years old. However, since the exact year of her
      death within the 1270s is not specified, and considering the range of possible
      years, her age at death could range, but the most conservative estimate based
      on the information given would put her at least in her early 70s.


      Given these estimates:

      - Aaron of Lincoln was approximately 63 years old at the time of his death.

      - Bella degli Abati was at least 70 years old at the time of her death, based
      on the available information.


      Since 63 (Aaron''s age at death) is less than 70 (the minimum estimated age
      for Bella at her death), the answer to whether Aaron of Lincoln was younger
      at their time of death than Bella degli Abati at their time of death is:


      YES'

      1. **Identify Claudius Colas**: First, we need to identify who Claudius Colas
      was. Claudius Colas (also known as Claude Colas) was a French chess player,
      but without a specific date of birth or death, it''s challenging to proceed
      directly from this information. However, assuming we are referring to a relatively
      well-known historical figure by this name, further research would typically

      2. **Identify John of Ibelin**: John of Ibelin, also known as John of Jaffa,
      was a Count of Jaffa and Ascalon and a jurist in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. He
      was born around 1215 and died around 1266. This gives us an approximate age

      average lifespans of the medieval period or slightly later, Colas would need
      to have died at a younger age than 51 to fulfill the condition of the question.

      a less prominent or possibly misrecorded figure. John of Ibelin, on the other
      hand, is known from historical records, particularly in the context of the Crusades
      and the Kingdom of Jerusalem.


      2. **Determine their lifespans**: Without specific details on Claudius Colas,

      Yong Li and Johann Georg Walch are. Yong Li could potentially refer to a figure
      from Chinese history, given the name. Johann Georg Walch, on the other hand,
      is identifiable as a German theologian and historian who lived from 1693 to
      1775.

      believed to have died around 44 BCE. The exact dates of his birth and death
      are not universally agreed upon among historians, but it is generally accepted
      that he was born around 59/60 BCE and died in 44 BCE. This would make him approximately
      15-16 years old at the time of his death.


      2. **Muhammad al-Jawad**: He was the ninth of the Twelve Imams in the Twelver
      branch of Shia Islam and is reported to have died in 835 CE. His birth is believed
      to have occurred in 811 CE, which would make him approximately 24 years old
      at the time of his death.


      Now, comparing the ages:

      - Ptolemy XIV of Egypt was about 15-16 years old when he died.

      - Muhammad al-Jawad was about 24 years old when he died.


      Given this information, Ptolemy XIV of Egypt was indeed younger than Muhammad
      al-Jawad at their respective times of death.

      Nikolai Essen was born on December 23, 1860 (or December 11 in the Julian calendar),
      and died on May 5, 1915.

      2. Next, we calculate Nikolai Essen''s age at the time of death. He died on
      May 5, 1915, which means he was 54 years old when he died.

      3. Now, we do the same for Konstantin Rokossovsky. He was born on December 21,
      1896, and died on August 3, 1968.

      4. We calculate Konstantin Rokossovsky''s age at the time of death. He died
      on August 3, 1968, which means he was 71 years old when he died.

      5. Finally, we compare their ages at the time of death to answer the question.
      Nikolai Essen was 54 years old, and Konstantin Rokossovsky was 71 years old.

      1. **Benedict IX**: He was the Pope of the Catholic Church on three occasions:
      from 1032 to 1044, again in 1045, and finally from 1047 to 1048. The exact dates
      of his birth and death are not known with precision, but it is believed he was
      born around 1012 and died around 1055 or 1056.


      2. **Hans Staden**: A German soldier and explorer, Staden is best known for
      his travels in South America, especially his captivity by the Tupinamba in present-day
      Brazil. He was born in 1525 and died in 1579.


      Given these dates:

      - Benedict IX was approximately 43 to 44 years old at the time of his death
      (if we use 1055 as the year of death).

      - Hans Staden was 54 years old at the time of his death.


      Now, comparing their ages at death:

      - Benedict IX was approximately 43 to 44 years old.

      - Hans Staden was 54 years old.


      Since 43 to 44 (Benedict IX''s age) is less than 54 (Hans Staden''s age), Benedict
      IX was indeed younger at the time of death than Hans Staden.

      of Alexander V and Gerard I of Durbuy at their times of death.


      1. **Identify Alexander V**: Alexander V was an antipope during the Western
      Schism of the Catholic Church, reigning from 1409 to 1410. Historical records
      indicate he was born as Pietro Philarghi and died in 1410. The exact date of
      his birth is not certain, but it is believed to be around 1339, making him approximately
      71 years old at the time of his death.


      2. **Identify Gerard I of Durbuy**: Gerard I of Durbuy was a count of Durbuy,
      but detailed historical information about him, including his birth and death
      dates, is not as readily available as for Alexander V. However, for the purpose
      of comparison, we need to establish his age at death.


      Without specific information on Gerard I of Durbuy''s birth and death dates,
      we cannot accurately compare his age at death with that of Alexander V. However,

      overlap or be near Alexander V''s time, the comparison would depend on the actual
      ages at death.


      Given the lack of specific information on Gerard I of Durbuy''s age at death
      in the question or readily available historical records, a precise comparison
      cannot be made. However, the question demands a YES or NO answer based on the
      assumption that we can determine or have access to these ages.


      Since I don''t have the specific ages at death for both figures and cannot verify
      Gerard I of Durbuy''s age, I must rely on the process of deduction and available
      historical data, which is incomplete for Gerard I of Durbuy.


      Given the constraints, the most logical approach would be to say that without
      the exact ages at death, we cannot definitively answer the question. However,
      the format requires a YES or NO answer, suggesting an evaluation based on available
      data or an assumption that such data could be known.

      indicate that Alexander V was born in 1339 and died in 1410. Thus, he was approximately
      71 years old when he died.


      2. **Gerard I of Durbuy**: Gerard was the Count of Durbuy from around 1073 until

      year is not precisely documented, making it difficult to accurately calculate
      his age at death. For the sake of this comparison, we would need a plausible

      Given the lack of specific information on Gerard I of Durbuy''s birth year,

      3. Compare the ages of Alexander V and Gerard I of Durbuy at their times of
      death to determine if Alexander V was younger.


      Step 1: Alexander V was an antipope who lived from 1339 to 1410. He died in
      1410 at the age of 71.


      Step 2: Gerard I of Durbuy was a count who lived in the 11th century. The exact
      dates of his birth and death are not universally agreed upon, but it is known
      that he died around 1051. Assuming a typical lifespan and considering he was
      an adult with responsibilities by the time he died, let''s proceed with the
      understanding that his exact age at death is not precisely known but would have
      been within the range expected for a medieval noble.


      Step 3: Given the lack of precise information on Gerard I of Durbuy''s birthdate,
      we can only estimate his age at death. However, for the sake of comparison,

      the ages of Alonso de Ojeda and Petrus Armengol at the time of their deaths.


      1. Alonso de Ojeda: He was a Spanish navigator and conquistador. According to
      historical records, Alonso de Ojeda was born around 1466 and died in 1515. This
      would make him approximately 49 years old at the time of his death.


      2. Petrus Armengol: He was a Spanish Franciscan friar. According to historical
      records, Petrus Armengol was born around 1238 and died in 1305. This would make
      him approximately 67 years old at the time of his death.


      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death: Alonso de Ojeda was approximately
      49 years old, and Petrus Armengol was approximately 67 years old.


      Since 49 is less than 67, Alonso de Ojeda was indeed younger than Petrus Armengol

    d071a5cb-2d8b-451c-a742-7cdd618e6f62: 'To answer this question, we need to find
      the ages of Wanyan Yongji and Justus Lipsius at the time of their deaths.


      1. First, let''s find the information on Wanyan Yongji. Wanyan Yongji was a
      Jurchen noble and the last emperor of the Jin dynasty. He died in 1234. However,
      I couldn''t find the exact date of his birth, but it is reported that he was
      born in 1192, which would make him around 42 years old at the time of his death.


      2. Now, let''s find the information on Justus Lipsius. Justus Lipsius was a
      Flemish philosopher and philologist. He was born on October 18, 1547, and died
      on March 23, 1606. Based on this information, Justus Lipsius was 58 years old
      at the time of his death.


      3. Comparing the ages, Wanyan Yongji was approximately 42 years old when he
      died, while Justus Lipsius was 58 years old. Since 42 is less than 58, Wanyan
      Yongji was indeed younger than Justus Lipsius at the time of their deaths.


      The answer is: YES'

      \ Swiss military officer. After research, it appears that Karl Josef von Bachmann\
      \ died in 1684.\n   - Bernard of Vienne was the Archbishop of Vienne. He died\

      \ information on his birthdate, precise age calculation is also difficult. However,\
      \ considering the time period (9th century), if we assume he was born around\
      \ 780-790 AD, he would have been approximately 52-62 years old at the time of\

      \ estimated age ranges, Karl Josef von Bachmann (approximately 44-54 years old)\
      \ and Bernard of Vienne (approximately 52-62 years old), it appears that Bachmann\
      \ was likely younger than Bernard of Vienne at their respective times of death.\n\
      \nBased on these steps and the estimated ages, the answer to whether Karl Josef\
      \ von Bachmann was younger at their time of death than Bernard of Vienne at\
      \ their time of death is: **YES**."

      \ lived into his 60s or 70s, which was old for that time period. However, without\
      \ precise dates, this is speculative.\n   - **David Shutt, Baron Shutt of Greetland**:\
      \ He died at the age of 78.\n\nGiven the lack of precise information on Payo\
      \ G\xF3mez Chari\xF1o's age at death and considering the average lifespan during\
      \ the 13th century, it's reasonable to assume that many people, if they survived\

      \ time.\n\nGiven the speculative nature of Payo G\xF3mez Chari\xF1o's age at\
      \ death and without concrete evidence to suggest he lived significantly longer\
      \ than average for his time, it's plausible that he could have been younger\

    d7e2e951-36a9-49b8-83db-3c2b00eab74b: "To answer this question, we need to follow\
      \ these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Jewell James Ebers and V\xEDmara Peres**: First,\
      \ we need to know who these individuals are. Jewell James Ebers was an American\
      \ football player, and V\xEDmara Peres (also known as Vimara Peres) was a 9th-century\
      \ Galician nobleman and the first ruler of the County of Portugal.\n\n2. **Determine\
      \ their birth and death dates**:\n   - Jewell James Ebers was born on December\
      \ 20, 1921, and died on September 2, 2008.\n   - V\xEDmara Peres was born around\
      \ 820 AD and died around 873 AD.\n\n3. **Calculate their ages at death**:\n\
      \   - Jewell James Ebers lived from 1921 to 2008, which means he was approximately\
      \ 86 years old when he died.\n   - V\xEDmara Peres lived from approximately\
      \ 820 AD to 873 AD, which means he was approximately 53 years old when he died.\n\
      \n4. **Compare their ages at death**:\n   - Jewell James Ebers was 86 years\
      \ old at his time of death.\n   - V\xEDmara Peres was 53 years old at his time\
      \ of death.\n\nGiven these calculations, Jewell James Ebers was older at his\
      \ time of death than V\xEDmara Peres at his time of death. Therefore, the answer\
      \ to whether Jewell James Ebers was younger at their time of death than V\xED\
      mara Peres is **NO**."
