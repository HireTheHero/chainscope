      1. **Vanni Fucci**: He is a character from Dante Alighieri''s "Divine Comedy"
      and is believed to be based on a real person who lived in the late 13th century.
      His exact birth and death dates are not definitively recorded, but he is often

      2. **Uc Brunet**: Uc Brunet, also known as Ugo di Brunetto, is a character from
      the same literary work and is also thought to be based on a real historical
      figure. Again, the specific birth and death dates are not definitively documented,

      during the Renaissance. His birth year is generally considered to be around
      1460, and he died in 1536. Therefore, he was approximately 76 years old at the

      - Antonio di Vincenzo was 76 years old at his death.

      - Christoph Cellarius was 69 years old at his death.

      \ establish the birth and death dates of both Jewell James Ebers and V\xEDmara\
      \ Peres.\n\n1. **Jewell James Ebers**: Jewell James Ebers was born on January\
      \ 15, 1932, and died on April 27, 2005. This means he lived for 73 years.\n\n\
      2. **V\xEDmara Peres**: V\xEDmara Peres was a historical figure from the 9th\
      \ century, specifically known for his role in the formation of the County of\
      \ Portugal. His exact birth date is not well documented, but he is believed\
      \ to have died around 873 AD. Given the historical context, we do not have an\
      \ exact birth date, but he is often thought to have been an adult by the time\
      \ of his death.\n\nSince V\xEDmara Peres lived during a time when records were\
      \ not as precise, we cannot definitively state his age at death, but he was\
      \ likely in his 30s or older at that time based on the context of his life and\
      \ the era.\n\nNow, we compare the ages:\n- Jewell James Ebers lived until 73\
      \ years of age.\n- V\xEDmara Peres's age at death is not definitively known\
      \ but is likely less than 50 years old based on typical lifespans and historical\
      \ context.\n\nGiven this reasoning, Jewell James Ebers was older than V\xED\
      mara Peres at their respective times of death.\n\nThus, the answer to the question\
      \ is **NO**."
    fd193d91-322d-41a3-b312-f8a4509d2f48: "To answer the question, we need to determine\
      \ the ages at the time of death for both Jewell James Ebers and V\xEDmara Peres.\n\
      \n1. **V\xEDmara Peres**: He was a 9th-century nobleman in what is now Portugal.\
      \ V\xEDmara Peres is believed to have died around 873 AD, but the exact date\
      \ of his birth is not well-documented. However, historical estimates suggest\
      \ he was likely in his 50s or 60s at the time of his death.\n\n2. **Jewell James\
      \ Ebers**: He was a contemporary figure, born in the 20th century. Jewell James\
      \ Ebers passed away in 2016. He was born on June 15, 1929, which means he was\
      \ 87 years old at the time of his death.\n\nNow, we compare the ages at the\
      \ time of death:\n- V\xEDmara Peres: estimated to be around 50-60+ years old.\n\
      - Jewell James Ebers: 87 years old.\n\nSince 87 is greater than 50-60+, we conclude\
      \ that Jewell James Ebers was older than V\xEDmara Peres at their respective\
      \ times of death.\n\nThus, the answer to the question \"Was Jewell James Ebers\
      \ younger at their time of death than V\xEDmara Peres at their time of death?\"\
      \ is **NO**."
