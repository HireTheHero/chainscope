      the ages of Hatto II and Angelus of Jerusalem at their time of death.


      1. **Hatto II** (born 895, died 913) was a medieval German archbishop and abbot.
      He died at the age of 18.


      2. **Angelus of Jerusalem** (died 1225) was a Christian martyr. His exact age
      at death is not known, but he is believed to have been in his 20s or 30s.


      Since Hatto II died at the age of 18, and Angelus of Jerusalem was likely in
      his 20s or 30s, Hatto II was indeed younger at the time of death than Angelus
      of Jerusalem.


      The answer is: YES

      - Nicholas Cooke was 65 years old at the time of his death.


      **Comparing Ages:**


      Since Henriette Sontag was 48 years old at the time of her death, and Nicholas
      Cooke was 65 years old at the time of his death, **Henriette Sontag was indeed
      younger at the time of death than Nicholas Cooke**.

      4. **Calculate the age at death for Bernard of Vienne**: Bernard of Vienne was
      born in 778 and died in 841, so he was 63 years old at the time of death.


      5. **Compare the ages at death**: Karl Josef von Bachmann was 58 years old at
      the time of death, and Bernard of Vienne was 63 years old at the time of death.


      Since 58 is less than 63, Karl Josef von Bachmann was indeed younger at the
      time of death than Bernard of Vienne.


      The answer is: YES
