      1. First, I''ll need to research who Humphrey of Hauteville and Hippoliet Van
      Peene were.


      2. Humphrey of Hauteville was a Norman nobleman who lived in the 11th century,
      part of the famous Norman family that conquered parts of Southern Italy.


      3. Hippoliet Van Peene was a Flemish writer and poet who lived in the 19th century
      (1811-1864).


      4. To compare their ages at death, I''ll need to find their birth and death
      dates.


      5. Humphrey of Hauteville lived approximately from 1010 to 1057, meaning he
      died around 47 years old.


      6. Hippoliet Van Peene lived from 1811 to 1864, meaning he died around 53 years
      old.


      7. Comparing their ages at death: 47 (Humphrey) is less than 53 (Hippoliet).


      8. Therefore, Humphrey was younger at the time of his death compared to Hippoliet
      Van Peene.
