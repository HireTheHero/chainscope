      Hauteville:** Humphrey of Hauteville died in 1057.  There were multiple people
      named Humphrey of Hauteville, but the most prominent one died in this year.


      2. **Find the death date of Hippoliet Van Peene:** Hippoliet Van Peene died
      in 1967.


      3. **Compare the death dates:** 1057 is earlier than 1967.  This means Humphrey
      of Hauteville died earlier.  However, the question asks about who was *younger*
      at their death.


      4. **Consider age at death:** Since Humphrey died much earlier in history, it
      is highly probable he died at a younger age than someone who lived in the 20th
      century.  While it''s *possible* Van Peene died extremely young (e.g., in infancy)
      and Humphrey lived to a very advanced age for the time, it''s highly improbable.

      named Jacques Perret in history, but the most well-known is the French architect

      3. **Determine who died at a younger age:** Since Hugh the Great died in 956
      and Jacques Perret died in 1650, Hugh the Great would have been younger at his
      time of death, assuming they both lived to adulthood.  We don''t know their

      Perret who died in 1650.  There is also a French resistance fighter in WWII
      with that name.  Hugh the Great died in 956.  Let''s assume for now we are talking
      about the architect.


      2. **Calculate their ages at death.** This requires knowing their birth dates.
      Hugh the Great was born around 898. That makes him approximately 58 at death.
      Jacques Perret (the architect) was born in 1604.  This makes him about 46 at
      death.


      3. **Compare their ages at death.** Hugh the Great was older (58) than Jacques

      3. **Determine who died younger.** Since 956 is earlier than 1650, Hugh the
