      several.  The most famous Hugh the Great died in 956.  There were several people
      named Jacques Perret in history, but the most well-known is the French architect
      who died in 1650.


      2. **Compare the death dates:** 956 AD is earlier than 1650 AD.


      3. **Determine who died at a younger age:** Since Hugh the Great died in 956
      and Jacques Perret died in 1650, Hugh the Great would have been younger at his
      time of death, assuming they both lived to adulthood.  We don''t know their
      exact birth years, but the difference in death years is significant enough to
      be confident in this conclusion.

      to identify which one is intended.  There''s a French architect named Jacques
      Perret who died in 1650.  There is also a French resistance fighter in WWII
      with that name.  Hugh the Great died in 956.  Let''s assume for now we are talking
      about the architect.


      2. **Calculate their ages at death.** This requires knowing their birth dates.
      Hugh the Great was born around 898. That makes him approximately 58 at death.
      Jacques Perret (the architect) was born in 1604.  This makes him about 46 at
      death.


      3. **Compare their ages at death.** Hugh the Great was older (58) than Jacques
      Perret (46) at their respective times of death.

      1290.


      * **Step 3:  Compare the dates.** 1186 is earlier than 1290.  Therefore, Aaron
      of Lincoln died earlier.


      * **Step 4: Consider the question.** The question asks if Aaron was *younger*
      at his death.  Since he died earlier, it''s highly likely he was younger, but
      not guaranteed.


      * **Step 5:  Consider the lack of birth dates.** We don''t know their birth
      dates.  It''s *possible*, though unlikely, that Aaron lived to be very old and
      Bella died young, despite the later death date.


      * **Step 6: Make the most reasonable assumption.** While not definitively provable
      without birth dates, it is highly probable Aaron of Lincoln died younger than
      Bella degli Abati.

      Carlo Lizzani died in 2016.


      2. **Determine their ages at death.**  This is difficult for Amatus, as his
      birth date is unknown.  However, we know he died *around* 1090.  Carlo Lizzani
      was 91 when he died in 2016.


      3. **Compare their ages at death.** Even if Amatus lived to be a very old man
      by 11th-century standards, it''s highly unlikely he lived to be 91. Average
      lifespans were much shorter then.


      Therefore, YES, Amatus of Montecassino was younger at their time of death than
      Carlo Lizzani at their time of death.

      Montecassino and Carlo Lizzani.**  Amatus of Montecassino died around 1090-1103.
      Carlo Lizzani died in 2016.


      2. **Determine the approximate ages at death.**  We don''t have Amatus'' birth
      date, but his active period was the latter half of the 11th century. This implies
      he lived a reasonable lifespan, likely into his 50s or older, but certainly
      less than the centuries separating him from Lizzani. Carlo Lizzani lived to
      be 91.


      3. **Compare their ages at death.** Even a generous overestimation of Amatus''
      age at death (e.g., 80) is still considerably younger than Carlo Lizzani''s
      age at death (91).

      death date.**  Amatus of Montecassino died around 1090.


      * **Step 2: Find Carlo Lizzani''s death date.** Carlo Lizzani died in 2013.


      * **Step 3:  Determine Amatus''s age at death.**  We don''t have an exact birth
      date for Amatus, but he was active in the late 11th century.  Let''s assume
      he lived to be at least somewhat old, perhaps 50-60 years old. (This is a reasonable
      assumption for a historian and monk who produced significant works).


      * **Step 4: Determine Carlo Lizzani''s age at death.** Carlo Lizzani was born
      on April 3, 1922, and died on October 5, 2013.  This makes him 91 years old
      at the time of his death.

      to know their birth dates to know that Sontag lived longer. Therefore, she could
      not have been younger at her death than Cooke at his.

      4. **Consider life spans:**  Since Zucchi died in 1602, he had a shorter life
      span (ending in 1602) than Gibson (ending in 2002). This makes it highly probable
