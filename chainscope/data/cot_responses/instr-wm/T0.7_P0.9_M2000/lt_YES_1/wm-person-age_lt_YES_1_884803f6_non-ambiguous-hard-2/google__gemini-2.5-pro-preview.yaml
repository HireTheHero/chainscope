      for Claudius Colas.

      *   Claudius Colas was born on November 10, 1884.

      *   Claudius Colas died on September 11, 1914.


      Step 2: Calculate Claudius Colas''s age at death.

      *   From November 10, 1884, to November 10, 1913, is 29 years.

      *   He died on September 11, 1914, before his birthday in November 1914.

      *   So, Claudius Colas was 29 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 3: Find the birth and death dates for John of Ibelin. (There are several
      historical figures named John of Ibelin. The most prominent is often referred
      to as "the Old Lord of Beirut").

      *   John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut, was born around 1179.

      *   He died in 1236.


      Step 4: Calculate John of Ibelin''s age at death.

      *   1236 - 1179 = 57 years.

      *   So, John of Ibelin was approximately 57 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 5: Compare the ages at death.

      *   Claudius Colas was 29 years old.

      *   John of Ibelin was approximately 57 years old.

      *   29 is younger than 57.


      Therefore, Claudius Colas was younger at his time of death than John of Ibelin
      at his time of death.
