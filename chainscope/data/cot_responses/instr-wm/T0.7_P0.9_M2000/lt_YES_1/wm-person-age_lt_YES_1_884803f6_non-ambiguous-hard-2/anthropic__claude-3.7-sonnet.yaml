      Christoph Cellarius (also known as Christopher Keller) was a German scholar
      who lived in the 17th century. He was born in 1638 and died in 1707, making
      him 69 years old at death.


      Step 3: Compare the ages at death.

      Antonio di Vincenzo: approximately 52 years old at death

      Christoph Cellarius: 69 years old at death


      Since 52 is less than 69, Antonio di Vincenzo was younger at his time of death

      Step 1: Identify when Amatus of Montecassino lived and died, and his age at
      death.

      - Amatus of Montecassino was a Benedictine monk and historian who lived in the
      11th century.

      - He died around 1080 CE.

      - However, his exact birth date is not well-documented in historical records,
      making it difficult to determine his precise age at death.


      Step 2: Identify when Carlo Lizzani lived and died, and his age at death.

      - Carlo Lizzani was an Italian film director, screenwriter, and critic.

      - He was born on April 3, 1922.

      - He died on October 5, 2013, at the age of 91.


      Step 3: Compare the information.

      - We know Carlo Lizzani died at age 91.

      - For Amatus of Montecassino, we don''t have reliable information about his
      age at death.

      - Without knowing Amatus''s age at death, I cannot make a definitive comparison.


      Given the limited historical records for medieval figures like Amatus, I cannot
      determine with certainty who was younger at their time of death.


      NO (I cannot confirm that Amatus was younger at death than Carlo Lizzani due

      Amatus of Montecassino was a Benedictine monk and historian who lived in the
      11th century. His exact birth date is not well-documented, but he is believed
      to have died around 1080 CE. Unfortunately, historical records don''t provide

      Carlo Lizzani was an Italian film director, screenwriter, and critic. He was
      born on April 3, 1922, and died on October 5, 2013. This means he was 91 years
      old at the time of his death.


      Step 3: Compare the ages at death.

      While we know Carlo Lizzani died at age 91, we don''t have reliable information
      about Amatus of Montecassino''s age at death. Life expectancy in the 11th century
      was significantly lower than in modern times, with most people not living beyond
      their 40s or 50s, especially considering the health conditions of that era.
      It would be extremely rare for someone in the 11th century to live to 91 years
      of age.


      Based on historical context and typical lifespans of the respective eras, it
      is highly probable that Amatus of Montecassino died at a younger age than Carlo
      Lizzani''s 91 years.


      YES, Amatus of Montecassino was likely younger at his time of death than Carlo

      Step 3: Compare the ages.

      While we know Carlo Lizzani died at 91, we don''t have enough information about

      Step 1: Determine when Henriette Sontag died and at what age.

      Henriette Sontag was a German opera singer who died in 1854 during a cholera
      epidemic in Mexico. She was born in 1806, which means she was approximately
      48 years old at the time of her death.


      Step 2: Determine when Nicholas Cooke died and at what age.

      Nicholas Cooke was the first Governor of Rhode Island during the American Revolution.
      He was born in 1717 and died in 1782, making him about 65 years old at the time
      of his death.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      Henriette Sontag: died at approximately 48 years old

      Nicholas Cooke: died at approximately 65 years old


      Step 4: Determine if Sontag was younger at death than Cooke.

      Since 48 is less than 65, Henriette Sontag was younger at her time of death
      than Nicholas Cooke was at his time of death.

      Step 1: Let me find out when Henriette Sontag was born and when she died.

      - Henriette Sontag was born on January 3, 1806.

      - She died on June 17, 1854.

      - This means she was approximately 48 years old at the time of her death.


      Step 2: Let me find out when Nicholas Cooke was born and when he died.

      - Nicholas Cooke was born on February 3, 1717.

      - He died on September 14, 1782.

      - This means he was approximately 65 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Henriette Sontag: 48 years old at death

      - Nicholas Cooke: 65 years old at death


      Since 48 is less than 65, Henriette Sontag was younger at her time of death

      Step 1: I need to find out when Henriette Sontag was born and when she died.

      - Henriette Sontag was born on January 3, 1806

      - She died on June 17, 1854

      - This means she was approximately 48 years old at the time of her death


      Step 2: I need to find out when Nicholas Cooke was born and when he died.

      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Henriette Sontag: 48 years old

      - Nicholas Cooke: 65 years old

      - 48 is less than 65


      Therefore, Henriette Sontag was younger at the time of her death than Nicholas

      - Henriette Sontag was born on January 3, 1806

      - She died on June 17, 1854


      Step 2: Calculate Henriette Sontag''s age at death.

      - From 1806 to 1854 is 48 years

      - From January 3 to June 17 is about 5.5 months

      - So Henriette Sontag was approximately 48 years and 5.5 months old when she
      died


      Step 3: Find out when Nicholas Cooke was born and when he died.

      - Nicholas Cooke was born on February 3, 1717

      - He died on September 14, 1782


      Step 4: Calculate Nicholas Cooke''s age at death.

      - From 1717 to 1782 is 65 years

      - From February 3 to September 14 is about 7.5 months

      - So Nicholas Cooke was approximately 65 years and 7.5 months old when he died


      Step 5: Compare their ages at death.

      - Henriette Sontag: approximately 48 years and 5.5 months

      - Nicholas Cooke: approximately 65 years and 7.5 months


      Since 48 years is less than 65 years, Henriette Sontag was younger at her time

      Step 1: Identify Alexander V.

      Alexander V was an antipope who reigned from 1409 to 1410. He was born as Pietro
      Philarghi around 1339 (some sources say between 1339-1340) and died on May 3,
      1410. This means he was about 70-71 years old at death.


      Step 2: Identify Gerard I of Durbuy.

      Gerard I of Durbuy was a medieval nobleman, Count of Durbuy, who lived in the
      13th century. He was born around 1223 and died in 1298. This would make him
      approximately 75 years old at death.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      Alexander V: approximately 70-71 years old at death

      Gerard I of Durbuy: approximately 75 years old at death


      Step 4: Determine who was younger at death.

      Since 70-71 is less than 75, Alexander V was younger at his time of death than
      Gerard I of Durbuy was at his time of death.


      NO - Alexander V was not younger at death than Gerard I of Durbuy. I made an
      error in my reasoning. Let me correct this:


      YES - Alexander V was younger at his time of death (70-71 years old) than Gerard
      I of Durbuy was at his time of death (approximately 75 years old).'
