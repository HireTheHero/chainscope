      Uc Brunet and Vanni Fucci to compare them.


      Step 1: Identify who Uc Brunet was and when they lived/died.

      Uc Brunet was a troubadour from Occitania who lived in the 13th century. However,
      specific birth and death dates for Uc Brunet aren''t well-documented in historical
      records.

      Vanni Fucci was an Italian thief from Pistoia who appears in Dante''s Inferno
      (written in the early 14th century). He was a historical figure who lived in
      the late 13th century, but again, precise birth and death dates aren''t well-established.


      Step 3: Evaluate what we know about their ages at death.

      Unfortunately, historical records don''t provide sufficient information about
      the exact ages at which either Uc Brunet or Vanni Fucci died. Without knowing
      their birth dates and death dates, I cannot determine who was younger at their
      time of death.


      NO


      (Note: I''ve answered "NO" not because I know Uc Brunet was older at death than
      Vanni Fucci, but because there isn''t sufficient historical evidence to conclude
      that Uc Brunet was younger at death than Vanni Fucci. The historical record
      doesn''t provide enough information to make this comparison with certainty.)'

      Carlo Lizzani was an Italian film director, screenwriter, and critic. He was

      Step 3: Compare the ages.

      While I don''t have Amatus''s exact age at death, historical context suggests
      he likely died in his 60s or 70s, as this was considered an advanced age in

      Step 1: Find information about Amatus of Montecassino.

      Amatus of Montecassino was a Benedictine monk and historian who lived in the
      11th century. His exact birth date is not well-documented, but he is believed
      to have died around 1080 CE. Unfortunately, historical records don''t provide
      precise information about his age at death.


      Step 2: Find information about Carlo Lizzani.

      Carlo Lizzani was an Italian film director, screenwriter, and critic. He was
      born on April 3, 1922, and died on October 5, 2013. This means he was 91 years
      old at the time of his death.


      Step 3: Compare the ages.

      While we know Carlo Lizzani died at age 91, we don''t have definitive information
      about Amatus of Montecassino''s age at death. Life expectancy in the 11th century
      was significantly lower than in the modern era, with the average person rarely
      living beyond 50-60 years. Even for monks who typically had better living conditions,
      reaching 91 years of age would have been extremely rare in that time period.


      Based on historical context and life expectancy patterns, it is highly probable
      that Amatus of Montecassino died at a younger age than Carlo Lizzani''s 91 years.


      NO - Amatus of Montecassino was most likely not younger at his time of death
      than Carlo Lizzani at his time of death. In fact, Amatus was almost certainly
      older at his time of death than Carlo Lizzani was at his.


      Wait, I need to be more careful with my reasoning. The question asks if Amatus
      was YOUNGER at death than Lizzani. If Amatus died at say 60 (which would be
      a reasonable estimate for someone of his era who survived to adulthood), and
      Lizzani died at 91, then Amatus would have been YOUNGER at death.


      YES - Amatus of Montecassino was very likely younger at his time of death than

      Step 3: Compare the ages.

      While I don''t have Amatus''s exact age at death, we can make a reasonable assessment.
      Given the much shorter life expectancy in the 11th century (typically 30-40
      years for adults who survived childhood), it is highly unlikely that Amatus
      lived to be 91 years old. Even if he was an exceptionally long-lived person
      for his time, reaching 60-70 would have been remarkable in that era.

      Carlo Lizzani was an Italian film director, screenwriter, and critic who was

      While I don''t have Amatus''s exact age at death, historical context suggests
      he likely died in his 60s or 70s, as this was a common lifespan for educated
      monks in the medieval period who survived into adulthood. Even if he lived to
      be considered elderly for his time, it would be extremely rare for someone in
      the 11th century to reach 91 years of age.


      Given the historical context of life expectancy in the 11th century versus the
      20th-21st centuries, it is almost certain that Amatus died at a younger age
      than Carlo Lizzani''s 91 years.

      11th century. His exact birth date is not well-documented, but he is believed
      to have died around 1080 CE. Unfortunately, historical records from this period
      don''t provide precise birth and death dates, making it difficult to determine
      his exact age at death.


      Step 2: Find information about Carlo Lizzani.

      Carlo Lizzani was an Italian film director, screenwriter, and critic who lived
      in the modern era. He was born on April 3, 1922, and died on October 5, 2013.
      This means he was 91 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 3: Compare the ages.

      While we don''t have an exact age for Amatus of Montecassino, historical evidence
      suggests people in the 11th century had significantly shorter lifespans than
      modern humans. The average life expectancy during that period was around 30-40
      years. Even for monks who typically lived longer than average people of their
      time, reaching 91 years would have been extremely rare, almost unprecedented
      in that era.


      Given the historical context and life expectancy of the 11th century, it is
      highly probable that Amatus died at a younger age than 91.


      NO, Amatus of Montecassino was very likely not younger at his time of death
      than Carlo Lizzani at his time of death. Carlo Lizzani lived to 91, which would
      have been an exceptionally old age for someone in the 11th century.


      Wait, I need to be more careful with the question. It''s asking if Amatus was
      younger (had fewer years) at death than Lizzani.


      If Amatus died at, say, 60 (which would be quite old for his time), and Lizzani
      died at 91, then Amatus would have been younger at death.


      YES, Amatus of Montecassino was almost certainly younger at his time of death
      than Carlo Lizzani at his time of death.'

      11th century. While his exact birth date is not well-documented, he is believed
      to have died around 1080 CE. Unfortunately, historical records don''t provide
      precise information about his age at death.


      Step 2: Find information about Carlo Lizzani.

      Carlo Lizzani was an Italian film director, screenwriter, and critic. He was
      born on April 3, 1922, and died on October 5, 2013. This means he was 91 years
      old at the time of his death.


      Step 3: Compare the ages.

      While we know Carlo Lizzani died at age 91, we don''t have enough information
      about Amatus of Montecassino''s lifespan to determine his exact age at death.
      Given the limited life expectancy in the 11th century (typically 30-40 years
      for those who survived childhood), it is highly probable that Amatus died at
      a younger age than 91.

      Carlo Lizzani was an Italian film director, screenwriter, and critic who lived
      from 1922 to 2013. He died on October 5, 2013, at the age of 91.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      While we know Carlo Lizzani died at 91, we don''t have reliable information
      about Amatus''s exact age at death. However, considering medieval life expectancy
      and the historical context of the 11th century, it would be extremely rare for
      someone to live into their 90s during that era. Most people who survived childhood
      in medieval times typically lived to around 50-60 years at most, with very few
      exceptions.

      Given the historical context and typical lifespans of the respective eras, it''s
      highly probable that Amatus died at a younger age than 91 (Lizzani''s age at
      death).


      NO - Amatus of Montecassino was most likely not younger at his time of death
      than Carlo Lizzani at his time of death. Lizzani''s 91 years would have been

      However, considering the historical context and average lifespans in the 11th
      century (when Amatus lived), it''s highly unlikely that Amatus lived beyond
      60-70 years, as life expectancy was much shorter then. It would be extremely
      rare for someone in the 11th century to reach 91 years of age.


      Based on historical life expectancy patterns, Amatus of Montecassino was almost
      certainly younger at his time of death than Carlo Lizzani was at his.


      NO (Amatus was likely not younger at death than Lizzani, but rather older)


      Wait - I need to be more careful with the question. It''s asking if Amatus was
      younger at death than Lizzani was at death. If Amatus died at, say, 60 years
      old, and Lizzani died at 91 years old, then Amatus would have been younger at

      unusual for someone to live to 91 years of age during that time period. Historical
      evidence suggests that the average life expectancy for those who survived childhood
      in medieval Europe was significantly lower than in modern times.


      Based on historical context and typical lifespans of the respective time periods,
      it is highly probable that Amatus of Montecassino died at a younger age than
      Carlo Lizzani''s 91 years.


      NO - Amatus of Montecassino was most likely not younger at his time of death

      the ages at death for both historical figures.


      Step 1: Identify Amatus of Montecassino''s lifespan.

      Amatus of Montecassino was a Benedictine monk and historian who lived in the
      11th century. He died around 1093 CE. However, his exact birth year is not well-documented,
      though he is believed to have been born in the early 11th century, perhaps around
      1010-1020.


      Step 2: Identify Carlo Lizzani''s lifespan.

      Carlo Lizzani was an Italian film director, screenwriter, and critic who lived
      from 1922 to 2013. He died at the age of 91.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      For Amatus, if we use the estimated birth year of around 1010-1020 and death
      year of 1093, he would have been approximately 73-83 years old at death.

      Carlo Lizzani died at 91 years of age.


      Step 4: Determine who was younger at death.

      Based on the available information, Amatus of Montecassino (approximately 73-83
      years old at death) was younger than Carlo Lizzani (91 years old at death).

      Step 1: Find information about Amatus of Montecassino.

      Amatus of Montecassino was a Benedictine monk and historian who lived in the
      11th century. The exact dates of his birth and death are not precisely known,
      but he is believed to have died around 1080-1090 CE. Historical records don''t
      provide clear information about his age at death.


      Step 2: Find information about Carlo Lizzani.

      Carlo Lizzani was an Italian film director, screenwriter, and critic who was
      born on April 3, 1922, and died on October 5, 2013. This means he was 91 years
      old at the time of his death.


      Step 3: Compare the ages.

      While we know Carlo Lizzani died at age 91, we don''t have reliable information
      about Amatus of Montecassino''s age at death. Without knowing Amatus''s age
      at death, I cannot make a definitive comparison.


      However, considering life expectancy in the 11th century was significantly lower
      than in the 21st century, it is highly probable that Amatus died at a younger
      age than 91. Even educated and relatively privileged individuals like monks
      rarely lived beyond their 60s or 70s during that era.


      Based on historical context and life expectancy patterns, though I cannot be

      old at the time of his death.


      Step 3: Compare the ages at death.

      While we know Carlo Lizzani died at age 91, we don''t have reliable information
      about Amatus of Montecassino''s age at death. Life expectancy in the 11th century
      was significantly lower than in the modern era, with the average person rarely

      was considered elderly for his time, it would be extremely rare for someone
      in the 11th century to reach 91 years of age.


      Based on historical context and life expectancy patterns, though without exact
