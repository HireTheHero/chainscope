      was younger at the time of his death than Hippoliet Van Peene, we need to determine
      the ages at which each of them died.


      **Step 1: Determine the lifespan of Humphrey of Hauteville.**


      - Historical records indicate that Humphrey of Hauteville died in 1057.

      - He was born around the year 1010.


      So, Humphrey of Hauteville lived approximately:

      1057 - 1010 = **47 years**


      **Step 2: Determine the lifespan of Hippoliet Van Peene.**


      - Hippoliet Van Peene was born in 1811 and died in 1864.


      So, Hippoliet Van Peene lived:

      1864 - 1811 = **53 years**


      **Step 3: Compare their ages at death.**


      - Humphrey of Hauteville: ~47 years

      - Hippoliet Van Peene: 53 years


      Since 47 < 53, Humphrey of Hauteville was indeed younger at the time of death.

      at the time of death than Jacques Perret, we need to:


      **Step 1: Identify who Hugh the Great was and determine his birth and death
      years.**

      - Hugh the Great was a Frankish nobleman, the father of Hugh Capet (founder
      of the Capetian dynasty).

      - Historical records indicate he was born around the year 898 and died in 956.

      - That would make him approximately 58 years old at the time of his death.


      **Step 2: Identify who Jacques Perret was and determine his birth and death
      years.**

      - Jacques Perret was a French architect and engineer known for his designs of
      fortifications.

      - He was active in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.

      - His exact birth and death dates are not precisely known, but historical sources
      suggest he flourished around 1600 and likely died in the early 17th century.

      - However, without precise birth and death years, it is difficult to determine
      his exact age at death.


      **Evaluation:**

      - We have a reasonably well-established age at death for Hugh the Great (~58).

      - For Jacques Perret, due to the lack of exact dates, we cannot definitively
      determine his age at death.


      Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot conclusively say that
      Hugh the Great was younger than Jacques Perret at their respective times of
      death.

    4a5b7b14-0ddd-4fef-93d6-a94e750742e9: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the age at death of both Amatus of Montecassino and Carlo Lizzani, and then
      compare them.


      **Step 1: Identify who Amatus of Montecassino was and when he died.**


      Amatus of Montecassino was a medieval monk and historian, active in the 11th
      century. His exact dates of birth and death are not precisely known, but he
      is generally believed to have lived during the 11th century. Some sources suggest
      he was born around 1000 and died around 1090, which would make him approximately
      90 years old at death. However, due to the uncertainty, some estimates place
      his age at death lower.


      But for the sake of reasoning, the general estimate is that he lived into old
      age, possibly around 90 years old.


      **Step 2: Identify who Carlo Lizzani was and when he died.**


      Carlo Lizzani was an Italian film director, screenwriter, and critic. He was
      born on April 3, 1922, and died on October 5, 2013.


      To calculate his age at death:

      2013 - 1922 = 91 years old


      So Carlo Lizzani was 91 years old when he died.


      **Step 3: Compare their ages at death.**


      - Amatus of Montecassino: Estimated to have died around 90 years old (possibly
      less, due to uncertainty)

      - Carlo Lizzani: Died at 91 years old


      Even assuming Amatus lived to 90 (a high estimate), Carlo Lizzani still lived
      longer.


      **Conclusion:** Amatus of Montecassino was younger at his time of death than
      Carlo Lizzani.

      - Benedict IX was born around 1012.

      - His date of death is uncertain but is generally considered to be around 1056.


      So his estimated age at death is:

      1056 - 1012 = 44 years old.

      Alexander V was an antipope during the Western Schism. His papacy lasted from

      **Step 1: Alexander V**


      Alexander V was an antipope during the Western Schism.

      - Born: 1339

      - Died: 1410


      So, age at death = 1410 - 1339 = 71 years old.

      Gerard I of Durbuy was a nobleman in the 11th century.

      - Born: Unknown exact year, but he died in 1108.

      - Historians estimate he was born around 1060 (approximate, as exact date is
      not well-documented).


      So, estimated age at death = 1108 - 1060 = around 48 years old.

      **Step 1: Determine Alexander V''s age at death.**

      - Alexander V was born in 1381.

      - He died in 1410.

      - Therefore, his age at death was: 1410 - 1381 = 29 years old.


      **Step 2: Determine Gerard I of Durbuy''s age at death.**

      - Gerard I of Durbuy died in 1138.

      - His exact birth year is not precisely recorded, but it is generally estimated
      to be around 1060.

      - So, approximate age at death: 1138 - 1060 = 78 years old (approximate).


      **Step 3: Compare their ages at death.**

      - Alexander V: 29 years old.

      - Gerard I of Durbuy: approximately 78 years old.
