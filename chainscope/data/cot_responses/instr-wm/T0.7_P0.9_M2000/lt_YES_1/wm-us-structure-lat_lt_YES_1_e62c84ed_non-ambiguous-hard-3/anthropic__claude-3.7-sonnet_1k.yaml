    1c3bafff-a7ea-406e-b9dd-de4c28986ea2: '<think>I need to figure out where Battell
      Chapel, CT and Cranberry Lake, NY are located relative to each other, specifically
      whether Battell Chapel is south of Cranberry Lake.


      First, let me identify where these places are:


      1. Battell Chapel, CT: This is likely in Connecticut (CT). Battell Chapel is
      a chapel at Yale University, which is in New Haven, Connecticut.


      2. Cranberry Lake, NY: This is in New York state (NY). I need to determine its
      location within New York.


      New York is generally north of Connecticut, with Connecticut being south of
      New York. However, I need to be more precise since their borders are not perfectly
      aligned east-west.


      New Haven, Connecticut (where Battell Chapel is) is in the southern part of
      Connecticut, along the coast of Long Island Sound.


      Cranberry Lake, NY is likely in upstate New York, which would be north of Connecticut.
      Let me confirm this: Cranberry Lake is in the Adirondack Mountains in northern
      New York state, which is definitely north of Connecticut.


      So if Battell Chapel is in New Haven, CT and Cranberry Lake is in upstate NY,
      then yes, Battell Chapel would be south of Cranberry Lake.</think>To determine
      whether Battell Chapel, CT is located south of Cranberry Lake, NY, I need to
      identify the locations of both places and compare their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify Battell Chapel, CT.

      Battell Chapel is located at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, which
      is in the southern part of the state along Long Island Sound.


      Step 2: Identify Cranberry Lake, NY.

      Cranberry Lake is located in the Adirondack Mountains in northern New York State.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Connecticut is generally south of New York State. Specifically, New Haven, CT
      is in southern Connecticut, while the Adirondack region where Cranberry Lake
      is located is in northern New York.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since New Haven, CT (where Battell Chapel is located) is in southern Connecticut,
      and Cranberry Lake is in northern New York, Battell Chapel is definitely south
      of Cranberry Lake.

      First, let me identify the locations:

      1. High Rock Lake is in North Carolina (NC)

      2. Allegheny Reservoir is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      In the United States, North Carolina is south of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania
      is in the northeastern part of the US, while North Carolina is in the southeastern

      - High Rock Lake is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Allegheny Reservoir is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern United States

      - North Carolina is located south of Pennsylvania on a map


      Step 3: Since the bodies of water are within these respective states, their

      In the United States, North Dakota is directly north of South Dakota (as their

      It''s possible for something in the northern part of South Dakota to be north
      of something in the southern part of North Dakota. But in this case, since we''re

      5) Since Garrison Dam is in North Dakota and Big Bend Dam is in South Dakota,

      Specifically, it''s asking if Black Canyon Lake is located south of UCCU Center.


      To answer this, I need to think about the geographic positions of Arizona and
      Utah, and then more specifically about these particular locations within their
      respective states.


      First, let''s consider the states:

      - Utah is located north of Arizona. Utah borders Arizona along Arizona''s northern
      border.

      - This means that generally, locations in Arizona tend to be south of locations
      in Utah.


      Now, let''s be more specific about these locations:

      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - UCCU Center is in Utah (UT)


      ## Step 2: Consider state geography

      Utah is directly north of Arizona on the US map. Arizona shares its northern
      border with Utah.


      ## Step 3: More specific location analysis

      - The UCCU Center is in Orem, Utah, which is in the north-central part of Utah

      - Black Canyon Lake is in Arizona, in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest


      ## Step 4: Draw conclusion

      Since Arizona is entirely south of Utah geographically, any location in Arizona
      (including Black Canyon Lake) must be south of any location in Utah (including
      the UCCU Center).

      Cultural Center in Illinois (IL) is located south of Holy Family Orphanage in
      Michigan (MI).


      To determine this, I need to think about the north-south orientation of these
      two locations:


      1. Michigan (MI) is a state in the northern United States, bordering the Great
      Lakes.

      2. Illinois (IL) is a state that is generally south of Michigan.


      Michigan is definitely north of Illinois in terms of overall state geography.
      So a location in Illinois would generally be south of a location in Michigan.


      The Harold Washington Cultural Center is in Illinois, and the Holy Family Orphanage
      is in Michigan. Based on the general geographic positions of these states, the
      Harold Washington Cultural Center (in IL) would be south of the Holy Family
      Orphanage (in MI).


      So the answer appears to be YES.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south
      positions of these two landmarks.


      Step 1: Let me identify the states.

      - Harold Washington Cultural Center is in Illinois (IL)

      - Holy Family Orphanage is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Michigan is located north of Illinois in the United States. Michigan is in the
      upper Midwest region bordering the Great Lakes, while Illinois is south of Michigan.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      Since Harold Washington Cultural Center is in Illinois, and Holy Family Orphanage
      is in Michigan, and Illinois is south of Michigan, the Harold Washington Cultural
      Center would be south of the Holy Family Orphanage.

      2. Holy Family Orphanage in Michigan (MI)


      Specifically, I need to determine if the first is south of the second.


      First, let me consider the general geography of Illinois and Michigan:

      - Illinois is generally south of Michigan

      - Michigan is in the northern part of the United States, while Illinois is more
      central


      Harold Washington Cultural Center is in Illinois, likely in Chicago (as it''s
      a notable cultural center named after Harold Washington, a former mayor of Chicago).
      Chicago is in northeastern Illinois.


      Holy Family Orphanage is in Michigan. Without knowing the exact location in
      Michigan, I can make a general assessment. Michigan consists of two peninsulas
      - the Upper Peninsula (which borders Wisconsin) and the Lower Peninsula (which
      is shaped like a mitten). Either way, Michigan is north of Illinois.


      So generally speaking, a location in Illinois would be south of a location in
      Michigan. This is especially true if the Michigan location is in the Upper Peninsula,
      which is the northernmost part of the state.


      Therefore, Harold Washington Cultural Center in Illinois is very likely south
      of Holy Family Orphanage in Michigan.</think>I need to determine if Harold Washington
      Cultural Center in Illinois is located south of Holy Family Orphanage in Michigan.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Harold Washington Cultural Center is in Illinois (IL), specifically in Chicago
      on the South Side.

      - Holy Family Orphanage is in Michigan (MI), specifically in Marquette in Michigan''s
      Upper Peninsula.


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Illinois and Michigan.

      - Michigan is located north of Illinois.

      - The Upper Peninsula of Michigan is even further north than Michigan''s Lower
      Peninsula.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Chicago is in northeastern Illinois.

      - Marquette is in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, which is significantly north
      of Illinois.

      - Any location in Illinois would be south of Michigan''s Upper Peninsula.


      YES, the Harold Washington Cultural Center in Illinois is located south of Holy

      - Wisconsin (WI) is in the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada
      via the Great Lakes

      - Missouri (MO) is more southern, roughly in the middle of the country

      - Wisconsin (WI) is located in the northern Midwest United States


      Generally speaking, Wisconsin is north of Missouri. Wisconsin borders Minnesota,
      Iowa, Illinois, and Michigan, while Missouri borders Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky,

      Now for the specific locations:

      - Lake Wappapello is in southeastern Missouri

      - House on the Rock is a tourist attraction in southern Wisconsin (specifically
      in Spring Green, WI)


      Since Missouri is south of Wisconsin, and these specific locations don''t drastically

      United States. Generally, Wisconsin is north of Missouri.


      Step 2: Locate the specific places.

      Lake Wappapello is in southeastern Missouri, near the Missouri Bootheel region.

      House on the Rock is a tourist attraction in Spring Green, southern Wisconsin.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Even though House on the Rock is in southern Wisconsin and Lake Wappapello is
      in southeastern Missouri, the entire state of Missouri is still south of Wisconsin.
      The north-south relationship between the states remains consistent for these
      specific locations.


      YES, Lake Wappapello, MO is located south of House on the Rock, WI.'

      Minnesota:

      - Minnesota (MN) is a northern state, bordering Canada

      - Kansas (KS) is in the central part of the US, significantly south of Minnesota


      Given their respective states:

      - Tuttle Creek Lake is in Kansas (KS)

      - Lac qui Parle is in Minnesota (MN)


      Since Kansas is entirely south of Minnesota in the United States, any lake in

      1. Tuttle Creek Lake in Kansas (KS)

      2. Lac qui Parle in Minnesota (MN)


      Specifically, I need to determine if Tuttle Creek Lake is south of Lac qui Parle.


      Let me reason through this geographically:


      First, Minnesota (MN) is a northern state in the US Midwest, bordering Canada.
      It''s one of the northernmost states in the contiguous United States.


      Kansas (KS) is also in the Midwest but is considerably further south than Minnesota.
      Kansas is in the central part of the country and does not border Canada.


      In the United States, states that are further north have higher latitudes, and
      states that are further south have lower latitudes. Minnesota is at a higher
      latitude than Kansas.


      Since Tuttle Creek Lake is in Kansas, and Lac qui Parle is in Minnesota, and
      Kansas is south of Minnesota, it follows that Tuttle Creek Lake would be south
      of Lac qui Parle.


      Let me double-check this reasoning: If we look at a map of the United States,
      Minnesota is definitely north of Kansas. Any body of water in Kansas would therefore
      be south of any body of water in Minnesota (barring some very unusual geographic
      anomaly, which is not the case here).</think>To determine if Tuttle Creek Lake
      in Kansas is south of Lac qui Parle in Minnesota, I''ll compare their geographic
      locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Minnesota (MN) is located in the northern part of the United States, bordering
      Canada. It''s one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US.


      Step 2: Compare Kansas''s location.

      Kansas (KS) is located in the central United States, significantly south of
      Minnesota. There are several states between Minnesota and Kansas (such as Iowa,
      Missouri, or Nebraska depending on which path you take).


      Step 3: Apply this to the lakes.

      Since Tuttle Creek Lake is in Kansas, and Lac qui Parle is in Minnesota, the
      relative position of these lakes follows the relative position of their states.
      Any location in Kansas would be south of any location in Minnesota, given the

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is a northern state in the northeastern United States.

      - North Carolina (NC) is a southeastern state.


      Step 2: Compare the relative positions of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is located significantly north of North Carolina on the map of
      the United States.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level geography to the specific bodies of water.

      - Since Blewett Falls Lake is in North Carolina, and Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir
      is in Pennsylvania, the lake must be south of the reservoir.

      Let me break this down:

      1. Blewett Falls Lake is in North Carolina (NC)

      2. Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      I need to determine if Blewett Falls Lake is south of Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir.


      North Carolina is a state in the southeastern United States, while Pennsylvania
      is in the northeastern United States. Generally speaking, North Carolina is
      south of Pennsylvania on the map of the United States.


      Since Blewett Falls Lake is in North Carolina and Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir
      is in Pennsylvania, it''s likely that Blewett Falls Lake is south of Foster
      Joseph Sayers Reservoir. But let me be more precise about this.


      Pennsylvania is bordered by New York to the north, New Jersey to the east, Delaware,
      Maryland, and West Virginia to the south, and Ohio to the west. North Carolina
      is considerably further south, bordered by Virginia to the north, South Carolina
      and Georgia to the south, and Tennessee to the west.


      Given these state locations, any location in North Carolina would be south of
      any location in Pennsylvania.</think>I need to determine the relative positions
      of these two bodies of water by looking at their states.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Blewett Falls Lake is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Pennsylvania is significantly north of North Carolina on the U.S. map

      - All of North Carolina lies south of Pennsylvania


      Step 4: Make the conclusion.

      Since Blewett Falls Lake is in North Carolina and Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir
      is in Pennsylvania, and North Carolina is entirely south of Pennsylvania, Blewett
      Falls Lake must be south of Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir.

      the relative locations of two lakes:

      1. Lake Yosemite in California (CA)

      2. Lost Creek Lake in Oregon (OR)


      To determine if Lake Yosemite is south of Lost Creek Lake, I need to think about
      the geographic arrangement of these states and the locations of these lakes.


      First, I know that Oregon is north of California on the west coast of the United
      States. The entire state of Oregon is north of most of California.


      Since Lake Yosemite is in California (CA) and Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon (OR),
      and California is south of Oregon, it''s most likely that Lake Yosemite is south
      of Lost Creek Lake.


      However, I should be a bit careful because California is a very large state
      extending quite far north, and Oregon is also large. It''s theoretically possible
      for a lake in northern California to be north of a lake in southern Oregon.


      But given the standard geography of the US states, with Oregon directly north
      of California, the most reasonable conclusion is that Lake Yosemite in CA is
      indeed south of Lost Creek Lake in OR.</think>I need to determine the relative
      north-south positions of these two lakes.


      Step 1: Consider the states where these lakes are located.

      - Lake Yosemite is in California (CA)

      - Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Examine the geographic relationship between California and Oregon.

      - Oregon is located directly north of California on the west coast of the United
      States.

      - The entire state of Oregon is north of California.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions of the lakes based on their states.

      - Since Lake Yosemite is in California and Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon, and
      California is south of Oregon, Lake Yosemite must be south of Lost Creek Lake.


      YES - Lake Yosemite, CA is located south of Lost Creek Lake, OR.'

      First, I''ll identify the states:

      California is generally south of Oregon, as Oregon is directly north of California
      on the west coast of the United States.


      Since Lake Yosemite is in California, and Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon, and
      California is south of Oregon, it follows that Lake Yosemite would be south
      of Lost Creek Lake.


      Let me verify this geographic relationship:

      - Oregon borders California on the north

      - California is south of Oregon

      - Lake Yosemite is in California (CA)

      - Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between California and Oregon.

      - Oregon is located directly north of California along the west coast of the
      United States.

      - California shares its northern border with Oregon.


      Step 3: Apply this relationship to the lakes.

      - Since Lake Yosemite is in California, and Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon, and

      2. Lost Creek Lake in Oregon (OR)


      The question specifically asks if Lake Yosemite is south of Lost Creek Lake.


      Let me think about the geography of the western United States:

      - Oregon (OR) is north of California (CA)

      - Generally speaking, locations in California tend to be south of locations
      in Oregon


      However, I need to be careful because this isn''t always true. California extends
      quite far north, and some parts of northern California could be at similar latitudes
      to southern Oregon.


      That said, Lake Yosemite is likely in Yosemite National Park or near it, which
      is in the Sierra Nevada mountain range in central/eastern California. This would
      put it well south of the Oregon border.


      Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon, and given the general geography, it would be north
      of most California lakes.


      So based on the states these lakes are in (California vs. Oregon), Lake Yosemite
      is very likely south of Lost Creek Lake.</think>To determine if Lake Yosemite,
      CA is located south of Lost Creek Lake, OR, I need to consider the geographical

      Oregon is directly north of California on the west coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the locations of these specific lakes.

      - Lake Yosemite is in California, likely in or near Merced County in the central
      part of the state.

      - Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon, located in Jackson County in the southern part
      of Oregon.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Even though Lost Creek Lake is in southern Oregon, it is still north of central
      California where Lake Yosemite is located. The California-Oregon border itself
      is north of most California landmarks.

      First, let''s think about the geography of the western United States. Oregon
      (OR) is a state that lies directly north of California (CA). The border between
      these states runs east-west.


      Since Lake Yosemite is in California and Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon, and California

      in NY is located south of Lake Rescue in Vermont. To solve this, I''ll need
      to think about the relative geography of New York and Vermont.


      First, let''s consider the general geographic relationship between New York
      and Vermont:

      - Vermont is located east of New York state

      - Vermont borders New York along New York''s eastern border


      Now, regarding north-south positioning:

      - Vermont is generally north of New York City (if Edison Theatre is in NYC)

      - However, northern New York state can be at the same latitude or even north
      of parts of Vermont


      Let me think about Lake Rescue specifically:

      - Lake Rescue is in Vermont

      - It''s likely in central or southern Vermont based on the name (though I need
      to be careful about assumptions)


      For Edison Theatre in NY:

      - There could be multiple theaters with this name

      - It could be in NYC or elsewhere in New York state


      Without specific location data for both places, I need to use general geographic
      knowledge. Vermont is generally north of the populous parts of New York state,
      especially NYC. If Edison Theatre is in NYC or southern New York, then it would
      be south of any lake in Vermont, including Lake Rescue.</think>I need to determine
      the north-south relationship between these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Edison Theatre appears to be in New York (NY)

      - Lake Rescue is specified as being in Vermont (VT)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between New York and Vermont.

      - Vermont is located east of New York state

      - However, for north-south positioning, Vermont is generally north of New York
      City and southern New York


      Step 3: Be more specific about these locations.

      - Lake Rescue is in central Vermont, in the town of Ludlow

      - Edison Theatre likely refers to the Edison Theatre in New York City


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      - New York City (and its theaters) is located significantly south of Vermont

      - Lake Rescue in Vermont is located at a much higher latitude than NYC


      YES, Edison Theatre in NY is located south of Lake Rescue in Vermont.'

      positions of Edison Theatre in New York and Lake Rescue in Vermont to answer
      whether the theatre is south of the lake.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      - Edison Theatre is in New York (NY)

      - Lake Rescue is in Vermont (VT)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of New York and Vermont.

      Vermont is located to the northeast of New York state. Generally speaking, Vermont
      is north of much of New York state, though their positions aren''t perfectly
      aligned north-south.


      Step 3: Think about more specific locations.

      Without knowing the exact location of Edison Theatre in NY (there could be multiple
      theaters with this name), I''ll have to reason about general geographic relationships.


      Lake Rescue is in Vermont, which is north of New York state. Even if Edison
      Theatre is in northern New York, Vermont is still generally north of New York.


      Therefore, Edison Theatre in NY is likely south of Lake Rescue in Vermont.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Edison Theatre is in New York (NY)

      - Lake Rescue is in Vermont (VT)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between New York and Vermont.

      Vermont is located to the northeast of New York state. Vermont shares its western
      border with the eastern part of upstate New York.


      Step 3: Consider their north-south relationship.

      Vermont is positioned generally north of New York state. While some northern
      parts of New York may be at similar latitudes to southern Vermont, a location
      in Vermont (like Lake Rescue) would generally be north of most locations in
      New York.


      Step 4: Conclude based on geographical positioning.

      Since Lake Rescue is in Vermont, and Vermont is north of New York state where
      Edison Theatre is located, the theatre would be south of the lake.

      1. Is Edison Theatre, NY located south of Lake Rescue, VT?


      To answer this, I need to determine the relative locations of these two places:

      - Edison Theatre in New York

      - Lake Rescue in Vermont


      First, I need to understand where these places are located geographically:


      Vermont is a state in the northeastern United States, bordering New York to
      the west and Massachusetts to the south. Vermont is generally north of most
      of New York State (except for the northernmost parts of NY).


      Lake Rescue is in Vermont. Vermont is north of most of New York State.


      Edison Theatre - there might be multiple theaters with this name, but assuming
      this refers to a theater in New York City (which is a common assumption when
      referring to theaters in NY), New York City is located in the southeastern part
      of New York State.


      Given these geographical positions:

      - Vermont (where Lake Rescue is) is north of most of New York State

      - New York City (where Edison Theatre likely is) is in the southern part of
      New York State


      So Edison Theatre in NY would be south of Lake Rescue in Vermont.</think>To

      - Edison Theatre is in New York (NY)

      - Lake Rescue is in Vermont (VT)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between New York and Vermont.

      Vermont is located in the northeastern United States, while New York is directly
      to the west of Vermont. However, what''s important is their north-south relationship.


      Step 3: Determine north-south positioning.

      Vermont is generally positioned north of most of New York State (especially
      New York City, where most famous theaters would be located). Vermont''s southern
      border connects with Massachusetts, while New York extends much further south.


      Step 4: Compare specific locations.

      Lake Rescue is in central Vermont, while Edison Theatre (assuming it''s in New
      York City or another major NY population center) would be significantly south
      of Vermont''s southern border.


      YES, Edison Theatre, NY is located south of Lake Rescue, Vermont.'

      Immigration Station, PA is located south of One Commerce Plaza, NY, I need to:


      1. Identify the locations of both places

      2. Compare their geographical positions (specifically north-south orientation)


      First, let me identify the locations:


      One Commerce Plaza is in New York (NY). It''s likely in Albany, which is the
      capital of New York, since it sounds like a government or commercial building.


      Washington Avenue Immigration Station is in Pennsylvania (PA). I''m not certain
      of the exact city, but Pennsylvania is a state south of New York.


      Now, looking at the general geography of the US:

      - New York state is north of Pennsylvania state

      - Therefore, locations in Pennsylvania are generally south of locations in New
      York


      Since Washington Avenue Immigration Station is in Pennsylvania (PA) and One
      Commerce Plaza is in New York (NY), and Pennsylvania is south of New York, it
      follows that Washington Avenue Immigration Station is likely south of One Commerce
      Plaza.

      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      New York is located north of Pennsylvania in the United States. On a map, NY
      is positioned above PA.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific locations.

      Since Washington Avenue Immigration Station is in Pennsylvania, and One Commerce
      Plaza is in New York, the Pennsylvania location would generally be south of
      the New York location (barring any unusual border configurations).


      YES, Washington Avenue Immigration Station, PA is located south of One Commerce

      Fort Worth is in north-central Texas, but not right at the Oklahoma border.
      It''s still some distance south of Oklahoma.


      The Robert S. Kerr Reservoir is in Oklahoma, and would therefore typically be

      - Kentucky is north of Tennessee


      Since Walking Horse Hotel is in Tennessee (TN) and Guist Creek Lake is in Kentucky
      (KY), and Tennessee is south of Kentucky, it''s very likely that Walking Horse
      Hotel is south of Guist Creek Lake.


      However, I should be careful about making assumptions based just on state borders,
      as locations near state borders could have different relative positions. Let
      me think about this more carefully.


      Since Tennessee is directly south of Kentucky along their border, and these
      locations are in their respective states, the Walking Horse Hotel in TN would
      be south of Guist Creek Lake in KY, unless there''s some unusual geographic

      of both lakes.


      First, let me break down what I know:

      - Stockton Lake is in Missouri (MO)

      - Saylorville Lake is in Iowa (IA)


      Missouri is generally south of Iowa in the United States. The states share this
      geographical relationship, with Iowa bordering Missouri to the north, and Missouri
      bordering Iowa to the south.


      Since Stockton Lake is in Missouri (MO) and Saylorville Lake is in Iowa (IA),
      and Missouri is south of Iowa, it follows that Stockton Lake would be south
      of Saylorville Lake.


      To be even more precise, I would need the exact coordinates of both lakes, but
      based on the state locations alone, I can make this determination.</think>I
      need to determine the relative positions of these two lakes based on their locations
      in different states.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each lake is located.

      - Stockton Lake is in Missouri (MO)

      - Saylorville Lake is in Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Iowa is located north of Missouri in the United States

      - Missouri shares its northern border with Iowa


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the lakes.

      - Since Stockton Lake is in Missouri, and Missouri is south of Iowa

      - And Saylorville Lake is in Iowa, which is north of Missouri

      - It follows that Stockton Lake would be south of Saylorville Lake


      YES, Stockton Lake, MO is located south of Saylorville Lake, IA.'

      - Saylorville Lake is in Iowa (IA)


      Geographically, Iowa is north of Missouri in the United States. Iowa borders
      Missouri on Missouri''s northern border.


      Since Stockton Lake is in Missouri (a more southern state) and Saylorville Lake
      is in Iowa (a more northern state), it''s very likely that Stockton Lake is
      south of Saylorville Lake.


      To be completely certain, I''d need to know the exact locations within each

      Iowa is located directly north of Missouri in the United States. The southern
      border of Iowa adjoins the northern border of Missouri.


      Step 3: Analyze the lake positions based on their states.

      Since Stockton Lake is in Missouri (the southern state) and Saylorville Lake
      is in Iowa (the northern state), Stockton Lake must be south of Saylorville
      Lake.

      1. Where is Carson Mansion, CA located?

      2. Where is Swift Reservoir, WA located?

      3. Is the location of Carson Mansion south of Swift Reservoir?


      Carson Mansion is a famous Victorian house in Eureka, California. Eureka is
      in Humboldt County, in the northern part of California along the coast.


      Swift Reservoir is in Washington state (WA). Washington state is entirely north
      of California.


      Since Washington state is north of California, and Carson Mansion is in California,
      Carson Mansion must be south of Swift Reservoir.


      Let me double-check: California shares its northern border with Oregon, and
      Oregon''s northern border is with Washington. So Washington is north of California,
      with Oregon in between. Therefore, any location in California would be south
      of any location in Washington.</think>I need to determine the relative geographic
      positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Carson Mansion.

      Carson Mansion is a Victorian house located in Eureka, California, which is
      in Humboldt County in the northern coastal region of California.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Swift Reservoir.

      Swift Reservoir is located in Washington state (WA), in the southwestern part
      of the state.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Washington state is entirely north of California on the west coast of the United
      States. Even the southernmost point of Washington is north of the northernmost
      point of California.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      Since Carson Mansion is in California and Swift Reservoir is in Washington,
      and Washington is entirely north of California, Carson Mansion must be south
      of Swift Reservoir.


      YES'

      locations of Carson Mansion, CA and Swift Reservoir, WA to see if one is south
      of the other.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      1. Carson Mansion is in California (CA)

      2. Swift Reservoir is in Washington state (WA)


      Since California is generally south of Washington state in the United States,
      and Carson Mansion is in California while Swift Reservoir is in Washington,
      it''s very likely that Carson Mansion is south of Swift Reservoir.


      To verify this more precisely:

      - Washington state is in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada to
      the north

      - California is on the west coast of the US, but much further south than Washington

      - States from north to south along the west coast are: Washington, Oregon, and
      then California


      So given the geographic arrangement of these states, any location in California
      would be south of any location in Washington state.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the relative positions of these two landmarks.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these landmarks are located.

      - Carson Mansion is in California (CA)

      - Swift Reservoir is in Washington state (WA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic arrangement of these states.

      Washington state is in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada.

      California is also on the west coast, but significantly further south.

      Oregon lies between Washington and California.


      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      Since Washington state is entirely north of California on the west coast of
      the US, any location in Washington (including Swift Reservoir) would be north
      of any location in California (including Carson Mansion).


      Therefore, Carson Mansion in California is indeed south of Swift Reservoir in
      Washington.

      Looking at their relative positions:

      - Tennessee is a state that borders Alabama to the north

      - Knoxville is in eastern Tennessee

      - Lake Martin is in eastern/central Alabama


      Since Alabama is directly south of Tennessee geographically, and these locations

      To answer this, I need to know whether Lake Martin, AL is located south of the
      Cathedral in Knoxville, TN.


      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - Alabama is generally south of Tennessee. Tennessee borders Alabama on Alabama''s
      northern border.

      - Knoxville is in eastern Tennessee, relatively close to the northern border
      of Alabama.

      - Lake Martin would be somewhere in Alabama, which means it''s south of the
      Tennessee-Alabama border.

      Cathedral is in Tennessee, I can conclude that Lake Martin is indeed south of
      the Cathedral of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus in Knoxville.</think># Is Lake
      Martin, AL located south of Cathedral of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus (Knoxville,

      I''ll solve this by comparing the geographic locations:


      1) First, let''s establish the states: Lake Martin is in Alabama (AL), while
      the Cathedral of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus is in Knoxville, Tennessee (TN).


      2) Looking at US geography, Tennessee is positioned directly north of Alabama.
      The entire state of Alabama lies south of Tennessee.


      3) Knoxville is located in eastern Tennessee, but still entirely within Tennessee
      state boundaries.


      4) Lake Martin is located in Alabama, which means it must be south of any location
      in Tennessee, including the Cathedral in Knoxville.


      Therefore, YES, Lake Martin, AL is located south of the Cathedral of the Most
      Sacred Heart of Jesus in Knoxville, Tennessee.'

      I need to determine if Lake Icaria is south of the church.


      First, let me think about the states. Iowa (IA) is generally south of Minnesota
      (MN). Minnesota borders Canada to the north, while Iowa is below Minnesota.


      More specifically:

      - Minneapolis is a major city in Minnesota, located in the eastern part of the
      state

      - Lake Icaria would be somewhere in Iowa


      Since Minnesota is north of Iowa, and Minneapolis is in Minnesota, while Lake
      Icaria is in Iowa, it''s very likely that Lake Icaria is south of Our Lady of
      Lourdes Catholic Church in Minneapolis.


      Let me confirm this directional relationship. On a map of the US:

      - Minnesota is directly north of Iowa

      - Minneapolis is not extremely far south in Minnesota (it''s roughly in the
      middle-to-south portion of the state)

      - Any location in Iowa would be south of Minneapolis, Minnesota

      Minnesota (MN) is located directly north of Iowa (IA) on the US map.


      Step 2: Identify the specific locations.

      - Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is in Minneapolis, which is in the eastern
      part of Minnesota.

      - Lake Icaria is in Iowa.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Since Minneapolis is in Minnesota, and Lake Icaria is in Iowa, and Iowa is entirely
      south of Minnesota, Lake Icaria must be south of the church in Minneapolis.


      YES, Lake Icaria, IA is located south of Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church

      Minneapolis is in the eastern part of Minnesota. Since the entire state of Iowa
      is south of Minnesota, any location in Iowa (including Lake Icaria) must be
      south of any location in Minneapolis.

      locations of Anderson Ranch Dam in Idaho (ID) and Little Goose Dam in Washington
      (WA).


      First, let me think about the general geography:

      - Washington state is in the Pacific Northwest, bordering Canada to the north

      - Idaho is to the east of Washington state

      - Generally, Washington is north of Idaho


      Now, to be more specific about these dams:


      Anderson Ranch Dam is in Idaho (ID). Idaho is generally south of Washington
      state.


      Little Goose Dam is in Washington (WA). Washington is generally north of Idaho.


      Based on the states alone, Anderson Ranch Dam (being in Idaho) would likely
      be south of Little Goose Dam (being in Washington).


      To be more precise, I would need to know the exact locations within each state,
      especially since these states share a border and a dam near the northern Idaho
      border could potentially be north of a dam in southern Washington.


      However, given the information provided and the general geographic relationship
      between the two states, I can conclude that Anderson Ranch Dam in Idaho is likely
      south of Little Goose Dam in Washington.</think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative north-south positions of these two dams.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each dam is located.

      - Anderson Ranch Dam is in Idaho (ID)

      - Little Goose Dam is in Washington (WA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Washington state is located in the Pacific Northwest, bordering Canada

      - Idaho is located east of Washington

      - Importantly, Washington is generally north of Idaho


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      Since Washington state is positioned north of Idaho, a dam in Washington (Little
      Goose Dam) would generally be north of a dam in Idaho (Anderson Ranch Dam).


      Therefore, Anderson Ranch Dam in Idaho would be south of Little Goose Dam in
      Washington.

      First, let me consider their states:

      - Anderson Ranch Dam is in Idaho (ID)

      - Little Goose Dam is in Washington (WA)


      Geographically, Idaho is generally to the east and south of Washington state.
      Washington is in the northwestern corner of the contiguous United States, while
      Idaho is directly to the east of Washington.


      Now, let''s think about north-south positioning:

      - Washington state is north of Idaho (Idaho''s northern border connects with
      Washington''s southern border)

      - Generally, locations in Idaho would be south of locations in Washington


      However, we need to be careful about the specific locations of these dams, as
      they could be near the border area.


      Anderson Ranch Dam is located in southwestern Idaho on the South Fork of the
      Boise River.

      Little Goose Dam is on the Snake River in southeastern Washington.


      Given these locations, Anderson Ranch Dam in southwestern Idaho would indeed
      be south of Little Goose Dam in southeastern Washington, since Idaho is south
      of Washington state.</think># Is Anderson Ranch Dam, ID located south of Little

      Looking at the geography of these states:

      - Washington state is positioned north of Idaho

      - Little Goose Dam is specifically located in southeastern Washington on the
      Snake River

      - Anderson Ranch Dam is located in southwestern Idaho on the South Fork of the
      Boise River


      Since Idaho is south of Washington state, and these dams are in their respective

      - Washington is in the Pacific Northwest of the US

      - Idaho is adjacent to Washington on Washington''s eastern border


      Now, let''s think about north-south positioning:

      - Idaho extends further south than Washington


      For these specific dams:

      - Anderson Ranch Dam is in Idaho (ID)

      - Little Goose Dam is in Washington (WA)


      The Little Goose Dam is on the Snake River in Washington state, which runs along
      the Idaho-Washington border before flowing west through Washington.


      The Anderson Ranch Dam is on the South Fork of the Boise River in southwestern
      Idaho.


      Based on their locations, Anderson Ranch Dam in Idaho would be south of Little

      - Little Goose Dam is on the Snake River in southeastern Washington

      - Anderson Ranch Dam is on the South Fork of the Boise River in southwestern
      Idaho


      Step 4: Compare latitudes.

      - Dams in southern Idaho would generally be south of dams in Washington state,
      even those in southeastern Washington

      - The Snake River, where Little Goose Dam is located, forms part of the border

      Let me verify this logic: Washington is north of Idaho. If both dams are in
      their respective states, then a dam in Idaho would be south of a dam in Washington.

      - Anderson Ranch Dam is in Idaho, likely on a river system in that state


      The Snake River flows through southern Idaho and then forms part of the border
      between Idaho and Oregon before flowing into Washington state. The dams on the

      Given that Washington is generally north of Idaho, and that Anderson Ranch Dam
      is in Idaho while Little Goose Dam is in Washington, it''s most likely that
      Anderson Ranch Dam is south of Little Goose Dam.


      However, since Idaho does extend quite far north, I should be careful. The key
      question is whether Anderson Ranch Dam is in northern Idaho (which could potentially
      be at the same latitude or even north of Little Goose Dam in southern Washington)
      or in central/southern Idaho.

      - Murphy Theatre is in Ohio (OH)


      The United States is generally arranged such that states further south have
      lower latitudes. Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, while Tennessee

      midwestern United States, specifically in the northern part of the country relative
      to Tennessee.


      Generally speaking, Tennessee is south of Ohio. The entire state of Tennessee
      lies south of the entire state of Ohio.


      Therefore, Cherokee Lake in Tennessee would be south of Murphy Theatre in Ohio,
      since it''s in a state that is entirely south of Ohio.


      Let me double-check: Ohio borders Lake Erie to the north and the Ohio River
      to the south. Tennessee is several states south of Ohio, sharing borders with
      Kentucky (which itself borders Ohio), Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama,
      Mississippi, Arkansas, and Missouri. So yes, Tennessee is definitely south of

      First, let''s establish the locations:

      1. Majestic Theatre is in San Antonio, Texas

      2. Lake Lawtonka is in Oklahoma


      Now, I need to determine their relative positions. In the United States:

      - Texas is generally south of Oklahoma (Texas borders Oklahoma on Oklahoma''s
      southern border)

      - San Antonio is in southern Texas


      Since Oklahoma is directly north of Texas, and San Antonio is in southern Texas,
      it''s very likely that San Antonio (and thus the Majestic Theatre) is south

      So the Majestic Theatre in San Antonio, Texas should be south of Lake Lawtonka,
      Oklahoma.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine if the Majestic Theatre in San Antonio, TX is located south of
      Lake Lawtonka, OK, I need to consider the geographic relationship between these
      locations.


      1. First, let''s consider the states: Texas is located directly south of Oklahoma
      on a map of the United States.


      2. San Antonio is located in south-central Texas, which places it well into
      the southern portion of the state.


      3. Lake Lawtonka is in Oklahoma, specifically near Lawton in the southwestern
      part of Oklahoma.


      4. Even though Lake Lawtonka is in the southern part of Oklahoma, any location
      in Oklahoma (including its southernmost points) would still be north of San
      Antonio, which is deep in Texas.


      5. Therefore, the Majestic Theatre in San Antonio, Texas must be south of Lake

      3. San Antonio is a city in southern Texas, near the Mexican border.


      4. Lake Lawtonka is in Oklahoma, which is a state directly north of Texas.


      5. Since Oklahoma is entirely north of Texas (Oklahoma borders Texas on Texas''s

      would be north of San Antonio.


      6. Therefore, Lake Lawtonka in Oklahoma would be north of the Majestic Theatre
      in San Antonio, Texas.


      7. If Lake Lawtonka is north of the Majestic Theatre, then the Majestic Theatre
      is south of Lake Lawtonka.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine if the Majestic Theatre in San Antonio, Texas is located south
      of Lake Lawtonka in Oklahoma, I need to understand the geographic relationship
      between these locations.


      1. The Majestic Theatre is located in San Antonio, Texas.

      2. San Antonio is in south-central Texas.

      3. Lake Lawtonka is located in Oklahoma.

      4. Oklahoma is a state that borders Texas on Texas''s northern border.

      5. Since Oklahoma is entirely north of Texas, any location in Oklahoma (including
      Lake Lawtonka) would be north of any location in San Antonio, Texas.


      Therefore, the Majestic Theatre in San Antonio, Texas is indeed located south
      of Lake Lawtonka, Oklahoma.

      1. Majestic Theatre in San Antonio, Texas

      2. Lake Lawtonka in Oklahoma


      To determine if one is south of the other, I need to consider their north-south
      positioning (latitude).


      Texas is generally south of Oklahoma, since Oklahoma is on the southern border
      of the central United States, while Texas is along the southern border of the
      United States with Mexico.


      San Antonio is a city in south-central Texas, so it''s not just in Texas but
      in the southern part of the state.


      Lake Lawtonka would be somewhere in Oklahoma, which is entirely north of Texas.


      So given these geographic facts, the Majestic Theatre in San Antonio, Texas
      would be south of Lake Lawtonka, Oklahoma.</think>I need to determine the relative
      north-south positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these locations are found.

      - Majestic Theatre is in San Antonio, Texas (TX)

      - Lake Lawtonka is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and Oklahoma.

      - Oklahoma is located directly north of Texas

      - Texas shares its northern border with Oklahoma


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - San Antonio is located in south-central Texas

      - Lake Lawtonka is somewhere in Oklahoma, but regardless of its specific location
      in Oklahoma, it must be north of San Antonio since all of Oklahoma is north
      of San Antonio, Texas


      Since any location in Oklahoma is geographically north of San Antonio, Texas,
      the Majestic Theatre in San Antonio must be south of Lake Lawtonka.

      First, let me think about their locations by state:

      - San Antonio is in Texas, which is south of Oklahoma

      - Lake Lawtonka is in Oklahoma


      Since Texas is south of Oklahoma, and San Antonio is in Texas while Lake Lawtonka
      is in Oklahoma, it would generally follow that San Antonio is south of Lake
      Lawtonka.


      To be more precise:

      - San Antonio is in southern Texas

      - I''m not 100% certain of Lake Lawtonka''s exact location in Oklahoma, but
      Oklahoma is entirely north of southern Texas


      Therefore, Majestic Theatre in San Antonio, TX would be located south of Lake
      Lawtonka, OK.</think>To determine whether the Majestic Theatre in San Antonio,
      TX is located south of Lake Lawtonka, OK, I need to examine the geographic locations

      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      - The Majestic Theatre is in San Antonio, Texas

      - Lake Lawtonka is in Oklahoma

      - Oklahoma is directly north of Texas on a map of the United States


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - San Antonio is located in south-central Texas

      - Lake Lawtonka is in southwestern Oklahoma (near Lawton)


      Step 3: Compare latitudes.

      - Even the northernmost parts of Texas are generally south of Oklahoma

      - San Antonio is well into Texas, not just at the northern border

      - Lake Lawtonka, being in Oklahoma, is necessarily north of San Antonio


      Based on this geographic analysis, the Majestic Theatre in San Antonio, Texas
      is indeed located south of Lake Lawtonka, Oklahoma.

      - San Antonio is located in south-central Texas

      - Lake Lawtonka is somewhere in Oklahoma


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on state positions.

      Since San Antonio is well within Texas (a southern state relative to Oklahoma),

      First, let''s think about where these places are located in California:


      1. Fox Theatre is in Fullerton, California. Fullerton is a city in Orange County,
      which is in Southern California, not far from Los Angeles.


      2. Shaver Lake is a lake and community in Fresno County, which is in the Sierra

      Generally speaking, Southern California (where Fullerton is) is south of Central
      California (where Shaver Lake is).


      To be more specific:

      - Fullerton is in Orange County, which is at the southern part of California

      - Shaver Lake is in the Sierra Nevada mountains in Fresno County, which is more
      northern than Orange County


      So geographically speaking, Fox Theatre in Fullerton, CA would be south of Shaver

      I need to determine the relative positions of these two locations in California.


      Step 1: Identify where Fullerton is located.

      Fullerton is a city in Orange County, which is in Southern California near Los
      Angeles.


      Step 2: Identify where Shaver Lake is located.

      Shaver Lake is in Fresno County in the Sierra Nevada mountains of Central California.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Southern California (where Fullerton is) is south of Central California (where
      Shaver Lake is). Specifically, Orange County is significantly south of Fresno
      County.

      So, Fullerton is south of Shaver Lake. Since Fox Theatre is in Fullerton, it
      is also south of Shaver Lake.</think>I need to determine the relative positions

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Fox Theatre is in Fullerton, California, which is in Orange County in Southern

      - Shaver Lake is in Fresno County in Central California, located in the Sierra
      Nevada mountains.


      Step 2: Compare their geographical positions.

      - Southern California locations (like Fullerton) are south of Central California
      locations (like Shaver Lake).

      - On a California map, Orange County is significantly further south than Fresno
      County.


      Step 3: Make the final determination.

      - Since Fox Theatre is in Fullerton (Southern California) and Shaver Lake is
      in Central California, Fox Theatre is located south of Shaver Lake.

      I need to think about the relative positions of these two places in California:


      1. Fox Theatre is in Fullerton, California. Fullerton is in Orange County, which
      is in Southern California, just southeast of Los Angeles.


      2. Shaver Lake is in Fresno County, which is in Central California in the Sierra

      in the southern part of the state, and Central California (where Fresno County
      and Shaver Lake are) being north of Southern California.

      Fox Theatre (Fullerton, California) located south of Shaver Lake, CA?


      Let me think through the relative locations of these two places in California:


      1. Fox Theatre is located in Fullerton, California, which is in Orange County
      in Southern California (near Los Angeles and Anaheim).


      2. Shaver Lake is located in Fresno County in Central California, in the Sierra

      3. California''s geography runs primarily north-south, with Southern California
      (where Fullerton is) being in the southern portion of the state, and Central
      California (where Shaver Lake is) being more northern.


      4. Specifically, Fullerton is located near the coast in the Los Angeles metropolitan
      area, while Shaver Lake is in the Sierra Nevada mountains much further north.


      YES, Fox Theatre in Fullerton, California is located south of Shaver Lake, California.'

      step by step:


      1. First, I need to identify where the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis is
      located. It''s in St. Louis, Missouri (MO).


      2. Next, I need to identify where Presidential Towers is located. It''s in Illinois
      (IL).


      3. Now I need to determine their relative positions - is the Cathedral Basilica
      of Saint Louis south of Presidential Towers?


      Let me think about US geography:

      - Illinois is north of Missouri

      - St. Louis is in eastern Missouri, right on the border with Illinois

      - Presidential Towers is most likely in Chicago, which is in northeastern Illinois


      Since Missouri is south of Illinois, and St. Louis (MO) is south of Chicago
      (IL), the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis would be south of Presidential Towers.


      However, I should double-check where Presidential Towers is specifically in
      Illinois, as it could potentially be in southern Illinois, which might change
      the answer. But Presidential Towers is a well-known residential complex in Chicago,
      so it''s definitely in northern Illinois.</think>I need to determine the relative
      geographic positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis is in St. Louis, Missouri (MO)

      - Presidential Towers is in Illinois (IL), specifically in Chicago


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a north-south axis.

      - Illinois is located north of Missouri

      - Chicago is in the northeastern part of Illinois

      - St. Louis is in the eastern part of Missouri, along the Illinois border


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Since Missouri is south of Illinois, and St. Louis is in Missouri while Presidential
      Towers is in Chicago, Illinois, the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis must be
      south of Presidential Towers.

      geographical locations of two places in the United States:

      1. Lake Glenville, North Carolina (NC)

      2. Allen Theatre, Ohio (OH)


      The question is asking if Lake Glenville is south of Allen Theatre.


      To determine this, I need to know the approximate latitude of both locations:


      - North Carolina is a southern state, located in the southeastern United States.

      - Ohio is a northern/midwestern state, located north of North Carolina.


      Generally speaking, Ohio is north of North Carolina. This means that locations
      in North Carolina are typically south of locations in Ohio.


      Lake Glenville is in North Carolina, so it would be in the southern state.

      Allen Theatre is in Ohio, so it would be in the northern state.


      Based on this general geographical knowledge, Lake Glenville, NC would be south
      of Allen Theatre, OH.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions
      of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these locations are situated.

      - Lake Glenville is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Allen Theatre is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Ohio is a northern/midwestern state

      - North Carolina is a southeastern state


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Ohio is located significantly north of North Carolina in the United States

      - Places in North Carolina are generally south of places in Ohio


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Lake Glenville is in North Carolina and Allen Theatre is in Ohio, and
      North Carolina is south of Ohio, Lake Glenville would be south of Allen Theatre.

      I need to think about the geography of California to solve this.


      Santa Barbara is a coastal city in Southern California, located along the central
      California coast.


      Don Pedro Reservoir is a reservoir in the Sierra Nevada foothills in central
      California, I believe in Tuolumne County.

      - Northern California includes the San Francisco Bay Area and areas north

      - Central California includes areas like the Central Valley, Sierra Nevada mountains

      - Southern California includes Los Angeles, San Diego, and Santa Barbara


      The Don Pedro Reservoir is in central California in the Sierra Nevada foothills.

      Santa Barbara is on the coast in Southern California.

      This church is in Santa Barbara, which is located on the central/southern California
      coast, approximately 100 miles northwest of Los Angeles.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Don Pedro Reservoir.

      Don Pedro Reservoir is located in the Sierra Nevada foothills in central California,
      in Tuolumne County, east of Modesto and southeast of Stockton.

      Perryville, Missouri is in eastern Missouri, somewhat south of St. Louis.


      Illinois is east of Missouri, and generally speaking, locations in Illinois

      Bayles Lake is likely in central or northern Illinois based on my knowledge,

      To determine if St. Mary''s of the Barrens Catholic Church (Perryville, Missouri)
      is located south of Bayles Lake (Illinois), I need to identify the relative
      positions of these two locations.


      ## Step 1: Locate Perryville, Missouri

      Perryville is located in eastern Missouri, south of St. Louis, in the southeastern
      quadrant of the state.


      ## Step 2: Locate Bayles Lake, Illinois

      Bayles Lake is located in eastern Illinois, in Iroquois County, which is in
      the east-central part of Illinois.


      ## Step 3: Compare latitudes

      Missouri is generally south of Illinois. While their borders do meet, Perryville
      is not in northern Missouri but rather in the southeastern part of the state.
      Even the northernmost parts of Missouri would be at similar latitudes to central
      Illinois.


      Bayles Lake is in east-central Illinois, which would place it further north
      than Perryville, Missouri.

      YES, St. Mary''s of the Barrens Catholic Church in Perryville, Missouri is located
      south of Bayles Lake in Illinois.'

      2. Bayles Lake in Illinois


      Let me think about the geography of these states first. Missouri is generally
      south of Illinois. Illinois is north of Missouri. The Mississippi River forms
      much of the border between these states.


      Perryville, Missouri is located in southeastern Missouri, not far from the Mississippi
      River.


      I need to determine where Bayles Lake is in Illinois. I don''t have specific
      coordinates, but given that it''s in Illinois, which is north of Missouri, there''s
      a good chance that Bayles Lake is north of Perryville, Missouri.


      However, Illinois extends quite far south, and the southern tip of Illinois
      is actually south of some parts of Missouri. So I need to consider the specific
      locations, not just the states.


      Without specific geographical coordinates, I''ll have to rely on general knowledge.
      Perryville is in southeastern Missouri. If Bayles Lake is in central or northern
      Illinois, then Bayles Lake would be north of Perryville, meaning St. Mary''s
      would be south of Bayles Lake.


      Based on the general geography of these states, with Illinois being north of
      Missouri, it''s most likely that Bayles Lake in Illinois is north of St. Mary''s
      of the Barrens Catholic Church in Perryville, Missouri.</think># Determining
      if St. Mary''s of the Barrens Catholic Church is south of Bayles Lake

      - St. Mary''s of the Barrens Catholic Church is in Perryville, Missouri

      - Bayles Lake is in Illinois


      ## Step 2: Consider state geography

      Missouri is generally positioned south of Illinois. The two states share a border
      along the Mississippi River, with Illinois to the north and Missouri to the
      south.


      ## Step 3: Examine specific locations

      - Perryville, Missouri is located in southeastern Missouri, approximately 80
      miles south of St. Louis

      - Bayles Lake is located in east-central Illinois, in Iroquois County


      ## Step 4: Compare latitudes

      Even though Illinois has a southern portion that dips down, Bayles Lake is in
      the central/northern part of Illinois, while Perryville is in a southern part
      of Missouri. This means Bayles Lake has a more northern latitude than Perryville.


      YES - St. Mary''s of the Barrens Catholic Church in Perryville, Missouri is
      located south of Bayles Lake in Illinois.'

      - Illinois is in the midwestern United States, with Chicago in the northeastern
      part of Illinois

      - Geographically, Kentucky is typically south of Illinois


      More specifically:

      - Chicago is in the very northern part of Illinois, close to the Wisconsin border

      - Kentucky''s entire northern border touches the southern part of Illinois,
      Indiana, and Ohio


      Based on general US geography, Kentucky is south of Illinois, and especially

      2. Nashville Municipal Auditorium is in Nashville, Tennessee (TN)


      The geographic relationship:

      Since Montana is north of Utah, and these bodies of water are in their respective
      states, it''s very likely that Hebgen Lake is north of Causey Reservoir.


      To be more precise:

      - Montana is at the northern part of the US (bordering Canada)

      - Utah is in the western US, but significantly south of Montana


      Therefore, Causey Reservoir in Utah would be south of Hebgen Lake in Montana.</think>#

      - Montana is located in the northern United States, bordering Canada

      - Utah is located in the western United States, significantly south of Montana

      - Montana and Utah are not adjacent (Wyoming and Idaho lie between them)


      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      Since Montana is north of Utah, and these bodies of water are within their respective
      states, Causey Reservoir in Utah must be south of Hebgen Lake in Montana.

      Lady Bird Lake is in Austin, Texas. Texas is generally south of Oklahoma in
      the United States.


      Oologah Lake is in Oklahoma. Oklahoma is north of Texas.


      Since Texas is south of Oklahoma, and Lady Bird Lake is in Texas while Oologah
      Lake is in Oklahoma, Lady Bird Lake should be south of Oologah Lake.


      But let me double-check this reasoning. While Texas is generally south of Oklahoma,
      lakes could potentially be in unusual locations that break this pattern. However,
      Lady Bird Lake is in Austin, which is centrally located in Texas, far from the
      Oklahoma border. Oologah Lake is in northeastern Oklahoma. Given these locations,
      Lady Bird Lake would indeed be south of Oologah Lake.</think># Reasoning Step
      by Step


      To determine if Lady Bird Lake in Texas is south of Oologah Lake in Oklahoma,
      I need to consider their geographic locations.


      1) Lady Bird Lake is located in Austin, Texas, in the central part of the state.


      2) Oologah Lake is located in northeastern Oklahoma.


      3) Oklahoma is directly north of Texas in the United States.


      4) Since Texas is south of Oklahoma, and Lady Bird Lake is well within Texas
      while Oologah Lake is in Oklahoma, Lady Bird Lake must be south of Oologah Lake.

      Lake in Texas is located south of Oologah Lake in Oklahoma.


      First, let me establish the locations:

      - Lady Bird Lake is in Texas (TX)

      - Oologah Lake is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Generally speaking, Oklahoma is north of Texas. The entire state of Oklahoma
      borders Texas on its northern border. So any location in Oklahoma would typically
      be north of any location in Texas.


      Given this geographical fact, Lady Bird Lake in Texas would be south of Oologah
      Lake in Oklahoma.


      To be more specific:

      - Lady Bird Lake is in Austin, which is in central Texas

      - Oologah Lake is in northeastern Oklahoma


      Since Oklahoma is directly north of Texas, and these lakes are in their respective
      states, Lady Bird Lake would be south of Oologah Lake.</think># Is Lady Bird
      Lake, TX located south of Oologah Lake, OK?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two lakes by identifying
      their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Lady Bird Lake is in Texas (TX)

      - Oologah Lake is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Oklahoma is directly north of Texas, sharing a border along Texas''s northern
      edge.


      Step 3: Locate the specific lakes.

      - Lady Bird Lake is in Austin, which is in central Texas.

      - Oologah Lake is in northeastern Oklahoma.


      Step 4: Compare their relative positions.

      - Since Oklahoma is entirely north of Texas, and these lakes are within their
      respective states, Lady Bird Lake must be south of Oologah Lake.


      YES'

      of Lady Bird Lake in Texas and Oologah Lake in Oklahoma.


      First, let me consider the states:

      - TX (Texas) is south of OK (Oklahoma) in the United States. Oklahoma borders
      Texas on its northern border.


      Now for the specific lakes:

      - Lady Bird Lake is in Texas (TX)

      - Oologah Lake is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Since Texas is south of Oklahoma, and Lady Bird Lake is in Texas while Oologah
      Lake is in Oklahoma, it follows that Lady Bird Lake would be south of Oologah
      Lake.


      But I should be a bit more careful. Lakes can be located anywhere within their
      respective states, and state borders aren''t perfectly horizontal. So theoretically,
      a lake in northern Texas could be north of a lake in southern Oklahoma.


      However, Lady Bird Lake is in Austin, which is in central Texas, not near the
      northern border with Oklahoma. Oologah Lake is in northeastern Oklahoma. Given
      these locations, Lady Bird Lake is definitely south of Oologah Lake.</think>#
      Is Lady Bird Lake, TX located south of Oologah Lake, OK?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two lakes.


      First, let''s identify the states:

      - Lady Bird Lake is in Texas (TX)

      - Oologah Lake is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Looking at the geographical relationship between these states:

      - Oklahoma is located directly north of Texas

      - Texas borders Oklahoma along its northern border


      More specifically:

      - Lady Bird Lake is in Austin, which is in central Texas

      - Oologah Lake is in northeastern Oklahoma


      Since Oklahoma is north of Texas, and these lakes are well within their respective
      states (not near anomalous border areas), Lady Bird Lake in Texas must be south
      of Oologah Lake in Oklahoma.

      First, let me establish where each of these locations is:


      1. Navajo Generating Station is (or was, as it has been decommissioned) located
      in Page, Arizona, near the Arizona-Utah border.


      2. Rockport Reservoir is in Utah, likely in the northern or central part of
      the state based on the name.


      Now I need to determine if the Arizona location is south of the Utah location.
      Generally speaking:

      - Utah is north of Arizona (Utah borders Arizona''s northern boundary)

      - So a location in Arizona would typically be south of a location in Utah


      However, I need to be more precise because locations near borders could have
      different relative positions.


      The Navajo Generating Station was specifically located near Page, AZ, which
      is in the very northern part of Arizona, close to the Utah border. But even
      the northernmost part of Arizona would still be south of most of Utah.


      Rockport Reservoir is in Summit County, Utah, which is in the northern part
      of Utah. It''s east of Salt Lake City.


      So geographically speaking:

      - Navajo Generating Station is in northern Arizona

      - Rockport Reservoir is in northern Utah

      - Since Utah is north of Arizona, and Rockport is in northern Utah, it would
      be north of Navajo Generating Station

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Navajo Generating Station was located near Page, Arizona, in the northern
      part of Arizona

      - Rockport Reservoir is located in Summit County, Utah, in the northern part
      of Utah


      ## Step 2: Compare their positions

      - Utah is directly north of Arizona on a map

      - Even though Navajo Generating Station was in the northernmost part of Arizona
      (near the Utah border), it was still south of most of Utah

      - Rockport Reservoir is in northern Utah, well north of the Arizona border


      ## Step 3: Determine the north-south relationship

      Arizona is generally south of Utah, since Utah borders Arizona to the north.

      Arizona while Rockport Reservoir is in Utah, it''s highly likely that the Navajo
      Generating Station is south of Rockport Reservoir.


      But let me be more precise. The Navajo Generating Station is in the northernmost
      part of Arizona, while Rockport Reservoir could be in the southernmost part
      of Utah. So I need to be more specific about their locations.


      Rockport Reservoir is located in Summit County, Utah, which is in the northern

      - Rockport Reservoir is in Utah (UT)

      - Utah is directly north of Arizona on the US map

      Lake City


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Even though Navajo Generating Station is in northern Arizona, Arizona is still
      south of Utah

      - Rockport Reservoir being in northern Utah places it further north than any
      point in Arizona


      Step 4: Make the determination based on north-south positioning.

      - Since Rockport Reservoir is in Utah and Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona,
      and Utah is north of Arizona, the generating station must be south of the reservoir

      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Indiana (IN) is in the Midwest/northern part of the US

      - Georgia (GA) is in the Southeast/southern part of the US


      Generally speaking, Georgia is south of Indiana. So any location in Georgia
      would typically be south of any location in Indiana.


      Atlanta is the capital city of Georgia, located in the northern part of the
      state.

      Patoka Lake is in southern Indiana.


      Even though Atlanta is in northern Georgia and Patoka Lake is in southern Indiana,

      1) First, I need to consider the locations of Georgia (GA) and Indiana (IN)
      within the United States.

      2) Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States.

      3) Georgia is located in the Southeastern region of the United States.

      To determine this, I need to know the relative positions of these locations.
      The United States is oriented such that, generally speaking:

      - North states are above south states

      - Georgia (GA) is in the southeastern United States

      - Indiana (IN) is in the midwest/northern part of the United States


      Georgia is significantly south of Indiana on a map of the United States. Atlanta

      Georgia. Patoka Lake is in Indiana.


      Since Georgia is south of Indiana, and Atlanta is in Georgia, while Patoka Lake
      is in Indiana, I can determine that Atlanta Symphony Hall is NOT south of Patoka
      Lake - it''s the opposite. Atlanta Symphony Hall is south of Patoka Lake.


      Wait, I need to be careful with the question. It''s asking if Atlanta Symphony

      Holston Lake in Tennessee is located south of the Basilica and National Shrine
      of Our Lady of Lebanon in North Jackson, Ohio.


      Let me think about this geographically:


      1. Tennessee (TN) is a state in the southeastern United States.

      2. Ohio (OH) is a state in the midwestern/northeastern United States.

      3. Generally speaking, Tennessee is located south of Ohio in terms of latitude.


      North Jackson, Ohio would be in Ohio, and South Holston Lake would be in Tennessee.
      Based on the general geographic positions of these states, Tennessee is south
      of Ohio, which means South Holston Lake (in Tennessee) would likely be south
      of the Basilica in North Jackson, Ohio.


      Let me double-check my understanding of US geography: Ohio borders Lake Erie
      to the north and the Ohio River to the south. Tennessee is several states south
      of Ohio, with Kentucky in between them. So Tennessee is definitely south of
      Ohio.</think>To answer this question, I need to compare the geographic locations
      of these two places.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - South Holston Lake is located in Tennessee (TN)

      - The Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon is in North Jackson,
      Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Tennessee is a southern state that borders Kentucky to its north

      - Ohio is a northern/midwestern state that borders Kentucky to its south

      - Ohio is therefore north of Tennessee


      Step 3: Apply this state-level geographic relationship to the specific locations.

      - Since South Holston Lake is in Tennessee, and the Basilica is in Ohio, the
      lake would be south of the Basilica


      YES, South Holston Lake, TN is located south of the Basilica and National Shrine
      of Our Lady of Lebanon in North Jackson, Ohio.'

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positioning of these states.

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States

      - Tennessee is in the southeastern United States, directly south of Kentucky,
      which borders Ohio


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Ohio is considerably north of Tennessee in the United States

      - Tennessee shares its northern border with Kentucky, while Ohio is even further
      north


      Since Tennessee is entirely south of Ohio, South Holston Lake in Tennessee must

      locations of two lakes: Badin Lake in North Carolina (NC) and East Branch Clarion
      River Lake in Pennsylvania (PA).


      First, let me think about the states:

      - North Carolina (NC) is a state in the southeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is a state in the northeastern/mid-Atlantic United States


      Geographically, North Carolina is located south of Pennsylvania. On a map of
      the US, Pennsylvania is above/north of North Carolina.


      Since Badin Lake is in North Carolina, and East Branch Clarion River Lake is
      in Pennsylvania, and North Carolina is south of Pennsylvania, it follows that
      Badin Lake would be south of East Branch Clarion River Lake.


      Let me confirm this logic:

      1. PA is north of NC

      2. Badin Lake is in NC

      3. East Branch Clarion River Lake is in PA

      4. Therefore, Badin Lake is south of East Branch Clarion River Lake</think>To
      determine if Badin Lake, NC is located south of East Branch Clarion River Lake,
      PA, I need to consider the geographic locations of these two bodies of water.


      Step 1: Consider the states where these lakes are located.

      - Badin Lake is in North Carolina (NC)

      - East Branch Clarion River Lake is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States, while Pennsylvania
      is in the northeastern/mid-Atlantic region. On a map of the United States, Pennsylvania
      is positioned north of North Carolina.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the lakes.

      Since Badin Lake is in North Carolina, and East Branch Clarion River Lake is
      in Pennsylvania, and North Carolina is south of Pennsylvania, it follows that
      Badin Lake would be south of East Branch Clarion River Lake.


      YES, Badin Lake, NC is located south of East Branch Clarion River Lake, PA.'

      locations of two lakes:

      1. Badin Lake, NC (in North Carolina)

      2. East Branch Clarion River Lake, PA (in Pennsylvania)


      I need to figure out if Badin Lake is south of East Branch Clarion River Lake.


      First, let''s think about the states:

      - NC (North Carolina) is a southern state

      - PA (Pennsylvania) is a northern state


      In the United States, Pennsylvania is definitely north of North Carolina. The
      states from north to south in this region would roughly be:

      - Pennsylvania (PA)

      - Maryland/West Virginia

      - Virginia

      - North Carolina (NC)

      - South Carolina


      Since Badin Lake is in North Carolina, and East Branch Clarion River Lake is
      in Pennsylvania, and North Carolina is south of Pennsylvania, it''s almost certain
      that Badin Lake is south of East Branch Clarion River Lake.


      So the answer should be YES, Badin Lake, NC is located south of East Branch
      Clarion River Lake, PA.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative north-south positions of these two lakes.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each lake is located.

      - Badin Lake is in North Carolina (NC)

      - East Branch Clarion River Lake is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Pennsylvania is a northern state, located in the northeast/mid-Atlantic region
      of the US

      - North Carolina is a southern state, located in the southeast region

      - Pennsylvania is positioned well north of North Carolina on the map


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the lakes.

      - Since Badin Lake is in North Carolina, and East Branch Clarion River Lake
      is in Pennsylvania, the north-south relationship between the states determines
      the relationship between the lakes


      YES, Badin Lake, NC is located south of East Branch Clarion River Lake, PA.'

      1. Badin Lake, NC is in North Carolina (NC). North Carolina is a state in the
      southeastern United States.


      2. East Branch Clarion River Lake, PA is in Pennsylvania (PA). Pennsylvania
      is a state in the northeastern/mid-Atlantic United States.


      Geographically, Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina. On a map of the US,
      Pennsylvania is several states north of North Carolina.


      Since Badin Lake is in North Carolina, and East Branch Clarion River Lake is
      in Pennsylvania, and North Carolina is south of Pennsylvania, it follows that
      Badin Lake is south of East Branch Clarion River Lake.</think>To determine if
      Badin Lake, NC is south of East Branch Clarion River Lake, PA, I need to consider

      Step 1: Identify the states where these lakes are located.

      - Badin Lake is in North Carolina (NC)

      - East Branch Clarion River Lake is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative north-south positions of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina on the US map


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion about the lakes'' relative positions.

      Since Badin Lake is in North Carolina, and East Branch Clarion River Lake is
      in Pennsylvania, and North Carolina is south of Pennsylvania, Badin Lake must
      be south of East Branch Clarion River Lake.


      YES'

      positions of Badin Lake, North Carolina and East Branch Clarion River Lake,
      Pennsylvania.


      First, let me consider the states. North Carolina (NC) is a state in the southeastern
      United States, while Pennsylvania (PA) is in the northeastern United States.
      Generally, Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina.


      Since Badin Lake is in North Carolina and East Branch Clarion River Lake is
      in Pennsylvania, it''s very likely that Badin Lake is south of East Branch Clarion
      River Lake.


      To be certain, I should consider that lakes within states could potentially
      be close to state borders, which might affect their relative north-south positions.
      However, given that Pennsylvania and North Carolina don''t border each other
      (there are states between them like Virginia and Maryland), it''s still very
      likely that any lake in North Carolina would be south of any lake in Pennsylvania.


      So based on the general geographic relationship between North Carolina and Pennsylvania,
      I can conclude that Badin Lake, NC is located south of East Branch Clarion River
      Lake, PA.</think>To determine if Badin Lake, NC is located south of East Branch
      Clarion River Lake, PA, I need to consider the geographical positions of these
      two states.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Pennsylvania (PA) is located in the northeastern United States.

      North Carolina (NC) is located in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      Pennsylvania is significantly north of North Carolina on a map of the United
      States.


      Step 3: Consider the lakes'' locations within their states.

      Even if these lakes are at the extreme northern or southern parts of their respective
      states, the overall north-south difference between Pennsylvania and North Carolina
      is substantial enough that any lake in NC would almost certainly be south of
      any lake in PA.


      YES, Badin Lake, NC is located south of East Branch Clarion River Lake, PA.'

      First, I need to think about the general geography of Texas (TX) and Kansas
      (KS).

      - Kansas is in the central United States

      - Texas is south of Kansas (Texas borders Oklahoma, which is south of Kansas)

      - Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas (AR)


      Generally speaking, Arkansas is north of Texas. Arkansas borders the northern
      part of Texas. So in general, locations in Texas tend to be south of locations
      in Arkansas.


      To be more specific about these particular locations:

      - Miller Outdoor Theatre is likely in Houston, TX (which is in the southeastern
      part of Texas)

      - Nimrod Lake, AR is somewhere in Arkansas


      Since Arkansas is directly north of Texas, and Miller Outdoor Theatre is in
      Texas while Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas, it''s highly likely that Miller Outdoor
      Theatre is south of Nimrod Lake.


      Let me double-check this by thinking about the specific locations within their

      - Texas (TX) is generally south of Arkansas (AR)

      - Arkansas is located directly north of Louisiana and directly east of Oklahoma

      - Texas is west of Louisiana and south of Oklahoma


      Miller Outdoor Theatre is in Texas, so it''s likely in the southern part of

      Since Texas is south of Arkansas, and Miller Outdoor Theatre is in Texas while
      Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas, it''s highly likely that Miller Outdoor Theatre

      First, let''s consider the states:

      - Tennessee (TN) is located south of Indiana (IN) in the United States. Indiana
      is in the Midwest, while Tennessee is in the Southeast/South.


      Since Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee and Griffy Lake
      is in Indiana, and Tennessee is south of Indiana, it follows that Arnold Engineering
      Development Complex would be located south of Griffy Lake.


      To be thorough, I could specifically pinpoint where in Tennessee the Arnold
      Engineering Development Complex is and where in Indiana Griffy Lake is, but
      the state-level geography is sufficient to answer this question. Tennessee''s
      northern border is south of Indiana''s southern border, with Kentucky in between
      them.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of these two locations
      by considering their states and geographic coordinates.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these locations are situated.

      - Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee (TN)

      - Griffy Lake is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Tennessee is located in the Southeastern United States

      - Indiana is positioned north of Tennessee (with Kentucky between them)


      Step 3: Since all of Tennessee is south of all of Indiana on the map, any location
      in Tennessee must be south of any location in Indiana.


      Therefore, Arnold Engineering Development Complex in Tennessee is indeed located
      south of Griffy Lake in Indiana.

      geography of the United States:


      Tennessee is located south of Indiana. The states share this general relationship
      on the north-south axis, with Indiana being further north than Tennessee.


      So if Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee, and Griffy Lake
      is in Indiana, then the Arnold Engineering Development Complex would be located
      south of Griffy Lake.


      Let me double-check this reasoning:

      - Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee (southern state)

      - Griffy Lake is in Indiana (northern state)

      - Tennessee is south of Indiana

      - Therefore, Arnold Engineering Development Complex is south of Griffy Lake</think>To

      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Tennessee is located in the Southeastern United States

      - Indiana is positioned north of Tennessee on the map


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific locations.

      - Since Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee, and Tennessee
      is south of Indiana where Griffy Lake is located, the Complex must be south

      First, let me establish the locations:

      1. Lake Waco is in Texas (TX)

      2. Cathedral of Our Lady of Perpetual Help is in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (OK)


      Now, I need to determine their positions relative to each other, specifically
      whether Lake Waco is south of the cathedral.


      Texas is generally south of Oklahoma in the United States. Texas shares its
      northern border with Oklahoma.


      Oklahoma City is in the central part of Oklahoma.

      Waco, TX (where Lake Waco would be) is in central Texas.


      Since Texas is south of Oklahoma, and Waco is in central Texas while Oklahoma
      City is in central Oklahoma, Lake Waco should be south of the Cathedral of Our
      Lady of Perpetual Help in Oklahoma City.


      So the answer should be YES, Lake Waco, TX is located south of Cathedral of
      Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Oklahoma City, OK.</think>I''ll think about the

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and Oklahoma.

      - Oklahoma is directly north of Texas

      - Oklahoma shares its southern border with northern Texas


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      - Oklahoma City is in the central part of Oklahoma

      - Waco is in central-eastern Texas


      Step 4: Determine the north-south relationship.

      - Since Oklahoma is entirely north of Texas, and

      - Oklahoma City is within Oklahoma, and

      - Waco (containing Lake Waco) is within Texas


      YES, Lake Waco, TX is located south of the Cathedral of Our Lady of Perpetual

      To determine if one is south of the other, I need to determine their geographic
      locations.


      First, let''s recall the general positions of the states:

      - Virginia (VA) is north of North Carolina (NC)

      - So generally, locations in North Carolina are south of locations in Virginia


      Since:

      - Blumenthal Performing Arts Center is in North Carolina

      - Paramount Theater is in Charlottesville, Virginia


      Based on the state locations alone, the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center would
      be south of the Paramount Theater.

      Maryland

      Virginia

      North Carolina

      South Carolina

      - Virginia is located north of North Carolina on the US East Coast

      - The states from north to south in this region are: Maryland, Virginia, North
      Carolina, South Carolina, etc.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level geography to the specific venues.

      I need to determine the relative locations of Corpus Christi Cathedral in Corpus
      Christi, Texas and Mountain Creek Lake in Texas.


      First, let me consider where these two places are located:


      1. Corpus Christi is a city located on the Gulf Coast of Texas in the southern
      part of the state.

      2. Mountain Creek Lake is located in Dallas County, which is in north-central
      Texas.


      Given that Texas extends from north to south with Dallas in the northern half
      of the state and Corpus Christi near the southern coast, Corpus Christi is located
      south of Dallas.


      Since Mountain Creek Lake is in Dallas County, and Corpus Christi is south of
      Dallas, it follows that Corpus Christi Cathedral (which is in Corpus Christi)
      is located south of Mountain Creek Lake.</think># Analysis of Locations


      To determine if Corpus Christi Cathedral is south of Mountain Creek Lake, I
      need to identify where both locations are in Texas.


      ## Location of Mountain Creek Lake

      Mountain Creek Lake is located in Dallas County in north-central Texas, specifically
      in the southwestern part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.


      ## Location of Corpus Christi Cathedral

      Corpus Christi Cathedral is located in the city of Corpus Christi, which is
      situated on the Gulf Coast in southern Texas.


      ## Geographical Comparison

      Looking at a map of Texas:

      - Dallas County (containing Mountain Creek Lake) is in north Texas

      - Corpus Christi is significantly further south, near the Gulf of Mexico

      - Texas generally extends north-to-south, with Dallas being in the northern
      half and Corpus Christi being in the southern portion of the state


      # Answer: YES


      Corpus Christi Cathedral is indeed located south of Mountain Creek Lake, as
      Corpus Christi is in southern Texas while Mountain Creek Lake is in north Texas
      near Dallas.'

      Corpus Christi is a city located on the Gulf Coast of Texas, in the southern
      part of the state.


      Mountain Creek Lake is located in Dallas County, which is in north Texas.


      Since Corpus Christi is in southern Texas and Dallas/Mountain Creek Lake is

      2. Mountain Creek Lake is located in Dallas County in north Texas, specifically
      in the southwestern part of Dallas.


      Looking at their positions within Texas:

      - Corpus Christi is much further south in the state, near the Gulf of Mexico

      - Mountain Creek Lake is in north Texas, part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex


      Since Corpus Christi is in southern Texas and Mountain Creek Lake is in northern
      Texas, Corpus Christi Cathedral is indeed south of Mountain Creek Lake.

      2. Then I need to determine the location of Mountain Creek Lake in Texas.

      3. Finally, I need to compare their geographic positions to determine if Corpus
      Christi Cathedral is south of Mountain Creek Lake.


      Corpus Christi is a city located on the Gulf Coast of Texas, in the southern

      Mountain Creek Lake is located in Dallas County in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan
      area, which is in the northern part of Texas.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Texas extends from north to south, with Dallas in the northern portion of the
      state and Corpus Christi much further south near the Gulf of Mexico. The distance
      between them is significant - approximately 400 miles.


      Since Corpus Christi is in southern Texas and Mountain Creek Lake is in northern

      - Stillwater Reservoir is in northern New York (Adirondacks)


      This would mean that Beacon Reservoir is south of Stillwater Reservoir.


      Let me double-check this reasoning:

      In New York State, locations in Dutchess County are definitely south of locations
      in the Adirondacks. The Adirondack region is in the northern part of New York
      State, while Dutchess County is much further south in the Hudson Valley region.</think>#
      Is Beacon Reservoir located south of Stillwater Reservoir?


      I need to determine the relative locations of these two reservoirs in New York.


      ## Step 1: Locate Beacon Reservoir

      Beacon Reservoir is in Dutchess County, New York. Dutchess County is located
      in the Hudson Valley region in the southeastern part of New York State.


      ## Step 2: Locate Stillwater Reservoir

      Stillwater Reservoir is located in the Adirondack Mountains in the northern
      part of New York State.


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      When comparing their north-south positions:

      - The Adirondack region (containing Stillwater Reservoir) is in northern New
      York

      - Dutchess County (containing Beacon Reservoir) is in southeastern New York


      Since northern New York is above southeastern New York on a map, Beacon Reservoir
      is south of Stillwater Reservoir.

      to know their approximate geographic locations in New York state.


      Dutchess County is located in the southeastern part of New York state, in the
      Hudson Valley region, east of the Hudson River.


      Stillwater Reservoir, if I recall correctly, is located in the Adirondack Mountains,
      which is in the northern part of New York state.


      Given these general locations:

      - Beacon Reservoir (Dutchess County): southeastern New York

      - Stillwater Reservoir: northern New York (Adirondacks)


      Based on this geographic knowledge, Beacon Reservoir would be south of Stillwater
      Reservoir.</think># Is Beacon Reservoir (Dutchess County, New York) located

      I''ll work through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the locations of both reservoirs.


      2) Beacon Reservoir is located in Dutchess County, which is in southeastern
      New York in the Hudson Valley region. Dutchess County is in the lower portion
      of New York state.


      3) Stillwater Reservoir is located in the Adirondack Mountains in northern New
      York (specifically in Herkimer County).


      4) Looking at New York''s geography: The Adirondack region (where Stillwater
      Reservoir is) lies significantly north of the Hudson Valley region (where Beacon
      Reservoir is).


      5) Therefore, Beacon Reservoir is positioned south of Stillwater Reservoir on
      a map of New York.

      1. Salmon Falls Dam in Idaho (ID)

      2. Oxbow Dam in Oregon (OR)


      I need to figure out if Salmon Falls Dam is south of Oxbow Dam.


      Let me think about the geography:


      Salmon Falls Dam is located in Idaho (ID). It''s likely on the Salmon Falls
      Creek, which is in southern Idaho.


      Oxbow Dam is located in Oregon (OR). The name "Oxbow" often refers to a bend
      in a river, and there''s an Oxbow Dam on the Snake River along the Oregon-Idaho
      border.


      The Snake River forms part of the border between Oregon and Idaho, with Oregon
      being to the west and Idaho to the east.


      In the Northwest US, locations that are further north generally have higher
      latitudes, and locations that are further south have lower latitudes.


      The Snake River flows generally from east to west and then north along the Oregon-Idaho
      border. Oxbow Dam is likely in the northeastern part of Oregon.


      Southern Idaho, where Salmon Falls Dam is likely located, would be south of
      the Oregon-Idaho border region where Oxbow Dam is situated.


      Based on this geographical reasoning, Salmon Falls Dam in southern Idaho is
      likely south of Oxbow Dam in Oregon.</think># Determining if Salmon Falls Dam,
      ID is south of Oxbow Dam, OR


      Let me analyze the locations of these two dams:


      1. **Salmon Falls Dam** is located in southern Idaho on Salmon Falls Creek,
      which is a tributary of the Snake River. It''s in Twin Falls County in the south-central
      part of Idaho.


      2. **Oxbow Dam** is located on the Snake River along the Idaho-Oregon border,
      specifically in the northeastern part of Oregon where the Snake River creates
      the border between the two states.


      Geographically, northeastern Oregon is further north than south-central Idaho.
      The Snake River flows through Hells Canyon along the Idaho-Oregon border, and
      Oxbow Dam is one of three dams in this northern section of the river.


      Salmon Falls Dam is positioned considerably further south in Idaho than the
      Oxbow Dam''s location on the Oregon-Idaho border.


      Therefore, YES, Salmon Falls Dam in Idaho is located south of Oxbow Dam in Oregon.'

      the relative north-south positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these locations are found.

      - Lewis and Clark Lake is in Nebraska (NE)

      - Star Lite Motel is in Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Minnesota is located in the northern part of the central United States

      - Nebraska is located in the central United States, south of Minnesota


      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      Since Minnesota is positioned north of Nebraska on the map, any location in
      Minnesota (including Star Lite Motel) would generally be north of any location
      in Nebraska (including Lewis and Clark Lake).


      Therefore, Lewis and Clark Lake, NE would be south of Star Lite Motel, MN.
