      **Step 1: Locate One Main Place, Dallas, TX.**

      Dallas, TX is located in North Texas.


      **Step 2: Locate Council Grove Lake, KS.**

      Council Grove Lake is located in east-central Kansas.


      **Step 3: Determine the relative north/south positions.**

      Kansas is directly north of Texas. Therefore, any location in Kansas will be
      north of any location in Texas.


      **Conclusion:**

      Since Council Grove Lake, KS, is in Kansas and One Main Place, Dallas, TX, is
      in Texas, Council Grove Lake is geographically north of One Main Place.


      Therefore, One Main Place (Dallas), TX is located south of Council Grove Lake,

      \ When someone refers to \"Stillwater Reservoir, NY\" without further county\
      \ specification, the *much larger and more geographically significant* one in\
      \ the Adirondacks (Hamilton County) is usually implied, or at least the most\
      \ likely one to come to mind for a general query. The Westchester one is less\
      \ commonly referred to simply as \"Stillwater Reservoir, NY\" without additional\
      \ context, as it's part of a larger system.\n\n    However, the question does\
      \ *not* specify the county for Stillwater. If we consider *all* possibilities\
      \ for \"Stillwater Reservoir, NY,\" then the answer could be different depending\
      \ on which one is intended.\n\n    Let's assume the most prominent one, the\
      \ one in the Adirondacks, as the primary interpretation given the lack of further\
      \ specification.\n\n    *   Beacon Reservoir (Dutchess County): ~41.50\xB0 N\n\
      \    *   Stillwater Reservoir (Adirondacks, Hamilton County): ~44.05\xB0 N\n\
      \n    Since a lower latitude means further south: 41.50\xB0 N is south of 44.05\xB0\
      \ N.\n\nLet's re-evaluate if the smaller Westchester Stillwater Reservoir is\
      \ a valid interpretation for the question's phrasing. If it is, then Beacon\
      \ Reservoir is *north* of it. The question *must* have a clear YES or NO answer.\
      \ This implies there's only one correct interpretation.\n\nThe question asks\
      \ \"Is Beacon Reservoir (Dutchess County, New York), NY located south of Stillwater\
      \ Reservoir, NY?\". The ambiguity of \"Stillwater Reservoir, NY\" makes a definitive\
      \ YES/NO problematic without clarification.\n\nHowever, if we are forced to\
      \ choose the most likely \"Stillwater Reservoir, NY\" without further context,\
      \ it's the Adirondack one.\n\nLet's be precise.\n*   Beacon Reservoir (Dutchess\
      \ County): Latitude approx. 41.50\xB0 N\n*   Stillwater Reservoir (Hamilton\
      \ County, Adirondacks): Latitude approx. 44.05\xB0 N\n*   Stillwater Reservoir\

      \ Beacon is north of it.\n\nGiven the need for a *clear* YES or NO, the ambiguity\
      \ must be resolved. Often, in such questions, if a name is used without county,\
