      \ latitudes**:  \n   - Chicago: ~41.88\xB0 N  \n   - Kewaunee: ~44.45\xB0 N\
      \  \n   - Since 41.88\xB0 < 44.45\xB0, Chicago (and the pumping station) is\
      \ farther south than Kewaunee.\n\nTherefore, the Chicago Avenue Pumping Station\
      \ is indeed located south of the Kewaunee Power Station.\n\n**Answer: YES**."

      in Indiana is located south of St. Matthew Cathedral in South Bend, Indiana,
      we need to analyze their geographic positions within the state.


      **Step 1: Locate South Bend, Indiana**

      - South Bend is a city in northern Indiana, very close to the Michigan border.

      - St. Matthew Cathedral is located in South Bend, so it is in the northern part
      of the state.


      **Step 2: Locate Brookville Lake Dam, Indiana**

      - Brookville Lake Dam is located in southeastern Indiana, near the town of Brookville.

      - Brookville is much farther south than South Bend, and closer to the Ohio border.


      **Step 3: Compare Latitudes**

      - Since South Bend is in northern Indiana and Brookville is in southeastern
      Indiana, Brookville Lake Dam is clearly at a more southern latitude than South
      Bend.


      **Conclusion:**

      Brookville Lake Dam is south of St. Matthew Cathedral in South Bend, Indiana.
