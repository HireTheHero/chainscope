      Step 1: Identify the locations of both bodies of water.

      - Barker Reservoir is in Texas (TX), specifically near Houston in the southeastern
      part of the state.

      - DeGray Lake is in Arkansas (AR), located in the southwestern part of Arkansas.

      Step 3: More specifically, Houston (where Barker Reservoir is located) is in
      the southeastern part of Texas, which is significantly south of the Texas-Arkansas
      border.


      Step 4: DeGray Lake in southwestern Arkansas is still considerably north of
      Houston, Texas.


      Step 5: Since Texas is south of Arkansas, and Barker Reservoir is in southeastern
      Texas while DeGray Lake is in southwestern Arkansas, Barker Reservoir must be
      south of DeGray Lake.

      Step 2: Determine their approximate geographical positions.

      - Lake Monroe is in south-central Indiana, near Bloomington.

      - Chicago is in northeastern Illinois, on Lake Michigan.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Chicago is located in the northern part of Illinois, near the Wisconsin border.

      - Lake Monroe is in the southern half of Indiana.

      - Illinois is generally north of Indiana, and Chicago is in the northern part
      of Illinois.

      - Indiana locations, especially those in southern Indiana like Lake Monroe,
      would be south of Chicago.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Lake Monroe is in southern Indiana, and St. Nicholas Cathedral is in Chicago
      (northern Illinois), Lake Monroe is south of St. Nicholas Cathedral.

      - Barker Meadow Reservoir is located in Colorado (CO), as indicated in the question.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Colorado is directly north of New Mexico in the United States.


      Step 3: Since these are in different states, and Colorado is north of New Mexico,
      a body of water in New Mexico would generally be south of a body of water in
      Colorado.

      if there are any unusual border configurations or if one location is very close
      to the state border.

      - Even accounting for the irregular border between the states, the general north-south
      relationship holds for most locations in these states.

      - Navajo Lake is in northwestern New Mexico.

      6) Since Montana is north of Utah, and Causey Reservoir is in Utah while Hebgen
      Lake is in Montana, Causey Reservoir must be south of Hebgen Lake.


      NO


      Wait, I need to be more careful. Let me verify:


      1) Montana is definitely north of Utah geographically.

      2) Causey Reservoir is in Utah (UT).

      3) Hebgen Lake is in Montana (MT).

      4) Since Utah is entirely south of Montana, any location in Utah (including
      Causey Reservoir) must be south of any location in Montana (including Hebgen
      Lake).

      the relative positions of these two dams.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both dams.

      - Salmon Falls Dam is located in Idaho (ID)

      - Oxbow Dam is located in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Let me determine their specific geographic coordinates.

      - Salmon Falls Dam is located in southern Idaho, on the Salmon Falls Creek near
      the Nevada border.

      - Oxbow Dam is located on the Snake River in northeastern Oregon, near the Idaho
      border.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Idaho is generally north of Nevada, and Salmon Falls Dam is in southern Idaho
      near the Nevada border.

      - Oregon is west of Idaho, but Oxbow Dam is specifically in northeastern Oregon.

      - On a north-south axis, Oxbow Dam in northeastern Oregon is further north than
      Salmon Falls Dam in southern Idaho.


      Therefore, Salmon Falls Dam is south of Oxbow Dam.
