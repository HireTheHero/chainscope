      - It is a residential complex in the West Loop neighborhood


      3. Determine their relative geographic positions:

      - St. Louis is southwest of Chicago

      - Missouri is south of Illinois


      4. Compare their specific locations:

      - The Cathedral Basilica is located in the city of St. Louis

      - Presidential Towers is located in Chicago

      - St. Louis is indeed south of Chicago


      5. Therefore, the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis is located south of Presidential
      Towers.
