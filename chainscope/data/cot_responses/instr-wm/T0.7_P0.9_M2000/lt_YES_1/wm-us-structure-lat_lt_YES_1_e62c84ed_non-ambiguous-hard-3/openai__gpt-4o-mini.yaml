      break down the reasoning as follows:


      1. **Geographical Locations**: We need to identify where both lakes are located.
      R. D. Bailey Lake is situated in the southern part of West Virginia, while Youghiogheny
      River Lake is located in the southwestern part of Pennsylvania.


      2. **Relative Positioning**: To assess their relative positions, we can look
      at a map. Youghiogheny River Lake is generally to the north of R. D. Bailey
      Lake due to the orientation of Pennsylvania and West Virginia''s borders.


      3. **Direction Assessment**: If R. D. Bailey Lake is to the south of Youghiogheny
      River Lake, then it would suggest that you would need to go south to reach R.
      D. Bailey Lake from Youghiogheny River Lake. Conversely, if Youghiogheny River
      Lake is north of R. D. Bailey Lake, then the opposite is true.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations and their positioning,

      step by step:


      1. **Identify the Location of Truman Reservoir, MO**: Truman Reservoir is located
      in west-central Missouri.


      2. **Identify the Location of IBM Rochester, MN**: IBM Rochester is located

      1. **Location of Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC)**: AEDC is located
      in Tullahoma, Tennessee.


      2. **Location of Griffy Lake**: Griffy Lake is located in Bloomington, Indiana.


      3. **Geographical Relation**: To understand their relative positions, we can
      look at a map. Tullahoma, TN is located to the south of Bloomington, IN.


      Since Tullahoma is south of Bloomington, we can conclude that AEDC is indeed
      south of Griffy Lake.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.'

      \ relative positions**:\n   - Since Lewis and Clark Lake is located at 42.5\xB0\

      NE is located south of Star Lite Motel, MN, let''s break down the locations
      step by step:


      1. **Identify the Location of Lewis and Clark Lake, NE**: Lewis and Clark Lake
      is situated near the border of Nebraska and South Dakota, specifically in the
      northeastern part of Nebraska.


      2. **Identify the Location of Star Lite Motel, MN**: The Star Lite Motel is
      located in Minnesota. To determine its exact position, we would typically look
      up its coordinates or address, but for this reasoning, we assume it is in the
      southern part of Minnesota.


      3. **Geographical Positioning**: Nebraska is directly south of Minnesota. Since
      Lewis and Clark Lake is located in Nebraska, it is inherently south of the state
      of Minnesota.


      4. **Comparison of Specific Locations**: Without the exact coordinates of Star
      Lite Motel, we can still conclude that since Lewis and Clark Lake is in Nebraska
      and south of Minnesota, it will be south of any location within Minnesota.


      In conclusion, based on the geographical positioning of both locations:


      **YES**, Lewis and Clark Lake, NE is located south of Star Lite Motel, MN.'
