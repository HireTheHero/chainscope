      1. Irminger Sea location:

      - The Irminger Sea is located in the North Atlantic Ocean

      - It is situated between Greenland and Iceland

      - It is a large marine area


      2. Lake Eyre basin location:

      - Lake Eyre basin is located in Australia

      - It is a large drainage basin in the interior of the continent

      - It covers parts of South Australia, Queensland, Northern Territory, and a
      small part of New South Wales


      3. Size comparison:

      - The Irminger Sea is a substantial marine area, covering approximately 300,000
      to 400,000 square kilometers

      - The Lake Eyre basin is enormous, covering about 1.2 million square kilometers


      4. Direct comparison:

      - The Lake Eyre basin is significantly larger than the Irminger Sea

      - Therefore, the Irminger Sea has a smaller area than the Lake Eyre basin
