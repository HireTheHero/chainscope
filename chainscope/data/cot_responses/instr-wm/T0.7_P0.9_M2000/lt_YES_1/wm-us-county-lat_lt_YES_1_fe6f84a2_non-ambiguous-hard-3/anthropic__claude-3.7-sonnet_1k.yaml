      to determine the locations of Leake County, MS and Brown County, WI and compare
      their geographic positions, specifically whether Leake County is south of Brown
      County.


      First, let me identify the states:

      - MS stands for Mississippi, which is a state in the southern United States.

      - WI stands for Wisconsin, which is a state in the northern part of the Midwest
      United States.


      Generally speaking, Mississippi is located significantly south of Wisconsin
      in the United States. Mississippi borders the Gulf of Mexico in the south, while
      Wisconsin is much further north, bordering Lake Superior and Lake Michigan.


      Given the general north-south relationship between these states:

      - Mississippi is entirely south of Wisconsin

      - Therefore, any county in Mississippi (including Leake County) would be south
      of any county in Wisconsin (including Brown County)


      So, Leake County, MS is indeed located south of Brown County, WI.</think>I''ll
      think through this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the states these counties are in.

      - Leake County is in Mississippi (MS)

      - Brown County is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Mississippi is located in the southern United States, bordering the Gulf of
      Mexico

      - Wisconsin is located in the northern Midwest, much further north on the map


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Wisconsin is significantly north of Mississippi

      - Any county in Mississippi would be south of any county in Wisconsin


      Step 4: Make the specific county comparison.

      - Since Leake County is in Mississippi, and Brown County is in Wisconsin, Leake
      County must be south of Brown County


      YES'

      Let me break this down:

      1. Leake County is in Mississippi (MS)

      2. Brown County is in Wisconsin (WI)


      To determine which is further south, I need to consider the geographic positions
      of these states:

      - Wisconsin (WI) is a northern state, bordering Canada through the Great Lakes

      - Mississippi (MS) is a southern state, bordering the Gulf of Mexico


      The US states, from north to south, include Wisconsin quite far north and Mississippi
      quite far south. Wisconsin is in the northern part of the US, while Mississippi
      is in the southern part of the US.

      2) Brown County is in Wisconsin (WI)

      3) Mississippi is a southern state, located in the Deep South region of the
      United States

      4) Wisconsin is a northern state, located in the Upper Midwest region

      5) Geographically, Mississippi is positioned much further south than Wisconsin

      the relative positions of two US counties: Leake County, Mississippi (MS) and
      Brown County, Wisconsin (WI).


      To solve this, I need to determine:

      1. Where Mississippi is relative to Wisconsin

      2. The locations of these specific counties within their states


      First, let''s consider the states:

      - Mississippi (MS) is in the southern United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico

      - Wisconsin (WI) is in the northern Midwest United States, bordering Lake Michigan
      and Lake Superior


      Mississippi is definitely south of Wisconsin on a map of the United States.


      Now, regarding the specific counties:

      - Leake County is a county in Mississippi

      - Brown County is a county in Wisconsin


      Since Mississippi is entirely south of Wisconsin, any county in Mississippi
      (including Leake County) would be south of any county in Wisconsin (including
      Brown County).


      So Leake County, MS is definitely south of Brown County, WI.</think># Is Leake
      County, MS located south of Brown County, WI?


      I need to think about the locations of these counties and their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Leake County is in Mississippi (MS)

      - Brown County is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Mississippi is in the southern United States, while Wisconsin is in the northern
      Midwest. On a map of the US, Wisconsin is positioned significantly north of
      Mississippi.


      Step 3: Consider county positions within their states.

      Even if Leake County were in northern Mississippi and Brown County were in southern
      Wisconsin, the entire state of Mississippi is still south of Wisconsin.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      Since Mississippi is entirely south of Wisconsin, any county in Mississippi
      (including Leake County) must be south of any county in Wisconsin (including
      Brown County).

      - Wisconsin is a northern state, located in the Upper Midwest region of the
      United States

      - Mississippi is a southern state, located in the Deep South region along the
      Gulf of Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Wisconsin is much further north in the United States

      - Mississippi is significantly south of Wisconsin


      Step 4: Since counties are contained within their respective states, Leake County
      must be south of Brown County because Mississippi is entirely south of Wisconsin.

      locations of Inyo County, CA and Sanders County, MT.


      First, let''s think about where these counties are located:

      - Inyo County is in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the United
      States

      - Sanders County is in Montana (MT), which is in the northern part of the United
      States, bordering Canada


      Now I need to think about their north-south relationship:

      - California is generally south of Montana on a map

      - Montana borders Canada, so it''s quite far north

      - California extends quite far south, bordering Mexico


      However, California is a very large state that extends quite far north, and
      Montana is fairly large too. So I need to think about the specific locations
      of these counties within their states.


      Inyo County is in eastern California, in the area that includes Death Valley
      and borders Nevada. It''s not in the southernmost part of California, but it''s
      in the southern half of the state.


      Sanders County is in western Montana. Montana is a northern state, and any county
      in Montana would be fairly far north.


      Given that California is south of Montana, and Inyo County is in California
      while Sanders County is in Montana, it''s highly likely that Inyo County is
      south of Sanders County.


      To be completely sure, I''d need to know the exact latitudes, but based on the
      general geography of the United States, with Montana being a northern border
      state and California being further south, I can conclude that Inyo County, CA

      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Montana is a northern state that borders Canada

      - California is on the west coast and extends from Oregon down to Mexico


      ## Step 3: Analyze the counties'' positions

      - Sanders County is in northwestern Montana, close to the Idaho border

      - Inyo County is in eastern California, containing parts of Death Valley


      ## Step 4: Compare their latitudes

      - Any county in Montana (including Sanders) will be much further north than
      most of California

      - Even though Inyo County isn''t in the southernmost part of California, it''s
      still significantly south of Montana''s position

      Is Prairie County, AR located south of Itasca County, MN?


      I need to think about the geographic locations of these counties and their states.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Prairie County is in Arkansas (AR)

      - Itasca County is in Minnesota (MN)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Minnesota is a northern state, located in the Upper Midwest region of the
      United States

      - Arkansas is a southern state, located in the southern region of the United
      States


      ## Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      Minnesota borders Canada to the north, while Arkansas is much further south,
      positioned above Louisiana and Texas. On a map of the United States, Minnesota
      is significantly north of Arkansas.


      ## Step 4: Conclude about the counties

      Since Prairie County is in Arkansas, and Itasca County is in Minnesota, Prairie
      County must be south of Itasca County.

      geographic positions of these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states these counties are in.

      - Quay County is in New Mexico (NM)

      - Billings County is in North Dakota (ND)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - North Dakota is located in the northern part of the United States, bordering
      Canada

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States, much farther south


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - All counties in New Mexico lie south of all counties in North Dakota

      - This is because New Mexico as a state is entirely south of North Dakota


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Quay County is in New Mexico and Billings County is in North Dakota, Quay
      County must be south of Billings County.

      1. Quay County is in New Mexico (NM), which is in the southwestern United States.

      2. Billings County is in North Dakota (ND), which is in the northern central
      United States.


      In general, North Dakota is much farther north than New Mexico in the United

      - North Dakota is in the northern United States, bordering Canada

      - New Mexico is in the southwestern United States, bordering Mexico


      Step 3: Compare relative positions.

      - North Dakota is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US

      - New Mexico is one of the southernmost states in the contiguous US

      - Any county in New Mexico would be south of any county in North Dakota


      Therefore, Quay County, NM is definitely located south of Billings County, ND.

      the relative locations of Iberville Parish, LA and Whiteside County, IL.


      Step 1: Identify where Iberville Parish, LA is located.

      Iberville Parish is in Louisiana (LA). Louisiana is a state in the southern
      United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 2: Identify where Whiteside County, IL is located.

      Whiteside County is in Illinois (IL). Illinois is a state in the midwestern
      United States, and doesn''t border the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare their relative north-south positions.

      In the United States, states that are further south generally have lower latitudes.
      Louisiana is significantly south of Illinois on a map of the United States.
      Louisiana is one of the southernmost states, while Illinois is more in the middle
      of the country.


      Step 4: Make the final comparison.

      Since Iberville Parish is in Louisiana (a southern state) and Whiteside County
      is in Illinois (a midwestern state that is north of Louisiana), Iberville Parish
      would be south of Whiteside County.</think>To determine if Iberville Parish,
      LA is located south of Whiteside County, IL, I need to think about the geographic
      locations of these counties and their respective states.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties within their states.

      - Iberville Parish is in Louisiana (LA)

      - Whiteside County is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Louisiana and Illinois.

      - Louisiana is a southern state bordering the Gulf of Mexico

      - Illinois is a midwestern state located much further north


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Louisiana is significantly south of Illinois on the map of the United States

      - Any parish in Louisiana would be south of any county in Illinois due to their
      states'' relative positions


      Therefore, Iberville Parish, LA is indeed located south of Whiteside County,
      IL.

      Dakota within the United States.


      South Dakota is a northern state, bordering North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska,
      Wyoming, and Montana. It''s located in the northern part of the United States.


      Texas is located in the southern United States, bordering Mexico to its south,
      and the US states of New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana.


      Based on this general knowledge, Texas is significantly south of South Dakota.
      Any county in Texas would be south of any county in South Dakota.


      Therefore, Stonewall County, TX would be located south of Edmunds County, SD.</think>To
      determine if Stonewall County, TX is located south of Edmunds County, SD, I
      need to consider the geographic positions of Texas and South Dakota.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' locations within the US.

      - South Dakota (SD) is a northern state in the upper Midwest region.

      - Texas (TX) is a southern state that extends to the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      - South Dakota is positioned much farther north in the United States.

      - Texas is positioned much farther south in the United States.


      Step 3: Apply this knowledge to the counties.

      - Edmunds County must be in the northern part of the US (in South Dakota).

      - Stonewall County must be in the southern part of the US (in Texas).


      Since any county in Texas would be south of any county in South Dakota due to
      their respective state positions, Stonewall County, TX is indeed south of Edmunds
      County, SD.


      YES'

      1. Stonewall County is in Texas (TX).

      2. Edmunds County is in South Dakota (SD).


      Now I need to think about the geographic positions of these states:

      - Texas is located in the southern United States

      - South Dakota is located in the northern central United States


      In terms of north-south positioning on a map of the United States:

      - South Dakota is much further north than Texas

      - Any county in Texas would be south of any county in South Dakota


      Therefore, Stonewall County, TX would be south of Edmunds County, SD.</think>To
      answer this question, I''ll determine the relative north-south positions of
      these counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these counties are located.

      - Stonewall County is in Texas (TX)

      - Edmunds County is in South Dakota (SD)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Texas is located in the southern United States

      - South Dakota is located in the northern central United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - South Dakota lies much further north than Texas

      - All counties in Texas are south of all counties in South Dakota, regardless
      of their specific locations within those states


      YES, Stonewall County, TX is located south of Edmunds County, SD.'

      step:


      1. The question is asking about the relative positions of two US counties: Stonewall
      County, TX and Edmunds County, SD.

      2. TX is the abbreviation for Texas, which is a state in the southern United
      States.

      3. SD is the abbreviation for South Dakota, which is a state in the northern
      United States.

      4. Generally speaking, any county in Texas would be south of any county in South
      Dakota, since Texas is geographically south of South Dakota.

      5. To verify: Texas shares borders with Oklahoma to the north, while South Dakota
      is much further north, sharing a border with North Dakota.


      So based on the locations of these states, Stonewall County, TX would indeed
      be located south of Edmunds County, SD.</think>I need to determine the relative
      north-south positioning of these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states these counties are in.

      - Stonewall County is in Texas (TX)

      - Edmunds County is in South Dakota (SD)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Texas is located in the southern United States

      - South Dakota is located in the northern United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - South Dakota is significantly north of Texas on the map

      - All counties in Texas are south of all counties in South Dakota


      Therefore, Stonewall County, TX is indeed located south of Edmunds County, SD.


      YES'

      to determine the relative geographic positions of Stonewall County, TX and Edmunds
      County, SD.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      TX is Texas, which is in the southern United States.

      SD is South Dakota, which is in the northern central United States.


      Step 2: Compare the states'' positions.

      Generally speaking, Texas is located south of South Dakota. The entire state
      of Texas is south of the entire state of South Dakota.


      Step 3: Consider the counties'' positions within their states.

      The specific locations of Stonewall County within Texas and Edmunds County within
      South Dakota don''t change the fact that any county in Texas would be south
      of any county in South Dakota, simply because of the states'' relative positions.


      Therefore, Stonewall County, TX is indeed located south of Edmunds County, SD.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these counties by state.

      - Stonewall County is in Texas (TX)

      - Edmunds County is in South Dakota (SD)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and South Dakota.

      - Texas is located in the southern United States

      - South Dakota is located in the northern central United States

      - Texas is entirely south of South Dakota on the map


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      Since Texas is completely south of South Dakota geographically, any county in
      Texas (including Stonewall County) must be south of any county in South Dakota
      (including Edmunds County).


      YES, Stonewall County, TX is located south of Edmunds County, SD.'

      2. Brookings County, SD (South Dakota)


      I need to figure out if Matagorda County is located south of Brookings County.


      First, let''s think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Texas is in the southern part of the United States

      - South Dakota is in the northern part of the United States, specifically in
      the northern Great Plains region


      Since Texas is south of South Dakota in the United States, it would make sense
      that counties in Texas would be south of counties in South Dakota.


      Matagorda County is in Texas, so it should be south of Brookings County, which
      is in South Dakota.


      To be more precise:

      - Matagorda County is located along the Gulf Coast of Texas

      - Brookings County is in eastern South Dakota, near the Minnesota border


      Given these locations, Matagorda County is definitely south of Brookings County.</think>#
      Step-by-Step Reasoning


      First, I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two counties
      by looking at which states they''re in.


      1. Matagorda County is in Texas (TX)

      2. Brookings County is in South Dakota (SD)


      Looking at the geographic position of these states:

      - South Dakota is in the northern central part of the United States

      - Texas is in the southern part of the United States


      Since Texas is significantly south of South Dakota in the United States, any
      county in Texas (including Matagorda County) would be south of any county in
      South Dakota (including Brookings County).


      To be more specific, Matagorda County is actually on the Gulf Coast of Texas,
      in the southeastern part of the state, making it even further south.

      1. First, I need to identify the states: TX is Texas and MN is Minnesota.

      2. In the United States, Minnesota is a northern state that borders Canada,
      while Texas is a southern state that borders Mexico.

      3. Therefore, Minnesota is generally north of Texas.

      4. If Archer County is in Texas, and Lac qui Parle County is in Minnesota, then
      Archer County would be south of Lac qui Parle County.


      Let me double-check this reasoning:

      - Archer County is in Texas (TX)

      - Lac qui Parle County is in Minnesota (MN)

      - Minnesota is located north of Texas in the United States

      - Therefore, any county in Texas would be south of any county in Minnesota


      Given this reasoning, Archer County, TX is located south of Lac qui Parle County,
      MN.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographical
      positions of these two counties.

      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Minnesota is a northern state in the US, bordering Canada

      - Texas is a southern state in the US, much further south and bordering Mexico


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions of the counties.

      - Since Minnesota is significantly north of Texas, any county in Minnesota (including
      Lac qui Parle County) would be north of any county in Texas (including Archer
      County)

      - Conversely, any county in Texas would be south of any county in Minnesota


      Therefore, Archer County, TX is located south of Lac qui Parle County, MN.

      - Michigan is in the north-central part of the United States, specifically in
      the Great Lakes region


      Given the general locations of these states, Florida is south of Michigan. So

      - Geneva County is in Alabama (AL)

      - Walworth County is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of Alabama and Wisconsin.

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States

      - Wisconsin is located in the northern Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Wisconsin is much further north in the United States, bordering the Great
      Lakes and near Canada

      - Alabama is much further south, extending to the Gulf of Mexico


      Step 4: Make the final determination about the counties.

      Since Geneva County is in Alabama (a southern state) and Walworth County is
      in Wisconsin (a northern state), Geneva County must be south of Walworth County.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States

      - Wisconsin is located in the northern Midwest United States


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positioning.

      - Wisconsin is significantly north of Alabama in terms of latitude

      First, let me think about their state locations:

      - Geneva County is in Alabama (AL), which is a southern state.

      - Walworth County is in Wisconsin (WI), which is a northern state, specifically
      in the Upper Midwest.


      Given the general geography of the United States:

      - Alabama is much further south than Wisconsin.

      - Wisconsin borders Lake Michigan and is close to the Canadian border.

      - Alabama is in the Deep South, bordering the Gulf of Mexico and Florida.

      positions of two counties in the United States:

      1. Sabine Parish, Louisiana (LA)

      2. Sibley County, Minnesota (MN)


      The question is whether Sabine Parish, LA is located south of Sibley County,
      MN.


      To answer this, I need to think about the geographic locations of Louisiana
      and Minnesota in the United States.


      Louisiana (LA) is located in the southeastern United States, along the Gulf
      of Mexico. It''s one of the southernmost states in the continental US.


      Minnesota (MN) is located in the northern part of the United States, bordering
      Canada. It''s one of the northernmost states in the continental US.


      Since Louisiana is a southern state and Minnesota is a northern state, it follows
      that Sabine Parish in Louisiana would be located south of Sibley County in Minnesota.</think>I
      need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these counties are located.

      - Sabine Parish is in Louisiana (LA)

      - Sibley County is in Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Louisiana is located in the southern United States, bordering the Gulf of
      Mexico

      - Minnesota is located in the northern United States, bordering Canada


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Minnesota is one of the northernmost states in the continental US

      - Louisiana is one of the southernmost states in the continental US


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the counties.

      Since Louisiana is significantly south of Minnesota, any parish in Louisiana
      (including Sabine Parish) would be south of any county in Minnesota (including
      Sibley County).


      YES'

      in Minnesota.


      Specifically:

      - Sabine Parish is in western Louisiana

      First, let''s consider the states they''re in:

      - Young County is in Texas (TX)

      - Rolette County is in North Dakota (ND)


      Texas is located in the southern part of the United States, while North Dakota

      Dakota (a northern state), it follows that Young County, TX would be located
      south of Rolette County, ND.</think>I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of these counties within their states.

      - Young County is located in Texas (TX)

      - Rolette County is located in North Dakota (ND)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical position of these states within the US.

      - North Dakota is a northern state, bordering Canada at the northern edge of
      the contiguous United States

      - Texas is a southern state, extending to the Gulf of Mexico and the Mexican
      border


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - North Dakota lies near the Canadian border at the northern part of the US

      - Texas is positioned in the southern region of the country

      - Any county in Texas would be south of any county in North Dakota due to their
      states'' relative positions

      - North Dakota is a northern state, bordering Canada at the northern edge of
      the continental United States

      - Texas is in the southern United States, bordering Mexico


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      Since North Dakota is one of the northernmost states and Texas is one of the
      southernmost states in the continental US, any county in Texas (including Young

      to determine the relative geographic locations of Indian River County, FL and
      Tucker County, WV.


      Let me think about this in terms of the states first:

      - FL is Florida, which is in the southeastern United States, extending south
      into a peninsula

      - WV is West Virginia, which is in the Appalachian region of the eastern United
      States


      Generally speaking, Florida is south of West Virginia. The entire state of Florida
      is south of the entire state of West Virginia.


      Now, let''s consider the specific counties:

      - Indian River County is in Florida

      - Tucker County is in West Virginia


      Since Florida is entirely south of West Virginia, any county in Florida (including
      Indian River County) would be south of any county in West Virginia (including

      into the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean

      - West Virginia is located in the Appalachian region of the eastern United States

      - Florida is entirely south of West Virginia on the map


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions of the counties.

      - Since Florida is completely south of West Virginia, any county in Florida
      (including Indian River County) must be south of any county in West Virginia
      (including Tucker County)


      YES, Indian River County, FL is located south of Tucker County, WV.'

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - McMullen County is in Texas (TX)

      - Hayes County is in Nebraska (NE)


      Step 2: General knowledge about the states'' positions.

      Nebraska is a northern state in the central part of the US, bordering South
      Dakota to the north.

      Texas is a southern state, bordering Mexico to the south.


      Step 3: In terms of latitude (north-south position):

      - Nebraska is much further north than Texas

      - Therefore, any county in Nebraska would be north of any county in Texas


      Step 4: Specific to these counties:

      While I don''t know the exact latitudes of these specific counties, the fact
      that one is in Nebraska and one is in Texas is sufficient to determine their
      relative north-south positions.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Texas and Nebraska.

      - Nebraska is located in the northern-central United States

      - Texas is located in the southern United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Nebraska is significantly north of Texas on the map

      - Any county in Nebraska would be north of any county in Texas


      Step 4: Determine the answer.

      - Since McMullen County is in Texas (south) and Hayes County is in Nebraska
      (north), McMullen County must be south of Hayes County


      YES, McMullen County, TX is located south of Hayes County, NE.'

      5) Texas is generally south of Nebraska in the United States. Texas borders
      Mexico to the south, while Nebraska is much further north, closer to the Canadian
      border.

      Step 1: Locate the states.

      - Arizona (AZ) is in the southwestern United States

      - Montana (MT) is in the northwestern United States

      - Generally speaking, Montana is north of Arizona


      Step 2: Consider the specific counties.

      - Gila County is in Arizona

      - Yellowstone County is in Montana


      Step 3: Since Montana is north of Arizona, and these counties are within their
      respective states, Gila County, AZ would be south of Yellowstone County, MT.


      Let me double check this reasoning. The United States is arranged with northern
      states like Montana being at higher latitudes than southern states like Arizona.
      There''s no geographical quirk that would make a county in Arizona be north
      of a county in Montana.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:

      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - Montana is in the northern part of the United States

      - Arizona is in the southwestern part of the United States

      - Montana is significantly north of Arizona on a map

      - Even if Gila County were in northern Arizona and Yellowstone County were in
      southern Montana, the entire state of Arizona is still south of Montana.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      - Since Gila County is in Arizona, and Yellowstone County is in Montana, Gila
      County must be south of Yellowstone County.

      Step 1: Identify the states these counties are in.

      - Gila County is in Arizona (AZ)

      - Yellowstone County is in Montana (MT)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      Arizona is in the southwestern United States, while Montana is in the northwestern

      Step 3: Think about north-south orientation.

      In the United States, states that are further north have higher latitudes, while
      states further south have lower latitudes. Montana borders Canada, which is
      the northern border of the contiguous United States. Arizona borders Mexico,
      which is the southern border.

      Montana is one of the northernmost states in the continental US, while Arizona
      is one of the southernmost states. Montana is several states north of Arizona.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific counties.

      Since Yellowstone County is in Montana and Gila County is in Arizona, Gila County

      - Conecuh County is in Alabama (AL)

      - Gogebic County is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States

      - Michigan is located in the northern United States, specifically in the Great
      Lakes region


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Alabama is a southern state, generally located between roughly 30-35 degrees
      north latitude

      - Michigan is a northern state, with even its southernmost points being farther
      north than Alabama, roughly between 41-48 degrees north latitude


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Alabama is entirely south of Michigan on a north-south axis, any county
      in Alabama (including Conecuh County) must be south of any county in Michigan
      (including Gogebic County).


      YES, Conecuh County, AL is located south of Gogebic County, MI.'

      Alabama is located south of Gogebic County, Michigan.


      Let me think about this geographically:


      1) Alabama (AL) is a state in the southeastern United States. It''s located
      in the deep south of the country.


      2) Michigan (MI) is a state in the northern United States, specifically in the
      Great Lakes region.


      3) Given the general geography of the United States, Alabama as a whole is located
      south of Michigan.


      4) Since Conecuh County is in Alabama, and Gogebic County is in Michigan, it''s
      very likely that Conecuh County is south of Gogebic County.


      To be even more specific:

      - Gogebic County is in the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan, which is the
      northernmost part of the state.

      - Conecuh County is in southern Alabama.


      So the answer is clearly YES - Conecuh County, AL is located south of Gogebic
      County, MI.</think>To determine if Conecuh County, AL is located south of Gogebic
      County, MI, I''ll think about the geographic positions of these counties and
      their states.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' locations.

      - Alabama (AL) is located in the southeastern United States.

      - Michigan (MI) is located in the northern United States, in the Great Lakes
      region.

      - Geographically, Alabama is significantly south of Michigan.


      Step 2: Consider the specific counties.

      - Conecuh County is in southern Alabama.

      - Gogebic County is in the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan, which is in
      the northern part of the state.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Since Alabama is entirely south of Michigan, and Conecuh County is in Alabama
      while Gogebic County is in Michigan, Conecuh County must be south of Gogebic
      County.
