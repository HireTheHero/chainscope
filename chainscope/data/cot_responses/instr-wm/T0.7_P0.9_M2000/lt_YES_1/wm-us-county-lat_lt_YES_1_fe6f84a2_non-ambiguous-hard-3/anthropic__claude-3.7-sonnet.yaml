      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both counties.

      - Leake County is in Mississippi (MS)

      - Brown County is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states within the US.

      - Mississippi is located in the southern United States

      - Wisconsin is located in the northern United States, specifically in the Upper
      Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Wisconsin is significantly north of Mississippi

      - Any county in Mississippi would be south of any county in Wisconsin


      Step 4: Make the specific county comparison.

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative locations of these
      two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these counties are located.

      - Colorado County is in Texas (TX)

      - Bon Homme County is in South Dakota (SD)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Texas and South Dakota.

      - Texas is located in the southern United States

      - South Dakota is located in the northern central United States

      - Texas is positioned significantly south of South Dakota on the map


      Step 3: Since Colorado County is in Texas, and Bon Homme County is in South
      Dakota, and Texas is south of South Dakota, it follows that Colorado County
      must be south of Bon Homme County.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      - Iberville Parish is located in the state of Louisiana, which is in the southern
      United States.

      - Whiteside County is located in the state of Illinois, which is in the northern
      part of the Midwest.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic position of these states.

      in the continental US.

      - Illinois is much further north, positioned in the upper Midwest region.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Louisiana is entirely south of Illinois on a map of the United States.

      - Any parish in Louisiana (including Iberville) would be south of any county

      - Edmunds County is in South Dakota (SD)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Texas and South Dakota.

      - Texas is located in the southern United States

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States, extending south into
      a peninsula

      - West Virginia is located in the Appalachian region of the eastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Florida is one of the southernmost states in the continental US

      - West Virginia is significantly further north than Florida

      - Montana is located along the US-Canada border in the northern part of the
      United States.

      - Arizona is located along the US-Mexico border in the southern part of the
      United States.


      In terms of latitude:

      - Montana is much further north in the United States compared to Arizona.

      - Therefore, counties in Arizona would generally be south of counties in Montana.


      Since Gila County is in Arizona and Yellowstone County is in Montana, Gila County
      would be located south of Yellowstone County.

      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Ohio is much further north in the United States compared to Florida

      - Florida extends significantly further south than Ohio


      Step 4: Specifically for these counties:

      - Highlands County is in central/southern Florida

      - Athens County is in southeastern Ohio


      Since Florida is south of Ohio, and Highlands County is in Florida while Athens
      County is in Ohio, Highlands County must be south of Athens County.


      YES, Highlands County, FL is located south of Athens County, OH.'
    736dad3f-e4f8-47dd-beef-ee2bf088b1a6: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Highlands County is in Florida (FL)

      - Athens County is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Florida is a southern state, located in the southeastern part of the United
      States

      - Ohio is a northern/midwestern state, located much further north than Florida


      Step 3: More specifically, let''s think about their relative positions.

      - Florida extends south from the southeastern United States into a peninsula

      - Ohio is positioned north of Florida, sharing a border with Canada''s Lake
      Erie


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      - Any county in Florida would be south of any county in Ohio

      - Therefore, Highlands County, FL must be south of Athens County, OH


      YES, Highlands County, FL is located south of Athens County, OH.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Highlands County is in Florida (FL)

      - Athens County is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Florida is in the southeastern United States

      - Ohio is in the midwestern/northeastern United States

      - Generally, Florida is south of Ohio on a map of the United States


      Step 3: Consider the specific counties.

      - Highlands County is in central/southern Florida

      - Athens County is in southeastern Ohio

      - Even the southernmost part of Ohio is still well north of any part of Florida


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since Florida is entirely south of Ohio, and Highlands County is in Florida
      while Athens County is in Ohio, Highlands County must be south of Athens County.


      YES, Highlands County, FL is located south of Athens County, OH.'
