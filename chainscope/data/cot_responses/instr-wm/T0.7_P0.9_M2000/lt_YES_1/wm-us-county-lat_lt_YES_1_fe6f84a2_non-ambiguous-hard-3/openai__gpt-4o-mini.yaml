      the geographical locations of both Leake County, MS, and Brown County, WI.


      1. **Locate Leake County, MS**: Leake County is situated in central Mississippi.
      It is located approximately in the central part of the state, south of the capital
      city Jackson.


      2. **Locate Brown County, WI**: Brown County is located in northeastern Wisconsin.
      It includes the city of Green Bay and is situated near the shores of Lake Michigan.


      3. **Determine their relative positions**: To find out if Leake County is south
      of Brown County, I need to compare their latitudes. Generally, Mississippi is
      situated further south than Wisconsin.


      Since Leake County, MS, is in a southern state and Brown County, WI, is in a
      northern state, it follows that Leake County is indeed located south of Brown
      County.
