      - Walworth County is in southeastern Wisconsin

      - It is located in the southeastern part of Wisconsin, near the Illinois border


      3. Now, I''ll compare their geographical positions:

      - Alabama is much further south than Wisconsin

      - Geneva County (in Alabama) is significantly south of Walworth County (in Wisconsin)


      4. Therefore, Geneva County, AL is indeed located south of Walworth County,
      WI.
