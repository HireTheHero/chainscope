      Leake County, Mississippi. Mississippi is in the southern United States, and
      Leake County is located in the central part of the state.


      Next, identify the location of Brown County, Wisconsin. Wisconsin is in the
      northern United States, and Brown County is located in the eastern part of the
      state, including the city of Green Bay.


      Comparing the relative latitudes of the two locations, Mississippi is generally
