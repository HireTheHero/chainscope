      (AR) is located south of Itasca County, Minnesota (MN), we need to consider
      the relative geographic locations of the two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Itasca County, MN.

      - Itasca County is in northern Minnesota.

      - Minnesota is a northern U.S. state that borders Canada.

      - Therefore, Itasca County is located fairly far north in the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Prairie County, AR.

      - Prairie County is in eastern Arkansas.

      - Arkansas is a southern U.S. state located south of Missouri and north of Louisiana.

      - Therefore, Prairie County is located much farther south compared to counties
      in Minnesota.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      - Itasca County, MN is at a higher latitude (i.e., farther north) than Prairie
      County, AR.


      Conclusion: Since Arkansas is south of Minnesota, and Prairie County is in Arkansas
      while Itasca County is in northern Minnesota, Prairie County is located south

      Step 1: Identify the location of Rolette County, ND.

      - Rolette County is in the northern part of North Dakota, which is a northern
      U.S. state bordering Canada.

      - Therefore, Rolette County is located very far north in the continental United
      States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Young County, TX.

      - Young County is in the northern-central portion of Texas.

      - Texas is located in the southern part of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      - Since North Dakota is much farther north than Texas, and Rolette County is
      in northern North Dakota, it is at a much higher latitude than Young County.

      - Therefore, Young County, TX is definitely south of Rolette County, ND.


      Final answer: YES.'
