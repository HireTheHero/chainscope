      1.  **Locate Quay County, NM:** Quay County is in eastern New Mexico. New Mexico
      is in the southwestern US.

      2.  **Locate Billings County, ND:** Billings County is in western North Dakota.
      North Dakota is in the upper midwestern US, bordering Canada.


      Without even looking at precise coordinates, it''s clear from a general understanding
      of US geography that North Dakota is significantly *north* of New Mexico.

      1.  **Locate Vermilion Parish, LA:** I know Louisiana is a southern state, and
      parishes are what counties are called there. A quick mental check or lookup
      would place Vermilion Parish in the southern part of Louisiana, on the coast
      of the Gulf of Mexico. This means its latitude will be relatively low (closer
      to the equator).


      2.  **Locate Marathon County, WI:** Wisconsin is a northern state. Marathon
      County is located in the central part of Wisconsin. This means its latitude
      will be relatively high (further from the equator).


      3.  **Compare Latitudes:** For something to be "south of" another, its latitude
      must be numerically smaller (closer to the equator). Since Louisiana is significantly
      south of Wisconsin, any point in Louisiana will have a lower latitude than any
      point in Wisconsin.


      4.  **Conclusion:** Vermilion Parish, LA, being in southern Louisiana, will
      have a much lower latitude than Marathon County, WI, which is in central Wisconsin.

      **Step 1: Locate Twiggs County, GA.**

      Twiggs County is in central Georgia. Georgia is a state in the southeastern
      United States.


      **Step 2: Locate Cheboygan County, MI.**

      Cheboygan County is in the northern part of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan.
      Michigan is a state in the northern United States, bordering Canada.

      Georgia is significantly further south than Michigan. The entire state of Georgia
      is south of the entire state of Michigan.


      **Step 4: Conclude based on relative positions.**

      Since Twiggs County is in Georgia and Cheboygan County is in Michigan, and Georgia
      is south of Michigan, Twiggs County must be south of Cheboygan County.
