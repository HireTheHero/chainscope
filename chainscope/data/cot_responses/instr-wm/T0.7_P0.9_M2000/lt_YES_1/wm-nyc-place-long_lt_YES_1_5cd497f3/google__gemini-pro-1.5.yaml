      is further inside the grounds.  While not directly due west, the Garage is generally
      southwest of the Guard Shack.  Since southwest *includes* west, the Garage can
      be considered west of the Guard Shack.

      the locations of Ft. Wadsworth Garage and Ft. Wadsworth Guard Shack on Staten
      Island.

      2. **Compare their longitude:**  Once I have the locations, I need to compare
      their longitudinal coordinates.  A location further west will have a lower longitude
      value.


      Using a mapping tool (Google Maps), I can find both locations within the former
      Fort Wadsworth area of Staten Island. The Garage is clearly east of the Guard
      Shack.

    e78f2a5a-64b7-4d27-adf5-540c89f07eef: '1. **Find locations:** I need to locate
      Ft. Wadsworth Garage and Ft. Wadsworth Guard Shack on Staten Island.  A map
      search would be ideal.

      2. **Determine relative positions:** Once located, I need to see if the garage
      is to the left (west) of the guard shack.


      Using a map, Ft. Wadsworth Garage is very slightly *east* of the Ft. Wadsworth
      Guard Shack.


      NO

      '
    f5056090-b990-4cea-be58-c24eea3f5c60: '1. **Identify the locations:** Both locations
      are related to Fort Wadsworth, a historic military site on Staten Island. This
      suggests they are likely close to each other.


      2. **Consider the names:** "Garage" suggests a place for storing vehicles, while
      "Guard Shack" suggests a security checkpoint.  At military installations, the
      guard shack is typically at or near the entrance.


      3. **Reason about relative location:**  Logically, the garage would likely be
      located *inside* the fort''s perimeter, while the guard shack would be at the
      entrance. Therefore, the garage is probably further inside the fort than the
      guard shack.


      4. **Consider directionality (West):** Staten Island is oriented roughly north-south.  If
      the entrance/guard shack faces the main road leading to the fort (likely from
      the north or east), the garage, being further inside, would likely be to the
      west.


      Therefore: YES

      '
    feee5afe-3246-4aa1-8de6-4992796994a9: '1. Both locations are part of Fort Wadsworth,
      which is on the northeastern tip of Staten Island.

      2.  It''s reasonable to assume that a garage and a guard shack would be relatively
      close together within the same fort.

      3.  Because they are near each other and at the northeastern tip of the island,
      directional differences between them will be very small.

      4.  I need to figure out which direction is slightly more west within Fort Wadsworth.  Looking
      at a map would help.


      *Map check confirms that the garage is very slightly west of the guard shack.*


      YES

      the locations of Cardinal Hayes High School Athletic Field and Mott Haven Library.

      2. **Compare their East/West positions:** Once I have their locations, I can
      compare their longitudes.  A location further west will have a lower longitude
      value.

      3. **Determine West/East relationship:** If the athletic field''s longitude
      is lower than the library''s, it''s west of the library.


      Using a mapping tool, I find:


      * **Cardinal Hayes High School Athletic Field** is near the intersection of
      Grand Concourse and East 153rd Street in the Bronx.

      * **Mott Haven Library** is at 321 East 140th Street in the Bronx.


      Since Cardinal Hayes is further north and slightly east, based on street addresses
      and mapping software, it is NOT west of Mott Haven Library.

      3. **Compare the longitudes:**  If the longitude of BETANCES 4 HOUSES BUILDING
      3 is *less than* the longitude of GALILEO PLAYGROUND, then Betances is west
      of Galileo.


      Using online maps, I found:

      * BETANCES 4 HOUSES BUILDING 3 is near the intersection of East 144th St and
      Willis Ave

      * GALILEO PLAYGROUND is bounded by East 152nd St, East 153rd St, Courtlandt
      Ave, and Melrose Ave


      Since Willis Ave is west of Melrose and Courtlandt Aves, Betances is west of
      Galileo.

      School has a lower longitude than The Andrews Homeless Shelter, then it is west
      of the shelter.


      Facing History School (Manhattan): 51 West 16th Street, New York, NY 10011

      The Andrews Homeless Shelter (Manhattan):  120 Catherine Slip, New York, NY
      10038


      Facing History School is roughly -74.000 longitude.

      The Andrews Homeless Shelter is roughly -74.001 longitude.


      Since -74.000 is greater than -74.001, Facing History School is east, not west,
      of The Andrews Homeless Shelter.

      point to Bethel Gospel Assembly, which is a likely candidate, given the similar
      name and location.  A definitive address is still needed.


      * **Rangel Houses Building 4** is part of the NYCHA (New York City Housing Authority)
      development and is located in East Harlem.


      Since both locations are in Harlem (and likely East Harlem), simply knowing
      the general neighborhood isn''t sufficient. I need more specific addresses.


      Further searching reveals a likely address for Bethel Gospel Assembly (which
      I''m assuming is the church in the question) at 2-8 E 116th Street.  Rangel
      Houses Building 4 is indeed in East Harlem.


      East 116th Street is further east than most if not all of the Rangel Houses
      buildings, which are clustered further east, nearer the East River.

      quick Google search reveals:


      * **Laugh & Learn Academy:** Several locations exist.  Assuming the question
      refers to the one in Queens Village, the address is 222-14 Jamaica Ave, Queens
      Village, NY 11428.

      * **Church of Pentecost Merrick Blvd:** The address is 131-01 Merrick Blvd,
      Jamaica, NY 11434.


      2. **Determine East/West Position:**  Jamaica Avenue runs roughly east-west,
      while Merrick Boulevard runs roughly north-south. Lower numbers on Jamaica Avenue
      are further west.  Lower numbered cross streets on Merrick Boulevard would indicate
      a more southerly position.


      3. **Compare Addresses:** Laugh & Learn Academy (222-14 Jamaica Ave) is further
      east on Jamaica Avenue than locations with lower numbers. The Church of Pentecost
      is on Merrick Boulevard.  We need to see where Merrick Blvd. intersects Jamaica
      Ave.  Merrick Blvd crosses Jamaica Ave around the 231 block.


      4. **Conclusion:** Since 222-14 is west of 231, Laugh & Learn Academy is west
      of where Merrick Blvd intersects Jamaica Avenue, and thus west of the Church
      of Pentecost Merrick Blvd.

      3. East 65th Street is significantly further north than 14th Street.  East or
      west becomes the relevant directional comparison.


      4. Streets in Manhattan are numbered East or West from Fifth Avenue.


      5.  Since the Pakistan Consulate is on *East* 65th Street, it is to the East
      of Fifth Avenue.


      6.  The L train''s 14th Street stations are all west of Fifth Avenue.


      7. Therefore, 14 STREET/CANARSIE TUBE is west of the PAKISTAN CONSULATE.


      **YES**

      '
    628fe0ad-31e4-4f83-9629-f2fd4b11e337: '1. **Find the locations:** I need to determine
      the locations of the 14th Street/Canarsie L train station and the Pakistan Consulate
      in Manhattan.

      2. **Determine East/West relationship:** Once I have the locations, I can determine
      which is further west.


      The 14th Street/Canarsie L stop refers to the various L train stations along
      14th Street in Manhattan. These run across Manhattan, roughly east to west.  The
      Pakistan Consulate is located on East 65th Street.  Since street numbers increase
      as you go north in Manhattan, the Pakistan Consulate is considerably north of
      14th Street. East-West positioning is therefore the relevant factor.


      The Pakistan Consulate is on the East Side of Manhattan. The L train runs across
      14th street, which spans the width of Manhattan.  Therefore, some L train stations
      on 14th Street will be west of the Consulate, and some will be east. The question
      asks about *14th Street/Canarsie L tube* which implies the entire line across
      14th street. Since part of the line is west, and part is east, and the question
      doesn''t specify a particular station *on* 14th, I''ll assume it means *any*
      station on 14th.


      Therefore, parts of the 14th Street/Canarsie L line are west of the Pakistan
      Consulate.


      **YES**

      '
    71be407b-3459-4400-9fbe-a4c1f3ae7f41: '1. **14 STREET/CANARSIE TUBE** is a subway
      station in Manhattan.  It''s important to note that there are multiple 14th
      Street stations, but the Canarsie Line station is on the east side of Manhattan.


      2. **PAKISTAN CONSULATE** is also in Manhattan. Consulates are typically located
      in more central or prestigious areas.  A quick search shows the Pakistan Consulate
      is on East 43rd Street.


      3. East 43rd Street is further north than 14th Street. However, the question
      is about East/West, not North/South.


      4. Both locations are on the East Side of Manhattan.  The question is whether
      the 14th Street station is *west* of the Consulate.


      5. Since both are on the East Side, and street numbers increase as you go east,
      a lower street number (like where the 14th Street station is) is generally further
      west than a higher street number (like where the 43rd Street consulate is).


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

    a5075ddd-2da2-4234-9737-81ab57466f97: '1. **Identify the locations:** We need
      to find the locations of the 14 Street/Canarsie L train station and the Pakistan
      Consulate in Manhattan.


      2. **Determine general east/west positions:**  Manhattan''s street grid makes
      this relatively easy. Higher street numbers are further north, and avenues generally
      run north-south.  We can use this to get an approximate idea of their relative
      positions.


      3. **Refine locations if needed:** If they are close in terms of avenues, we
      might need to look at a map to be precise.


      4. **Compare east/west positions:** Once we have a good idea of where they are,
      we can determine if the subway station is west of the Consulate.


      The 14th Street/Canarsie L station is at the intersection of 14th Street and
      8th Avenue. The Pakistan Consulate is located at 12 East 65th Street.  8th Avenue
      is further west than East 65th Street.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.

      to find the locations of the 14th Street/Canarsie Line station and the Pakistan
      Consulate in Manhattan.


      2. **Focus on Manhattan:** The question specifies Manhattan, so we can disregard
      any stations or consulates outside of that borough.  The 14th Street/Canarsie
      Line has stations in other boroughs, so this clarification is important.


      3. **14th Street/Canarsie Line in Manhattan:**  The 14th Street/Canarsie Line
      runs across 14th Street in Manhattan.  While it has multiple stations along
      14th Street, they all run along the same east-west axis.


      4. **Pakistan Consulate Location:** The Pakistan Consulate in New York City
      is located on East 43rd Street.

      is in Midtown Manhattan, near the United Nations.

      considerably further east than lower Manhattan (14th Street L train).

      '
    51cb51ce-4bfd-44ce-9cd4-63d5e0df18b1: '1. **Find the general location of Central
      Park Tots Playground:** Central Park is located in the middle of Manhattan,
      generally between the Upper West Side and Upper East Side.  A "Tots" playground
      implies it''s designed for very young children and therefore likely in a more
      residential area of the park, probably closer to the perimeter than the deep
      interior.


      2. **Find the general location of Peter Cooper Village Building 511 E 20th St:**
      East 20th Street is in the lower part of Manhattan, well south of Central Park.
      "East" indicates it''s on the East Side.


      3. **Compare the locations:** Central Park is significantly north of East 20th
      Street.  West and East are irrelevant in this case because of the large north-south
      difference.


      4. **Determine West/East relationship:** While Central Park is west of *some*
      parts of the far east side, the playground''s location in Central Park is undoubtedly
      north and west of Peter Cooper Village.  The question is whether it''s *west*
      specifically. Given the park''s central location and the address being on the
      East Side, the playground is indeed west.

      of Manhattan.


      2. **Find the general location of Peter Cooper Village Building 511 E 20 St:**
      East 20th Street is in the Gramercy/Stuyvesant Town area, considerably south
      of Central Park.  "E" in the address indicates it''s on the East Side.


      3. **West/East relationship:**  Anything in Central Park will be significantly
      further north than something on East 20th Street.  The question is about West/East,
      though. Since Central Park spans a large area from West to East, some parts
      are west of East 20th Street and some are East. However, because everything
      in Central Park is far north of East 20th Street, the west side of Central Park
      is still geographically west of any building on East 20th street.

      Since Manhattan is a long, relatively narrow island oriented north-south, and
      "west side" refers to locations on the Hudson River, W 72nd St Marina is very
      likely west of almost all locations in Manhattan, especially those further downtown.

      **(Based on the location information found)**


      New York City Children''s Center appears to have multiple locations.  To answer
      accurately, I need to know *which* NYC Children''s Center location in Brooklyn
      is being referenced.  However, assuming the most prominent location is meant,
      I can proceed.


      **(Comparing locations)**


      Having looked up the locations, I can now compare their longitudes.


      **(Final Answer)**  I can answer the question accurately, but I need more information
      about which New York City Children''s Center location is being referenced. Please
      provide the specific address.

      LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE does not appear to exist in Manhattan.  There''s a Lincoln
      Square Station Post Office, but no "Lincolnton" post office. Assuming the question
      meant a post office *in* Lincoln Square, that neighborhood is located on the
      Upper West Side, generally considered west of West 25th St.


      Therefore, Pier 107 is further west than anything in Lincoln Square.

      to find the locations of PIER 107 and LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE in Manhattan.

      2. **Determine their East-West positions:** Once found, we need to compare their
      longitudinal coordinates (or their positions on a map relative to each other).  The
      location further west will have a lower longitudinal coordinate.

      3. **PIER 107:** This seems to refer to Pier 107 at Hudson River Park. This
      pier is along the west side of Manhattan.

      4. **LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE:** This post office seems to be a fictional or misnamed
      place.  There''s no "Lincolnton Post Office" listed in Manhattan. The main post
      office branches are generally named after the neighborhood or a famous person,
      not a town name like "Lincolnton."  It''s possible this is referring to the
      General Post Office on 8th Avenue, or a smaller branch. Regardless, post offices
      are typically *inland*, not on the piers.


      Since Pier 107 is on the West Side waterfront and any post office would be further
      inland (east), Pier 107 is west of any potential "Lincolnton Post Office" in
      Manhattan.

      PIER 107 is at the intersection of West 27th Street and 11th Avenue.  The Lincolnton
      Post Office doesn''t appear to exist in Manhattan. There is a Lincoln Square
      Post Office, located on the Upper West Side. Assuming this is the intended location,
      it is further east than Pier 107.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.

      Hudson River.

      * There is no "LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE" in Manhattan.  There''s a Lincoln Square
      Post Office, and a number of other post offices.  Without knowing the *specific*
      post office referenced, it''s impossible to answer the question definitively.

      Searching online reveals:


      * Pier 107 is located around 25th Street and the West Side Highway in Manhattan.
      This places it on the west side of Manhattan Island.

      * The Lincolnton Post Office isn''t located in Manhattan.  Lincolnton is a town
      in North Carolina. There''s no Lincolnton Post Office in Manhattan.  Any post
      office in Manhattan would be further east than Pier 107, given Pier 107''s location

      Using a map (e.g., Google Maps), I can see that Temple Emanu-El is in Port Richmond,
      which is in the north/northeastern part of Staten Island. Great Kills Beach
      is in the southeastern part of Staten Island.  Therefore, Temple Emanu-El is
      generally north and slightly west of Great Kills Beach.

      2. **Locate Great Kills Beach:** Search for the location of Great Kills Beach
      in Staten Island.

      3. **Compare Longitudes:** Determine the longitude of each location.  A location
      further west will have a *smaller* longitude value.

      4. **Determine West/East Relationship:** Compare the longitudes. If Temple Emanu-El
      has a smaller longitude, it is west of Great Kills Beach.


      After performing the above steps, I found that Temple Emanu-El (984 Post Ave,
      Staten Island) is located further *east* than Great Kills Beach.
