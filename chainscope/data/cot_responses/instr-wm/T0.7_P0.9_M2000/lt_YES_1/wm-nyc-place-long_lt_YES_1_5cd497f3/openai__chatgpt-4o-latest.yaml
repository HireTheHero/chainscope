      PIER 107 CVII, Manhattan\" refers to a pier, which typically suggests a location\
      \ on the waterfront.\n   - \"LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE, Manhattan\" is a post office,\
      \ likely situated inland.\n\n2. **Interpreting the Pier Numbering System:**\n\
      \   - Pier numbers in Manhattan generally increase from south to north.\n  \
      \ - They are located along the waterfront, primarily on the west side (Hudson\
      \ River) or east side (East River).\n\n3. **Locating PIER 107 CVII:**\n   -\
      \ The number 107 suggests it is in the upper range of Manhattan piers.\n   -\
      \ \"CVII\" is the Roman numeral for 107, confirming this.\n\n4. **Locating LINCOLNTON\
      \ POST OFFICE:**\n   - \"Lincolnton\" does not correspond to a well-known neighborhood\
      \ in Manhattan.\n   - There is no widely recognized \"Lincolnton Post Office\"\
      \ in Manhattan.\n\n5. **General Pier Locations:**\n   - If Pier 107 exists,\
      \ it would likely be on the waterfront.\n   - Piers on the Hudson River (west\
      \ side) or East River (east side) would define relative positioning.\n\n6. **Comparing\
      \ Locations:**\n   - If Pier 107 is on the west side of Manhattan, it would\
      \ be west of most inland locations, including a post office.\n   - If Pier 107\
      \ is on the east side, it would be east of most inland locations.\n\n**Final\
      \ Answer:**\n- Since piers are generally on the waterfront and post offices\
      \ are typically inland, **PIER 107 CVII is likely west of LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE**\
      \ (assuming the post office is inland). \n\n**YES.**"
    fa07dcdb-2a52-4cb6-9039-4158c2037755: "1. **Understanding the locations:**\n \
      \  - \"PIER 107 CVII, Manhattan\" suggests a pier, which typically means it's\
      \ on the waterfront.\n   - Piers in Manhattan are usually on the Hudson River\
      \ (west side) or the East River (east side).\n   - \"107\" could indicate a\
      \ numbering system, but it's unclear whether it's on the west or east side.\n\
      \   - \"CVII\" is Roman numeral 107, reinforcing the idea of Pier 107.\n   -\
      \ \"Lincolnton Post Office, Manhattan\" is not a well-known landmark, so I need\
      \ to infer its location.\n\n2. **Determining the general layout of piers in\
      \ Manhattan:**\n   - Manhattan\u2019s piers on the Hudson River (west side)\
      \ are numbered from south to north.\n   - Piers on the East River (east side)\
      \ also have numbering but follow a different convention.\n   - Pier 107 is likely\
      \ on the East River, near East Harlem.\n\n3. **Finding Lincolnton Post Office:**\n\
      \   - There is no widely known \"Lincolnton Post Office\" in Manhattan.\n  \
      \ - However, if it refers to something related to Lincoln, it might be connected\
      \ to Lincoln Square (Upper West Side) or Lincoln Tunnel (West Side).\n   - Without\
      \ a clear reference, I assume it is westward compared to an East River pier.\n\
      \n4. **Final conclusion:**\n   - If Pier 107 is on the East River, it is on\
      \ the east side of Manhattan.\n   - If Lincolnton Post Office is on the west\
      \ side of Manhattan, it is west of Pier 107.\n\nThus, the answer is **NO**\u2014\
      Pier 107 is not west of Lincolnton Post Office."
    fc183f14-4ee4-43c5-b506-af3470d271bb: "1. **Understanding the locations:**\n \
      \  - \"PIER 107 CVII, Manhattan\" appears to describe a pier. Piers in Manhattan\
      \ are typically located along the western or eastern edges of the borough, along\
      \ the Hudson River (west) or the East River (east).\n   - \"LINCOLNTON POST\
      \ OFFICE, Manhattan\" is not a widely known post office, but assuming it follows\
      \ typical naming patterns, it could be an internal or historical name for a\
      \ location in Manhattan.\n\n2. **Interpreting the Pier Numbering System:**\n\
      \   - Pier numbering in Manhattan generally increases as you move northward.\n\
      \   - Piers on the west side of Manhattan (Hudson River) are generally numbered\
      \ separately from those on the east side (East River).\n\n3. **Determining Relative\
      \ Locations:**\n   - If \"PIER 107 CVII\" follows the standard pier numbering,\
      \ it is likely located along the East River or Hudson River.\n   - If \"LINCOLNTON\
      \ POST OFFICE\" is an inland post office, it would be located east of any piers\
      \ on the Hudson River.\n\n4. **Final Conclusion:**\n   - If \"PIER 107 CVII\"\
      \ is on the Hudson River (west side of Manhattan), then it is west of almost\
      \ any inland post office.\n   - If \"PIER 107 CVII\" is on the East River (east\
      \ side of Manhattan), it is likely not west of an inland post office.\n\nGiven\
      \ these considerations, without precise confirmation of the exact locations,\
      \ the general pattern suggests that **if Pier 107 is on the Hudson River, it\
      \ is west of most locations in Manhattan, including Lincolnton Post Office.**\
      \ \n\nThus, the answer is:  \n\n**YES.**"
