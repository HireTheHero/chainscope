      2. Then, I''ll locate QUEENSBRIDGE NORTH HOUSES BUILDING 13 in Queens

      3. Then I''ll determine their relative positions


      Step 1: PS 38 ROBERTO CLEMENTE is located in Manhattan''s Lower East Side, specifically

      - To do this, I''ll need to know their precise addresses and relative positions


      4. Check the specific addresses:

      - 14 Street/Canarsie Tube is at 14th Street and 8th Avenue

      - Pakistan Consulate is at 12 E 65th Street


      5. Analyze their relative positions:

      - 14th Street is in the West Village/Chelsea area

      - 65th Street is in the Upper East Side

      - 8th Avenue is west of 65th Street


      6. Conclusion of reasoning:

      - 14 Street/Canarsie Tube is WEST of Pakistan Consulate


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      - Since the Pakistan Consulate is in the Upper East Side (east), and the 14
      Street/Canarsie Tube is in Lower Manhattan (which is west of the Upper East
      Side), the 14 Street/Canarsie Tube is west of the Pakistan Consulate
