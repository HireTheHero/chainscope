      6 is located west of Smith Houses Building 7 in Manhattan, we should first understand
      the layout of the Smith Houses, which is a public housing development in Lower
      Manhattan.


      1. **Locate Smith Houses**: The Alfred E. Smith Houses are situated in the Lower
      East Side of Manhattan, bounded by St. James Place, Madison Street, Catherine
      Street, and South Street.


      2. **Determine the arrangement of buildings**: The Smith Houses consist of several
      residential buildings. The numbering of these buildings generally follows a
      specific pattern or layout, which would typically be aligned with the street
      grid.


      3. **Identify the specific locations of Building 6 and Building 7**: Understanding
      the precise locations of Building 6 and Building 7 within the Smith Houses is
      crucial. Typically, in a grid-like arrangement, lower-numbered buildings might
      be on one side compared to higher-numbered ones, but this isn''t a strict rule
      and must be verified specifically for the Smith Houses.


      After reviewing the layout:


      - Smith Houses Building 6 is located to the east of Smith Houses Building 7.


      Based on this information, the answer to the question is:


      NO.'

      6 is located west of Smith Houses Building 7 in Manhattan, we need to consider
      the layout of the Smith Houses, a public housing development in Manhattan.


      1. **Understanding the Layout**: The Smith Houses are a group of residential
      buildings located near the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The buildings are usually
      arranged in a grid-like pattern, which is common for public housing developments
      in New York City.


      2. **Identifying the Buildings**: Locate Smith Houses Building 6 and Building
      7 on a map. This can typically be done using an online map service or the official
      New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) resources which often have maps of their
      developments.


      3. **Determining Relative Position**: Once the locations of Building 6 and Building
      7 are identified, compare their positions. The cardinal direction "west" means
      that Building 6 would be to the left of Building 7 when looking north on a standard
      map.


      After following these steps, you can determine the relative positions of the
      buildings.


      The answer is **NO**; Smith Houses Building 6 is not located west of Smith Houses
      Building 7.'

      2. **Galileo Playground:** This playground is located in the Bronx, near the

      for "west" would be the cross streets. East 143rd Street is south of East 146th
      Street, but since they are on the same avenue (Willis Avenue), the concept of
      "west" in terms of street layout generally refers to movement along the east-west
      streets, not north-south avenues.


      In a typical NYC grid system, if two locations are on the same avenue, the one

      Thus, based on typical geographical orientation:

      be considered south of Galileo Playground (near East 146th Street and Willis
      Avenue), not west.

      1. **Location of Queensbridge Park Comfort Station**: Queensbridge Park is located
      in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens. It is situated along the East
      River, just east of Roosevelt Island.


      2. **Location of Carver Houses Building 8**: Carver Houses is a public housing

      on the eastern side of Manhattan as it is labeled with an "East" street designation.
      The East River is on the east side of Manhattan, and East 21st Street runs perpendicular
      to FDR Drive, which means Pier 69 is also on the east side of Manhattan.

      1. **Skyport Marina Location**: Skyport Marina is located at 2430 FDR Drive,
      Manhattan. FDR Drive runs along the eastern edge of Manhattan, adjacent to the
      East River.


      2. **Pier 69-E 21 St Location**: Piers with names like "Pier 69" are generally
      located along the Hudson River, which is on the western side of Manhattan. However,
      it''s important to note that "E 21 St" suggests this location is on the east

      in Brooklyn, Central Park is indeed situated to the west of Williamsburg.


      Based on these geographical considerations, the Central Park Precinct in Manhattan
      is located west of Independence Towers Building 2 in Brooklyn.

    f9746a31-986a-4b16-a9b6-62c97100c080: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Locate Central Park Precinct, Manhattan**: The Central Park Precinct is
      located within Central Park, which is situated in the borough of Manhattan.
      Central Park itself is generally bordered by Central Park West to the west,
      Fifth Avenue to the east, Central Park South (59th Street) to the south, and
      110th Street to the north.


      2. **Locate Independence Towers Bldg 2, Brooklyn**: Independence Towers is a
      housing complex located in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. Williamsburg
      is situated on the eastern shore of the East River.


      3. **Determine the relative position**: Manhattan is located to the west of
      Brooklyn. Therefore, any location within Manhattan, including the Central Park
      Precinct, would be west of any location in Brooklyn, such as Independence Towers
      Bldg 2.

      YES.'

      Church in Brooklyn is located west of W 205 St over the NYCT Subway Yards in
      the Bronx, we can follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the Location of Bethlehem Baptist Church, Brooklyn**: Bethlehem
      Baptist Church is located in Brooklyn, New York. Brooklyn is one of the five
      boroughs of New York City, situated to the southwest of the Bronx.


      2. **Identify the Location of W 205 St over NYCT Subway Yards, Bronx**: This
      location is in the Bronx, another borough of New York City, situated to the
      north of Brooklyn.


      3. **Determine the Relative Geographical Positions**: In general geographical
      terms, Brooklyn is located south of the Bronx. For a location in Brooklyn to
      be west of a location in the Bronx, it would have to be significantly more westward
      in longitude.


      4. **Consider the General Layout of NYC Boroughs**: The Bronx is primarily located
      to the north and slightly east of Brooklyn. Most of Brooklyn is south and slightly
      to the west of the Bronx, but specific locations need to be compared in terms
      of longitude.


      Conclusion: Since Brooklyn is generally south of the Bronx and not significantly
      west of it, Bethlehem Baptist Church in Brooklyn is likely not west of W 205
      St in the Bronx.


      Final Answer: NO, Bethlehem Baptist Church, Brooklyn is not located west of
