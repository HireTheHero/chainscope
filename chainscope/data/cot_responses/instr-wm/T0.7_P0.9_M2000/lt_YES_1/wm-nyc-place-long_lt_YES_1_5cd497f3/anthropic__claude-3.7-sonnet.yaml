      To determine the relative positions of Smith Houses Building 6 and Building
      7 in Manhattan, I need to consider how public housing developments are typically
      numbered.


      In large public housing developments like Smith Houses (which is part of NYCHA
      - New York City Housing Authority), buildings are typically numbered sequentially
      in the order they were built or in a logical spatial arrangement.


      While I don''t have the exact map coordinates for these specific buildings,
      in housing developments, adjacent buildings often have consecutive numbers.
      However, the numbering doesn''t necessarily follow a strict east-to-west or
      north-to-south pattern.


      Without specific geographic data on the exact locations of Smith Houses Buildings
      6 and 7, I cannot definitively determine their relative east-west positioning.


      NO


      (Note: If you need the actual geographic positions of these buildings, you would
      need to consult a detailed map of the Smith Houses development in Manhattan
      or NYCHA property information.)'

      Step 1: Smith Houses is a public housing development in the Lower East Side

      be in the Brighton Beach neighborhood.

      - Pratt Playground could be named after Pratt Institute, which is located in
      Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, or it could be elsewhere in Brooklyn.


      Step 3: Compare east-west positioning.

      - Brighton Beach is in the eastern part of southern Brooklyn.

      - Clinton Hill (if that''s where Pratt Playground is) would be in the north-central
      part of Brooklyn.

      - In general, Clinton Hill is west of Brighton Beach.

      be multiple playgrounds with similar names), I cannot give a definitive answer.
      If Pratt Playground is indeed in Clinton Hill or another western/central part
      of Brooklyn, then it would be west of a synagogue in Brighton Beach.

      Step 6: Given Fort Wadsworth''s orientation on the eastern shore of Staten Island,
      the guard shack would likely be positioned toward the eastern side (facing the
      Narrows), with support facilities like garages positioned behind it (to the
      west).


      Based on this reasoning about typical military fort layouts and Fort Wadsworth''s
      geographical orientation, the garage would likely be west of the guard shack.


      NO


      Wait, I need to reconsider. If the guard shack is at the entrance and the fort
      faces east toward the Narrows, then facilities inside the fort (like the garage)
      would be to the west of the entrance guard shack.

      - STRAUS HOUSES COMMUNITY CENTER is located in the Lower East Side of Manhattan

      Step 2: Consider Manhattan''s geography. In Manhattan, locations are typically
      described as:

      - East Side (eastern part of Manhattan)

      - West Side (western part of Manhattan)


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions:

      - Straus Houses Community Center is on the East Side of Manhattan (Lower East
      Side)

      - FDNY Rescue Collapse 1 is also on the East Side of Manhattan (East Harlem)

      - Both are on the East Side, but their east-west positioning relative to each
      other needs to be determined


      Step 4: More specifically, Straus Houses is close to the East River in the Lower
      East Side, while FDNY Rescue Collapse 1 would also be on the eastern portion
      of Manhattan in East Harlem.


      Since both are on the eastern side of Manhattan, and considering their specific

      they are both on the east side, with Straus Houses being further south.

      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      Straus Houses is on the east side of Manhattan, while FDNY Rescue 1 is on the
      west side of Manhattan. In Manhattan, locations on the west side are west of
      locations on the east side.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these positions.

      Upaca Senior Center is located in East Harlem (also known as Spanish Harlem
      or El Barrio) in Upper Manhattan. It''s in the eastern part of Manhattan.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      In Manhattan, locations in East Harlem are generally east of locations in Washington
      Heights/Hamilton Heights. St. Nicholas Avenue runs along the western portion
      of northern Manhattan, while East Harlem is on the eastern side of Manhattan.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      NO, Bushman Steps is not west of UPACA Senior Center. Bushman Steps is east

      - Briarwood is in central Queens, but more importantly, it is southeast of Whitestone


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      When looking at a map of Queens, Whitestone is actually located to the north
      and east of Briarwood. Therefore, Whitestone is not west of Briarwood - it''s
      actually to the east.

      Step 3: Analyzing their relative positions.

      St. Mary''s Park Houses is typically located east of Concord Avenue. The CSX
      rail overpass on Concord Avenue would be located along Concord Avenue itself.


      Since St. Mary''s Park Houses is east of Concord Avenue, and the overpass is
      on Concord Avenue, the housing complex (including Building 2) would be east
      of the overpass, not west.

      Step 2: Recall the general geography of NYC boroughs.

      Manhattan is west of Brooklyn when considering the overall layout of NYC. Manhattan
      is on the west side of the East River, while Brooklyn is on the east side.


      Step 3: Consider if there might be any exceptions.

      While there could be edge cases where parts of boroughs don''t follow the general
      pattern, the main campuses of institutions typically follow the standard borough
      layout. FIT (Fashion Institute of Technology) has its main campus in Manhattan''s
      Chelsea neighborhood, which is firmly on the west side of the East River.


      Step 4: Make a determination based on borough locations.

      Since FIT''s Business & Liberal Arts Center is in Manhattan, and JHS 227 is
      in Brooklyn, and Manhattan is west of Brooklyn, the FIT location would be west
      of the Brooklyn school.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Belasco Theatre is in Manhattan, specifically in the Theater District/Midtown
      area.

      - Wyckoff Gardens Houses is in Brooklyn, specifically in the Boerum Hill neighborhood.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of NYC boroughs.

      - Manhattan is west of Brooklyn, as the East River separates these two boroughs.

      - Manhattan is on the west side of the East River, while Brooklyn is on the
      east side.


      Step 3: Apply this general geography to the specific locations.

      - Since Belasco Theatre is in Manhattan, and Manhattan is west of Brooklyn,

      - And Wyckoff Gardens Houses is in Brooklyn, which is east of Manhattan,

      - Therefore, Belasco Theatre must be west of Wyckoff Gardens Houses.


      YES, Belasco Theatre in Manhattan is located west of Wyckoff Gardens Houses
      in Brooklyn.'

      - PS 16 JOHN J DRISCOLL is a public school in Staten Island.

      - CASTLE DAY CARE CANAL ST is a daycare center in Staten Island.


      Step 2: Consider Staten Island''s geography.

      Staten Island generally runs from northeast to southwest, with the eastern shore
      facing the New York Harbor and the western shore facing New Jersey.


      Step 3: Determine specific locations.

      - PS 16 JOHN J DRISCOLL is located in Tompkinsville, on the northeastern part
      of Staten Island.

      - CASTLE DAY CARE CANAL ST, based on the name, would be on Canal Street. In

      - "Canal St" suggests this daycare is likely located near Canal Street, which
      in Staten Island would be in the northeastern section, possibly in Stapleton
      or Tompkinsville areas.


      Without the exact addresses and coordinates, I cannot make a definitive determination

      - Midtown Manhattan is in the central part of Manhattan, generally north of
      the East Village.


      Step 3: Compare east-west positions.

      - In Manhattan, "west" generally refers to locations closer to the Hudson River,
      while "east" refers to locations closer to the East River.

      - Tompkins Square Park is in the East Village, very close to the East River.

      - Midtown Manhattan extends from the East River to the Hudson River, but a facility
      called "Mid Manhattan" is likely in the central part of Midtown.


      Step 4: Make a determination.

      - Given that Tompkins Square Park is far east in Manhattan (near the East River),
      and a "Mid Manhattan" location would be more centrally located, the Alternate

      Manhattan is an island borough that lies west of Brooklyn. Brooklyn is located
      on the western end of Long Island, east of Manhattan.


      Step 2: Since LA QUINTA INN & SUITES is in Manhattan, and BUTTERFLY GARDENS
      is in Brooklyn, we can determine their relative east-west positioning based
      on their boroughs.


      Step 3: Given that Manhattan is west of Brooklyn, any location in Manhattan
      (including LA QUINTA INN & SUITES) would be west of any location in Brooklyn
      (including BUTTERFLY GARDENS).


      Therefore, LA QUINTA INN & SUITES in Manhattan is located west of BUTTERFLY
      GARDENS in Brooklyn.


      NO


      Wait, I made an error in my answer. The question asks if LA QUINTA INN & SUITES
      is west of BUTTERFLY GARDENS, and my reasoning correctly established that it
      is. So the answer should be:


      YES'

      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of both schools in Queens.

      - Cambria Heights Academy High School is located in the Cambria Heights neighborhood
      of Queens, which is in the southeastern part of Queens.

      - PS 41 Crocheron (also known as Crocheron Elementary School) is located in
      Bayside, Queens, which is in the northeastern part of Queens.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - In New York City, west-east orientation generally follows the standard compass
      direction (west is to the left on a map, east is to the right).

      - Bayside (where PS 41 is) is located in northeastern Queens.

      - Cambria Heights (where Cambria Heights Academy is) is located in southeastern
      Queens.

      - When comparing these two neighborhoods, Bayside is further north, but also
      further west than Cambria Heights.


      Step 3: Make the final determination.

      - TRNVS = Transverse

      - 1WB = 1 Westbound

      - OV PD PTH = Over Pedestrian Path

      1WB OV PD PTH OPP 66, Manhattan" and "ANSCHE CHESED SYNAGOGUE, Manhattan" to
      compare their east-west positions.


      Step 1: Decoding "TRNVS 1WB OV PD PTH OPP 66, Manhattan"

      This appears to be a transit designation. "TRNVS 1WB" likely means "Transit
      1 Westbound", "OV PD PTH" likely means "Over Paid Path", and "OPP 66" likely
      refers to being opposite 66th Street. This would be referring to the 1 subway
      line westbound near 66th Street in Manhattan.


      Step 2: Locating Ansche Chesed Synagogue

      Ansche Chesed Synagogue is located at 251 West 100th Street in Manhattan''s
      Upper West Side.


      Step 3: Comparing locations

      The 1 train runs under Broadway on the Upper West Side. At 66th Street, this
      would place it in the Lincoln Square area. The synagogue is at 100th Street,
      which is further north.


      In terms of east-west positioning, both locations are on the west side of Manhattan,
      with Broadway (where the 1 train runs) being slightly east of West End Avenue/Amsterdam
      Avenue where the synagogue is located (at 100th Street).


      Since Broadway (where the 1 train at 66th Street would be) is east of where
      Ansche Chesed Synagogue is positioned on the west-east axis, the transit location
      would be east of the synagogue.

      Step 1: Decode "TRNVS 1WB OV PD PTH OPP 66, Manhattan"

      This appears to be a transit or traffic designation. "TRNVS 1WB" likely means
      "Transverse 1 Westbound" in Central Park. "OV PD PTH OPP 66" likely means "Over
      Pedestrian Path Opposite 66th Street".


      Step 2: Identify the location

      The 65th-66th Street Transverse runs east-west through Central Park at approximately
      65th-66th Streets.


      Step 3: Locate Ansche Chesed Synagogue

      Ansche Chesed Synagogue is located at 251 West 100th Street (at West End Avenue)
      in Manhattan''s Upper West Side.


      Step 4: Compare east-west positions

      - The 65th-66th Street Transverse is in Central Park, which divides the East
      and West sides of Manhattan

      - Ansche Chesed Synagogue is on the Upper West Side at West 100th Street

      - The synagogue is on the west side of Manhattan, west of Central Park

      - The transverse location is within Central Park


      Step 5: Make the determination

      Since the transverse is in Central Park and Ansche Chesed is on the Upper West
      Side (west of the park), the transverse location is east of the synagogue.


      NO, TRNVS 1WB OV PD PTH OPP 66, Manhattan is NOT located west of ANSCHE CHESED

      Step 1: Decoding "TRNVS 1WB OV PD PTH OPP 66, Manhattan"

      This appears to be a transit designation. "TRNVS 1WB" likely means "Transit
      1 Westbound" and "OV PD PTH OPP 66" likely refers to "Over Pedestrian Path Opposite
      66" - this is probably referring to a westbound train line 1 location near 66th
      Street.


      Step 2: Identifying Ansche Chesed Synagogue

      Ansche Chesed Synagogue is located at 251 West 100th Street in Manhattan''s
      Upper West Side.


      Step 3: Comparing locations

      The transit designation appears to be referring to a westbound 1 train location
      near 66th Street, which would be south of 100th Street where the synagogue is
      located. However, being "westbound" doesn''t necessarily indicate its east-west
      position relative to the synagogue.


      The 1 train line runs under Broadway on the Upper West Side. Ansche Chesed Synagogue
      is located between West End Avenue and Broadway, very close to Broadway.


      Since the 1 train runs under Broadway, and the synagogue is just west of Broadway,
      a westbound 1 train location would generally be east of or directly under the
      synagogue''s location.

      Step 1: Decode the first location. "TRNVS 1WB OV PD PTH OPP 66" appears to be
      abbreviated transit information. This likely refers to "Transit 1 Westbound
      over Pedestrian Path opposite 66" - which would be near the #1 subway line.


      Step 2: Identify Ansche Chesed Synagogue. This is a known synagogue located
      at 251 West 100th Street in Manhattan''s Upper West Side.


      Step 3: The first location mentions "1WB" which suggests the #1 subway line
      westbound. The #1 train runs along Broadway in this part of Manhattan.


      Step 4: Since the first location appears to be related to the #1 train line
      (which runs along Broadway) and the Ansche Chesed Synagogue is on West 100th
      Street (west of Broadway), I need to determine their relative positions.


      Step 5: The synagogue is west of Broadway. If the first location is on the Broadway

      Fort Washington Park is located along the Hudson River in northern Manhattan,

      positions of these two locations in NYC.


      Step 1: Identify the boroughs. URBAN ASSEMBLY SCHOOL FOR COLLABORATIVE HEALTHCARE
      is in Brooklyn, while CLASON POINT GARDENS BLDG 25 is in the Bronx.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of NYC boroughs. The Bronx is the northernmost
      borough and is located on the mainland. Brooklyn is located on the western end
      of Long Island, south of Manhattan.


      Step 3: In terms of east-west positioning, Brooklyn is generally to the west
      and south of the Bronx. While parts of Brooklyn extend quite far east, and parts
      of the Bronx extend west, the overall position of Brooklyn relative to the Bronx
      is southwest.


      Step 4: Specifically, Clason Point is in the southeastern section of the Bronx,
      near the East River. This places it on the eastern side of the Bronx.


      Step 5: Given that Brooklyn is generally west of the Bronx, and Clason Point
      is on the eastern side of the Bronx, the Urban Assembly School in Brooklyn would
      be west of Clason Point Gardens.


      NO


      Wait, I need to reconsider. I made an error in my geographic reasoning. Brooklyn
      is actually south and somewhat east of the Bronx, not west of it. Manhattan
      lies between the Bronx and Brooklyn. When comparing east-west positions, Brooklyn
      is generally to the east of the Bronx.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'
    adbe06dd-f5f5-4493-8851-0035ee902dc9: 'I''ll solve this step by step to determine
      the relative positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Let me identify the boroughs. URBAN ASSEMBLY SCHOOL FOR COLLABORATIVE
      HEALTHCARE is in Brooklyn, while CLASON POINT GARDENS BLDG 25 is in the Bronx.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic layout of NYC boroughs. The Bronx is the northernmost
      borough of NYC, while Brooklyn is located to the south of Manhattan and the
      Bronx.


      Step 3: In terms of east-west positioning, Brooklyn is generally to the west
      and slightly south of the Bronx. The Bronx is in the northeastern part of NYC,
      while Brooklyn is in the western part of Long Island.


      Step 4: Specifically, Clason Point is in the southeastern part of the Bronx,
      along the East River. Any location in Brooklyn would be southwest of this point.


      Step 5: Therefore, URBAN ASSEMBLY SCHOOL FOR COLLABORATIVE HEALTHCARE in Brooklyn
      would be located to the southwest of CLASON POINT GARDENS BLDG 25 in the Bronx,
      which means it is west (and also south) of the Bronx location.


      NO


      Wait, I need to correct my answer. Looking more carefully at the geography:


      Brooklyn is indeed south of the Bronx, but it''s not directly west of it. Brooklyn
      is actually southwest of the Bronx, and specifically, Brooklyn is generally
      west of Queens and south of Manhattan, while the Bronx is north of Manhattan
      and Queens.


      Since the question specifically asks about the east-west relationship, and Brooklyn
      is indeed west of the Bronx (including Clason Point), the correct answer is:


      YES'
    dabf60d9-7c50-4fb8-9e2b-74aba6af33b8: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of both places.

      - URBAN ASSEMBLY SCHOOL FOR COLLABORATIVE HEALTHCARE is in Brooklyn

      - CLASON POINT GARDENS BLDG 25 is in the Bronx


      Step 2: Determine the general geographic relationship between Brooklyn and the
      Bronx in NYC.

      - Brooklyn is located in the southwestern part of NYC

      - The Bronx is located in the northernmost part of NYC

      - Manhattan is between them, with the Bronx to the north and Brooklyn to the
      south


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning.

      - The Bronx is generally in the northeastern part of NYC

      - Brooklyn is in the southwestern part of NYC

      - When comparing east-west positioning, Brooklyn is generally west and south
      of the Bronx


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since Brooklyn is southwest of the Bronx, and the specific locations maintain
      this general borough relationship, the Urban Assembly School in Brooklyn would
      be west of Clason Point Gardens in the Bronx.


      NO - The Urban Assembly School for Collaborative Healthcare in Brooklyn is NOT
      located west of Clason Point Gardens Bldg 25 in the Bronx. Brooklyn is actually
      south and east of the Bronx.


      Wait, I need to correct myself. Looking at NYC geography more carefully:

      - Brooklyn is south of the Bronx

      - Brooklyn is generally southwest of the Bronx

      - But the Bronx as a whole is still west of most of Queens

      - Even the eastern edge of the Bronx is typically west of most of Queens

      is the northernmost borough of NYC, while Queens is located to the east of Manhattan
      and south of the Bronx.


      2) Orchard Beach is located in the eastern part of the Bronx, specifically in

      3) Duck Creek appears to be in Queens, which is generally east and south of
      the Bronx.


      4) When comparing east-west positions in NYC, locations in the Bronx are typically

      of eastern Queens (where Duck Creek would be located).


      Step 5: However, since Orchard Beach is in the eastern part of the Bronx and
      Duck Creek is in the eastern part of Queens, I need to be more precise about

      Wait, I need to verify this. Looking more carefully at NYC geography:

      - The Bronx is north of Queens

      - Eastern Bronx (where Orchard Beach is) is northeast of Queens

      - Duck Creek in eastern Queens would be southeast of Orchard Beach

      - Duck Creek is in Queens, likely in the eastern or southeastern part of the
      borough.


      Step 4: Compare the east-west positioning.

      - Even though Orchard Beach is in the eastern part of the Bronx, the Bronx as

      (at the East River), while the Pakistan Consulate is on the East Side but not
      at the river''s edge.


      5) Therefore, the 14 STREET/CANARSIE TUBE is east of the PAKISTAN CONSULATE.


      NO, 14 STREET/CANARSIE TUBE in Manhattan is not located west of PAKISTAN CONSULATE
      in Manhattan. It is located east of it.'
    ec98331d-5b81-45b4-926e-a1a435adb9f3: 'I''ll think about this step by step.


      First, I need to identify the locations of both places:


      1) 14 STREET/CANARSIE TUBE refers to the subway tunnel that carries the L train
      under the East River, connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn. The Manhattan side
      of this tube would be at 14th Street on the east side of Manhattan.


      2) PAKISTAN CONSULATE in Manhattan is located at 12 East 65th Street, which
      is on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.


      Now I need to determine their east-west positioning relative to each other:

      - Manhattan is generally oriented with west being toward the Hudson River and
      east being toward the East River.

      - The 14 STREET/CANARSIE TUBE is at the eastern edge of Manhattan where it goes
      under the East River.

      - The Pakistan Consulate at 12 East 65th Street is on the east side of Manhattan,
      but it''s not at the very eastern edge.


      Comparing their east-west positions:

      - The Canarsie Tube at its Manhattan end is at the eastern edge of Manhattan.

      - The Pakistan Consulate, while on the east side, is still somewhat inland from
      the eastern edge.


      Therefore, the 14 STREET/CANARSIE TUBE is likely located east of the PAKISTAN
      CONSULATE, not west of it.


      NO'

      NO


      Detective Keith L Williams Field House is not west of August Martin High School;
      it''s actually to the northwest of it.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both places.

      - Central Park Tots Playground is in Central Park, Manhattan

      - Peter Cooper Village Building 511 E 20 St is at 511 East 20th Street, Manhattan


      Step 2: Analyze the street coordinates.

      - Central Park is roughly between 59th Street and 110th Street, and between
      5th Avenue and 8th Avenue (Central Park West)

      - Peter Cooper Village is around East 20th Street, and based on the "E" in the
      address, it''s on the east side of Manhattan


      Step 3: Consider Manhattan''s grid system.

      - In Manhattan, "west" and "east" are relative to 5th Avenue

      - Central Park''s eastern border is 5th Avenue

      - East 20th Street indicates a location east of 5th Avenue


      Step 4: Compare the east-west positions.

      - Central Park (including Tots Playground) is west of 5th Avenue and extends
      further west

      - Peter Cooper Village at East 20th Street is east of 5th Avenue


      Therefore, Central Park Tots Playground is indeed west of Peter Cooper Village.

      Based on the address "511 E 20 St", this building is:

      - On East 20th Street

      - In Peter Cooper Village, which is located in the east side of Manhattan

      - The "E" in the address confirms it''s on the east side of Manhattan


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      - Central Park is between 5th Avenue and Central Park West (8th Avenue)

      - Peter Cooper Village is east of 1st Avenue, near the East River

      - In Manhattan, lower avenue numbers are further east than higher avenue numbers
      (with 5th Avenue as a dividing line)

      The FDR Drive runs along the east side of Manhattan, facing the East River.
      Skyport Marina would be located on this eastern edge of Manhattan.


      PIER 69-E 21 ST indicates a pier at East 21st Street. This would also be on
      the east side of Manhattan along the East River.


      In Manhattan, locations that are on the East River are on the eastern edge of
      the island. Since both locations are on the eastern edge of Manhattan along
      the FDR Drive/East River:


      To determine which is west of the other, I need to consider their positions
      relative to each other. The piers along the East River generally extend eastward
      from the shoreline into the water. This means the main land portion would be
      west of the pier itself.


      Since Skyport Marina is on the FDR Drive (the shoreline road), and PIER 69 extends
      from the shoreline into the water, the Marina would be west of the pier.

      - Passages Academy Belmont is in the Belmont neighborhood of the Bronx, not

      Step 2: Clarify the actual locations.

      - If we''re referring to Linden Houses Building 2 in East New York, Brooklyn,
      it''s in eastern Brooklyn.

      - If we''re referring to Passages Academy Belmont, it''s actually in the Bronx,

      their actual locations.

      - East New York (where Linden Houses is located) is in eastern Brooklyn.

      Passages Academy Belmont is an alternative school located in the Belmont section

      Brownsville/Belmont (where Passages Academy Belmont is) is also in eastern Brooklyn

      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since East New York is further east than Brownsville, and Linden Houses is in

      - Passages Academy Belmont is a school likely located in the Belmont neighborhood
      of Brooklyn.


      Step 2: Consider the geography of Brooklyn neighborhoods.

      - East New York is located in the eastern part of Brooklyn.

      - Belmont is typically associated with the Bronx, but if there''s a Passages

      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      - East New York (where Linden Houses is located) is in the eastern portion of

      and PS 81 ROBERT J CHRISTEN is in the Bronx.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of NYC boroughs. The Bronx is the northernmost
      borough of NYC, while Brooklyn is located in the southwestern part of the city.


      Step 3: When comparing east-west positioning specifically, Brooklyn is generally
      west and south of the Bronx. The Bronx is in the eastern part of the mainland,
      while Brooklyn is on the western side of Long Island.


      Step 4: Looking at a mental map of NYC, if you draw a line directly east from
      most points in Brooklyn, you would not intersect the Bronx, as the Bronx is
      both east and north of Brooklyn.


      Therefore, LOW HOUSES BUILDING 1 in Brooklyn is indeed west of PS 81 ROBERT
      J CHRISTEN in the Bronx.

      - PS 75 MAYDA CORTIELLA in Brooklyn


      Step 2: The NYC Children''s Center in Brooklyn (formerly Brooklyn Children''s

      Step 4: In New York City geography, locations that are more west have lower
      avenue numbers or are on avenues that run more westward in the grid system.


      Step 5: Bergen Street runs east-west, while Ralph Avenue runs north-south.


      Step 6: Looking at their positions on the Brooklyn map, 1819 Bergen Street (NYC
      Children''s Center) is in the Crown Heights area, while 25 Ralph Avenue (PS
      75) is in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area.


      Step 7: Ralph Avenue is located to the west of where the Children''s Center

      CVII is the Roman numeral for 107, so PIER 107 CVII is simply Pier 107.


      Step 3: Determine the locations.

      Pier 107 would be located along the waterfront of Manhattan. Manhattan is an
      island with water on its east side (East River) and west side (Hudson River).


      Step 4: Consider the Lincolnton Post Office.

      The name might be referring to a post office in Lincoln Square or another area,
      but this isn''t a recognized name for a Manhattan post office.


      Step 5: Analyze the geography.

      Manhattan piers are numbered sequentially along the waterfront. Piers on the
      west side (Hudson River) are typically even-numbered, while piers on the east
      side (East River) are typically odd-numbered. Since Pier 107 is an odd number,
      it would be located on the East River side of Manhattan.


      Step 6: Make the comparison.

      Any post office in Manhattan would be inland from the waterfront. Since Pier
      107 is on the east side of Manhattan, and any Manhattan post office would be
      west of the East River waterfront, the post office would be west of Pier 107.

      I need to note that there isn''t a well-known "Lincolnton Post Office" in Manhattan.
      There is Lincoln Station Post Office in Manhattan, but not Lincolnton. Lincolnton
      would typically refer to a place in North Carolina or Georgia, not in Manhattan.

      Step 2: Consider the geography of Manhattan.

      Manhattan is an island with a roughly north-south orientation. The Hudson River
      is on the west side, and the East River is on the east side.


      Step 3: Analyze the first location - PIER 107.

      Piers in Manhattan are numbered sequentially along the shorelines. Piers on
      the Hudson River (west side) are typically even-numbered, while piers on the
      East River (east side) are typically odd-numbered. Since PIER 107 has an odd
      number, it would be located on the East River, on the east side of Manhattan.


      Step 4: Consider the second location - LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE.

      Post offices are typically located inland, not directly on the waterfront. In
      Manhattan, this would place a post office somewhere between the east and west
      shores, but not at the extreme eastern edge where Pier 107 would be.


      Step 5: Compare the relative positions.

      - ST ANDREWS PLAYGROUND BASKETBALL COURT is in Brooklyn

      - HARLEM TEAMS FOR SELF HELP is in Manhattan


      Step 2: Understand the geographical relationship between Brooklyn and Manhattan.

      Manhattan is an island borough that lies to the northeast of Brooklyn. In other
      words, Brooklyn is southwest of Manhattan.


      Step 3: Apply directional logic.

      If Brooklyn is southwest of Manhattan, then places in Brooklyn are generally
      west and/or south of places in Manhattan.


      Step 4: Make the specific comparison.

      Since ST ANDREWS PLAYGROUND BASKETBALL COURT is in Brooklyn, and HARLEM TEAMS
      FOR SELF HELP is in Manhattan, the basketball court would be west (or southwest)
      of the Harlem location.


      NO


      Wait, I need to be more precise. The question specifically asks about "west"
      direction, not southwest.


      Brooklyn is generally southwest of Manhattan, meaning it has both a western
      and southern component relative to Manhattan. Since the basketball court is
      in Brooklyn and the Harlem location is in Manhattan, the basketball court would
      indeed be west (as part of being southwest) of the Harlem location.

      Manhattan is an island that lies to the northeast of Brooklyn. This means Brooklyn

      court would generally be west (and south) of the Harlem location.


      NO.


      Wait, I need to reconsider. Brooklyn is actually east and south of Manhattan,
      not west. Brooklyn is located across the East River from Manhattan. So a location
      in Brooklyn would typically be east of a location in Manhattan, not west.


      YES.


      Actually, I need to be more precise. Harlem is in the northern part of Manhattan,
      while Brooklyn is southeast of Manhattan. So a location in Brooklyn would be
      southeast (not directly west) of a location in Harlem.

      - The Bronx is the northernmost borough of NYC.

      - Queens is located to the east of Manhattan and south of the Bronx.


      Step 3: Determine the specific location of USTA South Gate.

      - The USTA National Tennis Center is located in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park
      in Queens.

      - This is in the northern part of Queens.


      Step 4: Determine the specific location of Edenwald Houses.

      - Edenwald Houses is a housing development in the northeast Bronx.


      Step 5: Compare east-west positions.

      - Queens is generally east of the Bronx.

      - The USTA facility in Queens would be east of locations in the Bronx.

      - Therefore, USTA South Gate in Queens would be east, not west, of Edenwald
      Houses in the Bronx.

      Wait, I made a mistake in my reasoning. The question asks if Air India is west
      of the handball court. Since Manhattan is west of Brooklyn, and Air India is
      in Manhattan while the handball court is in Brooklyn, Air India would be WEST
      of the handball court, not east.

      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Prospect Park extends roughly from west to east in Brooklyn. The Flower Garden
      Pavilion is in the eastern section of the park. Luria Academy is located to
      the northeast of Prospect Park.

      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Queens is generally east of Manhattan (Manhattan is west of Queens).

      - Astoria Houses is in the northwestern part of Queens, which puts it closer
      to Manhattan, but still east of it.

      - Wagner Pool in East Harlem is on the eastern side of Manhattan.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their boroughs.

      - Even though Astoria Houses is in the western part of Queens and Wagner Pool
      is on the eastern side of Manhattan, the East River separates them.

      - Manhattan as a whole is west of Queens.

      - Even the easternmost parts of Manhattan are generally west of the westernmost
      parts of Queens.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Mall Eighteen appears to be located in the Arverne neighborhood of Queens, in
      the Rockaways area.


      Step 2: Let me identify Beach Channel Park in Queens.

      Beach Channel Park is also located in the Rockaways area of Queens, near Beach
      Channel Drive.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      In the Rockaways, which is a peninsula that runs roughly east-west, Mall Eighteen
      (also known as Arverne by the Sea retail plaza) is located in the central/eastern
      part of the Rockaways. Beach Channel Park is located along Beach Channel Drive,
      slightly to the west of the Arverne neighborhood.

      1) First, I need to identify the locations of both Mall Eighteen and Beach Channel
      Park in Queens, NYC.


      2) Mall Eighteen is located in the Fresh Meadows area of Queens, near the intersection
      of Horace Harding Expressway and Francis Lewis Boulevard.


      3) Beach Channel Park is located along Beach Channel Drive in the Rockaway Peninsula
      area of Queens, near Jamaica Bay.


      4) In New York City geography, the Rockaway Peninsula is in the southern part
      of Queens, extending into the Atlantic Ocean.


      5) Fresh Meadows is located in the north-central part of Queens.


      6) When comparing east-west positions in Queens, the Rockaway Peninsula (where
      Beach Channel Park is) is in the eastern portion of Queens, while Fresh Meadows
      (where Mall Eighteen is) is more centrally located.


      7) Therefore, Mall Eighteen would be west of Beach Channel Park.


      NO


      Wait, I need to verify this. Let me reconsider the east-west orientation:


      The Rockaways (where Beach Channel Park is) are actually in the southwestern
      part of Queens, jutting into the Atlantic. Fresh Meadows (where Mall Eighteen
      is) is in the east-central part of Queens.


      So Mall Eighteen would be east of Beach Channel Park, not west.


      YES

      located in the Bayswater area of Far Rockaway, Queens, near Beach 18th Street

      Step 2: Let me identify Beach Channel Park. Beach Channel Park is located along
      Beach Channel Drive in the Rockaway Peninsula area of Queens.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions. In the Rockaway Peninsula of Queens,
      the street numbering system runs with lower numbers to the east and higher numbers
      to the west. Since Mall Eighteen is associated with Beach 18th Street, and Beach
      Channel Park is generally located further west along Beach Channel Drive (closer
      to higher-numbered beach streets), Mall Eighteen would be east of Beach Channel
      Park.

      Step 4: Beach Channel Park spans multiple beach street numbers, but it''s generally
      located further west than the Beach 18th Street area.


      Step 5: Since Mall Eighteen is near Beach 18th Street in the eastern part of

      - Manhattan is an island in the center of NYC

      - Brooklyn is located to the southeast of Manhattan


      Step 3: Determine directional relationship.

      - If Brooklyn is southeast of Manhattan, then Brooklyn is east (and south) of
      Manhattan

      - Manhattan is an island borough located east of Brooklyn

      - Brooklyn is located to the west and south of Manhattan


      Step 3: Based on the general borough locations:

      - If HOTEL UTICA is in Brooklyn, it would generally be west of locations in
      Manhattan

      - The KIRBY FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIC CENTER is in Manhattan


      Step 4: Check for any potential exceptions.

      the borough.


      Step 2: Let me identify the location of Pumpkin Patch Marsh in Queens.

      Pumpkin Patch Marsh is located in Jamaica Bay, in the southern part of Queens.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Jamaica Bay and its wetlands (including Pumpkin Patch Marsh) are in the southwestern
      portion of Queens, while Cedar Grove Cemetery is in the eastern part of Queens.


      Step 4: Make the determination based on NYC geography.

      Since Cedar Grove Cemetery is in eastern Queens and Pumpkin Patch Marsh is in
      southwestern Queens, Cedar Grove Cemetery would be east (not west) of Pumpkin
      Patch Marsh.

      of Cedar Grove Cemetery and Pumpkin Patch Marsh in Queens, NYC.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Cedar Grove Cemetery is located in Queens.

      Cedar Grove Cemetery is located in Flushing, in the northeastern part of Queens.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Pumpkin Patch Marsh is located in Queens.

      Pumpkin Patch Marsh is located in Jamaica Bay, in the southern part of Queens.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions of these locations.

      Jamaica Bay (where Pumpkin Patch Marsh is) is in southern Queens, extending
      toward the Atlantic Ocean. This area is in the southeastern part of Queens.

      Cedar Grove Cemetery in Flushing is in northeastern Queens.


      Step 4: Determine the east-west relationship.

      When looking at a map of Queens, locations in the northeastern part (like Cedar
      Grove Cemetery) are generally east of locations in the southeastern part (like
      Pumpkin Patch Marsh in Jamaica Bay).
