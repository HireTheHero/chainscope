      1. **Boca Reservoir** is located in Nevada County, California. It is situated
      in the northern part of the state, near the town of Truckee.


      2. **Wheeler Lake** could refer to several lakes by that name, but a notable
      Wheeler Lake is located in the Sierra Nevada, specifically in the John Muir
      Wilderness in California. There is also a Wheeler Lake in Colorado, but given
      the context of comparing to Boca Reservoir in California, the former is more
      relevant.


      3. **Relative Positioning**: Boca Reservoir, near Truckee, is located in the
      northern part of California, while Wheeler Lake in the Sierra Nevada is located
      further south. When considering the typical locations associated with these
      names, Boca Reservoir is positioned to the northwest of Wheeler Lake in the
      Sierra Nevada.


      Therefore, based on this reasoning, Boca Reservoir is indeed located west of
      Wheeler Lake in the Sierra Nevada.


      So, the answer is: YES.'
