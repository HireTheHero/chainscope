      Since Switzerland (where Glarus Alps are located) is west of Russia (where Lake
      Chany is located), the Glarus Alps must be west of Lake Chany.


      NO. The Glarus Alps are not located west of Lake Chany. They are located east
      of Lake Chany.


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me correct this:


      Switzerland is in western/central Europe, while Siberia (where Lake Chany is)
      is in northern Asia, far to the east. Therefore, the Glarus Alps in Switzerland
      are WEST of Lake Chany in Siberia, not east.

      I need to determine the locations of both lakes and compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify Detroit Lake''s location.

      There are multiple "Detroit Lakes" in the United States. The most notable ones
      are:

      - Detroit Lake in Oregon (in the western US)

      - Detroit Lake in Minnesota (in the upper Midwest)


      Step 2: Identify Walloon Lake''s location.

      Walloon Lake is located in northern Michigan, in the upper Midwest region of
      the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - If we''re referring to Detroit Lake in Oregon, it''s located in the western
      United States, which is west of Michigan where Walloon Lake is located.

      - If we''re referring to Detroit Lake in Minnesota, it''s also in the Midwest
      but slightly west of Michigan.


      Step 4: Make a determination.

      Regardless of which Detroit Lake we''re considering, both are west of Walloon
      Lake in Michigan.


      NO. Detroit Lake is not located west of Walloon Lake. Detroit Lake (whether
      in Oregon or Minnesota) is located east of Walloon Lake.


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me correct this:


      Detroit Lake in Oregon is definitely west of Michigan''s Walloon Lake, as Oregon
      is on the west coast while Michigan is in the Midwest.

      Detroit Lake in Minnesota is slightly west of Michigan''s Walloon Lake.


      YES. Detroit Lake is located west of Walloon Lake.'

      - Detroit Lake in Oregon (in the western US)

      - Detroit Lake in Minnesota (in the north-central US)


      Step 2: Identify Walloon Lake. Walloon Lake is located in northern Michigan,
      in the north-central United States.


      Step 3: Compare their locations.

      - If referring to Detroit Lake in Oregon: Oregon is on the west coast of the
      United States, while Michigan is in the north-central region. Oregon is definitely
      west of Michigan, so Detroit Lake in Oregon would be west of Walloon Lake.

      - If referring to Detroit Lake in Minnesota: Minnesota is also in the north-central

      of Walloon Lake.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both lakes.

      - Detroit Lake is likely in Michigan (there''s a Detroit, Michigan) or possibly
      in Oregon (there''s a Detroit Lake State Park in Oregon).

      - Walloon Lake is in Michigan, specifically in the northern part of Michigan''s
      Lower Peninsula.


      Step 2: Determine which Detroit Lake is being referenced.

      Since Walloon Lake is in Michigan, it makes sense to compare it with the Michigan
      Detroit Lake. However, I should consider both possibilities.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - If referring to Detroit Lake in Oregon: Oregon is on the west coast of the
      US, while Michigan is in the Midwest. So Detroit Lake, Oregon would be west
      of Walloon Lake, Michigan.

      - If referring to Detroit Lake in Michigan: Detroit is in southeast Michigan,
      while Walloon Lake is in northern Michigan. On an east-west axis, Detroit is
      east of Walloon Lake.


      Step 4: Make my determination.

      Since there''s ambiguity about which Detroit Lake is referenced, I need to consider
      both:

      - Detroit Lake, Oregon is west of Walloon Lake, Michigan

      - Detroit, Michigan (and any lake named after it in that area) would be east
      of Walloon Lake


      Given that Walloon Lake is more commonly known and the question is about natural
      places, I believe the question is comparing the Detroit Lake in Oregon with
      Walloon Lake in Michigan.


      NO - Detroit Lake (Oregon) is not located west of Walloon Lake (Michigan). It
      is actually east of Walloon Lake, as Oregon is west of Michigan on a map of
      the United States.


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. If Detroit Lake is in Oregon and Walloon
      Lake is in Michigan, then Detroit Lake IS west of Walloon Lake, since Oregon
      is west of Michigan.

      - Lake Altus-Lugert is located in southwestern Oklahoma in the United States.

      - Sanabria Lake (Lago de Sanabria) is located in northwestern Spain, in the
      province of Zamora.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on a global map.

      - The United States is located in North America, which is west of Europe.

      - Spain is in Europe, east of North America.


      Step 3: Since Lake Altus-Lugert is in the United States (North America) and
      Sanabria Lake is in Spain (Europe), and North America is west of Europe when
      looking at a global map, Lake Altus-Lugert is located west of Sanabria Lake.

      across the Atlantic Ocean. Saskatchewan in Canada is significantly west of Ireland.


      NO. Patience Lake is not west of Doo Lough (Mayo). It is actually east of Doo
      Lough when considering global geography, as Patience Lake (in Canada) is located
      east of Doo Lough (in Ireland) if you go eastward around the globe.'

      Step 1: Identify Doo Lough (Mayo). This appears to be a lake in County Mayo,
      Ireland. The "(Mayo)" specification is important as there could be multiple
      places called Doo Lough.


      Step 2: Identify Patience Lake. Based on my knowledge, there is no widely known
      natural lake called "Patience Lake" that would be considered a world natural
      place. There might be small local bodies of water with this name, but it''s
      not a recognized major lake.

      Step 2: Identify Patience Lake. I need to search for information about a lake
      called "Patience Lake."


      Step 3: Based on my knowledge, Patience Lake is a potash mine tailings pond
      located in Saskatchewan, Canada.


      Step 4: Compare the locations. Doo Lough is in Ireland (in Western Europe),
      while Patience Lake is in Saskatchewan, Canada (in North America).


      Step 5: Determine relative positions. When considering global geography, Canada
      is located west of Ireland if you go the shorter way across the Atlantic Ocean.
      However, you could also go eastward around the world through Asia to reach Canada
      from Ireland, which would make Canada east of Ireland. By convention, we typically
      use the shorter distance when describing relative positions globally.


      Based on this reasoning, Patience Lake in Saskatchewan, Canada is west of Doo
      Lough in Mayo, Ireland.


      NO

      with North America to the west of Europe, then Patience Lake (in Canada) would
      be west of Doo Lough (in Ireland), not east.

      Little Blue Run Lake is a man-made reservoir located on the border between West
      Virginia and Pennsylvania, in the eastern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on the map of the United States.

      Utah and Colorado are in the western United States, while Pennsylvania and West
      Virginia are in the eastern United States. Going from east to west across the
      US, you would encounter Pennsylvania/West Virginia first, and then much later
      you would reach Utah/Colorado.


      Step 4: Determine the relative east-west positioning.

      Since the Uinta Mountains are in Utah/Colorado (western US) and Little Blue
      Run Lake is in Pennsylvania/West Virginia (eastern US), the Uinta Mountains
      are located to the west of Little Blue Run Lake.
