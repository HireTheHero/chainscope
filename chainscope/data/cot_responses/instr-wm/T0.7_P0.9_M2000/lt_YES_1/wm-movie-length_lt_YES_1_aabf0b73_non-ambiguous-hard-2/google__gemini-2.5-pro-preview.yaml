      1.  **Identify the first movie and its director:** "War Story" by Peter Lord.

      2.  **Find the runtime of this film:** Peter Lord is a co-founder of Aardman

      is part of Aardman''s "Lip Synch" series, where Peter Lord was a key creative
      (often credited as producer or part of the Aardman team). This short film has

      live-action film titled "War Story" was directed by Mark Jackson and runs for
      90 minutes, but the question specifies Peter Lord).

      3.  **Identify the second movie and its director:** "Juan & Ted: Wanted" by
      Al Tantay.

      4.  **Find the runtime of this film:** "Juan & Ted: Wanted" (a Filipino film

      88 minutes (Almost Summer).


      Therefore, William Hanna''s Mouse Trouble does have a shorter total runtime
      than Martin Davidson''s Almost Summer.
