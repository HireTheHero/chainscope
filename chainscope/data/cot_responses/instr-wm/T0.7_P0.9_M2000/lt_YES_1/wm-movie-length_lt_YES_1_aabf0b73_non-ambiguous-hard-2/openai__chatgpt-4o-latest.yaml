      *Nee Varuvai Ena*, we need to find the runtime of each film and compare them.


      **Step 1: Identify the runtime of *High on Crack Street: Lost Lives in Lowell*.**

      - This is a documentary film released in 1995, directed by Jon Alpert and Maryann
      DeLeo.

      - The runtime of this HBO documentary is approximately 55 minutes.


      **Step 2: Identify the runtime of *Nee Varuvai Ena*.**

      - This is a Tamil-language romantic drama film released in 1999, directed by
      Rajakumaran.

      - The runtime of *Nee Varuvai Ena* is approximately 146 minutes.

      1. Identify the runtime of *Adventures in Wild California*.

      2. Identify the runtime of *In My Country*.

      3. Compare the two runtimes to determine which is shorter.


      Step 1: *Adventures in Wild California* is an IMAX documentary film released
      in 2000, directed by Greg MacGillivray. IMAX documentaries typically have shorter
      runtimes than standard feature films. The runtime of *Adventures in Wild California*

      Step 2: *In My Country* is a drama film directed by John Boorman, released in
      2004. It is a full-length feature film dealing with post-apartheid truth and
      reconciliation in South Africa. The runtime of *In My Country* is approximately
      103 minutes.


      Step 3: Comparing the two:

      - *Adventures in Wild California*: ~40 minutes

      - *In My Country*: ~103 minutes


      Since 40 minutes is less than 103 minutes, *Adventures in Wild California* has
      a shorter runtime.

      and others, not Ignas Jonynas.

      - Ignas Jonynas is a Lithuanian director known for films like "The Gambler"

      \ *Family Business*. The 1989 film *Family Business* was directed by Sidney\
      \ Lumet.\n   - John Putch directed *Atlas Shrugged: Part II* (2012), the second\
      \ installment of the *Atlas Shrugged* film trilogy. However, *Atlas Shrugged*\

      \ by John Putch)\n     - *Atlas Shrugged: Part III* (2014, directed by J. James\

      \ with the total runtime of the *Atlas Shrugged* trilogy (or at least the one\
      \ directed by John Putch, Part II).\n\n3. **Find the runtime of each film:**\n\
      \   - *Family Business* (1989): Approximately 110 minutes.\n   - *Atlas Shrugged*\
      \ trilogy:\n     - Part I: ~97 minutes\n     - Part II: ~111 minutes\n     -\
      \ Part III: ~99 minutes\n     - Total: 97 + 111 + 99 = 307 minutes\n\n   If\
      \ only considering Part II (directed by Putch): 111 minutes.\n\n4. **Compare\
      \ runtimes:**\n   - *Family Business* = 110 minutes\n   - *Atlas Shrugged: Part\
      \ II* = 111 minutes\n   - 110 < 111 \u2192 *Family Business* has a shorter runtime\

      "Paranthe Wali Gali" is a full-length feature film. Feature films generally
      have runtimes over an hour. Specifically, "Paranthe Wali Gali" has a documented
      runtime of approximately **110 minutes**.


      **Step 3: Compare the runtimes**


      - "The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street": ~30 minutes

      - "Paranthe Wali Gali": ~110 minutes


      Since 30 minutes is less than 110 minutes, "The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street"
      has a shorter total runtime.

      *The Scarlet Letter* has a shorter total runtime than Giuseppe Tornatore''s
      *Il Camorrista*, we need to:


      1. Verify that both movies exist and are correctly attributed to the named directors.

      2. Determine the total runtime of each movie.

      3. Compare the runtimes to decide which one is shorter.


      **Step 1: Verify the movies and directors**

      - *The Scarlet Letter* is a film title that has been adapted multiple times.
      However, Wim Wenders, the German filmmaker known for movies like *Paris, Texas*
      and *Wings of Desire*, is not known to have directed a version of *The Scarlet
      Letter*. There is no widely known version of *The Scarlet Letter* directed by
      Wim Wenders.

      - *Il Camorrista* (1986) is a film directed by Giuseppe Tornatore. It is his
      directorial debut and is based on the life of a Neapolitan crime boss.


      Assuming for the sake of the question that we refer to a version of *The Scarlet
      Letter* attributed to Wim Wenders, we can proceed with the comparison.


      **Step 2: Determine runtimes**

      - *Il Camorrista* (1986) has a runtime of approximately 146 minutes (2 hours
      and 26 minutes).

      - Since Wim Wenders is not known to have directed *The Scarlet Letter*, one
      possibility is that the question may be hypothetical or mistaken. However, if
      we were to compare with a known Wenders film sometimes mistakenly associated
      with that title, like *The Scarlet Letter* (1973), which Wenders did not direct,
      we would find that film is around 91 minutes long.


      Alternatively, if we suppose an obscure or misattributed version of *The Scarlet
      Letter* by Wenders exists and is relatively short (as his earlier films often
      were), we can reasonably assume a runtime under 146 minutes.


      **Step 3: Compare runtimes**

      - *Il Camorrista*: ~146 minutes

      - *The Scarlet Letter* (assumed Wenders version): likely under 146 minutes,
      possibly ~91 minutes


      Conclusion:


      Given that *Il Camorrista* is 146 minutes, and the presumed Wenders-directed
      *The Scarlet Letter* is shorter, the answer is:
