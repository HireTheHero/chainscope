      which film has the shorter runtime.


      Step 1: Find the runtime of "Destination Anywhere: The Film" directed by Mark
      Pellington.

      - "Destination Anywhere: The Film" is a 1997 short film/music video directed
      by Mark Pellington, starring Jon Bon Jovi.

      - Its runtime is approximately 16 minutes.


      Step 2: Find the runtime of "Poveri ma belli" (Poor But Beautiful) directed
      by Dino Risi.

      - "Poveri ma belli" is a 1957 Italian comedy film directed by Dino Risi.

      - Its runtime is approximately 95 minutes.


      Step 3: Compare the two runtimes.

      - "Destination Anywhere: The Film" = 16 minutes

      - "Poveri ma belli" = 95 minutes

      - 16 minutes is less than 95 minutes


      Therefore, Mark Pellington''s "Destination Anywhere: The Film" does have a shorter
      total runtime than Dino Risi''s "Poveri ma belli."

      Step 2: Determine the runtime of Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business".

      Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business" (1984) has a runtime of approximately 110
      minutes.


      Step 3: Determine the runtime of John Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged".

      John Putch directed "Atlas Shrugged: Part II" (2012), which has a runtime of
      approximately 112 minutes. However, this is just one part of the trilogy. The
      complete "Atlas Shrugged" trilogy has a total runtime of around 300 minutes
      when combining all three parts.


      Step 4: Compare the runtimes.

      Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business": ~110 minutes

      John Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged" (Part II only): ~112 minutes

      Complete "Atlas Shrugged" trilogy: ~300 minutes


      Step 5: Make a conclusion.

      Even if we only consider the part directed by John Putch (Part II), "Family
      Business" has a shorter runtime (110 min vs. 112 min). If we consider the complete
      "Atlas Shrugged" story, the difference is much larger (110 min vs. ~300 min).


      YES, Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business" has a shorter total runtime than John
      Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged".'

      - John Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged" (which is actually a trilogy: Part I in 2011,
      Part II in 2012, and Part III in 2014)


      Step 2: Determine the runtime of Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business".

      Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business" (also known as "Conseil de famille") has a
      runtime of approximately 127 minutes.


      Step 3: Determine the runtime of John Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged".

      John Putch directed "Atlas Shrugged: Part II" (the second film in the trilogy),
      which has a runtime of about 112 minutes. However, if we''re considering the
      entire "Atlas Shrugged" trilogy, the combined runtime would be significantly
      longer (approximately 300+ minutes across all three parts).


      Step 4: Compare the runtimes.

      If we''re comparing Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business" (127 minutes) to just
      Putch''s contribution to "Atlas Shrugged" (Part II - 112 minutes), then Costa-Gavras''s
      film is longer.

      If we''re comparing to the entire "Atlas Shrugged" trilogy, then Costa-Gavras''s
      film is shorter.


      Since John Putch only directed Part II of the Atlas Shrugged trilogy, and that
      single film (112 minutes) is shorter than Costa-Gavras''s Family Business (127
      minutes), the answer is:


      NO (Costa-Gavras''s Family Business does not have a shorter runtime than John
      Putch''s Atlas Shrugged)'

      Birds Anonymous is a Looney Tunes animated short film directed by Friz Freleng.
      As a Looney Tunes short, it would typically run about 6-8 minutes.


      Step 2: Identify what "Candleshoe" is.

      Candleshoe is a live-action Disney film directed by Norman Tokar, released in
      1977 starring Jodie Foster. As a feature film, it would have a standard feature-length
      runtime.


      Step 3: Compare the runtimes.

      - Birds Anonymous, being a Looney Tunes short, would have a runtime of approximately
      6-8 minutes.

      - Candleshoe, being a feature film, would have a runtime of approximately 90-120
      minutes (typical for Disney live-action films of that era).


      Step 4: Determine which has the shorter runtime.

      Since Birds Anonymous is a short film (around 7 minutes) and Candleshoe is a
      feature film (around 100 minutes), Birds Anonymous has a significantly shorter
      runtime.


      YES, Friz Freleng''s Birds Anonymous has a shorter total runtime than Norman

      This is a 1978 exploitation film directed by Joe D''Amato (real name Aristide
      Massaccesi). It''s a feature-length film in the "Black Emanuelle" series.


      Step 3: Compare the runtimes.

      Looney Tunes shorts like "Little Red Rodent Hood" typically run for about 6-8
      minutes.

      "Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade" is a feature film with a runtime of approximately
      90-100 minutes.

      specifically is approximately 7 minutes long.


      Step 2: Identify "Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade" by Joe D''Amato.

      This is a 1978 Italian exploitation film directed by Joe D''Amato (real name
      Aristide Massaccesi). As a feature film, it has a runtime of approximately 90-100

      First, I need to determine the runtime of each film:


      1. "Little Red Rodent Hood" is a Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Friz Freleng.
      Like most Looney Tunes shorts, it has a runtime of approximately 7-8 minutes.
      These theatrical cartoon shorts were typically designed to be shown before feature
      films and were standardized at this length.


      2. "Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade" (also known as "Emanuelle in America")
      is an exploitation film directed by Joe D''Amato. As a feature film, it has
      a much longer runtime - approximately 90-100 minutes, which is standard for
      feature films of this genre.


      Since "Little Red Rodent Hood" is a short cartoon (approximately 7-8 minutes)
      and "Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade" is a feature-length film (approximately
      90-100 minutes), the Looney Tunes cartoon has a significantly shorter runtime.

      To determine if Friz Freleng''s "Little Red Rodent Hood" has a shorter total
      runtime than Joe D''Amato''s "Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade," I need to
      find the runtime of each film.


      1) "Little Red Rodent Hood" is a Looney Tunes animated short directed by Friz
      Freleng. Looney Tunes shorts typically ran about 6-8 minutes. Specifically,
      "Little Red Rodent Hood" (1952) has a runtime of approximately 7 minutes.


      2) "Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade" (also known as "Emanuelle and the Last
      Cannibals" or "Emanuelle e gli ultimi cannibali") is an exploitation film directed
      by Joe D''Amato. It''s a feature-length film with a runtime of approximately
      91-94 minutes.


      3) Comparing the two: 7 minutes versus 91+ minutes.

      Step 2: Identify "Honkytonk Man" directed by Clint Eastwood.

      This is a feature-length film directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, released
      in 1982. As a standard feature film, it would have a runtime of around 90-120
      minutes.


      Step 3: Compare the runtimes.

      "Chaser on the Rocks" as a cartoon short would be approximately 6-7 minutes
      long.

      "Honkytonk Man" as a feature film would be approximately 90-120 minutes long
      (the actual runtime is about 122 minutes).


      Step 4: Determine if the first is shorter than the second.

      Since 6-7 minutes is significantly less than 90-120 minutes, "Chaser on the
      Rocks" has a shorter runtime than "Honkytonk Man."


      YES'

      This appears to be a feature film (also known as "Operation Uranium") from 1978.
      As a feature film, it would typically run at least 80-90 minutes.


      3) Comparing the two: A Tom and Jerry cartoon short (approximately 6-7 minutes)
      versus a full-length feature film (approximately 80+ minutes).


      Given that "The Tom and Jerry Cartoon Kit" is a short cartoon and "The Uranium
