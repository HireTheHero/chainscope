      - "Little Red Rodent Hood" is an animated cartoon by Friz Freleng

      - "Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade" is a live-action film by Joe D''Amato


      2. Animated cartoons from this era (likely a Looney Tunes/Warner Bros. cartoon)
      typically ran around 6-8 minutes.


      3. Exploitation/adult films like the Emanuelle series typically ran around 90-100

      4. Therefore, the animated cartoon would almost certainly have a much shorter
      runtime than the feature-length live-action film.


      5. The question is asking if the Freleng cartoon has a shorter runtime than
      the D''Amato film.

      YES'

      - This is an exploitation film by Joe D''Amato

      - Such films typically ran around 90-100 minutes


      3. Comparing the two:

      - A cartoon short of ~7 minutes is much shorter than a feature film of ~95 minutes


      4. Therefore, the cartoon short would indeed have a shorter total runtime.


      The answer is: YES.'

      1. First, I''ll need to find the runtime of "Chaser on the Rocks" by Rudy Larriva

      2. Then, I''ll find the runtime of "Honkytonk Man" by Clint Eastwood

      3. Then I''ll compare their total runtimes


      Checking runtimes:

      - "Chaser on the Rocks" (1977) appears to be a short animated film, likely under
      an hour

      - "Honkytonk Man" (1982) is a feature film starring Clint Eastwood, which typically
      runs around 1.5 to 2 hours

      - "Honkytonk Man" specifically has a runtime of approximately 115 minutes (1
      hour 55 minutes)


      Comparing:

      - "Chaser on the Rocks" is likely much shorter than 115 minutes

      - Therefore, "Chaser on the Rocks" would have a shorter total runtime


      Answer: YES'

      - I''ll look up its runtime

      - The runtime of "Gumrah" is approximately 132 minutes


      3. Now I''ll compare the runtimes

      - Last Holiday (1950): 94 minutes

      - Gumrah: 132 minutes

      - 94 is less than 132


      4. Therefore, Henry Cass''s Last Holiday does have a shorter total runtime than
      Mahesh Bhatt''s Gumrah.
