      gather the total runtimes for both films:


      1. **Pippi Longstocking (Olle Hellbom)**: The runtime of the 1969 film "Pippi
      Longstocking" directed by Olle Hellbom is approximately 1 hour and 38 minutes
      (or 98 minutes).


      2. **Manithan Maravillai (Chakrapani)**: The runtime of the 1963 film "Manithan
      Maravillai" directed by Chakrapani is approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes (or
      150 minutes).


      Now, we compare the two runtimes:


      - Pippi Longstocking: 98 minutes

      - Manithan Maravillai: 150 minutes


      Since 98 minutes (Pippi Longstocking) is less than 150 minutes (Manithan Maravillai),
      we can conclude that Olle Hellbom''s Pippi Longstocking does indeed have a shorter
      total runtime than Chakrapani''s Manithan Maravillai.

    ea7766ed-39db-4038-8ece-19c008cbf839: 'To answer the question, we first need to

      1. **Kinji Fukasaku''s House on Fire**: The runtime of this film is approximately
      106 minutes.

      2. **Regardt van den Bergh''s The Visual Bible: Matthew**: The runtime of this

      Now, we compare the two runtimes:

    a7493904-0dda-4543-818c-1fba434195bd: 'To determine whether John Gilling''s "The
      Brigand of Kandahar" has a shorter total runtime than B. Vittalacharya''s "Lakshmi
      Kataksham," we need to look up the runtimes of both films.


      1. Find the runtime of "The Brigand of Kandahar."

      2. Find the runtime of "Lakshmi Kataksham."

      3. Compare the two runtimes to see if "The Brigand of Kandahar" is shorter than
      "Lakshmi Kataksham."


      After researching, the runtime for "The Brigand of Kandahar" is approximately
      90 minutes, while "Lakshmi Kataksham" has a runtime of about 120 minutes.


      Now, comparing the two:

      - "The Brigand of Kandahar": 90 minutes

      - "Lakshmi Kataksham": 120 minutes


      Since 90 minutes is shorter than 120 minutes, we conclude that John Gilling''s
      "The Brigand of Kandahar" does indeed have a shorter total runtime than B. Vittalacharya''s
      "Lakshmi Kataksham."

      Now, comparing the two:


      - "Black Emanuelle 2": ~90 minutes

      - "Insaaf Ki Devi": ~120 minutes


      Since 90 minutes is indeed shorter than 120 minutes, we can conclude that "Black
      Emanuelle 2" does have a shorter total runtime.


      Thus, the answer to the question is:


      **YES**'

      1. **Check the runtime of "Digimon Adventure: Our War Game!"**: The runtime
      is approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes (100 minutes).

      2. **Check the runtime of "Blood from the Mummy''s Tomb"**: The runtime is approximately
