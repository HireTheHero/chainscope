      - Room and Bird (1951) is a Merrie Melodies animated short directed by Friz

      - As a Merrie Melodies cartoon, it would typically be around 7-8 minutes long

      1. First, I need to check Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business" runtime:

      - I need to note that there might be some confusion here, as the more famous
      "Family Business" (1989) was directed by Sidney Lumet, not Costa-Gavras.

      - I''m not entirely certain about a Costa-Gavras film called "Family Business"


      2. Check John Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged":

      - This refers to "Atlas Shrugged: Part I" (2011) directed by Paul Johansson

      - "Atlas Shrugged: Part II" (2012) and "Part III" (2014) were directed by John
      Putch

      - The Putch-directed parts run approximately 112 and 99 minutes respectively


      3. Since I cannot verify with certainty the existence or runtime of a Costa-Gavras
      film called "Family Business," I cannot make a direct comparison.


      Given the lack of verifiable information about one of the films, I cannot provide
      a definitive YES or NO answer to this question.'

      1. First, I need to find the runtime of "A Note of Triumph: The Golden Age of
      Norman Corwin"

      - This is a 2005 documentary short film

      - It runs for approximately 40 minutes


      2. Next, I need to find the runtime of "What''s the Matter With Helen?"

      - This is a 1971 psychological thriller film

      - It runs for approximately 101 minutes


      3. Now I can compare:

      - A Note of Triumph: 40 minutes

      - What''s the Matter With Helen?: 101 minutes

      - 40 is less than 101


      Therefore, yes, A Note of Triumph has a shorter runtime than What''s the Matter
      With Helen?

      1) First, let me identify the works:

      - "Little Red Rodent Hood" is a Looney Tunes animated short film from 1952

      - "Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade" is a 1978 exploitation film


      2) For the runtimes:

      - As a Looney Tunes cartoon, "Little Red Rodent Hood" would be a typical theatrical
      short, which typically ran about 6-7 minutes

      - "Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade" is a feature film, with a runtime of
      approximately 90 minutes


      3) Comparing:

      - 6-7 minutes vs 90 minutes

      - The animated short is clearly much shorter


      YES - Little Red Rodent Hood has a shorter total runtime than Emanuelle and
      the White Slave Trade.'

      - However, I cannot find a definitive runtime for this film.


      2) Next, I need to find the runtime of "Fighter" directed by Ravi Kinagi.

      - I cannot find reliable runtime information for this film either.


      Without having concrete runtime information for both films, I cannot make a
      valid comparison to determine which one is shorter.


      Since I cannot confidently determine the relative lengths of these films with
      the information available to me, I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
      to this question.


      The honest response is: I CANNOT DETERMINE'

      1) First, let me identify The Tom and Jerry Cartoon Kit:

      - This is a Tom and Jerry animated short film from 1962

      - Being a typical Tom and Jerry theatrical short, it would be around 6-7 minutes
      long


      2) Next, The Uranium Conspiracy:

      - This is a feature film directed by Menahem Golan

      - Being a feature film, it would be significantly longer, likely around 90-120
      minutes


      3) Comparing:

      - A theatrical animated short (6-7 minutes) vs.

      - A feature film (90+ minutes)

      - The feature film is clearly much longer


      Therefore:


      YES - The Tom and Jerry Cartoon Kit has a shorter total runtime than The Uranium
      Conspiracy'
    d7b91a8a-0f4a-41ba-b8b0-f77baa9665f1: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) The Tom and Jerry Cartoon Kit is an animated short film directed by Gene
      Deitch from 1962.

      - As a Tom and Jerry theatrical short, it would typically run around 6-7 minutes
      like other shorts in the series.


      2) The Uranium Conspiracy (also known as Operation Uranium) is a 1978 feature
      film directed by Menahem Golan.

      - Being a feature film, it would have a standard theatrical runtime, likely
      between 90-120 minutes.


      3) Even though I don''t have the exact runtimes, I can confidently conclude
      that:

      - A Tom and Jerry theatrical short would be much shorter than a standard feature
      film

      - The difference would be roughly 6-7 minutes vs. 90+ minutes
