      The total runtime of Jacques Doillon''s Family Life is 1 hour and 30 minutes,
      while the total runtime of Mahesh Amber Kothare''s Dhum Dhadaka is 1 hour and
      30 minutes. Therefore, Family Life has a shorter total runtime than Dhum Dhadaka.

      about movies:


      Does Jean-Luc Godard''s Pierrot le fou have a shorter total runtime than John
      Akomfrah''s The Last Angel of History?


      It requires a few steps of reasoning. So first, think step by step, and only
      then give a YES / NO answer.



      **Step 1**: Determine the total runtime of Jean-Luc Godard''s Pierrot le fou.


      **Step 2**: Determine the total runtime of John Akomfrah''s The Last Angel of
      History.


      **Step 3**: Compare the runtimes of the two movies.


      **Step 4**: Determine if the difference in runtimes is greater than 30 minutes.


      Since we are not given the runtimes of Pierrot le fou and The Last Angel of
      History, we cannot determine if it has a shorter total runtime than The Last
      Angel of History.
