      "I''ll Get You for This" is a feature film. Feature films from this era (1941)
      were usually around 90-120 minutes in length. Given that, we can estimate the
      runtime of "I''ll Get You for This" to be approximately 105 minutes.

      1. **Identify the runtime of Chuck Jones''s Chow Hound**: Chow Hound is a short
      film, and as such, it typically has a short runtime. Most classic animated shorts,
      especially from the era when Chuck Jones was active, are around 6 to 10 minutes
      long. However, without the exact runtime provided, we''ll have to consider the
      general length of short films.


      2. **Identify the runtime of Carl Reiner''s Dead Men Don''t Wear Plaid**: Dead
      Men Don''t Wear Plaid is a feature film, and feature films are generally much
      longer than short films. A typical feature film can range from about 80 minutes
      to over 3 hours in length. Dead Men Don''t Wear Plaid, being a comedy from 1982,
      likely falls within a standard range for its genre and time, probably around
      1.5 to 2.5 hours (90 to 150 minutes).

      1. **Identify the runtime of "Chow Hound"**: "Chow Hound" is a 1951 short film
      directed by Chuck Jones. Short films typically have shorter runtimes compared
      to feature films. Given the context and the year, it''s likely that "Chow Hound"
      has a runtime of around 7 to 10 minutes.


      2. **Identify the runtime of "Dead Men Don''t Wear Plaid"**: "Dead Men Don''t
      Wear Plaid" is a 1982 feature film directed by Carl Reiner. Feature films usually
      have runtimes ranging from 80 minutes to over 3 hours. For a comedy film like
      this, it''s reasonable to expect a runtime of around 90 to 120 minutes.


      3. **Compare the runtimes**: Since "Chow Hound" is a short film with a runtime
      of around 7 to 10 minutes, and "Dead Men Don''t Wear Plaid" is a feature film
      with a runtime of around 90 to 120 minutes, it''s clear that "Chow Hound" has

      range for its genre and time, probably around 1.5 to 2.5 hours (90 to 150 minutes).


      3. **Compare the runtimes**: Given that short films are typically under 10 minutes
      and feature films are usually over 80 minutes, it''s reasonable to conclude
      that Loopy De Loop, as a short film, would have a shorter runtime than War Requiem,
      a feature film.

      Step 1: Loopy De Loop is a series of animated short films created by William
      Hanna. The runtime of each short film in the series varies, but they are typically
      around 6-7 minutes long. However, since we are comparing the total runtime,
      we need to consider the total runtime of all the Loopy De Loop short films.


      Step 2: War Requiem is a 1989 British film directed by Derek Jarman. The runtime
      of War Requiem is approximately 92 minutes.


      Step 3: Comparing the runtimes, the total runtime of Loopy De Loop (series of
      short films) is significantly shorter than the runtime of War Requiem (feature
      film).

      Given the process:

      - **The Man Inside (1990)** has a runtime of approximately 93 minutes.

      - **Vidukathai (1997)**, after research, does not yield a commonly known or
      easily accessible runtime in widely available English sources. Tamil films from
      this era may have varying reported lengths due to differences in versions, cuts,
      or restoration efforts. However, many films from the 1990s tend to have runtimes
      that can range significantly, often between 120 to 180 minutes or more, considering

      Given the lack of specific information on "Vidukathai" and the known runtime

      **Conclusion**: Without a specific runtime for "Vidukathai" and considering
      typical lengths for films of that era, it''s challenging to definitively answer

      without exact figures for "Vidukathai."

      with Destiny is a short film, and according to various sources, it has a runtime
      of approximately 5 minutes.

      Main Karoongaa is a feature film, and like most feature films, it has a runtime

      compare them to determine if Playdate with Destiny has a shorter total runtime
      than Insaaf Main Karoongaa.


      Given the process:

      - **Playdate with Destiny (2020)** has a runtime of approximately 5 minutes.

      - **Insaaf Main Karoongaa (1985)**, after research, does not yield a commonly
      known or easily accessible runtime in widely available English sources. Hindi
      films from the 1980s may have varying reported lengths due to differences in
      versions, cuts, or restoration efforts. However, many films from this era tend
      to have runtimes that can range significantly, often between 120 to 180 minutes
      or more, considering the norms for Hindi cinema at the time.


      Given the lack of specific information on "Insaaf Main Karoongaa" and the known
      runtime of "Playdate with Destiny," we must rely on typical film lengths of
      the era and any available data.


      **Conclusion**: Without a specific runtime for "Insaaf Main Karoongaa" and considering
      typical lengths for films of that era, it''s challenging to definitively answer
      the question based solely on available data. However, if we consider many classic
      Hindi films tend to be longer, and "Playdate with Destiny" is 5 minutes, it''s
      plausible that "Playdate with Destiny" could have a shorter runtime, but this
      is speculative without exact figures for "Insaaf Main Karoongaa."


      Given the constraints and aiming for a reasoned guess based on typical film
      lengths of their respective genres and eras, the answer would lean towards YES,
      assuming many Hindi films of the 1980s were indeed longer than 5 minutes. However,
      without the exact runtime for "Insaaf Main Karoongaa," this is a reasoned speculation
      rather than a definitive fact.

      1. **Identify the runtime of William Hanna''s "Mouse Trouble"**: "Mouse Trouble"
      is a 1944 animated short film. It is part of the "Tom and Jerry" series. Most
      Tom and Jerry shorts are around 6-10 minutes in length.


      2. **Identify the runtime of Martin Davidson''s "Almost Summer"**: "Almost Summer"
      is a 1978 comedy film. The runtime for feature films like "Almost Summer" is
      typically around 90-120 minutes.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the runtime of William Hanna''s Mouse Trouble**: Mouse Trouble
      is a short film, and like most short films, it typically has a runtime of under
      30 minutes. Most classic animated shorts, especially from the era when William
      Hanna was active, are around 6 to 10 minutes long. However, without the exact
      runtime provided, we''ll have to consider the general length of short films.


      2. **Identify the runtime of Martin Davidson''s Almost Summer**: Almost Summer
      is a feature film, and feature films are generally much longer than short films.
      A typical feature film can range from about 80 minutes to over 3 hours in length.
      Almost Summer, being a comedy-drama from 1978, likely falls within a standard
      range for its genre and time, probably around 1.5 to 2.5 hours (90 to 150 minutes).


      3. **Compare the runtimes**: Given that short films are typically under 10 minutes

      is a 1965 Soviet comedy film. According to various sources, the runtime of this
      film is approximately 74 minutes.

      3. **Compare the runtimes**: Once we have the runtime for both films, we can
      compare them to determine if Thirty Three has a shorter total runtime than Anveshana.


      Given the process:

      - **Thirty Three (1965)** has a runtime of approximately 74 minutes.

      - **Anveshana (1985)**, after research, does not yield a commonly known or easily
      accessible runtime in widely available English sources. Telugu films from this
      era may have varying reported lengths due to differences in versions, cuts,
      or restoration efforts. However, many films from the 1980s tend to have runtimes
      that can range significantly, often between 120 to 180 minutes or more, considering
      the norms for Telugu cinema at the time.


      Given the lack of specific information on "Anveshana" and the known runtime
      of "Thirty Three," we must rely on typical film lengths of the era and any available
      data.


      **Conclusion**: Without a specific runtime for "Anveshana" and considering typical
      lengths for films of that era, it''s challenging to definitively answer the
      question based solely on available data. However, if we consider many Telugu
      films tend to be longer, and "Thirty Three" is 74 minutes, it''s plausible that
      "Thirty Three" could have a shorter runtime, but this is speculative without
      exact figures for "Anveshana."

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the runtime of Ignas Jonynas''s Yolki**: Yolki, also known as
      "Christmas Trees," is a 2010 Russian comedy-drama film. Most feature films typically
      have a runtime of around 90 minutes to 2 hours or more. However, without specific
      information about the runtime of Yolki, we can only estimate based on typical
      feature film lengths.


      2. **Identify the runtime of Ross McElwee''s Sherman''s March**: Sherman''s
      March is a 1986 American documentary film directed by Ross McElwee. Documentary
      films can vary widely in length, but they often range from about 60 minutes
      to several hours. Without specific information about the runtime of Sherman''s
      March, we can only estimate based on typical documentary film lengths.


      3. **Compare the runtimes**: Given that both films are feature-length productions,
      it''s reasonable to assume that Yolki and Sherman''s March have runtimes within
      the typical range for feature films and documentaries, respectively. However,
      without exact runtimes, we can''t definitively determine which film has a shorter
      runtime.

      Given the lack of specific information about the runtimes of both films, it''s
      not possible to definitively answer whether Yolki has a shorter total runtime
      than Sherman''s March. To provide a more accurate answer, we would need to find
      the exact runtimes of both films.

      \ feature film can range from about 80 minutes to over 3 hours in length. Musical\
      \ films from the 1950s often had runtimes that were longer than the average\
      \ film, typically around 2 to 2.5 hours (120 to 150 minutes).\n\nGiven the typical\

      Given the process:

      - **Orson Welles''s Othello** has a runtime of approximately 91 minutes.

      - **Thulasidas''s Kasaragod Khader Bhai**, after research, does not yield a
      commonly known or easily accessible runtime in widely available English sources.
      Malayalam films from this era may have varying reported lengths due to differences
      in versions, cuts, or restoration efforts. However, many films from the 1990s
      tend to have runtimes that can range significantly, often between 120 to 180
      minutes or more, considering the norms for Malayalam cinema at the time.


      Given the lack of specific information on "Kasaragod Khader Bhai" and the known
      runtime of "Orson Welles''s Othello," we must rely on typical film lengths of
      the era and any available data.


      **Conclusion**: Without a specific runtime for "Kasaragod Khader Bhai" and considering
      typical lengths for films of that era, it''s challenging to definitively answer
      the question based solely on available data. However, if we consider many classic
      Malayalam films tend to be longer, and "Orson Welles''s Othello" is 91 minutes,
      it''s plausible that "Orson Welles''s Othello" could have a shorter runtime,
      but this is speculative without exact figures for "Kasaragod Khader Bhai."


      Given the constraints and aiming for a reasoned guess based on typical film
      lengths of their respective genres and eras, the answer would lean towards YES,
      assuming many Malayalam films of the 1990s were indeed longer than 91 minutes.
      However, without the exact runtime for "Kasaragod Khader Bhai," this is a reasoned
      speculation rather than a definitive fact.

      films tend to be longer, and "Family Life" is 110 minutes, it''s plausible that
      "Family Life" could have a shorter runtime, but this is speculative without
      exact figures for "Dhum Dhadaka."


      Given the constraints and aiming for a reasoned guess based on typical film

      Henry" has a shorter total runtime than Yoram Gross''s "The Little Convict",
      we need to follow a step-by-step process:


      1. **Identify the runtime of "John Henry"**: "John Henry" is a short film, and
      short films typically have a shorter runtime compared to feature-length films.
      Most classic animated shorts, especially from the era when Mark Henn was active,
      are around 6 to 10 minutes long. However, without the exact runtime provided,
      we''ll have to consider the general length of short films.


      2. **Identify the runtime of "The Little Convict"**: "The Little Convict" is
      a feature film, and feature films are generally much longer than short films.
      A typical feature film can range from about 80 minutes to over 3 hours in length.
      "The Little Convict," being a family adventure film from 1979, likely falls
      within a standard range for its genre and time, probably around 1.5 to 2.5 hours
      (90 to 150 minutes).


      3. **Compare the runtimes**: Given that short films are typically under 10 minutes
      and feature films are usually over 80 minutes, it''s reasonable to conclude
      that "John Henry," as a short film, would have a shorter runtime than "The Little
      Convict," a feature film.

      2. **Identify the runtime of Friz Freleng''s Tweety & Sylvester: Feline Fwenzy**:
      Tweety & Sylvester: Feline Fwenzy is a 1996 video game. It''s not a film, so
      its "runtime" might not be applicable. However, for the sake of comparison,
      we can consider the typical time spent playing a video game. Video games can
      have various lengths, from a few minutes to hundreds of hours, depending on
      the game and the player''s choices. Without specific information on this particular
      game, we can''t determine an exact "runtime."


      3. **Compare the runtimes**: Given that Invasion of the Saucer Men has a runtime
      of about 69 minutes and Tweety & Sylvester: Feline Fwenzy is a video game without
      a specific runtime, it''s challenging to make a direct comparison. However,
      if we consider that most films are longer than most video game play sessions
      (excluding games like MMOs or open-world games with extensive content), it''s
      reasonable to conclude that the film has a longer runtime.


      Given these steps, the answer is: **NO**'

      American Western film directed by Harold F. Kress. According to various sources,
      its runtime is approximately 69 minutes.


      2. **Identify the runtime of "Chandralekha"**: "Chandralekha" is a 1948 Indian
      Tamil-language film directed by S. S. Vasan. It is a historical drama film and
      is one of the earliest Indian films to be released in multiple languages. The
      runtime for this film can vary depending on the version and the language. The
      Tamil version, which is the original, has a runtime of approximately 193 minutes
      (3 hours and 13 minutes).


      3. **Compare the runtimes**: Now that we have the runtimes for both films, we
      can compare them. "Apache War Smoke" has a runtime of 69 minutes, while "Chandralekha"
      has a runtime of 193 minutes.


      Given these runtimes, it''s clear that "Apache War Smoke" has a shorter total
      runtime than "Chandralekha".

      runtime of around 6 to 10 minutes.


      2. Identify the runtime of Lo Wei''s "Spiritual Kung Fu": "Spiritual Kung Fu"
      is a 1978 martial arts film, and feature-length films typically have runtimes
      of around 90 minutes or more.


      3. Compare the runtimes: Given that animated shorts are usually shorter than

      shorter runtime than Spiritual Kung Fu, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the runtime of Cats and Bruises**: Cats and Bruises is a short
      film, and like most classic animated shorts, it typically has a runtime of around
      6 to 10 minutes. We''ll assume it''s within this range.


      2. **Identify the runtime of Spiritual Kung Fu**: Spiritual Kung Fu is a feature
      film. Feature films usually have runtimes that are much longer than short films.
      They typically range from about 80 minutes to over 3 hours. Spiritual Kung Fu
      is a martial arts film, and many martial arts films from this era had runtimes
      of around 90 to 120 minutes. We''ll assume it''s within this range.


      3. **Compare the runtimes**: Since Cats and Bruises is a short film and Spiritual
      Kung Fu is a feature film, it''s safe to say that Cats and Bruises has a shorter
      runtime. This is because short films are typically under 10 minutes, while feature
      films are usually over 80 minutes.

      Step 3: Given the lack of specific information on "Kadhal Sadugudu" and the

      Conclusion: Without a specific runtime for "Kadhal Sadugudu" and considering
      typical lengths for films of that era, it''s challenging to definitively answer
      the question based solely on available data. However, if we consider that many

      Given the constraints and aiming for a reasoned guess based on typical film
      lengths of their respective genres and eras, the answer would lean towards YES,
      assuming many Tamil films of the 2000s were indeed longer than 92 minutes. However,
      without the exact runtime for "Kadhal Sadugudu," this is a reasoned speculation
