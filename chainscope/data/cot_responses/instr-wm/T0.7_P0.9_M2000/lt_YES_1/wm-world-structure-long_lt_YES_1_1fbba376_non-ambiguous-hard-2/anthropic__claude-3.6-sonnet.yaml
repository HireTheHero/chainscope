      - Ireland is on the western edge of Europe

      - Berlin is in eastern Germany, in central/eastern Europe

      1. First, let''s locate South Harrow tube station:

      - South Harrow is a London Underground station

      - It''s in west London, UK


      2. Next, let''s locate Tre Kronor castle:

      - Tre Kronor was a castle in Stockholm, Sweden

      - Stockholm is in eastern Sweden


      3. Now let''s compare their locations:

      - London is significantly west of Stockholm

      - Therefore, any location in London (including South Harrow) would be west of
      any location in Stockholm (including Tre Kronor)


      YES - South Harrow tube station is located west of Tre Kronor castle.'

      1. First, let me identify the locations:

      - Chotiari Dam is in Pakistan, in the Sindh province

      - Busan Exhibition and Convention Center (BEXCO) is in Busan, South Korea


      2. Now let me consider their relative positions:

      - Pakistan is in South Asia

      - South Korea is in East Asia

      - When looking at a map, Pakistan is clearly west of South Korea


      3. Since Chotiari Dam is in Pakistan and BEXCO is in South Korea, and Pakistan
      is west of South Korea, therefore Chotiari Dam must be west of BEXCO.
