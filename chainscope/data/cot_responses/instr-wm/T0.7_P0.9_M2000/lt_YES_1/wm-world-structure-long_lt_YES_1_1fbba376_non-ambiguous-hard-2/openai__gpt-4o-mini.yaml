      2. **Locate Mikhail Bulgakov Museum**: The Mikhail Bulgakov Museum is located
      in Moscow, Russia.


      3. **Geographical Relationship**: Greenford station is situated in the UK, while
      the Mikhail Bulgakov Museum is in Russia. To compare their locations, we consider
      their coordinates and general positions on the map.


      4. **West/East Determination**: Given that Greenford station is in the UK and

      Skara is in the southern part of Sweden.


      3. **Geographical Relation**: To find out if St. Werburgh''s Church is west
      of Skara Cathedral, we need to look at their respective positions. Dublin is
      southwest of Skara, meaning that if you were to draw a line from Skara Cathedral

      1. **Location of Danjiangkou Dam**: The Danjiangkou Dam is located in Hubei
      Province, China. It is situated near the city of Danjiangkou, which is in the
      central part of China.


      2. **Location of Russell Street, Melbourne**: Russell Street is located in Melbourne,
      Australia. Melbourne is situated in the southern part of Australia, while Russell
      Street is in the central business district of the city.


      3. **Geographical Context**: When comparing the two locations, Danjiangkou Dam
      is in China (northern hemisphere) and Russell Street is in Australia (southern
      hemisphere). Since they are in different countries and hemispheres, we need
      to assess their relative positions.


      4. **Direction**: To say that something is "west" of another location, it implies
      that you are moving in a westward direction from the reference point to reach
      the other location. Since Danjiangkou Dam is located in China and Russell Street
      is in Australia, it is not applicable to directly compare their positions in

      2. **Estadio Gigante de Arroyito**: This stadium is located in Rosario, Argentina.


      Next, we need to understand the geographical orientation of these two locations:


      - Washington State is in the northwestern part of the United States, and it
      is positioned to the north of Argentina.

      - Rosario, Argentina, is situated in the central part of the country, which
      is much further south compared to Washington.


      Now, to determine if Baker Lake is west of Estadio Gigante de Arroyito:


      - If we visualize or map the locations, Washington is to the northwest of Argentina.
      Therefore, Baker Lake, which is in Washington, would be west of Rosario (the

      1. **Identify the locations**: King Alfred''s Tower is located in Somerset,

      2. **Understand their relative positions**: Since King Alfred''s Tower is in

      is located in the eastern part of Norway.


      4. **West/East Relationship**: Since Dublin is further south and to the west
      of Lillehammer, we can conclude that Dublin is west of Lillehammer.


      Now, with this information in mind, we can conclude that:


      The Church of the Immaculate Conception is located west of the Gustav Adolf
      Stave Church.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is **YES**.'

    fa45a3a3-6eaf-48bd-8baf-910f92f6ed9a: 'To determine whether San Dimas Hotel is
      located west of Barker Reservoir, we need to identify the locations of both
      the San Dimas Hotel and Barker Reservoir.


      1. **Locate San Dimas Hotel:** The San Dimas Hotel is located in San Dimas,
      California.


      2. **Locate Barker Reservoir:** Barker Reservoir is located in Colorado, specifically
      near the town of Nederland.


      3. **Determine Relative Positions:** To find out if the San Dimas Hotel is west
      of Barker Reservoir, we need to compare the longitudes of both locations. San
      Dimas, California, is at a longitude of approximately -117.8 degrees, while
      Barker Reservoir in Colorado is at a longitude of approximately -105.5 degrees.


      4. **Compare Longitudes:** Since -117.8 is less than -105.5, San Dimas Hotel
      is actually located to the west of Barker Reservoir.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:


      **YES**'
