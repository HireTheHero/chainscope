      The question is about the relative location of "Riverside Park Community" and
      "Grange Park railway station."


      Step 2: Determine the likely location of "Grange Park railway station."

      Grange Park railway station is a well-known station in the London Borough of
      Enfield, North London, UK. This is the most prominent station with this name.


      Step 3: Determine the likely location of "Riverside Park Community" in relation
      to the identified Grange Park railway station.

      In the context of Enfield, London, there is a "Riverside Park." This park is
      located generally to the east and south-east of Grange Park railway station.
      The community or residential areas around this park would, therefore, also be
      generally to the east or south-east of the station. For example, areas along
      the New River or Pymmes Brook that form part of Riverside Park are east of the
      railway line that Grange Park station is on.


      Step 4: Compare the relative locations.

      If Riverside Park Community (referring to the areas around Riverside Park in
      Enfield) is to the east or south-east of Grange Park railway station, then it
      is not west of it.

      \ west of locations with East longitudes. Even if both were West, a smaller\
      \ negative number (closer to 0) is east of a larger negative number. If both\
      \ were East, a smaller positive number is west of a larger positive number.\
      \ In this case, West is clearly west of East.\n\nTherefore, Turnpike Lane tube\
