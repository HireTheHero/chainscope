      3. Kensico Reservoir is located in Westchester County, New York, near the city
      of White Plains.


      4. These two locations are on opposite sides of the United States - California
      is on the west coast, while New York is on the east coast.


      5. Since they are in completely different states and regions, I''ll need to
      definitively confirm their relative positions.


      6. California is west of New York, but the question is about the specific locations
      of these two water bodies.


      7. Based on their geographic locations, Lake Del Valle is west of Kensico Reservoir.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      However, I realize I do not actually know the precise geographical locations
      of these two specific buildings in Paris. Without being able to verify their
      exact positions, I cannot confidently answer YES or NO.


      The honest response is: I do not know.'

      1. First, let''s identify the locations mentioned:

      - Central Sofia Market Hall (located in Sofia, Bulgaria)

      - St. Stephen''s Church (mentioned as being in Delhi, India)


      2. These are two locations in completely different countries:

      - Sofia is the capital of Bulgaria (in Eastern Europe)

      - Delhi is a city in India (in South Asia)


      3. These locations are thousands of miles apart, on different continents.


      4. Therefore, the concept of "west of" becomes meaningless in this context.


      5. The question cannot be answered with a simple geographical relationship.


      However, the question demands a YES or NO answer. Since the locations are not
      geographically comparable, the most logical response is:


      NO'

    a3bcdfcc-de29-475b-9123-20d9209f329a: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to locate Durgapur Barrage geographically

      - Durgapur Barrage is located in West Bengal, India

      - It is situated on the Damodar River near the city of Durgapur


      2. Next, I need to locate Caloocan Cathedral

      - Caloocan is a city in the Philippines, specifically in the Metro Manila region

      - Caloocan Cathedral is located in Caloocan City, Philippines


      3. Comparing their geographical locations

      - Durgapur Barrage is in India (South Asia)

      - Caloocan Cathedral is in the Philippines (Southeast Asia)

      - These locations are thousands of miles apart


      4. Determining west/east relationship

      - These locations are not in a simple west/east relationship

      - They are in completely different parts of Asia


      5. Conclusion: The question cannot be definitively answered with a simple west/east
      orientation.


      However, the question demands a YES or NO answer. Given the information available,
      the most appropriate response is:


      NO'

    6b97faeb-be9a-410c-a8d3-c9d8246361b5: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. St. Agnes Cathedral is located in Rockville Centre, New York, which is on
      Long Island.


      2. Maze Hill railway station is located in Greenwich, London, United Kingdom.


      3. These two locations are on different continents - North America and Europe,
      respectively.


      4. Since they are thousands of miles apart, we need to determine their relative
      positions.


      5. Rockville Centre, NY is located east of the Greenwich meridian, while Greenwich,
      London is west of the meridian.


      6. Therefore, St. Agnes Cathedral is west of Maze Hill railway station.

      1. First, I need to locate San Dimas and Barker Reservoir geographically.


      2. San Dimas is a city in Los Angeles County, California.


      3. Barker Reservoir is located in the San Gabriel Mountains, specifically in
      the San Gabriel Canyon area.


      4. San Dimas is east of the San Gabriel Mountains, while Barker Reservoir is
      located in the mountains to the west of San Dimas.


      5. Therefore, from San Dimas'' perspective, Barker Reservoir would be west of
      the city.


      6. However, the question is about the location of San Dimas Hotel relative to
      Barker Reservoir.


      7. Without specific information about the exact location of San Dimas Hotel,
      I cannot definitively say whether it is west or east of Barker Reservoir.


      8. I do not have enough precise geographical information to confidently answer
      this question.


      Therefore, my answer is: NO (I cannot confirm the hotel''s location with certainty)'
