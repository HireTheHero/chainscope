      is located in Nepal, specifically in the Kathmandu Valley, near the town of
      Pharping.


      3. **Geographical Orientation**: To find out if the Sa''dabad Complex is west
      of the Pharping Hydropower Station, we need to compare their longitudinal coordinates.
      Tehran, Iran, is situated at approximately 51.4 degrees East longitude, while
      Pharping, Nepal, is situated at approximately 85.3 degrees East longitude.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Tehran (and hence the Sa''dabad Complex) is at a lower
      longitude than Pharping, it is indeed located to the west of Pharping.
