    2a4edb43-a186-43e5-b68f-ec55bf216fb4: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Greenford station is located in London, United
      Kingdom, while Mikhail Bulgakov Museum is located in Moscow, Russia.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: To determine if one location is west
      of another, we need to consider their positions relative to each other on a
      map. Generally, west refers to the direction towards the setting sun, which
      is one of the four cardinal directions.


      3. **Compare the locations**: London, where Greenford station is located, is
      in Western Europe. Moscow, where Mikhail Bulgakov Museum is located, is in Eastern
      Europe, specifically in Russia.


      4. **Determine direction**: When moving from Western Europe to Eastern Europe,
      one is generally moving eastward. However, the exact west-east positioning can
      depend on the specific locations within these broad regions.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that London (and thus Greenford station) is west of
      Moscow (where Mikhail Bulgakov Museum is located), we can conclude that Greenford
      station is indeed located west of Mikhail Bulgakov Museum.

      the steps needed to determine if Lake Del Valle is located west of Kensico Reservoir.


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know where Lake Del Valle and
      Kensico Reservoir are located. Lake Del Valle is in California, USA. Kensico
      Reservoir is in New York, USA.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: To determine if one location is west
      of another, we need to consider their positions relative to each other on a
      map. The United States spans a significant portion of North America, with California
      on the west coast and New York on the east coast.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Given that California (where Lake Del Valle is
      located) is on the west coast of the United States and New York (where Kensico
      Reservoir is located) is on the east coast, it means that any location in California
      is west of any location in New York.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations of Lake Del Valle in
      California and Kensico Reservoir in New York, Lake Del Valle is indeed west
      of Kensico Reservoir.

      of another, we need to consider their positions relative to each other on a
      map. The United States spans a significant portion of North America, with California
      on the west coast and Oklahoma in the central region.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Given that California (where Eureka Inn is located)
      is on the west coast of the United States and Oklahoma (where Blue Canyon Wind
      Farm is located) is in the central region, it means that Eureka Inn is indeed
      west of Blue Canyon Wind Farm.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations of Eureka Inn in California
      and Blue Canyon Wind Farm in Oklahoma, Eureka Inn is west of Blue Canyon Wind
      Farm.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{YES}$

      the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify where Blyderivierpoort
      Dam and Upper Seletar Reservoir are located. Blyderivierpoort Dam is in South
      Africa, while Upper Seletar Reservoir is in Singapore.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: To determine if one location is west
      of another, we need to consider their positions relative to each other on a
      map. South Africa is located on the southern tip of the African continent, and
      Singapore is an island country in Southeast Asia.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Given that South Africa is generally west of Singapore,
      we can conclude that Blyderivierpoort Dam in South Africa is west of Upper Seletar
      Reservoir in Singapore.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations, Blyderivierpoort Dam
      in South Africa is indeed west of Upper Seletar Reservoir in Singapore.

      Dam and Upper Seletar Reservoir. Blyderivierpoort Dam is located in South Africa,
      specifically in Mpumalanga province. Upper Seletar Reservoir is in Singapore.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: To determine if one location is west
      of another, we need to consider their positions relative to each other on a
      map. The Earth is divided into hemispheres (Northern and Southern) and continents.
      Africa is in the Southern Hemisphere, and Asia (where Singapore is located)
      is in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Given that South Africa (where Blyderivierpoort
      Dam is located) is in the Southern Hemisphere and Singapore (where Upper Seletar
      Reservoir is located) is in the Northern Hemisphere, we can conclude that Blyderivierpoort
      Dam is west of Upper Seletar Reservoir. This is because when you move from the
      Southern Hemisphere to the Northern Hemisphere, you are generally moving westward.

      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know where Lake Wallenpaupack
      and St Paul''s Church, Knightsbridge are located. Lake Wallenpaupack is in Pennsylvania,
      USA. St Paul''s Church, Knightsbridge is in London, England.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: To determine if one location is west
      of another, we need to consider their positions relative to each other on a
      map. The United States and the United Kingdom are both in the northern hemisphere,
      but they are on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Given that Pennsylvania (where Lake Wallenpaupack
      is located) is on the east coast of the United States and London (where St Paul''s
      Church, Knightsbridge is located) is in the United Kingdom, which is across
      the Atlantic Ocean to the east, it means that Lake Wallenpaupack is indeed west
      of St Paul''s Church, Knightsbridge.
