      quick search reveals that St. Kazimierz Church is a common name, and there are
      many around the world.  I need more information to pinpoint the specific church
      in question.  However, many are in Poland and Lithuania.

      3. **Determine relative positions:** Assuming we are talking about a St. Kazimierz
      Church in Poland or Lithuania (which seems most likely given the prevalence
      of that name in those countries), these countries are west of Russia.


      4. **Consider the specific longitude:** Even taking into account the curvature
      of the Earth and potential outliers, any St. Kazimierz Church in Poland or Lithuania
      would almost certainly have a longitude west of Shatura Power Station.

      Complex is in the northern part of Bangkok''s metropolitan area while the Shrine
      of St. Therese is in the eastern part of the city.


      3. **West/East Orientation:**  North is *above* East on a map.  Therefore, something
      north of a landmark cannot be directly west of it.  It might be northwest, but
      not directly west.

      Therese, Doctor of the Church.  Both are in Bangkok, Thailand.

      see that the Chaeng Watthana Government Complex is generally north and slightly
      east of the Shrine of St. Therese.


      3. **West signifies direction:** West is a specific direction, meaning to the
      left on a standard map.


      4. **Compare:** Since the Government Complex is north and slightly east, it
      is NOT west of the Shrine.
