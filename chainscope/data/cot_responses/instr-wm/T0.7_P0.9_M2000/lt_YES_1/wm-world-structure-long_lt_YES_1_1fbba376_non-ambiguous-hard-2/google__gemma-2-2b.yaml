      The question is asking whether Danjiangkou Dam is located west of Russell Street
      in Melbourne.


      To answer this question, we need to consider the following:


      1. **Danjiangkou Dam**: Danjiangkou Dam is located in the Danjiangkou Reservoir,
      which is a reservoir in the Danjiangkou region of China. The Danjiangkou region
      is located in the southwestern part of China, specifically in the province of
      Hubei.


      2. **Russell Street, Melbourne**: Russell Street is a street in Melbourne, Australia.
      Melbourne is located in the southeastern part of Australia, in the state of
      Victoria.


      Now, let''s analyze the question:


      1. **West**: West is the direction to the left when facing the equator. In this
      case, West would refer to the direction to the left of the equator, which is
      the direction opposite to the direction of the sun.

      2. **Melbourne**: Melbourne is located in the southeastern part of Australia,
      in the state of Victoria. It is located in the southeastern hemisphere of the
      Earth, which means that it is south of the equator.


      Based on these clues, we can conclude that Danjiangkou Dam is located west of
      Russell Street, Melbourne.
