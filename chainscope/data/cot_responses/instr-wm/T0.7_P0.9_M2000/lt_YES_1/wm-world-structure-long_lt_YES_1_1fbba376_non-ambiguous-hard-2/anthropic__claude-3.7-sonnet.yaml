      are west of locations in the United Kingdom, as the United States is further
      west in terms of longitude.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since North Shore Music Theatre (in Massachusetts, USA) is west of City Thameslink
      railway station (in London, UK) when considering global positioning, the answer
      is YES.


      NO


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me correct this:


      The United States is EAST of the United Kingdom when going eastward across the
      Pacific, but WEST of the United Kingdom when going westward across the Atlantic.
      Since we typically measure global positions using the shortest distance or conventional
      map orientation, North Shore Music Theatre (in Massachusetts, USA) is indeed
      WEST of City Thameslink railway station (in London, UK).


      So the correct answer is: YES'

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations mentioned in the question.

      - Belvedere on the Pfingstberg is a palace/structure in Potsdam, Germany (near
      Berlin in the eastern part of Germany).

      - Tafila Wind Farm is located in Tafila, Jordan, which is in the Middle East.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a world map.

      - Germany is in Western Europe.

      - Jordan is in the Middle East.

      - On a world map, Germany is west of Jordan.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Since Potsdam (where the Belvedere is located) is in Germany, and Tafila Wind
      Farm is in Jordan, the Belvedere is west of the Tafila Wind Farm.


      NO.


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me correct this:


      The Belvedere on the Pfingstberg (in Germany) is located WEST of the Tafila
      Wind Farm (in Jordan), not east of it. Germany is west of Jordan on a world
      map.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both churches.

      - St Julian''s Church is in Norwich, which is a city in eastern England, UK.

      - Holy Trinity Church is in Warsaw, which is the capital city of Poland.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a map.

      - England is located in Western Europe.

      - Poland is located in Central/Eastern Europe.

      - Warsaw is significantly east of any point in England.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Norwich is in eastern England, but even the easternmost point of England is
      still west of Warsaw, Poland.

      - Therefore, St Julian''s Church in Norwich must be west of Holy Trinity Church
      in Warsaw.


      NO, St Julian''s Church in Norwich is NOT located west of Holy Trinity Church

      Since Sudbury Hill Harrow railway station is in the UK (Western Europe) and
      Naghlu Dam is in Afghanistan (Central/South Asia), the railway station is west
      of the dam.


      NO - Sudbury Hill Harrow railway station is not located west of Naghlu Dam.
      It is located east of Naghlu Dam.


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me reconsider the east-west orientation:


      The UK is in Western Europe, which is west of Afghanistan in Asia. Therefore,
      Sudbury Hill Harrow railway station (in London, UK) is west of Naghlu Dam (in
      Afghanistan).


      YES - Sudbury Hill Harrow railway station is located west of Naghlu Dam.'

      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of both places - Chaeng Watthana Government
      Complex and Shrine of St. Therese, Doctor of the Church.


      Step 2: Chaeng Watthana Government Complex is located in Bangkok, Thailand.


      Step 3: The Shrine of St. Therese, Doctor of the Church is located in Juneau,

      Step 5: When comparing global east-west positions, Thailand is significantly
      east of Alaska. The international date line runs through the Pacific Ocean,
      with North America to the east and Asia to the west when viewing a standard
      map.

      Step 1: Identify the location of Turnpike Lane tube station.

      Turnpike Lane is a London Underground station located in north London, UK.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Bobov Dol Power Plant.

      Bobov Dol Power Plant is located in Bulgaria, which is in southeastern Europe.

      there are multiple churches with this name in different locations. Without more
      specific information about which New Wine Church is being referenced (city,
      country, etc.), I cannot make a definitive comparison.

      Sheboygan Municipal Auditorium and Armory.


      Step 2: Victoria General Hospital is likely in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.


      Step 3: Sheboygan Municipal Auditorium and Armory would be in Sheboygan, Wisconsin,
      USA.


      Step 4: Victoria, BC is on the west coast of Canada, while Sheboygan, Wisconsin
      is in the midwestern United States, near Lake Michigan.

      while Sheboygan is much further east, closer to the middle of North America.


      NO.


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Victoria General Hospital is west of
      Sheboygan Municipal Auditorium and Armory, not east of it. Victoria, BC is on
      the west coast of North America, while Sheboygan, Wisconsin is further east
      in the midwest. So the correct answer is:

      of San Dimas Hotel and Barker Reservoir to answer this question.


      Step 1: Let me identify where San Dimas Hotel is located. San Dimas is a city
      in Los Angeles County, California. Any hotel in San Dimas would be located in
      this city.


      Step 2: Now I need to identify where Barker Reservoir is located. There is a
      Barker Reservoir in Colorado, near Boulder. There''s also a Barker Reservoir
      in Texas, near Houston.


      Step 3: Compare the locations:

      - San Dimas, California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Barker Reservoir in Colorado is in the Rocky Mountain region

      - Barker Reservoir in Texas is in the Gulf Coast region


      Step 4: In terms of east-west positioning:

      - California is west of Colorado

      - California is west of Texas


      Therefore, regardless of which Barker Reservoir we''re referring to (Colorado
      or Texas), San Dimas Hotel in California would be located west of it.


      NO


      Wait, I need to reconsider. I made an error in my reasoning. California is indeed
      west of both Colorado and Texas. So a hotel in San Dimas, California would be
      WEST of either Barker Reservoir.


      YES'

      country. California is west of Texas.


      Step 4: Therefore, if we''re referring to San Dimas in California and Barker
      Reservoir in Texas, then San Dimas (and any hotel there) would be located west
      of Barker Reservoir.


      NO.


      Wait, I need to correct myself. San Dimas, California is indeed west of Barker
      Reservoir in Texas. So a San Dimas Hotel would be west of Barker Reservoir.


      YES.'
