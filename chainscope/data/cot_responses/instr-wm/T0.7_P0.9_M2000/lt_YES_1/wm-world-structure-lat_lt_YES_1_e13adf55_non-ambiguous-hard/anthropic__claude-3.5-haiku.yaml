    f59edd61-9e6e-49af-93b9-f32b3dc30d73: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Santa Maria Antiqua is a church located in Rome, Italy.


      2. Sudbury Hill tube station is located in London, United Kingdom.


      3. Rome and London are in different countries, on different continents.


      4. More specifically, Rome is in southern Europe, while London is in northwestern
      Europe.


      5. Even if we just look at their geographical positions, Rome is significantly
      south of London.


      6. Therefore, Santa Maria Antiqua is definitely located south of Sudbury Hill
      tube station.


      The answer is: YES.'

      1. First, I''ll locate Lewis and Clark Lake:

      - This is a reservoir on the Missouri River, located in South Dakota, United
      States

      - It is situated in the northern part of the United States


      2. Next, I''ll locate the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Baldock:

      - Lewis and Clark Lake is significantly north of the church''s location

      - The church is located further south compared to the lake
