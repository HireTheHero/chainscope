      1. First, let''s locate Hudspeth County, TX:

      - Hudspeth County is located in far west Texas

      - It borders New Mexico and is part of the El Paso metropolitan area

      - It is very far west in the state of Texas


      2. Next, let''s locate Acadia Parish, LA:

      - Acadia Parish is located in southwestern Louisiana

      - It is in the southern part of the state, west of New Orleans but east of Texas


      3. Now, let''s compare their geographic positions:

      - Hudspeth County is much further west, essentially on the Texas-New Mexico
      border

      - Acadia Parish is in southwestern Louisiana

      - When comparing their longitude, Hudspeth County is significantly west of Acadia
      Parish


      4. Conclusion:

      Since Hudspeth County is located much further west than Acadia Parish, it is
      indeed west of Acadia Parish.
