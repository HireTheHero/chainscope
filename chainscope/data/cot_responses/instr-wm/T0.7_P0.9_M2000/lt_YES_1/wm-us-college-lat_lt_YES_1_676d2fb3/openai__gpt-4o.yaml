      Miami is located south of the Miami International University of Art & Design,
      we need to consider the geographic locations of both institutions.


      1. **University of Miami**: The University of Miami is located in Coral Gables,
      Florida. Coral Gables is a city that is part of the Miami metropolitan area,
      situated southwest of downtown Miami.


      2. **Miami International University of Art & Design**: This university is located
      in downtown Miami, which is to the northeast of Coral Gables.


      Based on these locations:


      - The University of Miami is in Coral Gables, which is southwest of downtown
      Miami.

      - Miami International University of Art & Design is in downtown Miami.


      Therefore, the University of Miami is indeed located south of the Miami International
      University of Art & Design.

      of Florida campus.


      2. **Use Mapping Tools**: Utilize mapping tools like Google Maps or the University
      of Florida campus map to pinpoint the exact positions of these two locations.


      3. **Determine Orientation**: Once both locations are identified on the map,
      determine their relative positions in terms of cardinal directions (north, south,
      east, west).


      4. **Compare Latitudes**: Compare the latitude coordinates of the two locations.
      The location with the smaller latitude number (closer to the equator) will be
      further south.


      Based on these steps, we can conclude:


      - The University of Florida Cancer and Genetics Research Complex is located
      at the north part of the campus.

      - The University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center is located at the southwest
      part of the campus.

    2a52ff1a-d72a-4a05-805b-b524dd0b9757: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of both the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences and the University
      of Georgia School of Public and International Affairs.


      1. **Identify the Institutions**: Both the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences
      and the University of Georgia School of Public and International Affairs are
      part of the University of Georgia, which is located in Athens, Georgia.


      2. **Determine Locations within the Campus**: The Franklin College of Arts and
      Sciences and the School of Public and International Affairs are both located
      on the University of Georgia''s main campus in Athens.


      3. **Compare Their Positions**: The Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is
      primarily housed in the Old Campus area, specifically around the vicinity of
      the historic North Campus. The School of Public and International Affairs is
      also located in the North Campus area, with its main offices in Candler Hall.


      Given that both institutions are located in close proximity on the North Campus,
      determining which is geographically south of the other requires specific knowledge
      of building locations and layouts. Typically, the Franklin College encompasses
      multiple departments spread across several buildings, while the School of Public
      and International Affairs is more centralized.


      4. **Conclusion**: Without specific latitude and longitude coordinates or a
      detailed campus map to compare, it is not feasible to definitively conclude
      that one is significantly south of the other within the campus context. However,
      generally speaking, both are in the same campus area, making it unlikely for
      one to be clearly south of the other in a significant way.

      NO'

      2. **Location of USC Rossier School of Education**: The USC Rossier School of
      Education is part of the University of Southern California, which is located
      in Los Angeles, CA. The university''s main campus is situated in South Los Angeles.


      3. **Determine relative position**: Once we have identified the specific location

      south of Q6156423.


      Without access to real-time databases like Wikidata, I can''t directly look
      up what Q6156423 corresponds to and its location. If you have access to Wikidata

      Once you have that information, compare the latitude of USC Rossier (Los Angeles)
      with the latitude of the location identified by Q6156423.


      Based on these steps, if USC Rossier''s latitude is less (further south) than
      the latitude of Q6156423, then the answer is "YES." If it is not, then the answer
