    faab35a5-3edc-49c4-b5b0-88a731e5269a: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of both Academy of Art University and Golden Gate University in
      California.


      1. **Identify the location of Academy of Art University**: Academy of Art University
      is located in San Francisco, California. Specifically, it has several locations
      within San Francisco, but its main address is often associated with the area
      around 79 New Montgomery Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.


      2. **Identify the location of Golden Gate University**: Golden Gate University
      is also located in San Francisco, California. Its main campus is situated at
      536 Mission Street, San Francisco, CA 94105, which is also within the city of
      San Francisco.


      3. **Determine the relative positions of the two universities**: Given that
      both universities are in San Francisco, we need to establish whether one is
      south of the other. San Francisco is a relatively compact city, and both universities
      are located in the downtown area. To determine if Academy of Art University
      is south of Golden Gate University, we can look at their addresses or their
      locations on a map.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Since both universities are in close proximity
      and within the same city, the difference in their locations might be subtle.
      However, given the addresses (79 New Montgomery Street for Academy of Art University
      and 536 Mission Street for Golden Gate University), we can see they are relatively
      close to each other, with Mission Street and New Montgomery Street being nearby
      in the downtown area of San Francisco.


      5. **Conclusion**: Without precise GPS coordinates or a detailed map, it might
      be challenging to definitively say one is directly south of the other, given
      the close proximity and the layout of San Francisco''s streets. However, considering
      typical street layouts and assuming a straightforward interpretation of "south,"
      if we had to make a general assessment based on the information provided and
      the usual meaning of "south" in a metropolitan context, we would likely need
      to consult a map or more precise location data for an accurate answer.


      Given the complexity and the need for precise location data, and considering
      the question requires a definitive YES or NO answer without providing or consulting
      a map for the exact locations, the most straightforward approach would be to
      acknowledge that both universities are in San Francisco and their relative positions
      (north-south) would depend on the specific addresses or locations within the
      city. However, for the purpose of this exercise and without further specific
      geographic detail, I will provide a simplified answer based on the assumption
      that precise location data would be necessary for an accurate determination.

      3. **Compare their locations relative to each other**: Since both universities
      are in San Francisco, we need to consider their specific locations within the
      city. Academy of Art University has several locations in San Francisco, but
      its main campus is in the South of Market area. Golden Gate University is located
      in the Financial District of San Francisco.


      4. **Determine if Academy of Art University is south of Golden Gate University**:
      The Financial District, where Golden Gate University is located, is generally
      north of the South of Market area, where Academy of Art University''s main campus
      is situated. However, San Francisco''s geography and the specific addresses
      of these universities need to be considered for precise location determination.


      Given the general areas:

      - The Financial District (Golden Gate University) is typically north.

      - The South of Market area (Academy of Art University) is south of the Financial
      District.


      Therefore, based on the general areas of San Francisco where these universities
      are located, Academy of Art University is indeed south of Golden Gate University.

      University, FL is located south of The University of Tampa, FL, let''s break
      down the process:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      universities. Schiller International University has a campus in Largo, Florida,
      and The University of Tampa is located in Tampa, Florida.


      2. **Understand Geographic Positions**: Next, we need to understand the geographic
      positions of these locations relative to each other. Tampa is a city located
      in Hillsborough County, near the west coast of Florida. Largo is a city in Pinellas
      County, also on the west coast of Florida but situated to the west of Tampa,
      near the Gulf of Mexico.


      3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: To determine if one is south of the
      other, we need to consider their latitudes. Generally, in the Northern Hemisphere,
      if a location is south of another, it has a lower latitude.


      4. **Compare Latitudes**: Without exact coordinates, we can still infer based
      on common geographic knowledge. Tampa and Largo are relatively close to each
      other, but Tampa is slightly inland and to the east, while Largo is on the coast
      to the west. However, in terms of north-south orientation, Largo is not significantly
      south of Tampa; they are more or less at the same latitude, with Largo being
      slightly to the west.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the close proximity and similar latitudes of Tampa
      and Largo, and considering that "south" implies a noticeable difference in latitude,
      Schiller International University in Largo, FL, is not significantly south of
      The University of Tampa, FL. They are more accurately described as being at
      a similar latitude but with Largo being to the west.

      1. **Identify the location of The University of Tampa**: The University of Tampa

      2. **Identify the location of Schiller International University**: Schiller

      University''s Florida location is in Largo, Florida, but it also has had a presence
      in Tampa. However, for the purpose of this comparison, let''s consider its main
      Florida location. Assuming the main or a significant location in Florida is
      what we are comparing, and knowing it has been associated with the Tampa area,
      let''s proceed with the understanding that it''s in or around Tampa.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Since both universities are associated with the
      Tampa area, to determine if one is south of the other, we would need their exact
      addresses or a detailed map. However, given the general information, if Schiller

      or a precise location for Schiller International University''s Florida campus,
      it''s challenging to definitively say if it''s south of The University of Tampa.
      However, considering the need for a YES or NO answer and assuming Schiller International
      University''s location in relation to The University of Tampa based on the city
      or area (Tampa/Largo), if we had to make an educated guess based on typical
      city layouts and assuming Schiller''s location might not significantly differ

      direction based on the assumption of proximity.


      Given the information and the requirement for a definitive YES or NO answer
      without precise location details for a direct comparison, the most straightforward
      approach is to consider the general area. Both institutions are associated with
      the Tampa area, which suggests their locations might not have a significant
      north-south disparity, especially if considering the city limits or metropolitan

      1. **Identify the location of Kent State University College of Podiatric Medicine**:
      This institution is located in Independence, Ohio, which is a suburb of Cleveland.
      Cleveland is in the northeastern part of Ohio.


      2. **Identify the location of Chancellor University**: Chancellor University
      was a private, for-profit university located in Cleveland, Ohio. It ceased operations
      in 2013, but for the purpose of this question, we consider its last known location,
      which was in Cleveland.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Both institutions are associated with the Cleveland
      area, with Kent State University College of Podiatric Medicine being in a suburb
      of Cleveland and Chancellor University being in Cleveland itself.


      4. **Determine if one is south of the other**: Given that both are essentially
      in the same metropolitan area, with one being directly in Cleveland and the
      other in a suburb of Cleveland, the distinction of being "south" becomes a matter
      of precise location within the metropolitan area rather than a broad geographical
      difference.


      However, without precise GPS coordinates or street addresses, we can generalize
      based on the fact that Independence, where the podiatric college is located,
      is southwest of downtown Cleveland, where Chancellor University was. But considering
      the metropolitan context, this does not necessarily mean it is "south" in a
      way that implies a significant geographical separation.

      1. **Identify the location of Kent State University College of Podiatric Medicine**:
      Kent State University is located in Kent, Ohio. The College of Podiatric Medicine,
      specifically, is situated in Independence, Ohio, which is a suburb of Cleveland.
      This places it in the northern part of Ohio.


      2. **Identify the location of Chancellor University**: Chancellor University
      was located in Cleveland, Ohio. However, it''s essential to note that Chancellor
      University ceased operations and closed in 2013. Despite its closure, for the
      sake of comparison, we consider its last known location, which was also in the
      northern part of Ohio, specifically in Cleveland.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Both institutions are in the northern part of
      Ohio, with Kent State University College of Podiatric Medicine being in Independence

      their close proximity and both being in the northern region of Ohio, the question
      of one being south of the other hinges on their exact locations within this
      northern context.


      Given the information and focusing strictly on geographical terms without considering
      the operational status of Chancellor University, since both are essentially
      in the same general area (northern Ohio, with a focus on the Cleveland area),
      the question becomes more about the precise latitude or the specific suburb
      rather than a broad north-south comparison across the state.


      However, since Chancellor University was in Cleveland and Kent State University
      College of Podiatric Medicine is in Independence, a suburb of Cleveland, and
      considering typical understandings of "south" in a broad geographical sense,
      we''re looking at a relatively localized comparison. Independence, being a suburb,
      does not significantly differ in latitude from Cleveland in a way that would
      categorically place one institution decidedly south of the other in a statewide
      context.


      Therefore, based on their locations within the same general area of northern
      Ohio, the answer to whether Kent State University College of Podiatric Medicine
      is located south of Chancellor University would be **NO**, as both are essentially

      not directly south. Cleveland is located on the shores of Lake Erie, and Independence
      is a bit inland and to the east, rather than south, of Cleveland''s city center.


      Based on these steps, considering the geographical locations and the fact that
      Chancellor University is no longer operational but was in Cleveland, the answer

      the locations of Francis Marion University in South Carolina (SC) and California
      Pacific School of Theology in California (CA), and then compare their geographical
      positions.


      1. **Identify the location of Francis Marion University, SC**: Francis Marion
      University is located in Florence, South Carolina. South Carolina is on the
      East Coast of the United States, which places it to the east of the country.


      2. **Identify the location of California Pacific School of Theology, CA**: California
      Pacific School of Theology is located in California. California is on the West
      Coast of the United States, which places it to the west of the country.


      3. **Compare geographical positions**: Since South Carolina (where Francis Marion
      University is located) is on the East Coast and California (where California
      Pacific School of Theology is located) is on the West Coast, we know that South
      Carolina is east of California.


      4. **Determine if Francis Marion University, SC is south of California Pacific
      School of Theology, CA**: Being "south" refers to a geographical position that
      is more towards the equator than another location. California and South Carolina
      both cover a range of latitudes, but California extends further north than South
      Carolina. However, the key point here is the general latitudinal position of

      latitudes of the two institutions rather than their east-west positions. South
      Carolina is generally southeast of California, which means it is both east and
      south of California. Therefore, Francis Marion University in South Carolina

      International University of Art & Design within the city of Miami.


      5. **Geographical Consideration**: Coral Gables, being southwest of Downtown
      Miami, generally places the University of Miami south of the central part of
      Miami. However, the exact location of Miami International University of Art

      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to identify the locations of McNeese
      State University and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

      2. **McNeese State University location**: McNeese State University is located
      in Lake Charles, Louisiana.

      3. **University of Louisiana at Lafayette location**: The University of Louisiana
      at Lafayette is located in Lafayette, Louisiana.

      4. **Compare locations**: To determine if McNeese State University is south
      of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, we need to compare their geographical
      positions.

      5. **Geographical positions**: Lafayette is generally considered to be in southern
      Louisiana, but so is Lake Charles. However, Lake Charles is slightly west and
      north of Lafayette.

      6. **Determine the relationship**: Given that Lake Charles (McNeese State University)
      is north and slightly west of Lafayette (University of Louisiana at Lafayette),
      we can conclude that McNeese State University is not south of the University
      of Louisiana at Lafayette.

    ec2abed8-cbce-4255-b0f3-9415d5cc10d5: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Robert Morris University Illinois (RMU) and La Salle Extension University (LSU)
      within Illinois.


      2. **Robert Morris University Illinois Location**: RMU is based in Chicago,
      Illinois. Specifically, its main campus is in the Chicago area.


      3. **La Salle Extension University Location**: La Salle Extension University,
      now known as Kenneth Shipp College (previously an extension of La Salle University
      in Philadelphia, but noting the name change and evolution over time), doesn''t
      directly exist under that name currently, which might indicate some confusion
      or error in the question. However, assuming we are referring to an institution
      related to or formerly known as La Salle in the context of Illinois, it would
      be essential to note that there isn''t a well-known, currently operational La
      Salle Extension University in Illinois. La Salle University itself is in Philadelphia,
      PA. For the sake of argument, if we were to consider any educational institution
      by a similar name or affiliation in Illinois, it would likely not be a well-defined
      location without more specific details.


      4. **Comparison**: Since La Salle Extension University doesn''t have a clear,
      operational presence in Illinois, and considering the evolution or potential
      closure of such an entity, directly comparing locations becomes challenging.
      However, if we assume the question refers to a hypothetical or former institution
      related to La Salle within Illinois, or if there was confusion with another
      institution, Robert Morris University''s location in Chicago would be the point
      of comparison.


      5. **Geographical Context**: Chicago, where Robert Morris University Illinois
      is located, is in the northeastern part of Illinois. If La Salle Extension University
      were hypothetically located in southern Illinois (which is not confirmed due
      to the lack of clear information about such an institution), then Robert Morris
      University Illinois would indeed be north of it. However, without a clear location
      for La Salle Extension University in Illinois, this step involves significant
      speculation.


      Given these considerations, the question''s premise seems flawed due to the
      uncertain status and location of La Salle Extension University in Illinois.
      However, if we were to make an educated guess based on the likely location of
      Robert Morris University Illinois being in the northern part of the state (Chicago
      area) and assuming La Salle Extension University would be further south (which
      is speculative), the answer could lean towards YES, but this is highly speculative
      and based on incomplete information.


      **Answer**: YES'

      \ University is no longer in operation, having ceased its activities. Despite\
      \ this, for the purpose of this question, we consider its historical location\
      \ in Chicago.\n\n4. **Compare Locations**: Since both institutions are based\
      \ in Chicago, Illinois, their locations are essentially in the same city. \n\
      \n5. **Determine if RMU is South of La Salle Extension University**: Without\
      \ specific addresses for both (and considering La Salle Extension University\

      \ of the other based solely on their shared city location. However, given that\

      \ we could potentially determine their relative positions. But since La Salle\
      \ Extension University is not operational and without precise locations, we\

      \ of geographical comparisons within a city, if one were to assume or find that\
      \ Robert Morris University Illinois is indeed located south of where La Salle\
      \ Extension University was, the answer would be YES. Without specific addresses\

      of Florida is located, does not have significant geographical features like
      mountains that would drastically affect the layout of the campus. Thus, the
      placement of buildings is more likely to be based on the university''s master
      plan rather than geographical constraints.


      5. **Research Complex Location**: The Cancer and Genetics Research Complex,
      being a research facility, might be located in an area of the campus dedicated
      to research or medical sciences. This could be in a different part of the campus
      from recreational facilities.


      6. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Without specific information
      on the exact locations of these facilities within the University of Florida
      campus, it''s difficult to definitively say whether the Cancer and Genetics
      Research Complex is located south of the Southwest Recreation Center. However,
      considering the name "Southwest Recreation Center," if the Research Complex
      is indeed in a part of the campus that is generally south of the recreational
      center''s southwest location, it could be possible.


      Given the steps above and the lack of precise location information, the most
      accurate answer would typically require a map or specific details about the
      campus layout. However, based on the naming convention and assuming a traditional
      grid-like campus layout, one might infer the Research Complex could potentially
      be south of the Southwest Recreation Center, but this is speculative without
      exact locations.

      \ Cancer and Genetics Research Complex is located south of the University of\
      \ Florida Southwest Recreation Center, let's break down the steps to understand\
      \ the relative locations:\n\n1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to\
      \ identify the locations of both the University of Florida Cancer and Genetics\
      \ Research Complex and the University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center.\
      \ The University of Florida (UF) is a large campus with various facilities and\
      \ research centers.\n\n2. **Understand Campus Layout**: The University of Florida's\
      \ campus is laid out with various buildings, centers, and facilities distributed\
      \ across its area in Gainesville, Florida. The specific locations of these facilities\
      \ can be found on the university's maps or through their official website.\n\
      \n3. **Specific Locations**:\n   - **University of Florida Cancer and Genetics\
      \ Research Complex**: This complex is likely part of the university's research\
      \ initiatives and could be located near or as part of the health science or\
      \ research areas of the campus.\n   - **University of Florida Southwest Recreation\
      \ Center**: This is one of the recreational facilities provided by the university\
      \ for students and staff, indicating it's located in a more central or accessible\
      \ area of the campus to facilitate easy use.\n\n4. **Relative Positions**: Without\
      \ exact addresses or a map, determining the exact relative positions requires\
      \ some guesswork based on typical university layouts. However, the name \"Southwest\"\
      \ in the recreation center's name suggests it is located in the southwest part\
      \ of the campus.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: If the recreation center is in the southwest\
      \ part of the campus, and assuming the research complex does not have a similarly\
      \ indicative name suggesting its location, we would need to know if the research\
      \ complex is generally considered to be south of the southwest area of the campus.\
      \ Since \"southwest\" already implies a southern and western position, for the\
      \ research complex to be south of it, it would need to be even further south\
      \ than the southwest corner of the campus.\n\nGiven these considerations and\
      \ without specific information on the exact locations of these facilities relative\
      \ to each other, I would have to rely on the assumption that the \"Southwest\"\
      \ Recreation Center is indeed in the southwest part of the campus, which typically\
      \ would be towards the southern part of the campus. Therefore, for something\
      \ to be south of it, it would need to be in an area that extends beyond the\
      \ typical southern boundary of the campus or in a specific area designated for\
      \ research that might not adhere to simple directional naming conventions.\n\
      \n**YES / NO Answer**: Without precise location data or a map to reference,\

      \ of reasoning and typical campus layouts, if we assume the Cancer and Genetics\
      \ Research Complex could be located in a health sciences or research area that\
      \ might not strictly follow the directional naming of facilities, it's possible\

      \ and the steps outlined, and considering the lack of specific directional information\
      \ for the research complex, a definitive answer without a map or more detailed\
      \ location information would be speculative. However, if forced to choose based\
      \ on the directional hint from the \"Southwest\" Recreation Center and assuming\

      both the University of Florida Cancer and Genetics Research Complex and the
      University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center. However, without specific
      addresses or a map, we must rely on general knowledge about the University of
      Florida''s campus layout.


      2. **Understand Campus Layout**: The University of Florida is a large campus
      with various buildings and facilities spread out. The Cancer and Genetics Research
      Complex and the Southwest Recreation Center are two of its many facilities.


      3. **Research Complex Location**: The Cancer and Genetics Research Complex is
      likely to be part of the university''s health science or research area. Many
      universities group similar facilities together for convenience and collaboration.


      4. **Recreation Center Location**: The Southwest Recreation Center, as the name

      students living in or near that area.


      5. **Comparing Locations**: Without exact addresses, we can make an educated
      guess based on the names. If the Recreation Center is in the southwest, it implies
      the campus has a defined layout with areas designated for specific purposes.
      The Research Complex''s location relative to the Recreation Center would depend

      location details and relying solely on the names and typical campus layouts,
      it''s challenging to definitively say one is south of the other without a map
      or more detailed information about the University of Florida''s campus.


      However, considering typical naming conventions and the fact that "Southwest"

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the University of Florida Cancer and Genetics Research Complex and the University
      of Florida Southwest Recreation Center. The University of Florida has a large
      campus, and facilities can be spread out.


      2. **Campus Map or Directory**: Typically, the best way to find the exact locations
      of buildings on a university campus is by consulting the university''s campus
      map or directory. This would provide the exact locations, including the building
      names and their respective addresses or coordinates on the campus map.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Once we have the locations, we can determine their
      relative positions to each other. Since we''re interested in whether one is
      south of the other, we need to understand the layout of the campus and the directionality
      (north, south, east, west) of the buildings'' locations.


      4. **Southward Direction**: To say one location is south of another, it must
      be positioned in a more southerly direction on the map. This requires a basic
      understanding of cardinal directions and how they apply to the campus layout.


      Without access to real-time or the most current maps of the University of Florida''s
      campus, it''s challenging to provide a definitive answer based solely on the
      information given. However, we can attempt a logical approach based on typical
      university campus layouts and the names of the facilities:


      - The University of Florida Cancer and Genetics Research Complex is likely part
      of the university''s research or medical facilities.

      - The University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center, as the name suggests,
      is located in the southwest part of the campus.


      Given these points, if the Recreation Center is in the southwest, it implies
      that it is already somewhat south and west on the campus. Without exact locations,
      it''s difficult to say with certainty whether the Cancer and Genetics Research
      Complex is specifically south of it. However, if the Research Complex is also
      in a southern part of the campus but not necessarily southwest, it could potentially
      be south of the Recreation Center, depending on their exact locations.


      **Conclusion**: Without specific coordinates or a detailed campus map to reference,
      the most accurate answer I can provide based on the information and logical
      deduction would be speculative. However, considering the general nature of the
      question and typical campus layouts, I would lean towards a speculative "YES"
      based on the possibility that research facilities could be concentrated in areas
      that might be south of recreational facilities, but this is highly speculative
      without exact locations.

      consult a map of the University of Florida campus. However, without access to
      a real-time map in this response, we can consider general knowledge about the
      campus layout.


      3. **Facility Purposes**: The Cancer and Genetics Research Complex is likely
      to be part of the university''s research or medical facilities, which could
      be located in a specific area of the campus dedicated to such activities. The
      Southwest Recreation Center, as the name suggests, is a recreational facility,
      likely positioned to serve students living in or near the southwest part of
      the campus.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Without specific details on their exact locations,
      we must consider the naming convention. "Southwest" in the recreation center''s
      name might imply it is located in the southwestern part of the campus. The research
      complex''s location is less clear from its name alone.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of specific geographic information or a detailed
      campus map, we can''t definitively conclude the relative positions of these
      two facilities based solely on their names and presumed functions. However,
      for the purpose of this exercise and considering typical campus layouts, if
      we had to make an educated guess based on the "Southwest" indicator for the

      1. **Goldman School of Public Policy Location**: The Goldman School of Public
      Policy is located at the University of California, Berkeley. Berkeley, California
      is situated in the northern part of the San Francisco Bay Area.

      The University of California, Berkeley, where the Goldman School of Public Policy
      is housed, is generally spread out, but its main campus is north of the downtown
      Berkeley area. The Graduate Theological Union is located near the northwestern
      part of the campus, closer to the Berkeley Hills.

      campus, it''s plausible they could be relatively close, potentially with one
      being slightly south of the other depending on their exact locations within
      the area.


      But given the general information and without specific street addresses or a
      map, I would have to make an educated guess based on typical campus layouts
      and the fact that both are in Berkeley, suggesting they are not significantly
      far apart in terms of cardinal directions like north and south.

    9db07451-58ca-4356-bb37-5c4c5be3e80c: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of both the Detroit Windsor Dance Academy in Michigan (MI) and
      the Center for International Development at Harvard University in Massachusetts
      (MA), and then compare their geographical positions.


      1. **Location of Detroit Windsor Dance Academy, MI**: Detroit, Michigan is located
      in the southeastern part of the state, near the border with Canada, specifically
      near Windsor, Ontario. This places it in the northern United States.


      2. **Location of Center for International Development at Harvard University,
      MA**: Harvard University is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is in
      the northeastern United States. Massachusetts is north of Michigan.


      Given these locations:

      - Detroit, Michigan is south of Cambridge, Massachusetts.


      Therefore, considering their geographical positions:

      - The Detroit Windsor Dance Academy in Michigan is indeed **south** of the Center
      for International Development at Harvard University in Massachusetts.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: Temple University is located in Philadelphia,
      Pennsylvania. The Boyer College of Music and Dance is also located in Philadelphia,
      Pennsylvania, and it is a part of Temple University.


      2. **Determine Relative Positions**: Since both institutions are part of Temple
      University and located in the same city, the critical piece of information is
      whether they share the same campus or if there''s a notable distance between
      them that could be considered "south."


      3. **Campus Layout and Geography**: Given that Boyer College of Music and Dance
      is a college within Temple University, it''s reasonable to infer that it is
      situated on or very near the main Temple University campus in Philadelphia.
      The question of being "south" then becomes more about the specific buildings
      or areas within the campus rather than separate geographic locations.


      4. **Conclusion Based on Shared Location**: Since Temple University encompasses
      the Boyer College of Music and Dance, and assuming the question aims to understand
      if the entirety of Temple University is south of the Boyer College (which is
      itself a part of Temple), the question might seem to be based on a misunderstanding
      of the relationship between the two. However, if we consider the intent might
      be to ask if Temple University''s main campus (where Boyer College resides)
      is located south of some other reference point for Boyer College, it''s still
      a matter of interpreting the geography within the campus or the immediate area.


      Given the above analysis and understanding that Boyer College of Music and Dance
      is part of Temple University and located on its campus, the question seems to
      be based on a premise that might not fully account for their integrated nature.
      Therefore, without additional context suggesting otherwise, the most straightforward
      interpretation leads to a conclusion that doesn''t necessarily fit the YES/NO
      format due to the ambiguous nature of "south" in this context. However, for

      2. **Understanding the relationship**: Since the Boyer College of Music and
      Dance is a part of Temple University, they are essentially located in the same
      area, with the Boyer College being a constituent college of Temple University.


      3. **Determining the direction**: Given that both entities are part of the same
      university, the question of one being "south" of the other doesn''t apply in
      the conventional sense used for separate entities. However, since they are in
      the same location (Temple University''s campus), we can consider the question
      as trying to determine if Temple University''s main campus area is south of
      the specific location where the Boyer College of Music and Dance is situated
      within or around the campus.

      these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) and Illinois College of Optometry (ICO).


      2. **Illinois Institute of Technology Location**: IIT is located in Chicago,
      Illinois. Specifically, its main campus is situated in the Bronzeville neighborhood,
      which is in the southern part of Chicago.


      3. **Illinois College of Optometry Location**: ICO is also located in Chicago,
      Illinois. It is situated on the South Side of Chicago, near the intersection
      of Interstate 90/94 and 31st Street.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Since both institutions are in Chicago, we need to
      compare their specific locations within the city. Chicago is laid out in a grid
      system with the intersection of State and Madison Streets considered the origin
      (0,0). Addresses increase as you move north, south, east, or west from this
      point.


      5. **Determine if IIT is South of ICO**: Given that both are on the South Side,

      Based on the reasoning above, the answer to whether Illinois Institute of Technology,
      IL is located south of Illinois College of Optometry, IL is: **YES**.'
    8cfcf132-ee44-4c66-b6c7-27374b0486f4: 'To determine if Illinois Institute of Technology
      (IIT) is located south of Illinois College of Optometry (ICO), let''s break
      down the steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      institutions. Illinois Institute of Technology is located in Chicago, Illinois.
      Illinois College of Optometry is also located in Chicago, Illinois.


      2. **Specific Addresses**: To better understand their relative positions, we
      should look at their specific addresses. Illinois Institute of Technology''s
      main campus is at 3300 South Federal Street, Chicago, IL 60616. Illinois College
      of Optometry is located at 3241 South Indiana Avenue, Chicago, IL 60616.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Now, we compare their locations. Both institutions
      are in the same city (Chicago) and even share the same zip code (60616), indicating
      they are relatively close to each other.


      4. **Determine North-South Orientation**: To determine if IIT is south of ICO,
      we need to understand the orientation of their locations. Since both addresses
      are on the south side of Chicago (as indicated by "South" in their street names),
      we need to look at the actual street numbers or the geographical coordinates
      to determine their relative north-south positions.


      5. **Analyzing Street Numbers**: Looking at the addresses, IIT is on South Federal
      Street, and ICO is on South Indiana Avenue. Both streets run north-south, and
      their proximity can be gauged by their intersection with East-West running streets
      or by their actual latitude if available.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given the close proximity and without exact geographical
      coordinates or a detailed map, one might initially think it''s challenging to
      determine their relative positions solely based on addresses. However, considering
      typical urban grid patterns, if two locations share similar street prefixes
      (in this case, "South") and are in close proximity, their north-south relationship
      can often be discerned by their street numbers or the streets they''re on, assuming
      a standard grid pattern.


      Given the addresses:

      - IIT: 3300 South Federal Street

      - ICO: 3241 South Indiana Avenue


      Both are on the south side, but to determine if one is south of the other, we
      look at the streets. Federal Street and Indiana Avenue are close to each other
      in Chicago''s grid, with Federal being slightly east of Indiana. The numbers
      (3300 for IIT and 3241 for ICO) suggest that IIT is actually south of ICO because
      it has a higher street number, indicating it is further south in Chicago''s
      grid system, which generally increases as you move south.


      Therefore, based on the addresses and typical grid patterns, the answer is:
      **YES**'

      of Optometry (ICO) in relation to each other, specifically in terms of their
      geographic positions within Illinois.


      1. **Identify the location of Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT):** IIT
      is located in Chicago, Illinois. Specifically, its main campus is situated in
      the Bronzeville neighborhood, which is on the South Side of Chicago.


      2. **Identify the location of Illinois College of Optometry (ICO):** ICO is
      also located in Chicago, Illinois. It is situated in the Near West Side of Chicago,
      which is closer to the downtown area compared to IIT.


      3. **Compare their locations in terms of north-south positioning within Chicago:**
      Since both institutions are in Chicago, we need to determine their relative
      positions. The South Side, where IIT is located, is generally south of the downtown
      area and the Near West Side, where ICO is located.


      Based on this analysis, IIT is indeed located south of ICO within the city of

      \ institutions like Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, Morehouse School\
      \ of Medicine, and Spelman College. Given its name and the presence of these\

      \n3. **Determining Locations**:\n   - Atlanta University Center is in Atlanta,\
      \ GA.\n   - Without the exact location of Laurus Technical Institute, we can't\
      \ directly compare. However, given that the question asks if Atlanta University\
      \ Center is south of Laurus Technical Institute, we can infer that if Laurus\
      \ Technical Institute is also in or around Atlanta, or anywhere north of Atlanta,\
      \ the answer could be yes. If Laurus Technical Institute is significantly south\
      \ of Atlanta, then the answer would be no.\n\n4. **Assumption for the Sake of\
      \ Argument**: Assuming Laurus Technical Institute is located in a way that makes\
      \ this question meaningful (i.e., not ridiculously far south or in a location\
      \ that would make the question nonsensical), we can proceed with the assumption\
      \ that both institutions are within the state of Georgia, with Atlanta University\
      \ Center being in the city of Atlanta.\n\nGiven these steps and without the\

      \ Technical Institute but understanding that Atlanta University Center is in\
      \ Atlanta, GA, the question's intent seems to be about relative positioning\

      of both universities. Antioch University has a campus in Santa Barbara, California.
      Fielding Graduate University is also located in Santa Barbara, California.


      2. **Compare the locations**: Since both universities are in Santa Barbara,
      California, their locations are very close to each other. However, to determine
      if one is south of the other, we need more specific location data, such as their

      be relatively close, potentially even in the same general area of the city.
      However, the question of whether one is south of the other requires more precise
      geographical data than is provided here.


      For the purpose of this exercise and without access to real-time or specific
      location data (like exact street addresses or GPS coordinates) that could provide
      a definitive answer, we must consider the general principle of geographical
      comparison.


      Given that both universities are in Santa Barbara and without specific details
      on their exact locations within the city, it''s not possible to definitively
      conclude their relative north-south positioning based solely on the information
      provided. However, since the question demands a YES or NO answer and considering
      that both are in the same city, implying a close proximity, the likelihood of
      one being significantly south of the other might be low, but it''s not a guarantee
      without more specific information.


      Therefore, based on the steps of reasoning and acknowledging the lack of detailed
      geographical data, the most straightforward answer, considering the constraint
      of the question, would lean towards a simplification due to the proximity implied
      by both being in Santa Barbara. But, recognizing the need for precision in such
      comparisons, the answer would reflect the understanding that without specific
      location details, a definitive YES or NO might not fully capture the nuance
      of their relative positions.


      **Answer: NO**'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Antioch University Santa Barbara and Fielding Graduate University. Antioch University
      Santa Barbara is located in Santa Barbara, California. Fielding Graduate University
      is also located in Santa Barbara, California.


      2. **Compare the locations**: Since both universities are in the same city,
      Santa Barbara, we need to determine their relative positions within the city
      to decide if one is south of the other.


      3. **Specific addresses and geography**: Without specific addresses, we can
      consider the general layout of Santa Barbara. However, given that both institutions
      are in the same city and without more detailed information about their exact
      locations within Santa Barbara, it''s challenging to definitively say one is
      south of the other based solely on the city name.


      4. **Conclusion based on available data**: Given the information available and
      the fact that both universities are located in Santa Barbara, CA, without exact
      addresses or a detailed map, the most accurate answer would typically depend
      on the specific locations within the city. However, considering typical inquiries
      and the nature of this question, it seems to imply a need for a geographical
      comparison that might not require such precise detail, suggesting an expectation
      of a general knowledge answer.


      Given the above steps and considering the implications of the question, the
      answer to whether Antioch University Santa Barbara is located south of Fielding
      Graduate University, without specific addresses but knowing both are in Santa
      Barbara, would generally be challenging to determine without more precise location
      data. However, for the purpose of this exercise and considering we are to provide

      \ Panhandle being distinct due to its location adjacent to Maryland and Virginia,\
      \ and its separation from the rest of the state by the Appalachian Mountains.\n\
      \n4. **Specific Geographic Relationship**:\n   - Vienna, WV (OVU), is generally\
      \ northwest of Charles Town, WV (AMU), considering the layout of West Virginia.\
      \ The Eastern Panhandle, where Charles Town is located, extends eastward, bordering\
      \ Maryland and Virginia, and is not typically considered \"south\" of the central\
      \ or western parts of the state in a direct geographic sense.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n\
      \   - Given the geography, Charles Town (AMU) is actually east or southeast\
      \ of Vienna (OVU), rather than directly south. However, when considering the\
      \ general direction in the context of the entire state, AMU could be considered\
      \ somewhat south or more accurately southeast of OVU, depending on the specific\
      \ interpretation of \"south\" in this geographic context.\n\nGiven these considerations,\
      \ and understanding that \"south\" can be somewhat subjective depending on the\
      \ scale and context of the map, the most accurate interpretation based on standard\
      \ geographic understanding would be:\n\nYES"

    b4b85df7-857d-4736-8f3b-a7c4813661ac: 'To solve this, let''s break it down step
      by step:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of American
      Military University (AMU) and Ohio Valley University (OVU) in West Virginia
      (WV).


      2. **American Military University Location**: American Military University is
      located in Charles Town, West Virginia. Charles Town is in the eastern part
      of West Virginia.


      3. **Ohio Valley University Location**: Ohio Valley University is located in
      Vienna, West Virginia. Vienna is in the central part of West Virginia, near
      the Ohio River.


      4. **Compare Locations**: To determine if AMU is south of OVU, we need to compare
      their geographical positions. Given that both universities are in West Virginia,
      we''ll look at their relative positions within the state.


      5. **Geographical Orientation**: Generally, in the United States, "south" refers
      to a direction towards the southern part of a region or state. West Virginia''s
      geography is such that the Ohio River forms its western and northern borders
      with Ohio.


      6. **Specific Locations**: Charles Town, where AMU is located, is in the eastern
      panhandle of West Virginia. Vienna, where OVU is located, is more central but
      still considered to be in the northern part of the state due to its proximity
      to the Ohio River.


      7. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical layout of West Virginia and the specific
      locations of these universities, AMU in Charles Town is actually more to the
      east and slightly south of OVU in Vienna, considering the state''s unique shape
      and the orientation of its regions.


      Therefore, based on this step-by-step analysis, the answer to whether American
      Military University, WV is located south of Ohio Valley University, WV is: **YES**.'

      of the colleges within the university, focusing on liberal arts education.


      2. **Location of Texas A&M University**: Texas A&M University is located in

      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to understand that Texas A&M College
      of Liberal Arts and Texas A&M University are not two separate institutions in
      different locations. Texas A&M University is the main institution, and the College
      of Liberal Arts is one of its colleges. This means they are essentially located

      2. **Understand the Geography**: Since both entities are part of the same university,
      the question of one being south of the other doesn''t apply in the context of
      separate geographical locations. However, to fully address the question, we
      must consider if there''s any nuance in how buildings or colleges within a university
      might be arranged.


      3. **Consider Campus Layout**: While a university''s campus can be quite large

      A&M University and not a separate entity that could be located in a different
      area, the premise of the question seems to be flawed or based on a misunderstanding
      of how university structures work.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Texas A&M College of Liberal Arts, TX is located
      south of Texas A&M University, TX, considering the intended meaning of separate
      locations, would be **NO**.'

      down into steps:


      1. **Understanding the Question**: We need to determine if the Texas A&M College
      of Liberal Arts is located south of Texas A&M University. Both institutions
      are in Texas, but the question implies a comparison of their geographical locations.


      2. **Identifying Locations**: Texas A&M University is located in College Station,
      Texas. The College of Liberal Arts is a part of Texas A&M University, meaning
      it is also in College Station, Texas.


      3. **Comparing Locations**: Since both Texas A&M University and its College
      of Liberal Arts are in the same location (College Station, Texas), there''s
      no north-south distinction to be made between them. They are essentially in
      the same place, with the College of Liberal Arts being a constituent college
      of the university.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that the College of Liberal Arts is part of Texas A&M
      University and not a separate entity located elsewhere, it cannot be said to
      be located south (or north) of the university. They share the same location.

      1. **Identify the locations**: The first step is to understand the locations
      involved. Hartford International University for Religion and Peace is located
      in Connecticut (CT), and Saint Paul School is in Rhode Island (RI).


      2. **Determine the geographical relationship**: Next, we need to determine the
      geographical relationship between Connecticut and Rhode Island. Both are states
      in the northeastern United States.


      3. **Specific locations within states**: Hartford, CT, is relatively north within
      Connecticut, and Rhode Island is southeast of Connecticut. However, to answer
      the question accurately, we need to consider the specific locations of Hartford
      International University for Religion and Peace and Saint Paul School.


      4. **Saint Paul School, RI**: Without the specific address of Saint Paul School
      in Rhode Island, we can still consider the general geography. Rhode Island is
      southeast of Connecticut, but since it''s a small state, the difference in latitude
      (north-south position) between locations in CT and RI might not be dramatic.


      5. **Hartford, CT, vs. Rhode Island**: Generally, Hartford, CT, is north of
      most of Rhode Island. However, the question is about being "south" of a specific
      location in Rhode Island, not Rhode Island as a whole.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given that Hartford, CT, is generally north of Rhode Island,
      for Hartford International University for Religion and Peace to be south of
      a location in Rhode Island, that location would need to be significantly north
      within Rhode Island or very close to the Connecticut border. Without exact coordinates
      or addresses, we rely on general geographical knowledge. Hartford, CT, is not
      typically considered south of most locations in Rhode Island due to its more
      northern position.


      However, considering the question asks about a specific school in Rhode Island
      and without knowing its exact location, we must remember that "south" is relative
      to the position of Saint Paul School in Rhode Island. If Saint Paul School is
      located in the northern part of Rhode Island, it''s conceivable that Hartford,
      CT, could be south of it, given the close proximity of the two states and the
      potential overlap in their latitudes.

      and the College of Arts and Sciences are part of EMU.


      2. **Location Consideration**: The question asks if the College of Education
      is located south of the College of Arts and Sciences. This implies we need to
      know the relative locations of these two colleges within the EMU campus or their
      respective buildings.


      3. **University Campus Layout**: Typically, universities have their colleges
      and departments spread across the campus, often with specific buildings or areas
      designated for each college. The layout can vary, with some colleges being closer
      together or farther apart, depending on the campus''s geography and historical
      development.


      4. **Assumption of Proximity**: Given that both colleges are part of the same
      university, it''s reasonable to assume that they are relatively close to each
      other, possibly even within walking distance, as is common in many university
      settings.


      5. **Specific Locations**: Without specific information on the exact locations
      of the College of Education and the College of Arts and Sciences within Eastern
      Michigan University, we can''t definitively say which one is south of the other

      be answered with the information provided (as it doesn''t specify the exact
      locations or relative positions of these colleges within the university), a
      definitive answer would typically require consulting a map of the EMU campus
      or contacting the university directly for more detailed information.


      However, given the nature of the question and the expectation for a YES or NO
      answer without additional research or context, and considering that colleges
      within a university are often not separated by large distances or distinct directional
      placements (north, south, etc.) in a way that would make one consistently south

    5f266924-5de7-4f90-90f8-3e70c31b90b4: 'To determine if Eastern Michigan University
      College of Education, MI is located south of Eastern Michigan University College
      of Arts and Sciences, MI, we need to consider the following steps:


      1. **Understanding the Institutions**: Both the College of Education and the
      College of Arts and Sciences are part of Eastern Michigan University (EMU).
      EMU is a public university located in Ypsilanti, Michigan.


      2. **Campus Structure**: Typically, colleges within a university are not separate
      entities with distinct geographical locations but are rather departments or
      schools that offer various majors and programs. They often share the same campus
      or are located very close to each other.


      3. **Location Consideration**: Given that both colleges are part of Eastern
      Michigan University and likely located on the same campus or in very close proximity,
      the concept of one being "south" of the other would depend on the specific buildings
      or areas where these colleges are housed within the university.


      4. **Same University, Same Location**: Unless specifically stated otherwise,
      it''s reasonable to assume that different colleges within the same university,
      such as EMU, do not have significantly different geographical locations, especially
      when considering the scale of a university campus.


      Based on these considerations, without specific information indicating that
      the College of Education and the College of Arts and Sciences are located in
      different parts of Ypsilanti or in separate buildings with a notable distance
      between them, it''s logical to conclude that they are essentially in the same
      location, as they are both part of Eastern Michigan University.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Eastern Michigan University College of Education,
      MI is located south of Eastern Michigan University College of Arts and Sciences,
      MI is: **NO**.'

    7111cb59-1168-445f-a2f4-d08038dba700: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps of reasoning needed:


      1. **Understanding the Question**: We''re comparing the locations of two colleges
      within Eastern Michigan University (EMU) - the College of Education and the
      College of Arts and Sciences. Both are located in Michigan (MI).


      2. **Identifying Locations**: Since both colleges are part of Eastern Michigan
      University, we first need to establish if they are located on the same campus
      or if they have separate locations. Typically, colleges within a university
      are located on the same campus or very close to each other.


      3. **Eastern Michigan University Campus**: Knowing that Eastern Michigan University
      has a main campus in Ypsilanti, Michigan, it''s logical to assume that both
      the College of Education and the College of Arts and Sciences are located on
      this campus, given that they are both part of EMU.


      4. **Same Campus Implication**: If both colleges are on the same campus, the
      question of one being "south" of the other becomes less about geographic location
      in terms of north-south orientation and more about their relative positions
      within the campus. However, without specific building locations or a campus
      map, determining their exact positions relative to each other (north, south,
      east, west) can be challenging.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Given that both colleges are
      part of Eastern Michigan University and likely located on the same campus, without
      specific information on the layout of the campus or the exact locations of these
      colleges, we must consider the typical structure of university campuses. However,
      the question seems to imply a distinction that might not be relevant or might
      be based on an assumption that these colleges have distinct, separate locations
      that can be compared in terms of cardinal directions.


      6. **Final Consideration**: Since we''re asked for a yes or no answer without
      access to a campus map or more detailed information about the specific locations
      of these colleges within the university, and considering that universities often
      have interconnected buildings and facilities, the question may be based on an
      oversimplification of campus geography.


      Given these considerations and the information provided, the most straightforward
      answer, without additional context or a campus map, would lean towards the fact
      that both colleges are likely part of the same campus and thus not distinctly
      located in a north-south manner that would make one definitively south of the
      other in a way that''s meaningful for separate institutions or locations. Therefore,
      the answer would be "NO", they are not distinctly located south of each other
      in the context implied by the question, as they are part of the same university
      campus.

      2. **Ouachita Baptist University Location**: Ouachita Baptist University is
      located in Arkadelphia, Arkansas.


      3. **Henderson State University Location**: Henderson State University is also
      located in Arkadelphia, Arkansas.


      4. **Comparison**: Since both universities are in the same city, Arkadelphia,
      their locations are essentially the same in terms of being north or south of
      each other within the state. However, for the sake of precision in answering
      the question, we must consider if there''s any notable difference in their exact
      locations within Arkadelphia that could be considered "south."


      5. **Determining "South"**: Without exact GPS coordinates or a detailed map,
      we can''t determine a precise difference in their locations that would classify
      one as definitively south of the other within the same city limits. However,
      given that they are in the same city, the difference, if any, would likely be
      minimal and not significant enough to definitively say one is south of the other
      in a broader geographical context.


      Given these steps, the answer to whether Ouachita Baptist University is located
      south of Henderson State University is essentially based on the fact that they
      are in the same city, making the question somewhat moot. However, without precise
      location data, the most straightforward interpretation based on shared city
      location would lean towards "NO" because they are not distinctly separate in

      designation would be highly dependent on the exact address or campus layout.
      However, for the purpose of this question and considering typical interpretations
      of "south" in geographic terms, if both universities are essentially in the
      same area, the distinction might not be significant enough to definitively say
      one is south of the other without more specific information.


      Given these steps and the fact that both universities are located in Arkadelphia,
      Arkansas, the question seems to hinge on a very localized understanding of "south."
      Without more detailed information about their exact locations within Arkadelphia,
      the most straightforward answer based on the information provided would lean
      towards acknowledging their proximity rather than a clear directional relationship.

      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know the locations of both
      Ouachita Baptist University (OBU) and Henderson State University (HSU) in Arkansas.


      2. **Ouachita Baptist University Location**: OBU is located in Arkadelphia,
      Arkansas.


      3. **Henderson State University Location**: HSU is also located in Arkadelphia,
      Arkansas.


      4. **Comparison**: Since both universities are in the same city, we need to
      determine their relative positions to decide if one is south of the other.


      5. **Relative Positions**: Given that they are in the same city and likely close
      to each other, the specific addresses or the layout of the city would determine
      their relative north-south orientation. However, without exact addresses or
      a map, we can infer based on typical university layouts and the fact that they
      share a city, the difference in their locations would be minimal and likely
      not significantly north-south oriented but rather in close proximity.


      6. **Conclusion**: Without specific geographical coordinates or a detailed map
      showing their exact locations within Arkadelphia, it''s challenging to definitively
      say one is directly south of the other. However, considering the context of
      the question and the need for a YES/NO answer, if we assume the question implies
      a notable difference in their north-south positioning within the city, we must
      rely on the general knowledge that both institutions are essentially in the
      same location, Arkadelphia.


      Given this analysis and the requirement for a yes/no answer without access to
      detailed maps or coordinates at this moment, the most straightforward approach
      to answering the question based on the steps provided would be to consider the
      intent of the question. Since both universities are in Arkadelphia, for the
      purpose of this question and without further detailed geographic information,
      we might lean towards a simplification that doesn''t account for the nuanced,
      exact positioning within the city.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Ouachita Baptist University, AR is located
      south of Henderson State University, AR, given they are in the same city and

      But, to give a precise YES or NO answer based on typical geographical knowledge
      and assuming the question implies a comparison of their main campuses:


      - If Ouachita Baptist University is literally south of Henderson State University

      - If it''s not, or if their locations are essentially the same or too close
      to definitively say one is south of the other without more specific information,
      the answer would lean towards NO, considering the context of the question seems
      to imply a noticeable geographical difference which might not be applicable
      within the same city limits.


      Given these considerations and without specific details on their exact locations
      within Arkadelphia, one might be inclined to say NO due to the lack of significant
      geographical difference typically implied by such a question. However, this

      1. **Identify the locations**: Portland State University (PSU) is located in
      Portland, Oregon. Pacific University has multiple campuses, but the Health Professions
      Campus is specifically located in Hillsboro, Oregon.


      2. **Understand the geography**: Portland and Hillsboro are both part of the
      Portland metropolitan area. Hillsboro is west of Portland.


      3. **Determine the directional relationship**: Since Hillsboro (where Pacific
      University Health Professions Campus is located) is west of Portland (where
      PSU is located), and not south, we need to consider if "south" applies in any
      way. Given the primary directions, we''re comparing a western location (Hillsboro)
      to a location that would be considered more easterly in this context (Portland).


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the locations, Portland State University is not
      south of Pacific University''s Health Professions Campus. It''s more to the
      east, considering the general directions of these cities in relation to each
      other.

      \ in a broader geographical context within the state of Virginia, both Fairfax\
      \ and Annandale are in the northern part of the state.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\
      \ Given that both universities are in the northern part of Virginia and considering\
      \ the specific question of whether George Mason University is located south\
      \ of the University of Northern Virginia, we need to look at their relative\
      \ positions. Since Annandale (UNV's location) is slightly southwest of Fairfax\
      \ (GMU's location), and considering the question's framing, the answer leans\
      \ towards GMU being slightly south or more accurately southwest of UNV, but\
      \ in the context of Virginia's geography and the question's simplicity, the\
      \ distinction might not be critical. However, strictly speaking, if we consider\
      \ \"south\" as the direction, GMU is not directly south but rather slightly\
      \ southwest of UNV's former location.\n\nGiven these considerations, the answer\
      \ to whether George Mason University is located south of the University of Northern\
      \ Virginia would be more towards a YES due to the southwest direction being\
      \ somewhat south, though it's a simplification of the actual geographical relationship.\n\

      \ in Virginia is located south of the University of Northern Virginia in Virginia,\
      \ we need to establish the locations of both institutions.\n\n1. **Location\
      \ of George Mason University**: George Mason University is located in Fairfax,\
      \ Virginia. Fairfax is situated in the northern part of the state, near Washington,\
      \ D.C.\n\n2. **Location of University of Northern Virginia**: The University\
      \ of Northern Virginia (UNVA) was a private university located in Annandale,\
      \ Virginia. Annandale is also in the northern part of Virginia, not far from\

      \ both universities are in the northern part of Virginia and relatively close\
      \ to each other, the question of one being south of the other depends on their\
      \ exact locations. However, given that \"Northern\" is part of the University\
      \ of Northern Virginia's name, it suggests that it is located in the northern\
      \ part of the state, possibly implying it could be as far north or even slightly\
      \ north of George Mason University, depending on the specific locations within\
      \ their respective areas.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Without precise geographic coordinates\
      \ or a detailed map, one might infer based on names and general locations that\
      \ George Mason University could potentially be south of the University of Northern\
      \ Virginia, given the latter's name suggesting a northern location. However,\
      \ considering both are in the northern part of Virginia and relatively close,\
      \ the difference in their locations might be minimal. The key factor here is\
      \ the name \"Northern\" in the University of Northern Virginia, which could\
      \ imply it is situated in a more northern position than George Mason University.\n\

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to know the locations of both
      Harrisburg University of Science and Technology (HUST) and the University of
      Pittsburgh at Johnstown (UPJ).


      2. **Harrisburg University Location**: Harrisburg University of Science and
      Technology is located in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Harrisburg is the capital
      city of Pennsylvania and is situated in the south-central part of the state.


      3. **University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown Location**: The University of Pittsburgh
      at Johnstown is located in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Johnstown is a city in Cambria
      County, Pennsylvania, which is in the western part of the state.


      4. **Compare Locations**: To determine if Harrisburg University is south of
      the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, we need to compare their geographical
      positions. Generally, Harrisburg is southeast of Johnstown. In Pennsylvania,
      moving from west to east, you would go from Johnstown towards Harrisburg. However,
      in terms of north-south orientation, Harrisburg is slightly south of Johnstown
      but more significantly, it is east.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on geographical positions, Harrisburg University of
      Science and Technology is indeed more to the southeast of the University of
      Pittsburgh at Johnstown. However, considering only the north-south axis for
      "south of," it can be considered that Harrisburg is not directly south but is
      positioned in a way that could be interpreted as south or more accurately southeast
      of Johnstown. The question, however, asks for a direct "south" comparison.


      Given the geographical context and focusing strictly on the north-south axis
      for the purpose of this question, the answer leans towards a simplification
      that might not fully capture the nuance of their geographical relationship but
      is necessary for a YES/NO response.

      the steps needed:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Kingston University LA, CA, and Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science,
      CA.


      2. **Kingston University LA, CA**: After researching, it appears there might
      be confusion or a mix-up in the question. There isn''t a well-known or prominent
      university by the name of "Kingston University" in Los Angeles, CA. However,
      there is a Kingston University in the UK. It''s possible the question refers
      to a different institution or there''s a misunderstanding in the name. For the
      sake of proceeding with the available information, let''s assume the question
      intends to ask about a university in Los Angeles, but the specific name might
      be incorrect or confused with another institution.


      3. **Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science, CA**: This university
      is located in Willowbrook, California, which is in Los Angeles County. Its address
      is 1731 E 120th St, Los Angeles, CA 90059.


      4. **Comparison**: Without the exact location of "Kingston University LA, CA"
      due to the potential mix-up in its name or existence, we can''t directly compare
      the two locations. However, if we consider the possibility that the question
      is asking about a hypothetical or incorrectly named university in LA, we would
      need to know its exact location to determine if it''s south of Charles R. Drew
      University.


      5. **Decision**: Given the information available and the potential confusion
      with the name "Kingston University LA, CA," it''s challenging to provide a definitive
      YES or NO answer without making assumptions. However, for the purpose of this
      exercise and considering the strict instruction for a YES or NO answer, we must
      proceed with the information we have.


      Since we cannot accurately identify or confirm the existence of "Kingston University
      LA, CA" or its location relative to Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and
      Science, CA, due to the potential error in the university''s name or details,
      the question as posed cannot be accurately answered with the information provided.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Kingston University LA, CA, and Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science,
      CA.


      2. **Kingston University**: Upon research, it appears that Kingston University
      is actually based in the United Kingdom, not in Los Angeles, CA. This suggests
      there might be confusion or a mix-up in the question as presented. However,
      for the sake of proceeding with the question as it might be intended, let''s
      assume we''re discussing a hypothetical or mistaken reference to a university
      by this name in LA, or perhaps there''s a very small or specialized institution
      not widely recognized under this name in LA.


      3. **Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science**: This university is
      located in Willowbrook, California, which is a neighborhood in South Los Angeles.
      Its address is 1731 E 120th St, Los Angeles, CA 90059.


      4. **Comparison**: Without a clear, recognized location for "Kingston University
      LA, CA," it''s challenging to directly compare the two. However, assuming the
      question intends to ask about the relative positions of these two institutions
      within the LA area, we can consider the general area of Charles R. Drew University.


      5. **Determination**: Given the lack of specific information on "Kingston University
      LA, CA," and assuming it''s meant to refer to a location within Los Angeles,
      the question becomes speculative. Charles R. Drew University is in the southern
      part of Los Angeles. Without exact coordinates or an address for Kingston University
      LA, CA, we cannot accurately determine its location relative to Charles R. Drew
      University.


      6. **Conclusion**: Since Kingston University LA, CA, does not appear to be a
      recognized institution in Los Angeles, CA, and without further information,
      we cannot definitively say whether it is located south of Charles R. Drew University
      of Medicine and Science. However, the question seems to be based on a premise
      that may not be accurate regarding the existence or location of Kingston University
      in LA.

      \ LA, CA's location and considering the steps above, the question cannot be\

      \ down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Locations**:\n   - First, we need\
      \ to identify the locations of Kingston University LA, CA, and Charles R. Drew\
      \ University of Medicine and Science, CA.\n   - Kingston University is actually\
      \ not based in Los Angeles, CA, as it seems to be a confusion or misrepresentation.\
      \ Kingston University is primarily known to be located in the United Kingdom.\
      \ However, for the sake of this exercise, let's proceed with the assumption\
      \ that there might be a misunderstanding or a mix-up with another institution\
      \ or a non-existent entity by this name in LA.\n   - Charles R. Drew University\
      \ of Medicine and Science is indeed located in Los Angeles, California. It's\
      \ situated in the Willowbrook area, which is in the southern part of Los Angeles.\n\
      \n2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**:\n   - Given the confusion around\
      \ Kingston University's location in LA (since it doesn't actually exist in LA),\
      \ we'll hypothetically consider any institution that might be confused with\
      \ it or assume a generic location in LA for the sake of argument.\n   - To determine\
      \ if one location is south of another, we need to know their specific geographic\
      \ locations. Since Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science is in\
      \ the southern part of Los Angeles, for Kingston University LA, CA (or its hypothetical\
      \ stand-in) to be south of it, it would need to be located even further south\
      \ than Willowbrook.\n\n3. **Address the Misunderstanding**:\n   - The critical\
      \ piece of information here is the actual existence and location of Kingston\
      \ University in LA, which appears to be a mistake. Without a real location for\
      \ Kingston University in LA, we cannot accurately determine its geographic relationship\
      \ to Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n\
      \   - Given the confusion and the apparent non-existence of Kingston University\
      \ in LA, CA, as typically understood, and without a clear location to compare,\
      \ the question cannot be definitively answered based on real-world data. However,\
      \ since the question demands a YES or NO answer and considering the steps taken,\
      \ the most appropriate response, based on the information provided and typical\
      \ geographic knowledge, would lean towards a hypothetical scenario where if\
      \ Kingston University were actually located in LA, its position relative to\
      \ Charles R. Drew University would depend on its exact location. But since Kingston\
      \ University is not actually in LA, and for the sake of providing an answer\
      \ as requested:\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{NO}$"

    9857e0ce-dd79-407a-b25a-6267baa97988: 'To determine if the USC Rossier School
      of Education, CA is located south of Q6156423, CA, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify USC Rossier School of Education Location**: The USC Rossier School
      of Education is part of the University of Southern California (USC), which is
      located in Los Angeles, California.


      2. **Identify Q6156423, CA**: The term "Q6156423" seems to refer to a specific
      location or entity in California. However, without direct information on what
      Q6156423 represents, we must deduce or look up what it could be. Given the context,
      it''s likely referring to a specific geographic location or landmark in California.
      After researching, it appears that Q6156423 could refer to a Wikipedia entry
      or a unique identifier for a location, but without a specific name or description
      provided, we must consider a general approach to understanding its potential
      location.


      3. **Understanding Geographic References**: Without a clear definition of Q6156423,
      we must consider how geographic locations are typically referenced. If Q6156423
      refers to a point of interest, city, or landmark in California, determining
      its exact location would be necessary to compare it with the USC Rossier School
      of Education''s location.


      4. **General Knowledge of California Geography**: USC, being in Los Angeles,
      is in the southern part of California. To be south of another location in California,
      that location would need to be either at the same latitude as Los Angeles or
      further north.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Without a specific location
      for Q6156423, it''s not possible to definitively say whether USC Rossier School
      of Education is south of it. However, considering the need for a YES or NO answer
      and the typical format of such questions, it seems we''re expected to make an
      educated guess or assume Q6156423 could represent any point in California. If
      Q6156423 were a location significantly north of Los Angeles (like San Francisco
      or Sacramento), USC would indeed be south. But without knowing what Q6156423
      is, we can''t accurately determine its location relative to USC.


      Given the information and the requirement for a definitive answer, and assuming
      the possibility that Q6156423 could represent a location north of Los Angeles
      (given that many notable locations in California are north of LA), the most
      reasoned approach would lead towards a potential "yes" if considering USC''s
      location in relation to possible northern California locations. However, this
      is speculative without the exact nature of Q6156423.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{Yes}$'

      If Q6156423 refers to a location north of Los Angeles (such as the Bay Area,
      Sacramento, or points further north), then USC would indeed be south of it.

      \ University in the sense of being significantly further south. But since they\
      \ are relatively close in latitude, with San Francisco slightly north, the correct\

      \ the premise that if one location is not significantly north or is at a similar\
      \ latitude, it could be considered in relation to the other's position.\n\n\
      Given these steps, the answer to whether San Francisco State University, CA,\

      \ - Angelo State University is a public university located in San Angelo, Texas.\n\
      \   - The College of Sciences is a part of Angelo State University. \n\n3. **Analyzing\

      1. **Identify the locations**: Clayton State University is located in Georgia

      3. **Determine the relative north-south positions**: Generally, Arizona is southwest

      However, the key factor here is the north-south relationship. Arizona is typically
      at a higher latitude (more north) than Georgia but not by a significant margin
      that would override the general southwest direction from Georgia. The critical
      aspect to consider is that while Arizona is to the west, its latitude is not
      sufficiently different from Georgia''s to change the fact that it is generally
      west rather than distinctly north or south in a significant manner.

      \ requirement**: The question asks if Clayton State University (in GA) is located\
      \ south of Arizona Christian University (in AZ).\n\nGiven that Georgia is generally\
      \ east and slightly north of Arizona, but still considering that \"south\" refers\
      \ to a direction on a map, we need to think about whether the latitude of Clayton\
      \ State University is less than (further south) that of Arizona Christian University.\n\
      \n5. **Final consideration**: Arizona is known for being relatively far west\
      \ and somewhat south in terms of U.S. geography. Georgia, while east, is not\
      \ as far south as parts of Arizona. However, without exact latitudes, the general\
      \ idea is that Arizona is southwest, and its southern parts are likely at a\
      \ similar or slightly lower latitude than Georgia's southern parts.\n\nGiven\
      \ these steps and without precise latitudes, the general geographic relationship\
      \ would suggest that parts of Georgia could indeed be south of parts of Arizona,\
      \ depending on the specific locations within those states. However, considering\
      \ typical geographic understandings, Arizona's position southwest of Georgia\
      \ means that its southernmost parts are likely at a similar latitude to Georgia's\
      \ southernmost parts. But since we're comparing a university in southern Georgia\
      \ to one in Arizona, and considering that Arizona stretches further south than\
      \ Georgia does west, the specific university locations become crucial.\n\nClayton\
      \ State University is near Atlanta, GA, and Arizona Christian University is\
      \ in the Phoenix area, AZ. Phoenix, AZ, is at a latitude of about 33.45\xB0\

      The Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences is part of Case Western Reserve
      University, which is located in Cleveland, Ohio.


      2. **Identify the Location of Premier Flight Academy, OH**: Premier Flight Academy
      is based at the Burke Lakefront Airport in Cleveland, Ohio, but for precision
      in comparison, we need to consider if there are other locations. However, given
      the context, we''ll proceed with the assumption that the primary or most relevant
      location for this comparison is in Cleveland.


      3. **Compare the Locations**: Since both entities are based in Cleveland, Ohio,
      we must consider their specific addresses or general areas within Cleveland
      to determine their relative positions.


      4. **Determine the Geographic Relationship**: Without exact addresses but knowing
      both are in Cleveland, we''d typically need to pinpoint their exact locations.
      However, since both are in the same city, the difference in their locations
      would depend on their exact addresses or the areas of Cleveland they occupy.


      Given the information available and the complexity of determining exact locations
      without specific addresses, the key factor is recognizing that both institutions
      are located in Cleveland, Ohio. Therefore, without precise addresses or a detailed
      map indicating their exact positions relative to each other, it''s challenging
      to definitively state which one is south of the other based solely on their
      affiliation with Cleveland.


      However, considering typical scenarios where such information might be relevant,
      if we had to make a decision based on available data (and assuming no additional
      specific location data is provided), we might lean towards a general understanding
      of Cleveland''s layout. But, crucially, without explicit location details (e.g.,
      exact street addresses or known landmarks nearby), any answer would be speculative.


      Given these considerations and the need for precise location data to accurately
      answer the question, the most informed response, based on the step-by-step analysis
      provided, would have to reflect the limitations of our current knowledge.

      these steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Mandel
      School of Applied Social Sciences and Premier Flight Academy in Ohio.


      2. **Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences Location**: The Mandel School
      of Applied Social Sciences is located in Cleveland, Ohio. It is part of Case
      Western Reserve University.


      3. **Premier Flight Academy Location**: Next, we need to find the location of
      Premier Flight Academy in Ohio. After research, it appears that Premier Flight
      Academy is based at the Akron Fulton International Airport in Akron, Ohio.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Cleveland, where the Mandel School is located, is
      generally north of Akron, where Premier Flight Academy is based.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographical locations of Cleveland
      being north of Akron, we can conclude that the Mandel School of Applied Social
      Sciences is located north of Premier Flight Academy.

      by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Malone University is located in Ohio, and Nebraska
      Wesleyan University is located in Nebraska.


      2. **General geography of the US**: Nebraska is generally considered to be part
      of the Midwestern United States, often towards the north and west compared to
      Ohio, which is also in the Midwest but more eastward and somewhat southward
      of Nebraska.


      3. **Compare the states'' general positions**: Ohio is typically southeast of
      Nebraska. This positioning suggests that Ohio is generally south (and slightly
      east) of Nebraska.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Malone University is in Ohio and Nebraska Wesleyan
      University is in Nebraska, and considering the general geographic relationship
      between these two states (Ohio being southeast of Nebraska), it''s reasonable
      to conclude that Malone University, OH is indeed located south of Nebraska Wesleyan
      University, NE.

      the geographical locations of both Malone University in Ohio and Nebraska Wesleyan

      1. **Identify the general geographical location of each state**: Ohio is located
      in the Eastern United States, while Nebraska is in the Midwestern United States
      but further west and somewhat north compared to Ohio.


      2. **Consider the term "south"**: When determining if one location is south
      of another, we are looking at the latitude. Locations that are south have a
      lower latitude than locations that are north.


      3. **Compare the latitudes of Ohio and Nebraska**: Nebraska is generally at
      a higher latitude (further north) than Ohio. This is because Nebraska is located
      in the Great Plains region, which is north of the states considered part of
      the South or the Midwest where Ohio is situated.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Nebraska is north of Ohio, it logically follows
      that any institution in Nebraska, such as Nebraska Wesleyan University, would
      be north of institutions in Ohio, like Malone University.

      North Carolina. NC State University is also located in Raleigh, North Carolina.


      2. **Compare the locations**: Since both universities are in the same city (Raleigh),

      4. **Consider the geography of Raleigh**: Raleigh is a city where the downtown

    f655147e-12ec-4545-9727-5d9381ddf041: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      William Peace University and NC State University. William Peace University is
      located in Raleigh, North Carolina. NC State University is also located in Raleigh,
      North Carolina.


      2. **Compare locations**: Since both universities are in Raleigh, NC, we need
      to determine their relative positions within the city to assess if one is south
      of the other.


      3. **Determine the direction**: Without exact addresses, we can consider the
      general areas where these universities are known to be. William Peace University
      is situated in the downtown area of Raleigh, and NC State University is located
      a bit northwest of downtown Raleigh.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that William Peace University is in the downtown area
      and NC State University is northwest of downtown, William Peace University would
      not be considered south of NC State University in a general sense, as "south"
      implies a direction that does not align with the relative positions of these
      two universities in Raleigh.


      Based on the steps above, the answer is: **NO**'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know the locations of both
      Georgia Military College (GMC) and Georgia College & State University (GCSU)
      within the state of Georgia.


      2. **Georgia Military College (GMC)**: GMC has multiple campuses, but its main
      campus is located in Milledgeville, Georgia.


      3. **Georgia College & State University (GCSU)**: GCSU is also located in Milledgeville,
      Georgia.


      4. **Compare locations**: Since both institutions are in Milledgeville, they
      are essentially in the same location in terms of being north or south of each
      other within the city or its immediate surroundings.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that both colleges are in the same city (Milledgeville),
      it''s not possible for one to be strictly south of the other in a geographical
      sense that would apply to different cities or significant distances within the

    e035b916-efa2-414b-8b62-b3eb6f03050a: 'To answer this question, we need to follow
      these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Corcoran
      College of Art and Design and George Washington University School of Nursing
      in Washington, D.C.

      2. **Determine the relative positions**: Once we have their locations, we need
      to determine their relative positions in terms of geography, specifically which
      one is south of the other.


      Given that Corcoran College of Art and Design is located in Washington, D.C.,
      and considering it became part of George Washington University in 2014 and is
      situated near the university''s main campus, we can proceed with this understanding:


      - **Corcoran College of Art and Design** was located near the George Washington
      University campus before it merged with GWU. The Corcoran College of Art and
      Design''s main building is at 500 17th St NW, Washington, DC 20006.

      - **George Washington University School of Nursing** is part of George Washington
      University, which has its main campus located in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood
      of Washington, D.C. The address for the School of Nursing could vary, but GWU''s
      main campus is around 2121 I St NW, Washington, DC 20052.


      Considering these locations:

      - The Corcoran College of Art and Design (500 17th St NW) and George Washington
      University (around 2121 I St NW) are relatively close, given the compact nature
      of Washington, D.C.''s downtown area.

      - To determine if Corcoran is south of the GWU School of Nursing, we need to
      compare their latitudes or relative positions on a map. Generally, the area
      around 17th St NW and the area around I St NW are not vastly different in terms
      of north-south positioning within the city''s grid.


      However, without precise coordinates or a detailed map comparison, we can still
      reason based on typical city grid layouts and known locations:

      - GWU''s main campus, including the area where the School of Nursing would be
      located, is generally situated around the Foggy Bottom area.

      - Corcoran College of Art and Design''s location, being closer to the National
      Mall and slightly south or southwest of the traditional Foggy Bottom neighborhood,
      might suggest it could be south or slightly southwest of GWU''s main campus,
      depending on the exact locations within the city grid.


      Given this analysis and the need for precise location data to definitively answer,
      we must consider the general geography of Washington, D.C. and the relative
      positions of these institutions.


      **Conclusion**: Based on the general understanding of Washington, D.C.''s layout
      and without precise location data for a definitive comparison, it''s reasonable
      to consider that Corcoran College of Art and Design could be located south or

      \ of Art and Design Location**: The Corcoran College of Art and Design was located\
      \ in Washington, D.C. However, it's essential to note that the college has undergone\
      \ significant changes. As of my last update, the Corcoran College of Art and\

      \ the same latitude, the question essentially becomes about comparing their\
      \ exact latitudes or considering minor differences in latitude for this specific\
      \ comparison.\n\nGiven the steps above and considering minor variations might\
      \ not significantly impact the overall assessment due to the close latitudinal\
      \ positions, the answer leans towards **NO**, because Pfeiffer University and\
      \ Oklahoma City University are roughly at the same latitude, and the question\
      \ of being \"south\" would depend on very minor variations in latitude or possibly\
      \ longitude in a very general sense, but primarily, they are not significantly\
      \ different in their north-south positioning.\n\n**Answer: NO**"

    57d2f6bb-bf74-4386-994e-41c3faad4b5e: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of Washington Technology University and Antioch University Seattle,
      and then compare their positions.


      1. **Identify the location of Antioch University Seattle**: Antioch University
      Seattle is located in Seattle, Washington. Seattle is a city in the state of
      Washington, USA, known for being in the northwestern part of the country.


      2. **Identify the location of Washington Technology University**: After researching,
      it appears that there might not be a widely recognized or accredited institution
      by the name of "Washington Technology University" in Washington state. However,
      for the sake of this exercise, let''s assume it exists or could exist in a hypothetical
      scenario. Without a specific location, we can''t directly compare, but typically,
      when comparing locations in Washington state, being "south" would imply a location
      that is more towards the southern part of the state compared to another location.


      3. **Determine what "south" means in the context of Washington state**: In the
      context of Washington state, "south" would generally refer to locations that
      are towards the southern part of the state, moving away from the Canadian border.
      Given that Seattle is in the northwestern part of Washington state, a location
      would be considered south of Seattle if it is in a more southerly direction,
      which could include parts of the state like Olympia (the capital), Tacoma, or
      even further south towards the Oregon border.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Without the exact location of Washington Technology
      University, we can''t make a precise comparison. However, if Washington Technology
      University is indeed located somewhere in Washington state, to be south of Antioch
      University Seattle, it would need to be in a city or area that is south of Seattle.


      Given the lack of information about Washington Technology University''s exact
      location and assuming it''s a hypothetical or less well-known institution, the
      question becomes speculative. However, to follow through with the logic:


      - If Washington Technology University is in a location that is known and can
      be verified as south of Seattle, then the answer would be YES.

      - If it''s not possible to verify its location or if it''s located north of
      Seattle, then the answer would be NO.


      Since I couldn''t verify the existence or location of Washington Technology
      University and given the instruction to reason step by step before answering,
      I will proceed with a cautionary answer based on the assumption that the question
      aims to test geographical knowledge and reasoning rather than provide a factual
      error:

      University Seattle, and then compare them to see which one is south of the other.


      1. **Location of Antioch University Seattle**: Antioch University Seattle is
      located in Seattle, Washington. Seattle is a major city in the state of Washington,
      situated in the northwestern part of the United States.


      2. **Location of Washington Technology University**: To determine if Washington

      that there is limited information available on a "Washington Technology University"
      in Washington state. This could imply that the institution might not be well-known,
      is a fictional name, or might be operating under a different name or as a part

      VA 23220.


      3. **University of Richmond School of Professional & Continuing Studies Location**:
      The University of Richmond, which includes its School of Professional & Continuing
      Studies, is also located in Richmond, Virginia. Its address is 28 Westhampton
      Way, University of Richmond, VA 23173.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Since both institutions are in Richmond, VA, we need
      to determine their relative positions. Richmond is a city, and within a city,
      "south" can be determined by looking at the map or knowing the general layout
      of the city and its streets.


      5. **Determine Direction**: Without a detailed map, we can''t precisely determine

      east and slightly north of the University of Richmond''s location.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the general locations within Richmond, VA, Virginia
      Union University seems to be located more to the east and slightly north of
      the University of Richmond. Therefore, considering the directional query (south),

      one is "south" would typically require knowing their exact addresses or relative
      positions within the city. However, given that they are both in Richmond, it
      might initially seem like a detailed map or specific address comparison would
      be necessary.


      6. **Consider Geographical Context**: Richmond, Virginia, is a city and does
      not have a vast north-south spread compared to other cities in the United States.
      However, to give a definitive answer, understanding that "south" refers to a
      cardinal direction, we would need to establish a reference point.

      2. **Virginia Union University Location**: VUU is located in Richmond, Virginia.
      Richmond is the capital of Virginia and is situated in the central part of the
      state, near the fall line of the James River.


      3. **University of Richmond Location**: The University of Richmond, including
      its School of Professional & Continuing Studies, is also located in Richmond,
      Virginia. Specifically, it is situated in the western part of the city.


      4. **Determine the Relative Positions**: Since both institutions are in Richmond,
      Virginia, we need to determine their relative positions within the city to assess
      if one is south of the other.


      5. **Virginia Union University''s Specific Location**: VUU is located at 1500
      N Lombardy St, Richmond, VA 23220.


      6. **University of Richmond''s Specific Location**: The University of Richmond
      is located at 28 Westhampton Way, Richmond, VA 23173.


      7. **Compare Locations**: To determine if VUU is south of the University of
      Richmond, we need to compare their geographic locations within Richmond. Given
      that both are in Richmond, we look at their addresses and consider the general
      layout of the city. Richmond''s streets and avenues are somewhat aligned with
      the cardinal directions, with "North" in addresses typically indicating a location
      north of the James River and the city center.


      8. **Conclusion**: Given the specific locations and the layout of Richmond,
      Virginia, we need to consider the actual geographic positions based on their
      addresses. However, without precise GPS coordinates or a detailed map, the determination
      relies on understanding Richmond''s geography. Generally, locations with "North"
      in their street names (like North Lombardy for VUU) are north of those without,
      but the University of Richmond''s location in the western part of the city means
      we''re comparing a central/northern location (VUU) with a western location (UR).
      Since both are within the city limits and considering the usual grid-like pattern
      of American cities, the specific positioning (north-south) depends on the exact
      location within Richmond.


      9. **Final Analysis**: Given that both universities are in Richmond, to accurately
      determine if VUU is south of the University of Richmond, we would ideally need
      to compare their exact latitudes. However, based on typical city layouts and
      without specific GPS data, it''s reasonable to consider that locations in the
      western part of Richmond (like the University of Richmond) might be at a similar
      latitude to those in the central or northern parts (like VUU), given the city''s
      geography.


      Based on this analysis and the fact that both institutions are located within
      the same city, making a precise determination without exact coordinates is challenging.
      However, considering general knowledge about the layout of Richmond and typical
      urban geography:


      The final answer is: NO'
