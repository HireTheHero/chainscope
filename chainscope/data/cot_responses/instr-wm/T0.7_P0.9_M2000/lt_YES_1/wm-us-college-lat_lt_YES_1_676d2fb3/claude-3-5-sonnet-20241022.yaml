      1. First, let me identify the locations:

      - Pratt Institute is located in Brooklyn, specifically in Clinton Hill

      - NYU Tandon School of Engineering is also in Brooklyn, specifically in Downtown
      Brooklyn/MetroTech area


      2. Looking at their relative positions in Brooklyn:

      - Clinton Hill is located northeast of Downtown Brooklyn

      - Therefore, Pratt Institute is located north of NYU Tandon


      3. Since Pratt Institute is north of NYU Tandon (not south), the answer is:


      NO'

      2. Looking at their relative positions:

      - San Jose is south of Palo Alto

      - Therefore, Henley-Putnam University was located south of Palo Alto University


      Note: It''s important to mention that Henley-Putnam University no longer exists
      as an independent institution - it was acquired by National American University
      in 2018.

      Since Antioch is southeast of Fielding, it is indeed south of Fielding.


      Answer: YES'
    efaf6807-b944-462b-890f-529807a3eb5a: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me locate both universities in Santa Barbara:

      - Antioch University Santa Barbara is located at 602 Anacapa Street, Santa Barbara

      - Fielding Graduate University is located at 2020 De la Vina Street, Santa Barbara


      2. Looking at their locations within Santa Barbara:

      - Anacapa Street (Antioch) is in downtown Santa Barbara

      - De la Vina Street (Fielding) is in upper State Street area


      3. In Santa Barbara''s geography:

      - Downtown area is south of upper State Street area

      - Therefore, Anacapa Street is south of De la Vina Street


      4. Since Antioch is on Anacapa Street (downtown) and Fielding is on De la Vina
      Street (upper area):

      - Antioch is south of Fielding


      Answer: YES'

      1. First, I need to check if both universities still exist:

      - George Mason University exists in Fairfax, VA

      - University of Northern Virginia was an unaccredited institution that closed
      in 2013


      2. Since one of the universities no longer exists, I can use its last known
      location:

      - George Mason University is in Fairfax, VA

      - University of Northern Virginia was in Annandale, VA


      3. Looking at the relative positions:

      - Fairfax and Annandale are very close to each other

      - Fairfax is slightly west and slightly north of Annandale


      4. Since George Mason University is north of where University of Northern Virginia
      was located, it cannot be south of it.

      - Lincoln Group of Schools in NJ would be to the east of Pennsylvania

      - New Jersey is generally on the same latitude as central/northern Pennsylvania


      3) When comparing north/south positions:

      - Central Pennsylvania (where Penn State is) is roughly at the same latitude
      as northern/central New Jersey

      - Lincoln Group of Schools is in NJ, which means it''s likely at a similar latitude
      to Penn State


      4) However, most of New Jersey is actually slightly south of State College,
      PA


      Therefore: YES, Lincoln Group of Schools, NJ is located south of Pennsylvania
      State University School of Hospitality Management, PA.'
