      \ University has multiple locations, but its main campus is in the South of\
      \ Market (SoMa) district, which is more central and slightly south of the Financial\
      \ District.\n\nBased on this analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that Academy\
      \ of Art University is not strictly south of Golden Gate University, as they\

      4. **Compare the locations**: Now, we need to compare the locations of these
      universities. Both universities are located in different states, and they are
      far apart geographically. California is on the West Coast of the United States,
      while Indiana is in the Midwest.


      5. **Determine if one is south of the other**: To determine if Sonoma State
      University is south of Oakland City University, we need to consider their relative
      positions on the map. California is generally considered to be south of Indiana,
      as it is located further south on the map. Therefore, Sonoma State University
      in California is indeed located south of Oakland City University in Indiana.

    f6a79a89-9f34-4852-90dd-1603049cdeeb: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know the locations of Robert
      Morris University Illinois (RMU) and La Salle Extension University in Illinois.


      2. **Robert Morris University Illinois Location**: RMU has several campuses
      in Illinois. However, for the sake of simplicity, we''ll focus on its main campus,
      which is in Chicago, Illinois. Chicago is in the northeastern part of the state,
      near Lake Michigan.


      3. **La Salle Extension University Location**: La Salle Extension University
      was a distance education institution that operated in Chicago, Illinois. However,
      it''s essential to note that La Salle Extension University is no longer operational,
      having ceased operations in 2002. For the sake of this question, we consider
      its last known location, which was in Chicago, Illinois.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Both institutions are in Chicago, Illinois, which
      is in the northeastern part of the state. Since they are in the same city, we
      can''t determine if one is south of the other based solely on their city location.


      5. **Determine if one is south of the other**: Given that both institutions
      are in the same city (Chicago), we need to consider their specific locations
      within the city to determine if one is south of the other. However, since La
      Salle Extension University is no longer operational, we don''t have detailed
      information about its specific location within Chicago. Therefore, it''s challenging
      to determine if Robert Morris University Illinois is located south of La Salle
      Extension University based on the available information.


      Based on this reasoning, we can conclude that it''s difficult to determine if
      Robert Morris University Illinois is located south of La Salle Extension University
      based on the provided information.


      The answer is: **UNDECIDABLE**

      the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Oral
      Roberts University and Arkansas State University Paragould.


      2. **Oral Roberts University location**: Oral Roberts University is located
      in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Tulsa is in the northeastern part of Oklahoma.


      3. **Arkansas State University Paragould location**: Arkansas State University
      Paragould is located in Paragould, Arkansas. Paragould is in the northeastern
      part of Arkansas, near the Missouri border.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Both universities are in the northeastern parts
      of their respective states. However, "south" is a relative term that depends
      on the exact locations. Given that both are in the same general area (northeastern
      Oklahoma and Arkansas), we must determine their relative positions.


      5. **Determine if one is south of the other**: Since both Oral Roberts University
      (in Tulsa, Oklahoma) and Arkansas State University Paragould (in Paragould,
      Arkansas) are in the northeastern parts of their respective states and relatively
      close to each other, with Tulsa being slightly south of Paragould, we can conclude
      that Oral Roberts University is indeed located south of Arkansas State University
      Paragould.

    649db832-f350-45ca-8d95-586a2fce8348: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations:** First, we need to know the locations of both
      Immaculata University and Eastern University in Pennsylvania.


      2. **Immaculata University location:** Immaculata University is located in Immaculata,
      Pennsylvania. Immaculata is a borough in Chester County, Pennsylvania.


      3. **Eastern University location:** Eastern University is located in St. Davids,
      Pennsylvania. St. Davids is an unincorporated community in Radnor Township,
      Delaware County, Pennsylvania.


      4. **Compare the locations:** Now, we need to compare the relative positions
      of these two locations. Immaculata is in Chester County, which is more to the
      west of Delaware County, where Eastern University is located.


      5. **Determine if one is south of the other:** To determine if Immaculata University
      is south of Eastern University, we need to understand the geography of Pennsylvania.
      Generally, locations in the eastern part of the state are considered more "southern"
      compared to locations in the western part of the state.


      6. **Conclusion:** Since Immaculata is in the western part of Pennsylvania (Chester
      County) and St. Davids is in the eastern part (Delaware County), we can conclude
      that Immaculata University is not located south of Eastern University. Instead,
      Immaculata University is located to the west of Eastern University.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to know the locations of North Dakota
      State College of Science (NDSCS) and Minnesota State Community and Technical
      College (MSCTC) in their respective states.


      2. **North Dakota State College of Science (NDSCS) Location**: NDSCS is located
      in Wahpeton, North Dakota. Wahpeton is situated in the southeastern part of
      the state, near the Minnesota border.


      3. **Minnesota State Community and Technical College (MSCTC) Location**: MSCTC
      has multiple campuses in Minnesota. One of its campuses is in Moorhead, Minnesota.
      Moorhead is located in the western part of Minnesota, near the North Dakota
      border.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Since Wahpeton (NDSCS) is in the southeastern
      part of North Dakota, it is generally north of Moorhead (MSCTC), which is in
      the western part of Minnesota.


      5. **Answer the question**: The question asks if NDSCS is located south of MSCTC.
      Based on the locations, NDSCS is actually north of MSCTC, not south.


      The final answer is: **NO**'

      It''s in the Willowbrook area of Los Angeles.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Since both institutions are in Los Angeles, we
      need to consider the geography of Los Angeles. Los Angeles is a vast city, and
      its neighborhoods can be in different directions.


      5. **Determine if one is south of the other**: To answer if Kingston University
      LA is south of Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science, we need to
      know their specific locations within Los Angeles. Unfortunately, the information
      provided does not specify the exact locations within Los Angeles for either
      institution. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine if one is south of
      the other without more precise location details.


      Based on the information given, it''s unclear whether Kingston University LA
      is located south of Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science. We would
      need more specific location details within Los Angeles to make a definitive
      determination. The answer is: **UNKNOWN**

      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know where Mandel School of
      Applied Social Sciences and Premier Flight Academy are located in Ohio.


      2. **Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences location**: Mandel School of Applied
      Social Sciences is part of Case Western Reserve University, which is located
      in Cleveland, Ohio. Cleveland is in the northeastern part of the state.


      3. **Premier Flight Academy location**: Premier Flight Academy is located at
      the Northeast Ohio Regional Airport in Ashtabula, Ohio. Ashtabula is also in
      the northeastern part of Ohio, but it''s further east and closer to the Pennsylvania
      border.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Both institutions are in the northeastern part
      of Ohio, but they are not in the same city or even the same county.


      5. **Determine if one is south of the other**: Cleveland, where Mandel School
      is located, is generally considered to be south of Ashtabula, where Premier
      Flight Academy is located. However, the difference in latitude between the two
      locations is relatively small, so the terms "north" and "south" might be somewhat
      subjective in this case.


      6. **Consider the context of the question**: The question asks specifically
      about whether Mandel School is located "south" of Premier Flight Academy. Given
      the geographical information, we can say that Mandel School is located south
      of Premier Flight Academy, although the difference in latitude is not very significant.

      4. **Compare the locations**: We need to compare the geographical locations
      of these two institutions. Both Phoenix and Carrollton are in different regions
      of the United States, with Phoenix being in the southwest and Carrollton being
      in the southeast.


      5. **Determine if one is south of the other**: The question asks if National
      Paralegal College is located south of the University of West Georgia. Given
      that Phoenix is in the southwestern part of the country and Carrollton is in
      the southeastern part, we can conclude that National Paralegal College is not
      south of the University of West Georgia. Instead, it''s more to the west.

      Technology University (WTU) and Antioch University Seattle (AUS) in Washington
      state.


      2. **Washington Technology University location**: WTU is located in Bellevue,
      Washington, which is a city east of Seattle across Lake Washington.


      3. **Antioch University Seattle location**: AUS is located in Seattle, Washington,
      specifically in the downtown area.


      4. **Compare the locations**: To determine if WTU is located south of AUS, we
      need to understand the geography of Washington state. Seattle is located in
      the western part of the state, and Bellevue is to the east of Seattle. In terms
      of north-south orientation, Seattle is generally north of Bellevue.


      5. **Answer the question**: The question asks if WTU is located south of AUS.
      Based on the locations, WTU in Bellevue is actually north of AUS in Seattle,
      not south.


      The final answer is: **NO**'
