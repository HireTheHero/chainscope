      \ (DSU)** is located in Dickinson, North Dakota.\n   - **University of Jamestown\
      \ (UJ)** is located in Jamestown, North Dakota.\n\n2. **Determine their relative\
      \ positions within North Dakota:**\n   - Dickinson is in the western part of\
      \ North Dakota.\n   - Jamestown is in the central part of North Dakota.\n\n\
      3. **Compare their latitudes (north-south positioning):**\n   - Dickinson is\
      \ located at approximately **46.88\xB0N** latitude.\n   - Jamestown is located\
      \ at approximately **46.91\xB0N** latitude.\n\n4. **Compare the numerical values\
      \ of the latitudes:**\n   - Since 46.88\xB0N is slightly less than 46.91\xB0\
      N, Dickinson is slightly **south** of Jamestown.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**YES**"
