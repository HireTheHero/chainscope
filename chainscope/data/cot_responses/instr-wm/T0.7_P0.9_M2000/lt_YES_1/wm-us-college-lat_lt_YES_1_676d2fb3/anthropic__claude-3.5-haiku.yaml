      in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.


      2. Since they are both located in the same city, their relative north-south
      positioning becomes a matter of their specific campus locations within Philadelphia.


      3. Temple University''s main campus is located in the North Philadelphia neighborhood.


      4. Boyer College of Music and Dance is part of Temple University''s campus.


      5. Since Boyer College of Music and Dance is part of Temple University''s campus,
      it cannot be located separately from Temple University.


      6. Therefore, the question of whether Temple University is south of Boyer College
      of Music and Dance doesn''t make sense, as they are essentially in the same
      location.


      However, the question requires a YES or NO answer. Since the premise is fundamentally
      flawed, I cannot definitively say YES or NO.

      4. "South of" means being located further south on a map

      - Since Lon Morris College is west of, not south of, the Armstrong Campus, it
      is NOT south of it


      5. Additional note: Lon Morris College actually closed in 2012, but for geographical
      comparison purposes, its former location still applies.

      south of its own College of Sciences?


      2. This is a bit of a tricky question because it''s asking about the location
      of a part of the university relative to the whole university.


      3. Since the College of Sciences is a part of Angelo State University, it would
      be located within the same campus.


      4. By definition, a part cannot be south of the whole, as the part is contained
      within the whole.


      5. Therefore, it is not possible for Angelo State University to be located south
      of its own College of Sciences.


      The answer is: NO.'

      very similar entities: "Angelo State University" and "Angelo State University
      College of Sciences"


      2. These sound like they are part of the same institution, not two separate
      geographic locations


      3. In fact, the College of Sciences is likely a department or college within

      4. Since they are essentially the same physical location, neither can be "south"
      of the other
