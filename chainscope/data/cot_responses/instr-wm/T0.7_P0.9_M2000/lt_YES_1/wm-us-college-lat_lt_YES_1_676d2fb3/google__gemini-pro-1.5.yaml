      University isn''t a traditional campus-based university in the same way, the
      question of one being south of the other is less clear.  Historically, LaSalle
      Extension operated primarily as a correspondence school and may have shared

      4. **Consider the closure of Robert Morris University Illinois:** Robert Morris
      University Illinois closed in 2020. This further complicates the question, as

    0357e8a3-6b8e-470e-a864-d0bb3db52fe1: '1. **Identify the locations of each institution:**
      Wilkes University is in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, not Mesa, Arizona. The Ira
      A. Fulton Schools of Engineering is part of Arizona State University, with campuses
      across the Phoenix metropolitan area.


      2. **Determine if the question is valid:** Since the prompt gives a false location
      for Wilkes University, the question as posed is invalid. We can''t compare the
      locations as stated because one of the locations is wrong.


      3. **Consider the intended comparison:**  The question likely intends to compare
      a Wilkes University location (presumably the one in Pennsylvania) with the Fulton
      Schools in Arizona.


      4. **Compare the actual locations:** Wilkes-Barre, PA is much further north
      than Arizona.

    24b2b992-36e4-497d-ae12-e184369a63a9: '1. **Wilkes University''s main campus:**
      Wilkes University''s main campus is in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.  The question
      mentions a Mesa, AZ location.  It is possible they have a branch campus there.

      2. **Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering:** This is part of Arizona State University
      (ASU). ASU has multiple campuses, but its main engineering school is in Tempe,
      AZ.

      3. **Mesa vs. Tempe:** Both Mesa and Tempe are part of the Phoenix metropolitan
      area. Mesa is generally east and slightly south of Tempe.


      Therefore, if Wilkes University *does* have a Mesa campus, it would likely be
      south of the main Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering in Tempe.

      University in Mesa. Since the premise is false, the question of its location
      relative to Tempe is moot.


      5. **Conclusion:**  The question cannot be answered as stated because it''s
      based on a false premise.  However, if we were to interpret it as asking if
      Mesa is south of Tempe, the answer would be partially yes, but mostly east.  Since
      the question demands a YES/NO, and Mesa isn''t *directly* south of Tempe, the
      closest answer based on the flawed premise would be NO.

      south of Tempe, a location in Mesa *could* be considered south of a location
      in Tempe, depending on the specific locations within each city. However, since
      a Wilkes University in Mesa is not readily confirmed, the premise of the question
      is flawed.


      5. **Conclusion:** Since  the location "Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ" is not
      definitively confirmed, I cannot accurately assess its location relative to
      the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering. Therefore, I cannot give a YES or
      NO answer.

      Therefore, the question is fundamentally flawed.  However, interpreting it as
      asking if the College of Education building(s) is south of the College of Arts
      and Sciences building(s), the most likely answer is:


      **NO** (It''s unlikely one entire college is definitively south of another within
