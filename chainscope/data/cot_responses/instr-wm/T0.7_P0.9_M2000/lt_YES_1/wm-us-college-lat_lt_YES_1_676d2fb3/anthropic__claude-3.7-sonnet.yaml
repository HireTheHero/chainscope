      - Clinton Hill (Pratt) is located in north-central Brooklyn.

      - Downtown Brooklyn/MetroTech (NYU Tandon) is located in northwest Brooklyn,
      closer to the Manhattan Bridge.


      Step 3: Comparing their north-south positions:

      - Downtown Brooklyn (NYU Tandon) is slightly north of Clinton Hill (Pratt).

      - This means Pratt Institute is positioned south of NYU Tandon School of Engineering.


      NO.


      Wait, I need to verify this. Looking more precisely at their locations:

      - Pratt Institute''s main campus is at 200 Willoughby Ave, Brooklyn

      - NYU Tandon is at 6 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn

      - When mapped, Pratt Institute is actually slightly southeast of NYU Tandon

      the relative locations of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Pratt Institute''s main campus is located in Brooklyn, NY, specifically in
      the Clinton Hill neighborhood.

      - NYU Tandon School of Engineering (formerly Polytechnic Institute) is also
      located in Brooklyn, NY, in the Downtown Brooklyn/MetroTech area.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - In New York City, locations are typically described using cardinal directions
      (north, south, east, west).

      - Clinton Hill, where Pratt is located, is northeast of Downtown Brooklyn, where
      NYU Tandon is located.

      - This means Pratt Institute is north and east of NYU Tandon, not south of it.


      Step 3: Confirm with geographical knowledge.

      - Moving from NYU Tandon toward Pratt Institute would generally involve traveling
      northward and eastward through Brooklyn.

      - Clinton Hill is considered to be further "up" in Brooklyn (more northerly)
      than Downtown Brooklyn.


      NO, Pratt Institute is not located south of NYU Tandon School of Engineering.
      It is located northeast of it.'

      - NYU Tandon School of Engineering (formerly Polytechnic Institute) is also
      located in Brooklyn, NY, in the Downtown Brooklyn/MetroTech area.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - In New York City, north-south positioning generally corresponds to higher
      and lower street numbers (with north being higher numbers).

      - Clinton Hill (where Pratt is located) is northeast of Downtown Brooklyn (where
      NYU Tandon is located).

      - Specifically, Pratt Institute is located around Willoughby Ave and Washington
      Ave in Clinton Hill.

      - NYU Tandon is located near MetroTech Center in Downtown Brooklyn.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a north-south axis.

      - Clinton Hill is slightly north and east of Downtown Brooklyn.

      - Therefore, Pratt Institute is positioned north of NYU Tandon School of Engineering,
      not south.


      NO, Pratt Institute is not located south of NYU Tandon School of Engineering.

      Step 1: Identify the location of Kent State University College of Podiatric
      Medicine, OH.

      - Kent State University College of Podiatric Medicine is located in Independence,
      Ohio, which is in the northeastern part of Ohio, near Cleveland.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Chancellor University, OH.

      - Chancellor University was located in Cleveland, Ohio. (Note: Chancellor University
      closed in 2013, but I''ll use its former location for this comparison.)


      Step 3: Compare the relative north-south positions.

      - Independence, OH (where Kent State''s Podiatric Medicine College is) is located
      slightly south of Cleveland proper.

      - Chancellor University was in Cleveland.

      - Therefore, Kent State University College of Podiatric Medicine is south of
      where Chancellor University was located.


      NO.


      Wait, I need to verify this more carefully. Looking at the specific locations:

      - Kent State University College of Podiatric Medicine is in Independence, OH,
      which is indeed south of Cleveland.

      - Chancellor University was located in the Seven Hills area of Cleveland, which
      is actually south of Independence.


      After careful consideration of their specific locations, the answer is:


      YES.'

      - The Cancer and Genetics Research Complex (CGRC) is located in the Health Science
      Center area of UF''s campus.

      - The Southwest Recreation Center is located in the southwestern part of UF''s
      campus, as its name suggests.


      Step 2: Consider the general layout of UF''s campus.

      - The Health Science Center, where the CGRC is located, is in the southern part
      of the main campus.

      - The Southwest Recreation Center is indeed in the southwestern corner of campus.


      Step 3: Compare their specific positions.

      - The Cancer and Genetics Research Complex is located near Archer Road, in the
      health sciences district.

      - The Southwest Recreation Center is located on Hull Road, west of SW 34th Street.

      - When comparing their positions, the CGRC is actually southeast of the Southwest
      Recreation Center.


      Step 4: Determine if CGRC is south of the Southwest Recreation Center.

      - While the CGRC is southeast of the Southwest Recreation Center, the question
      specifically asks if it''s south (directly south).

      - The CGRC is more east and slightly south of the Southwest Recreation Center,
      but not directly south.

      - However, the CGRC does have a more southern latitude than the Southwest Recreation
      Center.


      Based on this analysis, the Cancer and Genetics Research Complex is indeed south
      (has a more southern latitude) than the Southwest Recreation Center.

      Step 2: Consider the cardinal directions.

      - If something is south of another location, it means it has a lower latitude
      (is further down on a map).

      - The Southwest Recreation Center, being in the southwest part of campus, would
      be both west and south of central campus.

      - The Cancer and Genetics Research Complex, being in the eastern part of campus,
      would be east of central campus.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - The Southwest Recreation Center is in the southern portion of campus (as indicated
      by "Southwest" in its name).

      - The Cancer and Genetics Research Complex is in the eastern part but not specifically
      designated as northeast or southeast.


      Step 4: Based on the campus layout, the Cancer and Genetics Research Complex
      is in the eastern/northeastern area of campus, while the Southwest Recreation
      Center is in the southwestern area of campus.

      - This means the Cancer and Genetics Research Complex is north of (or at least

      the relative locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Goldman School of Public Policy is part of UC Berkeley, located in Berkeley,
      California.

      - Graduate Theological Union is also located in Berkeley, California.


      Step 2: Find their specific locations within Berkeley.

      - Goldman School of Public Policy is located at 2607 Hearst Avenue, Berkeley,
      CA.

      - Graduate Theological Union is located at 2400 Ridge Road, Berkeley, CA.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      - In Berkeley, streets running east-west (like Hearst Avenue) are numbered from
      south to north.

      - Ridge Road is north of Hearst Avenue in Berkeley.

      - This means Goldman School (on Hearst) is south of Graduate Theological Union
      (on Ridge).


      NO.


      Wait, I need to double-check my reasoning. Looking at the map orientation of
      Berkeley:

      - Goldman School of Public Policy is on Hearst Avenue near LeRoy Avenue

      - Graduate Theological Union is on Ridge Road, which is indeed north of Hearst
      Avenue


      Therefore, Goldman School of Public Policy is located SOUTH of Graduate Theological
      Union.


      YES.'

      Berkeley, California.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Graduate Theological Union.

      The Graduate Theological Union is also located in Berkeley, California.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions within Berkeley.

      The Goldman School of Public Policy is located at 2607 Hearst Avenue in Berkeley,
      in the northeast part of the UC Berkeley campus.

      The Graduate Theological Union is located at 2400 Ridge Road in Berkeley, which
      is in the Berkeley hills north of the UC Berkeley campus.


      Step 4: Compare their north-south positions.

      Looking at their specific addresses in Berkeley, the Graduate Theological Union
      is located further north in Berkeley compared to the Goldman School of Public
      Policy.


      Therefore, the Goldman School of Public Policy is located south of the Graduate
      Theological Union.

      Berkeley, California.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Graduate Theological Union.

      The Graduate Theological Union (GTU) is also located in Berkeley, California.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions within Berkeley.

      The Goldman School of Public Policy is located at 2607 Hearst Avenue in Berkeley.

      The Graduate Theological Union is located at 2400 Ridge Road in Berkeley.


      Step 4: Compare their north-south positions.

      In Berkeley, Hearst Avenue runs east-west, and Ridge Road is north of Hearst
      Avenue. The GTU campus sits in the Berkeley hills, in the northern part of Berkeley,
      while the Goldman School is located more centrally in Berkeley''s campus area.


      Since the Graduate Theological Union is located north of the Goldman School
      of Public Policy within Berkeley, the Goldman School would be south of GTU.


      NO - Goldman School of Public Policy is NOT located south of Graduate Theological
      Union. It is located north of it.


      Wait, I made an error in my analysis. Let me correct this:


      The Goldman School of Public Policy (2607 Hearst Avenue) is actually located
      SOUTH of the Graduate Theological Union (2400 Ridge Road) in Berkeley. Ridge
      Road is in the hills above and north of the main UC Berkeley campus, while Hearst

      - Graduate Theological Union is located in the "Holy Hill" area of Berkeley,
      at 2400 Ridge Road.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positioning.

      - In Berkeley, Ridge Road runs east-west along the hills north of the main UC
      Berkeley campus.

      - Hearst Avenue also runs east-west but is located downhill from Ridge Road,
      closer to downtown Berkeley.

      - In Berkeley''s geography, locations further into the hills are more northern,
      while locations closer to the bay are more southern.

      the relative positions of these two institutions in Georgia.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Atlanta University Center (AUC).

      The Atlanta University Center is a consortium of historically Black colleges
      and universities located in Atlanta, Georgia, specifically in the west side
      of Atlanta.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Laurus Technical Institute.

      Laurus Technical Institute was located in Decatur, Georgia, which is a city
      in DeKalb County, just east of Atlanta.


      Step 3: Compare the geographic positions.

      Atlanta is generally located in the central part of Georgia, with downtown Atlanta
      being the reference point. The AUC is in west Atlanta.

      Decatur is located east of Atlanta.


      Step 4: Determine north-south positioning.

      When comparing locations in the Atlanta metro area, Decatur is slightly northeast
      of downtown Atlanta, while the Atlanta University Center is west and slightly
      south of downtown Atlanta.


      Based on these geographic positions, the Atlanta University Center is indeed
      south of where Laurus Technical Institute was located.

      Step 2: Identify the location of Fielding Graduate University.

      Fielding Graduate University is also located in Santa Barbara, California.


      Step 3: Since both universities are in the same city, I need to determine their
      specific locations within Santa Barbara to compare their north-south positioning.


      Step 4: Antioch University Santa Barbara is located in downtown Santa Barbara
      at 602 Anacapa Street.


      Step 5: Fielding Graduate University is located at 2020 De la Vina Street in
      Santa Barbara.


      Step 6: Looking at the map of Santa Barbara, Anacapa Street (where Antioch is)
      is closer to the coast and slightly south of De la Vina Street (where Fielding
      is).


      Therefore, YES, Antioch University Santa Barbara is located south of Fielding
      Graduate University within the city of Santa Barbara, CA.'

      Step 3: Now I need to determine the relative north-south positioning of these
      cities.

      - Cypress is located in northwestern Orange County.

      - Anaheim is also in Orange County, just northeast of Cypress.


      Step 4: Looking at their specific positions on a map:

      - Cypress (where Trident is) is slightly southwest of Anaheim.

      - This means Cypress is south of Anaheim (though also slightly west).


      Since Trident University International is in Cypress, which is south of Anaheim
      (where Anaheim University is located), the answer is:


      YES'

      - University of St. Thomas is located in Houston, Texas, specifically in the
      Montrose neighborhood.

      - University of Houston-Downtown is located in downtown Houston, Texas.

      - The Montrose neighborhood where University of St. Thomas is located is generally
      southwest of downtown Houston.

      - University of Houston-Downtown is, as its name suggests, in downtown Houston.


      Step 3: Based on the cardinal directions, if University of St. Thomas is southwest

      if D-Q University is located south of University of Sacramento.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both universities.

      - D-Q University is located near Davis, California, in Yolo County. Specifically,
      it''s about 6-7 miles west of Davis.

      - The University of Sacramento (which is now closed) was located in Sacramento,
      California.


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these locations.

      - Davis is located west of Sacramento in California''s Central Valley.

      - In terms of north-south positioning, Davis is slightly north of Sacramento.

      - D-Q University, being west of Davis, maintains approximately the same north-south
      position as Davis.


      Step 3: Compare the north-south positions.

      - Since D-Q University is approximately at the same latitude as Davis, and Davis
      is slightly north of Sacramento, D-Q University would be slightly north of Sacramento.

      - Therefore, D-Q University is NOT south of where the University of Sacramento

      D-Q University is located near Davis, California, in Yolo County. It''s specifically
      located west of Davis.


      Step 2: Let me identify the location of University of Sacramento.

      The University of Sacramento was located in Sacramento, California (the state

      Sacramento is located east of Davis. Since D-Q University is west of Davis,
      and Davis is west of Sacramento, D-Q University is west of Sacramento.


      Step 4: Determine if "west" means "south" in this context.

      Being west of a location doesn''t necessarily mean it''s south. These are different
      directional relationships. I need to determine if D-Q University is south of
      Sacramento.


      Step 5: Looking at the geography of the area, Davis (near where D-Q University
      is located) is slightly northwest of Sacramento, not south of it.

    6f9fbfc6-14a2-4a0d-98f8-a561a6443d9c: '# Is Portland State University, OR located
      south of Pacific University Health Professions Campus, OR?


      I''ll think about this step by step:


      1) Portland State University (PSU) is located in downtown Portland, Oregon.


      2) Pacific University has multiple campuses, and its Health Professions Campus
      is located in Hillsboro, Oregon.


      3) Geographically, Hillsboro is located west of Portland in the Portland metropolitan
      area.


      4) When comparing north-south positioning, downtown Portland (where PSU is)
      is slightly south of Hillsboro (where Pacific University Health Professions
      Campus is).


      5) However, checking more precisely, Portland State University is located in
      the southern part of downtown Portland, while Hillsboro is generally northwest
      of downtown Portland.


      6) This means Portland State University is south of Pacific University Health
      Professions Campus.


      NO, Portland State University is NOT located south of Pacific University Health
      Professions Campus. PSU is located southeast of the Pacific University Health
      Professions Campus.'
    a0f94857-22f8-401c-8a6b-b7fdfdd0d90a: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of both Portland State University
      (PSU) in Oregon and Pacific University Health Professions Campus in Oregon.


      Step 2: Portland State University is located in downtown Portland, Oregon.


      Step 3: Pacific University has multiple campuses. The Health Professions Campus
      is located in Hillsboro, Oregon, which is west of Portland.


      Step 4: In terms of north-south positioning, Portland is slightly south of Hillsboro.
      Portland is located along the Willamette River, while Hillsboro is in Washington
      County to the west and slightly north of Portland.


      Step 5: Since Portland State University is in Portland, and Pacific University
      Health Professions Campus is in Hillsboro which is slightly north of Portland,
      PSU would be south of Pacific University Health Professions Campus.


      NO, Portland State University is not located south of Pacific University Health
      Professions Campus. It''s actually located slightly southeast of it.


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me correct this:


      Portland State University is located in downtown Portland, while Pacific University
      Health Professions Campus is in Hillsboro, which is west and slightly north
      of Portland. Therefore, PSU is located south (specifically southeast) of Pacific
      University Health Professions Campus.


      So the correct answer is: YES'

      the relative positions of these two Oregon institutions.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both universities.

      - Portland State University (PSU) is located in downtown Portland, Oregon.

      - Pacific University Health Professions Campus is located in Hillsboro, Oregon
      (a suburb west of Portland).


      Step 2: Consider their geographic orientation.

      - Portland is situated along the Willamette River in northwestern Oregon.

      - Hillsboro is located west of Portland in the Portland metropolitan area.


      Step 3: Determine north-south positioning.

      - When looking at a map of the Portland metro area, Hillsboro is generally west
      of Portland, with minimal north-south difference.

      - However, if we''re being precise, Hillsboro is slightly north of downtown
      Portland where PSU is located.

      - This means PSU would be slightly south of Pacific University''s Health Professions
      Campus.


      NO.


      Portland State University is not located south of Pacific University Health
      Professions Campus. PSU is actually slightly north of the Pacific University
      campus.'

      - North Central University is located in the Elliot Park neighborhood of Minneapolis.


      Step 3: Now I need to determine the north-south relationship between these neighborhoods.

      - Cedar-Riverside (where Augsburg is) is located just south of downtown Minneapolis.

      - Elliot Park (where North Central is) is on the southeastern edge of downtown
      Minneapolis.


      Step 4: Comparing their specific positions, Augsburg University is slightly

      of these two colleges to answer whether North Dakota State College of Science

      Step 1: Let''s identify the states where these colleges are located.

      - North Dakota State College of Science is in North Dakota (ND)

      - Minnesota State Community and Technical College is in Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between North Dakota and Minnesota.

      - North Dakota is west of Minnesota

      - Both states share a border that runs east-west

      - Minnesota is generally east of North Dakota, not north of it


      Step 3: Since the border between these states runs primarily east-west, colleges
      in North Dakota would generally be at similar latitudes as colleges in Minnesota,
      not necessarily north or south of each other.


      Step 4: Without specific campus location information, I need to rely on the

    f89695a9-067e-4cf9-8b06-a5e7f9651d98: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: Determine the locations of both colleges.

      - North Dakota State College of Science (NDSCS) is located in North Dakota (ND),
      as the name indicates.

      - Minnesota State Community and Technical College (M State) is located in Minnesota
      (MN), as the name indicates.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between North Dakota and Minnesota.

      - North Dakota and Minnesota are neighboring states.

      - Minnesota is located to the east of North Dakota.

      - In terms of north-south positioning, Minnesota is not entirely north or south
      of North Dakota - they are roughly at the same latitude, with their borders
      running east-west.


      Step 3: Since the question is specifically about north-south positioning, I
      need to determine if NDSCS is south of M State.

      - M State has multiple campuses in Minnesota, but they are all within Minnesota
      state boundaries.

      - NDSCS is in Wahpeton, ND, which is in the southeastern part of North Dakota,
      right at the border with Minnesota.

      - The M State campuses are spread throughout western and central Minnesota.


      Step 4: Compare the specific latitudes.

      - Wahpeton, ND (where NDSCS is located) is at the southern edge of North Dakota.

      - M State''s campuses (Detroit Lakes, Fergus Falls, Moorhead, and Wadena) are
      all in Minnesota, with some being further north than Wahpeton.


      Based on this analysis, NDSCS in Wahpeton is likely south of at least some M
      State campuses, but not necessarily all of them. However, since the question
      asks for a definitive yes/no, and at least some M State campuses are north of
      NDSCS, I can provide an answer.


      NO - North Dakota State College of Science is not located south of Minnesota
      State Community and Technical College (at least not all of its campuses).'

      of Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering and Purdue University College of
      Agriculture in Indiana.


      Step 1: Let me identify where these schools are located.

      The Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering is part of Purdue University, located
      in West Lafayette, Indiana.


      Step 2: Similarly, the Purdue University College of Agriculture is also part
      of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana.


      Step 3: Since both schools are part of the same university campus, I need to
      determine their specific locations within the campus.


      Step 4: The Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering is located in Martin Jischke
      Drive, in the Discovery Park area of Purdue''s campus.

      of campus, with its main buildings including the Agricultural Administration
      Building.


      Step 6: On Purdue''s campus map, the Discovery Park area (where Weldon School
      is) is generally located to the south of the main agricultural buildings.

      University of Wisconsin-Parkside is located in Kenosha, Wisconsin, near the
      southeastern corner of the state.


      Step 2: Let me identify the location of University of Wisconsin-Rock County.

      University of Wisconsin-Rock County (now part of UW-Whitewater at Rock County)

      Janesville (where UW-Rock County is) is also in southern Wisconsin, but it is
      slightly further north than Kenosha.

      College of Sciences, because the College of Sciences is a part of Angelo State

      Step 1: Let me understand what these two entities are. Angelo State University
      is a university in Texas. The Angelo State University College of Sciences is
      a college (academic division) within Angelo State University.


      Step 2: Since the College of Sciences is a part of Angelo State University,

      within the other (Angelo State University). It would be like asking if Texas
      is south of Dallas - the relationship is one of containment, not cardinal direction.

      2) The College of Sciences is one of the colleges/schools within Angelo State
      University. It''s not a separate university but rather a division or department
      of ASU.


      3) Since the College of Sciences is part of Angelo State University, they are

      4) If they''re on the same campus, one cannot be "south of" the other in terms
      of separate geographic locations - they occupy the same general location.


      5) The College of Sciences might be housed in a specific building or buildings
      on the ASU campus, but this doesn''t make the university itself "north" or "south"
      of one of its own colleges.


      6) The question assumes they are two distinct geographic locations, but they''re
      actually the same institution in the same location.


      NO - Angelo State University is not located south of Angelo State University

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both universities.

      - Lewis University is located in Romeoville, Illinois (IL)

      - Grand View University is located in Des Moines, Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Illinois and Iowa.

      - Iowa is directly north of Illinois

      - Des Moines is in central Iowa

      DC. It''s worth noting that Corcoran was actually absorbed by George Washington
      University in 2014, but I''ll use its historical location.


      Step 2: Let me identify the location of George Washington University School
      of Nursing in DC.

      The GWU School of Nursing is located at 1919 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington,
      DC.


      Step 3: Compare the locations on a north-south axis.

      In Washington DC''s grid system, streets with higher numbers are further west,
      while the north-south position is indicated by the lettered streets and the
      quadrant (NW, NE, SW, SE).


      Both institutions are in the NW quadrant. Looking at their specific addresses:

      - Corcoran: 500 17th Street NW (near E Street)

      - GWU Nursing: 1919 Pennsylvania Avenue NW (Pennsylvania Ave runs diagonally,
      but this location is approximately at 19th and I or K Streets)


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Pennsylvania Avenue runs diagonally through DC, but at 19th Street, it''s further
      north than E Street where Corcoran was located. This means Corcoran (near E
      Street) is south of GWU Nursing (near I/K Street).


      NO, Corcoran College of Art and Design is NOT located south of George Washington
      University School of Nursing. It is located north of it.


      Wait, I made an error in my analysis. Let me correct this:


      The Corcoran (near E Street) is actually SOUTH of GWU Nursing (near I/K Street),
      as E Street is south of I/K Street in DC''s grid system.


      YES, Corcoran College of Art and Design is located south of George Washington
      University School of Nursing.'

      The GWU School of Nursing is located at 1919 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington,
      DC.


      Step 3: Compare the locations in terms of north-south positioning.

      In Washington DC''s grid system:

      - Lower numbered streets run north-south

      - The 17th Street address of Corcoran is at approximately the same north-south
      line as the Pennsylvania Avenue address

      - However, when comparing the exact coordinates, Corcoran (500 17th St NW) was
      slightly south of GWU School of Nursing (1919 Pennsylvania Ave NW)


      NO'
    f4826cda-23a1-4376-afe1-e5ec2d513e32: 'I''ll think through this step by step.


      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of both Corcoran College of Art and
      Design, DC and George Washington University School of Nursing, DC.


      Step 2: The Corcoran College of Art and Design was located at 500 17th Street
      NW, Washington, DC. (Note: Corcoran was actually acquired by George Washington
      University in 2014, but I''ll use its historical location.)


      Step 3: The George Washington University School of Nursing is located at 1919
      Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC.


      Step 4: In Washington DC''s grid system, numbered streets run north-south, with
      numbers increasing as you go west. Pennsylvania Avenue runs diagonally through
      the city.


      Step 5: Corcoran was at 17th Street NW, while GWU School of Nursing is at 1919
      Pennsylvania Avenue NW, which is near 20th Street NW.


      Step 6: Since Corcoran was at 17th Street (farther east) and GWU Nursing is
      around 20th Street (farther west), we need to compare their north-south positions.


      Step 7: Corcoran was near E Street NW, while GWU Nursing on Pennsylvania Avenue
      is approximately at H Street NW level.


      Step 8: In DC''s grid, letters increase as you go north (A, B, C, etc.). So
      E Street is south of H Street.


      Therefore, Corcoran College of Art and Design was located south of George Washington
      University School of Nursing.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both schools.

      - Lincoln Group of Schools is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - Pennsylvania State University School of Hospitality Management is in Pennsylvania
      (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the specific locations.

      - The main campus of Penn State University (where the School of Hospitality
      Management is located) is in University Park/State College, PA, which is in
      central Pennsylvania.

      - Lincoln Group of Schools has locations in New Jersey, which is east and south
      of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - New Jersey is entirely east of Pennsylvania.

      - Parts of New Jersey are south of central Pennsylvania (where Penn State is
      located).

      - Without the specific city in NJ for Lincoln Group of Schools, I need to consider
      NJ''s position relative to central PA.

      - Most of New Jersey is south of the latitude of State College, PA.


      Based on this analysis, and considering the general geographic relationship
      between New Jersey and central Pennsylvania, the answer is:


      YES'
    dbc24d59-4468-40ca-a1e3-c36c33a06450: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Lincoln Group of Schools is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - Pennsylvania State University School of Hospitality Management is in Pennsylvania
      (PA)


      Step 2: Determine their specific locations.

      - Lincoln Group of Schools has locations in several NJ cities, including Union,
      Mahwah, and others

      - Penn State''s School of Hospitality Management is located at the main University
      Park campus in State College, PA


      Step 3: Compare their geographic positions.

      - State College, PA (where Penn State is located) is in central Pennsylvania

      - The NJ locations of Lincoln Group of Schools are in northern New Jersey

      - Northern New Jersey is east and slightly south of central Pennsylvania


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      - When comparing strictly on a north-south axis, the Lincoln Group of Schools
      locations in northern NJ are generally at a similar latitude or slightly south
      of State College, PA


      NO


      The Lincoln Group of Schools in NJ is not definitively south of Penn State''s
      School of Hospitality Management. They are at similar latitudes, with Lincoln
      Group locations being primarily east rather than south of Penn State.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both schools.

      - Lincoln Group of Schools is in New Jersey (NJ).

      - Pennsylvania State University School of Hospitality Management is in Pennsylvania
      (PA).


      Step 2: Determine their relative geographic positions.

      - Pennsylvania is north of New Jersey.

      - Pennsylvania State University''s main campus (where the School of Hospitality
      Management is located) is in State College, PA, which is in the central part
      of Pennsylvania.

      - New Jersey is entirely south of central Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - Since New Jersey is south of central Pennsylvania, and Lincoln Group of Schools
      is in New Jersey, it must be south of Pennsylvania State University''s School
      of Hospitality Management.


      NO.


      Wait, I need to correct my answer. I made an error in my reasoning. New Jersey
      is east and slightly south of central Pennsylvania, not entirely south. I need
      to be more precise about the exact locations.


      Step 1 (revised): Identify the specific locations.

      - Lincoln Group of Schools has locations in NJ (specifically in areas like Edison,
      Mahwah, etc.)

      - Penn State''s School of Hospitality Management is in State College, PA, in
      the central part of the state


      Step 2 (revised): Compare latitudes.

      - New Jersey locations of Lincoln Group of Schools are generally in the northern
      or central part of NJ

      - These locations are south of State College, PA
