      - It is located in California

      - Specifically, it''s in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta region

      - It''s west of the California Central Valley

      Station is located in Wyoming, while Benton County Wind Farm is located in Oregon.


      3. Wyoming is east of Oregon in the United States.


      4. Therefore, Sundance Power Station is east of Benton County Wind Farm, not
      west.


      5. Since the question asks if it is west, and it is actually east, the answer
      is NO.

      - Lake Martin is in Alabama, which is in the southeastern part of the United
      States


      4. Determine their relative positions

      - Los Angeles is west of Lake Martin

      - Therefore, Saint Sophia Cathedral, being in Los Angeles, is also west of Lake
      Martin


      5. Conclusion:

      YES, Saint Sophia Cathedral, Los Angeles is located west of Lake Martin.

    dbda4042-cc77-4a7b-9a10-d5278c23923e: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate Gibraltar on a map:

      - Gibraltar is located at the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula

      - It is in the extreme southwest of Europe, near the entrance to the Mediterranean
      Sea


      2. Next, locate Skara Cathedral:

      - Skara is a city in Sweden

      - Sweden is in northern Europe, in the Scandinavian region


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Gibraltar is in the southwest of Europe

      - Skara is in the north of Europe


      4. Determine their relative west-east positioning:

      - Since Gibraltar is further west than Skara, anything in Gibraltar would be
      west of Skara


      5. Therefore, the Synagogues of Gibraltar would indeed be west of Skara Cathedral.


      The answer is: YES.'

      England.


      3. St. Kazimierz Church could refer to multiple churches, but I''ll assume the
