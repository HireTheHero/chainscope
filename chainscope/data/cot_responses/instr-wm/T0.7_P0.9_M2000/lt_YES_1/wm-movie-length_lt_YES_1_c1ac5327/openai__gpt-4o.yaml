    f2a891e8-2912-442d-b6e8-dcaf61829e11: 'To determine whether Alper Mestci''s "Sijjin"
      is shorter than Sajid Khan''s "Housefull" franchise, we need to consider the
      lengths of the movies involved.


      1. **Sijjin Series**: The "Sijjin" series is a Turkish horror film franchise
      directed by Alper Mestci. As of October 2023, the series consists of multiple
      films. To answer the question accurately, we need to consider the total runtime
      of all the films in the "Sijjin" series.


      2. **Housefull Franchise**: The "Housefull" franchise is an Indian comedy film
      series directed by Sajid Khan for the first two films and by others for subsequent
      films. As of October 2023, the franchise includes several films. Similar to
      "Sijjin," we need to calculate the total runtime of all the films in the "Housefull"
      franchise.


      Given that both are film series with multiple entries, the question requires
      comparing the cumulative runtimes of both series.


      Without specific runtime data for each film in both series, I must rely on general
      information: Typically, horror films like those in the "Sijjin" series have
      runtimes ranging from 90 to 120 minutes each. Comedy films such as those in
      the "Housefull" franchise can have similar or slightly longer runtimes, often
      ranging from 120 to 150 minutes each.


      Considering these typical runtimes and the number of films in each series, it''s
      reasonable to conclude that the total runtime of the "Housefull" franchise is
      likely to be longer than that of the "Sijjin" series because the "Housefull"
      franchise is known for having more entries with possibly longer runtimes.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**, the "Sijjin" series is shorter than the "Housefull"
      franchise.'

      the lengths of each film:


      1. **Will Vinton''s "Will Vinton''s"**: It seems like there might be a repetition
      or error in the title. Will Vinton is known for creating short films and claymation
      works. However, without a specific title, it''s unclear which film is being
      referenced. If we assume it refers to one of his notable works, they are typically
      short films, often ranging from a few minutes to around 30 minutes.


      2. **Hank Azaria''s "Nobody''s Perfect"**: Hank Azaria is known for various
      roles in film and television, but "Nobody''s Perfect" is not widely recognized
      as a film he directed or created. Assuming this refers to a short film or a
      lesser-known project, we would need to confirm its length.


      If we assume typical lengths for Will Vinton''s works (short films around 10-30
      minutes) and that "Nobody''s Perfect" is also a short film, it''s difficult
      to definitively say which is longer without specific durations.


      Thus, without more precise information about each specific work, we cannot accurately
      determine which is shorter. If you have specific durations, please provide them.


      Based on typical assumptions and the nature of short films:

      - **YES**, if we assume Will Vinton''s works are usually quite short and "Nobody''s
      Perfect" is a feature-length project.

      - **NO**, if both are short films of similar length or if "Nobody''s Perfect"
      is not significantly longer.

      - The answer is **NO** if both are short films of comparable length, which is

      released in 1962. The typical length for Tom and Jerry shorts from this era
      is around 7 minutes.


      2. **Friz Freleng''s "Devil''s Feud Cake"**: This is a Looney Tunes cartoon
      featuring Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam, released in 1963. Looney Tunes shorts
      from this period typically run around 6 to 7 minutes.


      Since both films are short cartoons, they have similar runtimes. However, without
      exact durations available for both, we can assume based on the typical runtime
      of shorts from these series.


      Given the typical lengths, it is likely that "Tall in the Trap" and "Devil''s
      Feud Cake" are approximately the same length, with any difference being negligible.

      "Race" franchise. The "Race" franchise includes three films: "Race" (2008),
      "Race 2" (2013), and "Race 3" (2018). Each film has a runtime of approximately
      2 to 2.5 hours.


      Now, let''s compare:


      - The "Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3" includes multiple shorts and
      is several hours long.

      - The combined runtime of the "Race" franchise films would be around 6 to 7.5
      hours (considering each film is about 2 to 2.5 hours).


      Therefore, when comparing the total runtime of the Looney Tunes collection to
      the combined runtime of the Race franchise, the Race franchise is likely longer.


      The answer is: **YES**.'
    ea47395e-733e-4f17-966b-016a104901df: 'To answer this question, we need to clarify
      what is being compared:


      1. **Tex Avery''s Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3** - This is a collection
      of animated shorts. We need to establish the total runtime of this collection.


      2. **Race 2''s Race franchise** - This refers to the 2013 film "Race 2," which
      is part of the "Race" film series. We need to determine the runtime of the film
      "Race 2" only, not the entire franchise.


      Now, let''s find the relevant information:


      - **Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3**: This collection consists of
      multiple discs, each containing several animated shorts. The total runtime for
      the entire collection is approximately 411 minutes.


      - **Race 2**: The runtime of the film "Race 2" is about 150 minutes.


      Now, compare the two:


      - 411 minutes (Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3) is longer than 150
      minutes (Race 2).


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**, Tex Avery''s Looney Tunes Golden Collection:
      Volume 3 is not shorter than Race 2.'
    f26aa6bc-e467-48f8-ab25-77d132bcf977: 'To answer this question, we need to clarify
      a few things:


      1. **Tex Avery''s Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3**: This is a collection
      of classic cartoons directed by Tex Avery, but it should be noted that Tex Avery
      primarily worked for MGM on the "Screwy Squirrel" and "Droopy" series, not on
      Looney Tunes. However, if we consider the "Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume
      3," this is a DVD set containing several hours of Looney Tunes cartoons. Each
      volume typically contains around 60 to 70 cartoons, each ranging from 6 to 8
      minutes, totaling approximately 420 to 560 minutes.


      2. **Race 2 (part of the Race franchise)**: "Race 2" is a Bollywood film and
      the second installment in the Race franchise. The movie''s runtime is approximately
      150 minutes.


      3. **Race franchise**: The Race franchise includes "Race" (2008), "Race 2" (2013),
      and "Race 3" (2018). The total runtime of the entire franchise would be the
      sum of the runtimes of these three films. Each film typically runs around 150
      to 160 minutes, so the cumulative runtime of the franchise would be around 450
      to 480 minutes.


      Now, comparing the two:


      - **Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3** has a total runtime of about
      420 to 560 minutes.

      - The **Race franchise** has a cumulative runtime of approximately 450 to 480
      minutes.


      Considering these estimates, the Looney Tunes collection could be slightly longer
      or shorter than the Race franchise depending on the exact number of cartoons
      and their lengths in the collection.


      Therefore, the answer is not definitively clear-cut based on the typical estimates.
      However, given the upper range of the Looney Tunes collection, it could be longer
      than the Race franchise, but this requires precise data to confirm.


      Without precise runtimes, the question cannot be answered definitively with
      a simple YES or NO. However, based on typical estimates and assuming the maximum
      length for the Looney Tunes collection, the answer leans towards NO, the Looney
      Tunes collection is not shorter than the Race franchise.'

      down into steps:


      1. **Tex Avery''s Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3**: This is a DVD
      collection featuring animated shorts directed by Tex Avery. The entire collection
      includes multiple volumes of classic Warner Bros. animated shorts, but it is
      not a single movie. Typically, these collections contain several hours of content

      3. **Comparison**: Since Tex Avery''s Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume

      longer in total duration than a single movie like "Race 2."
