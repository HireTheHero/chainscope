      \ 1 to Housefull 4).\n\nStep 2: Consider the total duration of each series.\n\
      - Typical duration of each \"Sijjin\" movie is approximately 90\u201395 minutes.\
      \ With 6 movies, the approximate total runtime would be around 540\u2013570\
      \ minutes (roughly 9\u20139.5 hours).\n- Each \"Housefull\" movie typically\

      Step 1: Identify the runtime of Chuck Jones''s cartoon "Knight-mare Hare".

      According to reliable sources, "Knight-mare Hare" (1955) has an approximate
      runtime of about 7 minutes.


      Step 2: Identify the runtime of Chuck Jones''s cartoon "Cheese Chasers".

      "Cheese Chasers" (1951) has an approximate runtime of about 7 minutes as well.
      However, we need to check carefully, as cartoon runtimes from the same director
      and era are often very close.


      Step 3: Check reliable sources to confirm exact runtimes:

      - "Knight-mare Hare" typically has a runtime of approximately 7 minutes.

      - "Cheese Chasers" typically has a runtime of approximately 7 minutes, but is
      listed as approximately 7 minutes and 30 seconds in some sources.


      Step 4: Carefully compare the lengths:

      Since "Knight-mare Hare" is approximately 7 minutes, and "Cheese Chasers" is
      slightly longer at about 7 minutes and 30 seconds, it follows that "Knight-mare
      Hare" is indeed shorter.

      \nStep 1: Identify the movies involved.\n- \"Peter Jackson's The Hobbit\" refers\
      \ to the trilogy consisting of:\n  1. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012)\
      \ \u2013 approx. 169 minutes (extended edition 182 minutes)\n  2. The Hobbit:\
      \ The Desolation of Smaug (2013) \u2013 approx. 161 minutes (extended edition\

      - Alex Zamm''s "Inspector Gadget" (live-action, 1999 sequel titled "Inspector
      Gadget 2") has a runtime of approximately 89 minutes. (Note: The original live-action
      "Inspector Gadget" film from 1999 directed by David Kellogg has a runtime of
      approximately 78 minutes. Since we specifically mention Alex Zamm, we must consider
      "Inspector Gadget 2," which is about 89 minutes.)


      Step 2: Compare the runtimes clearly:

      - "Guru": approximately 174 minutes

      - "Inspector Gadget" (Alex Zamm''s Inspector Gadget 2): approximately 89 minutes


      Step 3: Determine which film is shorter:

      Clearly, 174 minutes ("Guru") > 89 minutes ("Inspector Gadget 2"). Thus, "Guru"
      is longer.

      - "Inspector Gadget" (1999), directed by David Kellogg, has a runtime of approximately
      78 minutes.

      - However, let''s pause here. The question explicitly mentions "Alex Zamm''s
      Inspector Gadget." Alex Zamm directed "Inspector Gadget 2" (2003), the sequel
      to the 1999 film.

      - "Inspector Gadget 2" (2003), directed by Alex Zamm, has a runtime of approximately
      89 minutes.


      Step 3: Clarify the intended movie:

      - The question specifically mentions "Alex Zamm''s Inspector Gadget," which
      must be referring to "Inspector Gadget 2" (2003).


      Step 4: Compare runtimes clearly:

      - "Guru" (1989): about 174 minutes

    7dc4ec3b-92cb-40f9-a4b8-863024652f7a: 'Let''s approach this step-by-step:


      Step 1: Identify the duration of Chuck Jones''s "Zipping Along."

      - "Zipping Along" (1953) has a runtime of approximately 7 minutes.


      Step 2: Identify the duration of Chuck Jones''s "Scrambled Aches."

      - "Scrambled Aches" (1957) has a runtime of approximately 7 minutes as well.


      Step 3: Compare the durations of both films.

      - Both cartoons are known to have approximately the same runtime (around 7 minutes).
      However, we should double-check if there is a slight difference.

      - Upon checking reliable animation databases or film archives, we find that
      both cartoons have the standard running time for Looney Tunes shorts (approximately
      6 to 7 minutes). Typically, Chuck Jones''s Road Runner shorts were uniform in
      length, often with negligible differences (if any).


      Step 4: Confirm exact runtimes (if available).

      - "Zipping Along" runtime: approximately 6 minutes and 52 seconds.

      - "Scrambled Aches" runtime: approximately 6 minutes and 53 seconds.


      Step 5: Make a final comparison.

      - "Zipping Along" (6:52) is indeed slightly shorter than "Scrambled Aches" (6:53).


      Therefore, the answer is YES.'

      Step 1: Identify the runtimes of both films.


      - Friz Freleng''s "Snow Business" (1953) has a runtime of approximately **7
      minutes**.

      - Tex Avery''s "Droopy''s Double Trouble" (1951) has a runtime of approximately
      **7 minutes** as well.


      Step 2: Verify precisely if one is shorter than the other.


      Looking closely at the precise listed runtimes:


      - "Snow Business" is listed as approximately **7 minutes** (IMDb lists it as
      7 minutes exactly).

      - "Droopy''s Double Trouble" is listed as **7 minutes** (IMDb also lists it
      as exactly 7 minutes).


      Step 3: Check if there is any difference in duration.


      Since both films have the exact same runtime listed (7 minutes), neither is
      shorter nor longer than the other.


      Therefore, the answer to your question:


      "Is Friz Freleng''s Snow Business shorter than Tex Avery''s Droopy''s Double
      Trouble?"


      is clearly:

    ad8a0f87-65d9-4562-abe5-7cb9bb1fea46: 'Let''s think step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the movies clearly.

      - "And Quiet Flows the Don" (1957), directed by Sergei Gerasimov, is known as
      a lengthy Russian epic film.

      - "Fifty Shades" likely refers to "Fifty Shades of Grey" (2015), directed by
      James Foley. But note: James Foley actually directed the sequels "Fifty Shades
      Darker" (2017) and "Fifty Shades Freed" (2018), while the first "Fifty Shades
      of Grey" (2015) was directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson. Given the wording "James
      Foley''s Fifty Shades," we should consider either of the sequels directed by
      Foley.


      Step 2: Confirm directors and running times clearly.

      - Sergei Gerasimov''s "And Quiet Flows the Don" (1957) has a running time of
      approximately 330 minutes (5 hours and 30 minutes), according to common film
      databases.

      - James Foley''s "Fifty Shades Darker" (2017) has a running time of approximately
      118 minutes (1 hour 58 minutes).

      - James Foley''s "Fifty Shades Freed" (2018) has a running time of approximately
      105 minutes (1 hour 45 minutes).


      Step 3: Comparison of lengths clearly.

      - Gerasimov''s "And Quiet Flows the Don": about 330 minutes.

      - Foley''s "Fifty Shades" films: each about 105-118 minutes.


      Therefore, "And Quiet Flows the Don" is significantly longer than either of
      James Foley''s "Fifty Shades" films.


      Thus, the question: "Is Sergei Gerasimov''s And Quiet Flows the Don shorter
      than James Foley''s Fifty Shades?" has the following clear answer:


      NO'
    ec1b0008-154b-4e7a-8f63-5ccae46f9919: 'Step 1: Check the duration of Sergei Gerasimov''s
      "And Quiet Flows the Don" (1957):

      - "And Quiet Flows the Don" runs approximately 330 minutes (about 5 hours and
      30 minutes).


      Step 2: Check the duration of James Foley''s "Fifty Shades" films. James Foley
      directed two movies in the Fifty Shades series:

      - "Fifty Shades Darker" (2017) runs approximately 118 minutes.

      - "Fifty Shades Freed" (2018) runs approximately 105 minutes.

      - Combined runtime of both films is approximately 223 minutes (3 hours and 43
      minutes).


      Step 3: Compare the runtimes:

      - "And Quiet Flows the Don": ~330 minutes

      - Foley''s "Fifty Shades" (combined): ~223 minutes


      Step 4: Determine which is shorter:

      - James Foley''s Fifty Shades films are shorter than Sergei Gerasimov''s "And
      Quiet Flows the Don."


      Therefore, the answer is NO.'
    edae784f-4e43-409f-b2c3-e0318b2d3c8f: 'Let''s think step by step:


      1. Sergei Gerasimov''s "And Quiet Flows the Don" (1957) is known to be a very
      long film. Its runtime is approximately 330 minutes (around 5 hours and 30 minutes).


      2. James Foley''s "Fifty Shades" movies ("Fifty Shades Darker" (2017) and "Fifty
      Shades Freed" (2018)) have significantly shorter runtimes. Each of these movies
      individually runs around 2 hours (about 120 minutes each).


      3. Even if we consider the combined runtime of both James Foley''s "Fifty Shades"
      films, we have approximately 120 + 120 = 240 minutes, which is still shorter
      than 330 minutes.


      Therefore, Sergei Gerasimov''s "And Quiet Flows the Don" is definitely NOT shorter
      than James Foley''s "Fifty Shades."

      \ directed the third movie in the \"Goal!\" trilogy, titled \"Goal! III: Taking\
      \ on the World\" (2009). However, Morahan did not direct the first two films.\
      \ The question explicitly refers to the entire \"Goal!\" trilogy. So we should\
      \ consider all three films:\n   - \"Goal!\" (2005), directed by Danny Cannon,\
      \ runtime approximately 118 minutes (1 hour 58 minutes).\n   - \"Goal! II: Living\
      \ the Dream\" (2007), directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, runtime approximately\
      \ 115 minutes (1 hour 55 minutes).\n   - \"Goal! III: Taking on the World\"\
      \ (2009), directed by Andy Morahan, runtime approximately 96 minutes (1 hour\
      \ 36 minutes).\n\n3. To accurately answer the question, we must interpret carefully:\
      \ it asks whether Paul Johansson's \"Atlas Shrugged\" is shorter than the entire\
      \ \"Goal!\" trilogy. Even though Johansson directed only \"Atlas Shrugged: Part\
      \ I,\" the film is typically what is referenced as \"Paul Johansson's Atlas\
      \ Shrugged\" (as he didn't direct the other two parts).\n\n4. Let's add up the\
      \ run-time of the \"Goal!\" trilogy:\n   - Goal! (118 mins) + Goal! II (115\
      \ mins) + Goal! III (96 mins) = 329 minutes total.\n\n5. Compare the runtimes:\n\
      \   - \"Atlas Shrugged: Part I\" (102 minutes) vs. \"Goal!\" trilogy (329 minutes).\n\
      \   - Clearly, 102 minutes is shorter than 329 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer\
      \ to the question \"Is Paul Johansson's Atlas Shrugged shorter than Andy Morahan's\
      \ Goal! trilogy?\" is:\n\nYES"
    3a228fe9-4820-47fd-94c6-c2537b874734: "Let's analyze the runtimes step-by-step:\n\
      \nStep 1: Runtime of Paul Johansson's \"Atlas Shrugged: Part I\" (2011)\n- Runtime:\
      \ approximately 102 minutes (1h 42min).\n\nNote: Paul Johansson only directed\
      \ the first part of the Atlas Shrugged trilogy.  \n(\"Atlas Shrugged\" is a\
      \ trilogy, but Paul Johansson directed only Part I.)\n\nStep 2: Runtime of Andy\
      \ Morahan's \"Goal!\" trilogy films:\nAndy Morahan directed only the third film,\
      \ \"Goal! III: Taking on the World\" (2009).  \nLet's clarify the runtimes of\
      \ the entire \"Goal!\" trilogy:\n- \"Goal!\" (2005) directed by Danny Cannon:\
      \ approx. 118 minutes (1h 58min)\n- \"Goal II: Living the Dream\" (2007) directed\
      \ by Jaume Collet-Serra: approx. 115 minutes (1h 55min)\n- \"Goal III: Taking\
      \ on the World\" (2009) directed by Andy Morahan: approx. 96 minutes (1h 36min)\n\
      \nStep 3: Clarifying what the question specifically means:\nThe question says\
      \ explicitly: \"Is Paul Johansson's Atlas Shrugged shorter than Andy Morahan's\
      \ Goal! trilogy?\"\n\nHowever, we must be careful:  \n- Paul Johansson directed\
      \ only \"Atlas Shrugged: Part I\" (102 minutes).\n- Andy Morahan directed only\
      \ \"Goal III\" (96 minutes), NOT the entire Goal trilogy.\n\nBut the question\
      \ explicitly says \"Andy Morahan's Goal! trilogy,\" suggesting perhaps a misunderstanding.\
      \ Andy Morahan did NOT direct the entire trilogy; he only directed the third\
      \ film. The Goal trilogy was directed by three separate directors.\n\nThus,\
      \ there are two ways to interpret this question:\n\n1. If the question means\
      \ literally \"Andy Morahan's Goal trilogy\" (incorrectly assuming Morahan directed\
      \ all three films), then the runtime would be:  \n   Goal I (118 min) + Goal\
      \ II (115 min) + Goal III (96 min) = 329 minutes total.  \n   Atlas Shrugged\
      \ Part I (102 min) would indeed be shorter than 329 min.\n\n2. If the question\
      \ means correctly \"Andy Morahan's entry in the Goal trilogy,\" then the runtime\
      \ is only Goal III (96 min), and Atlas Shrugged Part I (102 min) is actually\
      \ longer.\n\nGiven the phrasing, the question explicitly says \"Andy Morahan's\
      \ Goal! trilogy,\" which seems to incorrectly imply Morahan directed all three\
      \ films. We must therefore assume the questioner mistakenly attributes the full\
      \ Goal trilogy to Morahan. Under this assumption, Morahan's \"Goal trilogy\"\
      \ runtime is 329 minutes, which is significantly longer than Paul Johansson's\
      \ Atlas Shrugged (102 min).\n\nThus, under the most reasonable interpretation\
      \ of the question as stated, Paul Johansson's \"Atlas Shrugged: Part I\" (102\
      \ min) is shorter than the total runtime of the Goal! trilogy (329 min).\n\n\

      1. Tex Avery and Chuck Jones are both known animation directors who worked on
      Looney Tunes cartoons.

      2. Looney Tunes Golden Collection is a DVD series that compiles classic Warner
      Bros. animated shorts.

      3. Tex Avery is primarily associated with Warner Bros. (early on) and MGM cartoons,
      but the Looney Tunes Golden Collection mostly includes Warner Bros. shorts.
      Chuck Jones is also closely associated with Warner Bros.

      4. "Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5" and "Looney Tunes Golden Collection:
      Volume 2" are both known DVD compilations of Looney Tunes cartoons.

      5. Typically, each volume of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection has roughly
      similar runtime, but there can be slight differences.

      6. Volume 2 (Chuck Jones) contains a total runtime of approximately 432 minutes
      (7 hours, 12 minutes).

      7. Volume 5 (Tex Avery featured, among other directors) has an approximate total
      runtime of about 417 minutes (6 hours, 57 minutes).

      8. Thus, Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5 (about 417 minutes) is indeed
      shorter than Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2 (about 432 minutes).

      87 minutes.


      Step 2: Identify the film referred to as "(CBE,BSC)''s The Card".

      - "(CBE,BSC)" almost certainly refers to the cinematographer and director Ronald
      Neame, who held both titles "CBE" (Commander of the Order of the British Empire)

      Musicians* has a runtime around 18-19 minutes, while Roman Kachanov''s *Shapoklyak*
      is usually listed as approximately 19-20 minutes.

      5. Therefore, Vasily Livanov''s *On the Trail of the Bremen Town Musicians*
      is indeed shorter (or at least equal, but not longer) than Roman Kachanov''s
      *Shapoklyak*.


      Thus, the answer is:
