      2. Then I need to find the runtime of "Baton Bunny" by Abe Levitow.

      3. Then I''ll compare their lengths.


      I know these are both Looney Tunes/Warner Bros. animated shorts featuring Bugs
      Bunny.


      However, I do not actually know their precise runtimes from memory. Without

      cartoons.


      2. "To Hare is Human" is a Chuck Jones cartoon featuring Wile E. Coyote and

      3. "Baton Bunny" is an Abe Levitow cartoon featuring Bugs Bunny, released in

      6. "Baton Bunny" is approximately 6 minutes and 20 seconds long.


      7. Since 6 minutes is shorter than 6 minutes and 20 seconds, "To Hare is Human"

      Step 3: Comparison

      - "God of Gamblers 3: The Early Stage" is 100 minutes long

      - "Khuda Gawah" is a Hindi film released in 1992

      - Its runtime is approximately 180 minutes (3 hours)


      3. Comparing the runtimes:

      - Anjathe: 150 minutes

      - Khuda Gawah: 180 minutes


      4. Is Anjathe shorter than Khuda Gawah?

      - 150 minutes is less than 180 minutes

      - So yes, Anjathe is shorter


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      2. Then I''ll find the runtime of Mukul S. Anand''s "Khuda Gawah"

      3. Then I''ll compare their lengths


      Step 1: Checking "Anjathe"

      - "Anjathe" is a 2008 Tamil film directed by Mysskin

      - Its runtime is approximately 150 minutes (2 hours 30 minutes)


      Step 2: Checking "Khuda Gawah"

      - "Khuda Gawah" is a 1992 Hindi film directed by Mukul S. Anand

      - Its runtime is approximately 180 minutes (3 hours)


      Step 3: Comparison

      - Anjathe: 150 minutes

      - Khuda Gawah: 180 minutes

      - 150 < 180, so Anjathe is shorter

      - Includes films like "Hera Pheri" (2000) and "Phir Hera Pheri" (2006)

      - Total runtime of the main films is around 3-4 hours


      2. American Epic:

    eb57dfdd-d70a-46b4-a2fd-ceb711a94f82: 'Let me break this down step by step:


      1. First, I need to clarify which Michael Apted Narnia film is being referenced.
      I know he did not direct any Narnia films - those were directed by Andrew Adamson
      and later Michael Apted directed The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.


      2. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader was released in 2010 and has a runtime of
      approximately 115 minutes.


      3. Bob Clampett''s Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1 is actually a DVD
      collection of animated shorts, not a single film. These collections typically
      run several hours long.


      4. Even if just considering the individual Bob Clampett shorts, these would
      likely be much shorter than a feature film.


      5. Therefore, the Narnia film would be longer than the Looney Tunes collection.


      The answer is: NO'

      - It was released in 1957

      - It''s a historical epic film

      - These types of historical films are typically quite long


      2. Now, "Fifty Shades" by James Foley:

      - Historical epics from the Soviet era tend to be very long, often 3-4 hours

      - Modern romantic dramas are usually shorter
