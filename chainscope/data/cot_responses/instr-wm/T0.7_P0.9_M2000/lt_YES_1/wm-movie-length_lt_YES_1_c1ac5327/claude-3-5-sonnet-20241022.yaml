      a 2023 comedy special directed by Alex Timbers

      - "Dot in Space" is a feature-length animated film that runs approximately 70
      minutes

      - "John Mulaney: Baby J" is a comedy special with a runtime of about 85 minutes


      3. Comparing the two:

      70 minutes < 85 minutes


      YES - Dot in Space is shorter than Alex Timbers''s John Mulaney special.'

      28 minutes


      2. Compare the lengths:

      - Scrooge McDuck and Money: 15 minutes

      - Cruise of the Zaca: 28 minutes

      - 15 is less than 28


      Therefore:


      YES - Hamilton Luske''s "Scrooge McDuck and Money" is shorter than Errol Flynn''s
      "Cruise of the Zaca"'

      - "Scrooge McDuck and Money" runs for approximately 15 minutes

      - "Cruise of the Zaca" runs for approximately 28 minutes

    ebaafd30-9a82-4420-bc43-f630fef9c5e2: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me recall the lengths of these documentaries:

      - "Long Strange Trip" (2017) is approximately 238 minutes (nearly 4 hours)

      - "My Voyage to Italy" (1999) is approximately 246 minutes (just over 4 hours)


      2. To determine if Long Strange Trip is shorter, I need to compare:

      238 minutes < 246 minutes


      3. Since 238 is less than 246, Long Strange Trip is indeed shorter than My Voyage
      to Italy.

      2) American Epic by Bernard MacMahon is a documentary series consisting of:

      - 3 main episodes

      - Plus a feature-length film "The American Epic Sessions"

      Total runtime is approximately 5-6 hours.


      3) Comparing the two:

      - Hera Pheri series: ~4-5 hours

      - American Epic: ~5-6 hours

      Therefore, Hera Pheri series has a shorter total runtime.


      Answer: YES'
    e68717c3-3e42-48f3-9a8c-6fe3e60fda3a: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to identify what Hera Pheri series consists of:

      - Hera Pheri (2000)

      - Phir Hera Pheri (2006)

      These are two films in the series directed by Priyadarshan.


      2. Next, I need to identify what American Epic is:

      American Epic is a documentary series by Bernard MacMahon that consists of three
      main episodes plus a recording session film.


      3. Now to compare:

      - Hera Pheri series: 2 feature films

      - American Epic: 3 episodes + 1 recording session film = 4 parts total


      4. Based on number of installments:

      2 < 4


      Therefore: YES, the Hera Pheri series is shorter than American Epic in terms
      of number of installments.


      The answer is: YES'

      2. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader has a runtime of approximately 115 minutes
      (1 hour and 55 minutes).


      3. The Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1 is a DVD collection containing
      multiple classic cartoon shorts.


      4. A typical Looney Tunes cartoon is around 7-8 minutes, and the collection
      contains multiple discs with numerous cartoons, totaling several hours of content.


      5. The total runtime of the Looney Tunes collection would be significantly longer
      than a single feature film.


      Answer: NO - Apted''s Narnia film is not shorter than the Looney Tunes collection.'

      1. First, I need to identify the lengths of both movies

      2. Unfortunately, I cannot find a reliable runtime for "Dot and the Whale" (1986)

      3. For "Cat Girl" (1957), I can confirm it is approximately 69 minutes long

      4. Without being able to confirm the length of "Dot and the Whale", I cannot
      make a direct comparison

      5. Therefore, I cannot determine with certainty whether one is shorter than
      the other


      Given this lack of verifiable information to compare both runtimes, I cannot
      provide a definitive YES or NO answer to this question.'
