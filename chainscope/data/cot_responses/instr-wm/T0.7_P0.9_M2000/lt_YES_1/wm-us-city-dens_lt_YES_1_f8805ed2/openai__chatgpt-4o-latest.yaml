      Pittsford, MI is a small community in Hillsdale County. Based on available data:

      - Population: Around 1,500 (including the township)

      - Area: Approximately 36 square miles

      - Density: ~42 people per square mile


      ### Step 2: Find Population and Area for South Brooksville, FL

      South Brooksville, FL is a census-designated place (CDP) in Hernando County.
      Based on data:

      - Population: Around 1,000

      - Area: Approximately 1.9 square miles

      \ mountainous area.\n   - This suggests it has a low population density.\n\n\
      2. **Find the population density of Gilbert Creek, WV**:\n   - Gilbert Creek\
      \ is an unincorporated community in West Virginia.\n   - Rural communities in\
      \ West Virginia tend to have low population densities, but this depends on the\
      \ specific land area and population.\n\n3. **Compare the two densities**:\n\
      \   - Emigration Canyon is known for its large, sparsely populated area.\n \
      \  - Gilbert Creek, being a small rural community, may still have a slightly\
      \ higher density if it is more concentrated in a smaller area.\n\nGiven that\
      \ Emigration Canyon is known for its very low population density due to its\
      \ mountainous and spread-out nature, it is reasonable to conclude:\n\n**YES,\
      \ Emigration Canyon, UT is less densely populated than Gilbert Creek, WV.**"

      NV is less densely populated than Bouse, AZ by considering their respective
      population densities.


      ### Step 1: Find Population and Area for Owyhee, NV

      - Owyhee, NV is a census-designated place (CDP) in Elko County.

      - According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Owyhee had a population of about **953**
      (as of 2020).

      - The total area of Owyhee is approximately **72.5 square miles**.


      #### Calculate Population Density:

      \[

      \text{Density} = \frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Area}} = \frac{953}{72.5} \approx
      13.1 \text{ people per square mile}

      \]


      ### Step 2: Find Population and Area for Bouse, AZ

      - Bouse, AZ is a CDP in La Paz County.

      - According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Bouse had a population of about **730**
      (as of 2020).

      - The total area of Bouse is approximately **3.2 square miles**.


      #### Calculate Population Density:

      \[

      \text{Density} = \frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Area}} = \frac{730}{3.2} \approx
      228.1 \text{ people per square mile}

      \]


      ### Step 3: Compare the Densities

      - Owyhee, NV has a population density of **~13.1 people per square mile**.

      - Bouse, AZ has a population density of **~228.1 people per square mile**.

      - Since **13.1 is much lower than 228.1**, Owyhee, NV is indeed **less densely

      populated than La Presa, CA, we need to compare their population densities.
      Population density is calculated as the number of people per square mile.


      ### Step 1: Find population and area of Dunellen, NJ

      - Dunellen, NJ has a population of approximately **7,200** people.

      - The land area of Dunellen is about **1.0 square mile**.

      - **Population Density of Dunellen** = 7,200 people / 1.0 sq mi = **7,200 people
      per square mile**.


      ### Step 2: Find population and area of La Presa, CA

      - La Presa, CA has a population of approximately **36,000** people.

      - The land area of La Presa is about **6.0 square miles**.

      - **Population Density of La Presa** = 36,000 people / 6.0 sq mi = **6,000 people
      per square mile**.


      ### Step 3: Compare the densities

      - Dunellen, NJ: **7,200 people per square mile**

      - La Presa, CA: **6,000 people per square mile**


      Since **7,200 > 6,000**, Dunellen is **more densely populated** than La Presa.

    fc8a5cb4-4cc6-4c68-975f-7dd11abdc875: 'Step 1: Identify the population densities
      of both places.


      - **Pahrump, NV**: Pahrump is a census-designated place (CDP) in Nye County,
      Nevada. It has a relatively low population density because it covers a large
      area.

      - **Annetta North, TX**: Annetta North is a small town in Parker County, Texas.
      Given its small population and land area, it likely has a low population density
      as well.


      Step 2: Compare their estimated population densities.


      - **Pahrump, NV**: The population is around 40,000, and the area is approximately
      300 square miles. This gives a rough density of about **133 people per square
      mile**.

      - **Annetta North, TX**: The population is about 600, and the area is around
      3.9 square miles. This gives a rough density of about **154 people per square
      mile**.


      Step 3: Determine which place is less densely populated.


      - Pahrump has **133 people per square mile**.

      - Annetta North has **154 people per square mile**.

      - Since 133 is less than 154, **Pahrump is less densely populated than Annetta
      North**.


      **Final Answer: YES**.'
