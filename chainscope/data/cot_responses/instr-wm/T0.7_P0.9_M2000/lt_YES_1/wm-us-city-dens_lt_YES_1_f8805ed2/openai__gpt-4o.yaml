    7efed79d-ef6e-49b3-bcfd-1cee3e1ea52c: 'To answer this question, we need to compare
      the population density of Maury, NC, and Frazee, MN. Population density is typically
      measured as the number of people per square mile or square kilometer.


      Step 1: Find the population and area of Maury, NC.

      Maury, North Carolina, is an unincorporated community and does not have a formally
      recorded population density like incorporated cities. It is part of Greene County,
      and specific population data for such small communities may not be readily available.


      Step 2: Find the population and area of Frazee, MN.

      Frazee is a city in Becker County, Minnesota. According to recent data (e.g.,
      from the U.S. Census Bureau or other reliable sources), you would need to look
      up the latest population and area figures to calculate the population density.


      Step 3: Calculate or compare the population densities.

      Without specific numerical data available here, you would compare the known
      population and area values to determine density.


      Since Maury, NC, is an unincorporated community, it is likely to be less densely
      populated compared to a city like Frazee, MN, which has formal city governance
      and typically more defined population metrics.


      Conclusion: Based on the nature of Maury being a small, unincorporated community
      and Frazee being an incorporated city, it is reasonable to conclude that Maury,
      NC is less densely populated than Frazee, MN.

      \ latest available data, Troutdale has a population density of approximately\
      \ 3,300 people per square mile.\n\n2. **Determine Quinnipiac University, CT's\
      \ Population Density:**  \n   - Quinnipiac University is a private university\
      \ located in Hamden, Connecticut.\n   - The university itself is not a city,\
      \ but we can consider the campus population density in terms of the number of\
      \ students and staff per the area of the campus.\n   - Quinnipiac University\
      \ has an enrollment of around 9,000 students. The main campus is approximately\
      \ 600 acres, which is about 0.9375 square miles.\n   - This gives a rough population\
      \ density of about 9,600 people per square mile (considering students only and\
      \ excluding staff/faculty for simplicity).\n\n3. **Compare the Population Densities:**\n\
      \   - Troutdale, OR: ~3,300 people per square mile.\n   - Quinnipiac University,\
      \ CT: ~9,600 people per square mile.\n\nBased on this comparison, Troutdale,\

      1. **Greenvale, NY**: Greenvale is a hamlet in the town of North Hempstead,

      is more likely to be specific data available regarding its population density.


      3. **Comparing Densities**: We would need specific figures for the population
      and land area of both Greenvale and Port Jefferson Station to directly compare
      their population densities. Typically, areas in Nassau County, like Greenvale,
      tend to be more densely populated than those in Suffolk County, like Port Jefferson
      Station, due to Nassau County''s proximity to New York City and its more developed
      suburban environment.

      \ be hard to find.\n   - Camas, WA is a city located in Clark County, Washington.\n\
      \n2. **Obtain Population and Area Data:**\n   - For Camas, WA: According to\
      \ recent data, Camas has a population of approximately 26,000 people and covers\
      \ an area of about 10.6 square miles, which gives a population density of roughly\
      \ 2,453 people per square mile.\n   - For Penn Farms, PA: As it might not be\
      \ an incorporated city, specific population density data might not be readily\
      \ available. However, it's likely that it is a smaller, less urbanized area\
      \ compared to Camas.\n\n3. **Comparison:**\n   - Given that Penn Farms, PA is\

      less densely populated than Camas, WA, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify Penn Farms, PA**: First, we need to determine if "Penn Farms"
      is an official city or census-designated place. It might be a neighborhood or
      a smaller community within a larger municipality in Pennsylvania.


      2. **Identify Camas, WA**: Camas is a recognized city in Washington State. We
      can look up its population density, which is typically measured as the number
      of people per square mile or square kilometer.


      3. **Population Density of Camas, WA**: As of the latest available data, Camas
      has a population density of approximately 2,500 to 3,000 people per square mile.
      This can vary slightly based on the most recent census or estimates.


      4. **Population Density of Penn Farms, PA**: If "Penn Farms" is a neighborhood,
      it may not have a direct population density figure. We would need to look at
      the density of the broader area or municipality it is part of.


      5. **Comparison**: If Penn Farms is part of a larger city or township, we compare
      the known population density of that area with Camas, WA.


      Given these steps, if Penn Farms, PA is a part of a rural or less densely populated
      area in Pennsylvania, it is likely to be less densely populated than Camas,
      WA. However, without specific figures for Penn Farms, this is a general assessment.


      Since Penn Farms is not an officially recognized city or census-designated place,
      providing a concrete comparison isn''t feasible without additional context.
      But based on general assessments of rural vs. city population densities, the
      answer would lean towards:


      NO, without specific data for Penn Farms, PA, it is assumed to be less densely
      populated than Camas, WA.'
