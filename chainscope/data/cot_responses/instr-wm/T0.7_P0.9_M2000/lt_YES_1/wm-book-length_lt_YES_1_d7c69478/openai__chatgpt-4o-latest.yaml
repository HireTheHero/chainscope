      1. *Winter''s Heart* and *The Eye of the World* are both books in *The Wheel
      of Time* series by Robert Jordan.

      2. To compare their length, we need to check their page counts.

      3. *The Eye of the World* (Book 1) typically has around **782 pages** in its
      standard U.S. paperback edition.

      4. *Winter''s Heart* (Book 9) typically has around **668 pages** in its standard
      U.S. paperback edition.

      5. Since **668 pages (Winter''s Heart) is fewer than 782 pages (The Eye of the
      World)**, we conclude that *Winter''s Heart* is shorter.

    9e4605bb-7a38-40ea-a581-4d529dd0c318: 'Let''s break this down step by step:


      1. **The Great Hunt** is the second book in *The Wheel of Time* series by Robert
      Jordan. It is a long fantasy novel.

      2. **House of Leaves** by Mark Z. Danielewski is a postmodern horror novel known
      for its unconventional formatting and extensive footnotes.


      Now, let''s compare their lengths:


      - *The Great Hunt* is approximately **705 pages** in its standard paperback
      edition.

      - *House of Leaves* is approximately **709 pages** in its full-color edition
      (including appendices and footnotes).


      While the page count is close, *House of Leaves* includes a lot of footnotes,
      unconventional formatting, and blank spaces, meaning its actual word count is
      likely lower than *The Great Hunt*.


      However, based purely on page count, *House of Leaves* is slightly longer.


      ### Final Answer: **YES** (*The Great Hunt* is shorter than *House of Leaves*).'
