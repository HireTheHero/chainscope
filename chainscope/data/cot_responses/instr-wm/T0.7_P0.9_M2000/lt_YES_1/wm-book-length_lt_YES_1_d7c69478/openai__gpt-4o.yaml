      Portfolio" is shorter than Nick Mamatas''s "Move Under Ground," we need to consider
      the lengths of both works.


      1. **Kurt Vonnegut''s "Sucker''s Portfolio":** This is a collection of previously
      unpublished short stories and other writings by Vonnegut. It is not a full-length
      novel but rather a compilation of shorter works. The book typically has around
      200 pages, depending on the edition.


      2. **Nick Mamatas''s "Move Under Ground":** This is a full-length novel that
      combines elements of the Beat Generation with H.P. Lovecraft''s mythos. This
      book is generally around 220-250 pages, depending on the edition.


      Based on these typical page counts, "Sucker''s Portfolio," being a collection
      of shorter works, is generally shorter or roughly comparable in length to "Move
      Under Ground," but often slightly less in page count.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is:


      YES.'

      the lengths of "Sucker''s Portfolio" by Kurt Vonnegut and "Move Under Ground"
      by Nick Mamatas.


      1. **Sucker''s Portfolio by Kurt Vonnegut**: This is a collection of previously
      unpublished short stories, essays, and a poem. Being a collection rather than
      a single narrative, it is typically shorter than a full-length novel.


      2. **Move Under Ground by Nick Mamatas**: This is a novel, which generally means
      it is longer than a collection of short stories or essays.


      Given these considerations, "Sucker''s Portfolio" is likely to be shorter in
      length than "Move Under Ground."

      1. **Sucker''s Portfolio by Kurt Vonnegut**: This is a collection of previously

      2. **Move Under Ground by Nick Mamatas**: This is a novel that combines elements
      of the Beat Generation with Lovecraftian horror. It is a full-length novel.


      Comparing the two:


      - "Sucker''s Portfolio" is a collection of short works, generally resulting
      in a shorter overall length compared to a full-length novel.

      - "Move Under Ground" is a full-length novel, which typically implies a greater

      - "Octopussy and The Living Daylights," in its original form, is around the
      same length or potentially shorter than "The Book of Bunny Suicides," depending
      on the edition.

      - However, considering the nature of the content (text versus illustrations),
      "The Book of Bunny Suicides" is likely to have less textual content than "Octopussy
      and The Living Daylights."


      Therefore, while the page count might be similar, the textual content is less
      in Riley''s book compared to Fleming''s.


      So, the answer to whether "Octopussy and The Living Daylights" is shorter than

      1. **All Tomorrows by C. M. Kosemen**: This is a speculative evolution book

      often described as more of a novella or a long essay than a standard full-length
      book.


      2. **The Art of Drowning by Billy Collins**: This is a poetry collection by
      Billy Collins. Poetry books can vary in length, but they often have fewer pages
      than standard novels due to the nature of poetry (fewer words per page).


      Now, let''s compare the typical lengths of these works:


      - "All Tomorrows" is often around 100 pages or less, given its format and content.

      - "The Art of Drowning," like many poetry collections, is also around 100 pages.


      Given these considerations, both books are relatively short. However, typical
      editions of "The Art of Drowning" have slightly more pages than "All Tomorrows."
