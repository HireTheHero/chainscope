    4b6e4fa6-dc59-4756-bf25-f5181d151a37: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll look at the two zip codes: 70510 and 70528, both in Louisiana
      (LA)


      2. In US zip codes, the first digit represents a broad geographical region,
      and subsequent digits narrow down the location


      3. Both zip codes start with 705, which means they are in the same general region

      5. Comparing the last two digits: 10 is less than 28

    2473738d-cc1d-4444-8214-5681e5a54771: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s look at the two zip codes: 33040 and 33042


      2. In the US zip code system, the first digit or first few digits typically
      indicate a geographic region within a state


      3. These two zip codes are both in Florida (FL)


      4. The first three digits (330) are the same, which suggests these are in the
      same general region of Florida


      5. The last two digits differ: 40 vs 42


      6. In zip code numbering, a lower last two-digit number typically indicates
      a more southern location


      7. So 33040 is likely south of 33042


      8. In fact, 33040 is a zip code for Key West, which is at the southernmost point
      of Florida


      9. 33042 is in the Florida Keys region, but more north than Key West


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      3. Both zip codes start with 011, which means they are in the same general western
      Massachusetts region


      4. The last two digits (29 and 07) can help determine relative location


      5. In this case, 01129 has a higher last two digits (29) compared to 01107 (07)


      6. In Massachusetts, higher zip code numbers typically correspond to locations
      further north or west


      7. Therefore, 01129 is likely located north of 01107


      8. The question asks: "Is 01129, MA located south of 01107, MA?"


      9. Since 01129 is likely north of 01107, the answer is NO.


      Answer: NO'

    7184085f-aa08-4cc1-a557-e7ae726e5bbe: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll look at the first digits of these zip codes: 92025 and 92029


      2. Both start with 920, which means they are in the same general San Diego County
      area of California


      3. The last two digits (the "25" and "29" part) can indicate relative location
      within that area


      4. Comparing the last two digits, 92025 (25) is less than 92029 (29)


      5. In zip code systems, lower numbers often (but not always) correspond to more
      southern locations


      6. In San Diego County specifically, this pattern generally holds true


      7. So 92025 is likely located south of 92029


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

    f66e899b-d961-4a60-8469-5a4d6658b953: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll look at the two zip codes: 29640 and 29730, both in South Carolina
      (SC)


      2. In zip codes, the first three digits typically indicate the general geographic
      region within the state


      3. 29640 starts with 296, and 29730 starts with 297


      4. Since 296 comes before 297 numerically, this suggests 29640 is located north
      of 29730


      5. Therefore, 29640 is NOT located south of 29730


      The answer is: NO'

      1. First, let''s look at the zip codes: 98607 and 98663, both in Washington

      2. Zip codes in the US are generally assigned geographically, with lower numbers
      typically indicating locations further north and higher numbers indicating locations
      further south


      3. 98607 has a lower number (98607) compared to 98663 (98663)


      4. Therefore, 98607 is likely located NORTH of 98663


      5. So the answer to "Is 98607, WA located south of 98663, WA?" is:


      NO'

      5. The last two digits differ: 07 vs 63


      6. In zip code systems, a lower last two digits typically indicates a location
      further south or west


      7. So 98607 (with 07) is likely located south of 98663 (with 63)


      8. To confirm this, I can verify these are both in Clark County, Washington,
      with 98607 being closer to Portland and 98663 being in Vancouver


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'
