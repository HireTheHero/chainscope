      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 93657 is in California (CA)

      - 87402 is in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Consider their general geographic positions.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States, east of California


      Step 3: Consider their latitudes (north-south positioning).

      - California generally extends further north and south than New Mexico

      - However, I need to check the specific locations of these zip codes


      Step 4: Identify the specific locations.

      - 93657 appears to be in the Sanger area in central California

      - 87402 appears to be in the Farmington area in northwestern New Mexico


      Step 5: Compare latitudes.

      - Central California (where Sanger is located) is approximately at the same

      - The second digit is different: 5 for 35016 and 8 for 38655


      Step 4: The second digit in US zip codes often indicates position within the
      region, with lower numbers typically being further east and/or north

      - 35016 (with second digit 5) would likely be north of 38655 (with second digit
      8)

      - Alabama zip codes starting with 35 are generally in the northern part of Alabama

      - Mississippi zip codes starting with 38 are generally in the northern part
      of Mississippi


      Step 5: Looking at the specific locations:

      - 35016, AL is in north-central Alabama

      - 38655, MS is in northern Mississippi (Oxford area)

      - Northern Alabama is approximately at the same latitude as northern Mississippi


      Based on the zip code system and the geography of these states, 35016, AL is
      likely to be at a similar latitude or slightly north of 38655, MS, not south
      of it.


      NO, 35016, AL is not located south of 38655, MS.'
    b6189de4-ef13-43d8-aa04-be94bcf78b22: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the states and zip codes.

      - 35016, AL (Alabama)

      - 38655, MS (Mississippi)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Alabama and Mississippi.

      - Alabama is located east of Mississippi.

      - Both states are in the southern United States.


      Step 3: Consider the numeric patterns of zip codes in the US.

      - US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the eastern
      and northeastern parts of the country, while higher numbers tend to be in the
      western and southern regions.

      - The first digit of 3 for both zip codes places them in the southeastern US.

      - Within this region, the second digit helps determine relative north-south
      positioning, with lower second digits typically being further north.


      Step 4: Compare the specific zip codes.

      - 35016 (Alabama) has a lower second digit (5) than 38655 (Mississippi) with
      second digit (8).

      - This suggests that 35016 is likely further north within the southeastern region
      than 38655.


      Step 5: Verify with specific locations.

      - 35016 corresponds to Blountsville, Alabama, which is in the northern part
      of Alabama.

      - 38655 corresponds to Oxford, Mississippi, which is in the northern part of
      Mississippi.

      - When comparing their latitudes, Blountsville, AL is further north than Oxford,
      MS.

    ce3d74c5-c21d-499f-9b7d-025bdfff66f4: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 35016, AL is in Alabama

      - 38655, MS is in Mississippi


      Step 2: Understand the geographic relationship between Alabama and Mississippi.

      - Alabama is located east of Mississippi

      - They share a border, with Mississippi to the west of Alabama


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbers.

      - In the US zip code system, generally lower numbers are in the eastern and
      northeastern parts of the country, while higher numbers tend to be in the western
      and southern regions

      - However, this pattern isn''t precise enough for determining north/south relationships
      between neighboring states


      Step 4: Look at the specific locations.

      - 35016 is in Alabama, likely in the northern part of the state based on the
      first digit (3)

      - 38655 is in Mississippi, also likely in the northern part based on the first
      digit (3)

      - The first digits being similar suggests they''re in roughly the same latitude
      band


      Step 5: Check the actual locations.

      - 35016, AL is in north-central Alabama (Blount County area)

      - 38655, MS is in northern Mississippi (Oxford area)

      - Northern Mississippi is generally at a similar latitude to north-central Alabama


      Step 6: Make the north/south comparison.

      - 35016, AL is approximately at the same latitude as 38655, MS, or slightly
      north

      - It is not south of 38655, MS


      NO'

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 35016 is in Alabama (AL)

      - 38655 is in Mississippi (MS)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Alabama is located east of Mississippi. Both states share a border, with Mississippi
      to the west of Alabama.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      In the US zip code system, generally lower numbers tend to be in the eastern
      and southern parts of the country, while higher numbers tend to be in the western
      and northern parts. Within this pattern, the first digit broadly indicates geographic
      region.


      Step 4: Compare the zip codes.

      - 35016 (AL) starts with "3", which typically covers southeastern states

      - 38655 (MS) also starts with "3", but is a higher number


      Step 5: Determine relative north-south positioning.

      Since both states are in the same general region (southeast US), and Alabama
      and Mississippi are side-by-side (east-west), the zip code numbers can give
      us clues about north-south positioning. The higher number (38655) suggests a
      more northern location than the lower number (35016).


      NO, 35016, AL is not located south of 38655, MS. It is likely located north
      of it.'

      35016, AL is located south of 38655, MS. Let me think step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 35016 is a zip code in Alabama (AL)

      - 38655 is a zip code in Mississippi (MS)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Alabama and Mississippi.

      - Alabama is east of Mississippi

      - Alabama and Mississippi share a border


      Step 3: Consider what the zip code numbers might tell us.

      - In the US zip code system, lower numbers generally (but not always) correspond
      to more eastern and northern locations

      - 35016 (Alabama) has a lower number than 38655 (Mississippi)


      Step 4: Check the north-south relationship specifically.

      - Alabama zip codes in the 350xx range are typically in the north-central part
      of Alabama

      - Mississippi zip codes in the 386xx range are typically in the northern part
      of Mississippi

      - 35016 is in north-central Alabama, likely around the same latitude or slightly
      south of northern Mississippi

      - 38655 is in northern Mississippi (Oxford area)


      Step 5: Based on the specific locations, 35016 (Adger, AL) is in central Alabama,
      while 38655 (Oxford, MS) is in northern Mississippi. Looking at their positions
      on a map, 35016 is south of 38655.

      - 15909 is in the Johnstown area in Cambria County


      Step 4: Comparing their positions:

      - Johnstown (15909) is in central PA, east of Pittsburgh and at a higher elevation
      in the Allegheny Mountains

      - Johnstown (15909) is in central-western PA

      - Geographically, Johnstown is northeast of Pittsburgh


      Step 4: When comparing north-south positions:

      - Pittsburgh (15140) is further south than Johnstown (15909)

      - Ohio is located south of the Great Lakes, below the northeastern states


      Step 3: Looking at their latitudes:

      - Connecticut is generally around 41-42 degrees north latitude

      - Ohio is generally around 38-42 degrees north latitude


      Step 4: More specifically, ZIP code 44839 is in northern Ohio, while ZIP code
      06514 is in Connecticut.

      - Northern Ohio is at a similar latitude to Connecticut

      - However, Connecticut as a whole is north of most of Ohio


      Since Ohio is generally south of Connecticut, and even northern Ohio ZIP codes
      tend to be south of Connecticut ZIP codes, I can conclude:


      YES, 44839, OH is located south of 06514, CT.'

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 77031 is a zip code in Houston, Texas, in the southwestern part of the city.

      - 77061 is also a zip code in Houston, Texas, located in the southeastern part
      of the city.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - In Houston, zip codes generally follow a pattern where those closer to downtown
      have lower numbers within the same first three digits.

      - Both zip codes start with 770, indicating they''re in the same general region
      of Houston.

      - Looking at their specific locations, 77031 is in the southwest Houston area
      (around Sharpstown/Alief area).

      - 77061 is in the southeast Houston area (around Gulfgate/South Park area).


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - While both are in the southern part of Houston, 77031 is more westerly while
      77061 is more easterly.

      - In terms of north-south positioning, they are roughly at similar latitudes,
      but 77031 is actually slightly north of 77061.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 44065 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)

      - 46506 is a zip code in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Indiana is west of Ohio

      - Ohio and Indiana are roughly at similar latitudes, but their zip codes follow
      different patterns


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      - In the US zip code system, generally lower numbers tend to be in the eastern
      parts of the country, while higher numbers tend to be in the western parts

      - The first digit indicates a broad region (4 covers parts of the Midwest including
      Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, etc.)

      - The second and third digits typically indicate more specific regions within
      that area


      Step 4: Compare the specific zip codes.

      - 44065 (OH) starts with "440" which is in the northern part of Ohio

      - 46506 (IN) starts with "465" which is in the northern part of Indiana


      Step 5: Make the north-south determination.

      - The "440" prefix in Ohio typically covers areas near Cleveland in the northern
      part of the state

      - The "465" prefix in Indiana typically covers areas in the northern part of
      Indiana

      - Since both are in the northern parts of their respective states, and Ohio
      and Indiana are at similar latitudes, I need to look at the specific locations


      Based on the zip code patterns, 44065 (Newbury, OH) is in northeast Ohio near
      Cleveland, while 46506 (Bremen, IN) is in northern Indiana. When comparing these
      specific locations, 44065 in Ohio is slightly NORTH of 46506 in Indiana, not
      south.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 37367 is a zip code in Tennessee (TN)

      - 28658 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic relationship between Tennessee and North Carolina.

      - Tennessee is generally west and slightly south of North Carolina

      - They share a border, with North Carolina being to the east of Tennessee

      - The border between them runs roughly east-west, with some irregularities


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbers.

      - In the US zip code system, the first three digits generally indicate a sectional
      center facility

      - However, zip codes don''t directly correlate to latitude (north-south position)


      Step 4: Look at the specific locations.

      - 37367 appears to be in the southeastern part of Tennessee (likely near Chattanooga
      area)

      - 28658 is in western North Carolina


      Step 5: Compare latitudes.

      - The southeastern part of Tennessee (where 37367 is located) is generally at
      a similar latitude or slightly south of western North Carolina (where 28658
      is located)

      - Tennessee''s southeastern region is indeed south of most of western North
      Carolina


      Based on the geographic arrangement of these states and these specific regions,
      37367, TN is located south of 28658, NC.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 36582 is a ZIP code in Alabama (AL)

      - 32351 is a ZIP code in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Alabama and Florida.

      Alabama is generally located north of Florida, as Florida is the southernmost
      state in the continental United States. Alabama borders Florida along Florida''s
      northern border.


      Step 3: Consider the specific ZIP codes.

      While Alabama is generally north of Florida, we need to check these specific
      ZIP codes, as some parts of Alabama could potentially extend south of certain
      parts of northern Florida.


      Step 4: Analyze the ZIP code numbers.

      In the US postal system, ZIP codes generally (though not perfectly) follow geographic
      patterns. Lower ZIP code numbers in the same region typically indicate more
      southern locations. Here we have:

      - 36582 (Alabama)

      - 32351 (Florida)


      The Florida ZIP code has a lower number (32xxx vs 36xxx), which suggests it''s
      likely further south.


      Step 5: Verify the specific locations.

      36582 appears to be in the Mobile, Alabama area (southern Alabama)

      32351 appears to be in the Florida Panhandle (northern Florida)


      Even though 36582 is in southern Alabama, it would still be north of any part
      of Florida, including the Panhandle area where 32351 is located.

      35-36.


      Step 4: The specific case of these ZIP codes.

      - 32351 is in northern Florida (since Florida ZIP codes start with 32-34)

      - 36582 is in southern Alabama (since it''s in the 365xx range)


      Step 5: Draw a conclusion based on the states'' relative positions.

      Since Alabama is north of Florida, and these specific ZIP codes are in southern
      Alabama and northern Florida respectively, it''s highly unlikely that the Alabama
      ZIP code is south of the Florida one.

      NY?


      Let me think step by step:


      1) First, I need to understand how zip codes are generally organized in New
      York state.

      2) In the US postal system, the first three digits of a zip code typically indicate
      a sectional center facility (SCF).

      3) In New York state, lower zip code numbers generally correspond to locations
      further south.

      4) 13323 starts with "133" while 14228 starts with "142".

      5) Since 133 < 142, this suggests that 13323 is likely south of 14228.

      6) However, I should verify this pattern specifically for NY zip codes.

      7) In New York state, zip codes beginning with 100-119 are for NYC area, 120-129
      for Albany/northeastern NY, 130-139 for Syracuse/central NY, and 140-149 for
      Buffalo/western NY.

      8) Since 13323 is in the 130s range (Syracuse/central NY) and 14228 is in the
      140s range (Buffalo/western NY), and Buffalo is further north than Syracuse,
      13323 would be south of 14228.

      south of 14228, NY. Let me think step by step.


      Step 1: Let me identify these zip codes.

      - 13323 is a zip code in New York state

      - 14228 is also a zip code in New York state


      Step 2: In the US zip code system, generally:

      - First digit indicates a broad geographical region (1 is for northeastern states)

      - The first three digits typically represent a sectional center facility

      - Lower numbers in the same region often (but not always) indicate locations
      further south


      Step 3: Specifically for New York:

      - Zip codes beginning with 130-139 typically cover central and northern NY

      - Zip codes beginning with 140-149 typically cover western NY (including Buffalo
      area)


      Step 4: 13323 is in Deansboro, central NY

      - 14228 is in Williamsville, near Buffalo in western NY


      Step 5: Geographically, central NY (13323) is generally east and south of western
      NY/Buffalo area (14228)


      Based on the geographical locations of these zip codes, 13323 (Deansboro) is

      Step 1: Let me identify what these zip codes represent.

      - 13323 is a zip code in New York state

      - 14228 is also a zip code in New York state


      Step 2: Consider what zip code patterns tell us about location.

      In the US zip code system, generally lower numbers tend to be in the eastern
      and southern parts of the country, while higher numbers tend to be in the western
      and northern parts. Within New York state, lower zip codes are generally in
      the southern and eastern parts of the state.


      Step 3: Compare the specific zip codes.

      13323 has a lower first digit (1) than 14228 (1), but that doesn''t help since
      they both start with 1.

      Looking at the second digit, 13323 has a 3, while 14228 has a 4.

      In New York state, zip codes starting with 13xxx are generally in the central
      part of the state, while 14xxx are typically in the western part.


      Step 4: Based on the zip code pattern in New York:

      - 13xxx zip codes cover central NY (including areas like Utica, Syracuse)

      - 14xxx zip codes cover western NY (including Buffalo area)


      Since central NY (13xxx) is east of western NY (14xxx), and in NY state the
      northern regions are generally assigned higher numbers within each prefix group,
      13323 would be east and likely north of 14228, not south of it.


      NO, 13323, NY is not located south of 14228, NY. It is likely located east and

      south of 55055, MN by analyzing these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 54474 is a zip code in Wisconsin (WI)

      - 55055 is a zip code in Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Wisconsin and Minnesota.

      - Minnesota is generally north of Wisconsin, as Wisconsin borders Minnesota
      to the south.


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      - In the US zip code system, lower numbers in the first three digits generally
      (but not always) indicate more southern locations within a region.

      - 544xx (Wisconsin) vs 550xx (Minnesota) - these are close, but the 544xx is
      slightly lower.


      Step 4: Verify the specific locations.

      - 54474 appears to be in central Wisconsin (Rosholt area)

      - 55055 appears to be in eastern Minnesota (Marine on St. Croix area)


      Step 5: Determine relative positions.

      positions of two zip codes to answer whether 54474, WI is south of 55055, MN.


      Step 1: Let me identify what states these zip codes are in.

      - 54474 is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - 55055 is in Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Wisconsin and Minnesota.

      - Minnesota is located north of Wisconsin, with Minnesota bordering Wisconsin''s
      northwestern border.


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code numbers.

      - In the US postal system, zip codes generally follow geographic patterns.

      - Within the same region, lower zip code numbers tend to be south of higher
      zip code numbers.

      - 54474 (Wisconsin) has a lower number than 55055 (Minnesota).

      - This aligns with the general north-south relationship between these states.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on both state locations and zip code patterns.

      - Since Minnesota is generally north of Wisconsin, and the zip code numbering
      pattern supports this (lower number in Wisconsin, higher in Minnesota), 54474,
      WI is very likely south of 55055, MN.


      YES, 54474, WI is located south of 55055, MN.'

      - New Jersey is located south of Connecticut


      Step 3: More specifically, all of New Jersey is south of Connecticut. The northernmost
      parts of New Jersey are still south of the southernmost parts of Connecticut.


      Step 4: Since 07421 is in New Jersey and 06605 is in Connecticut, and New Jersey
      is south of Connecticut, it follows that 07421, NJ must be south of 06605, CT.


      YES, 07421, NJ is located south of 06605, CT.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 07421 is a ZIP code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 06605 is a ZIP code in Connecticut (CT)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the northeastern United States.

      - Connecticut is located north of New Jersey

      - Connecticut borders New York to its south

      - New Jersey is south of New York


      Step 3: More specifically, ZIP codes starting with 066 are in the southern part
      of Connecticut (Bridgeport area), while ZIP codes starting with 074 are in the
      northern part of New Jersey.


      Step 4: Even though 07421 is in northern New Jersey, any location in New Jersey
      would still be south of Connecticut geographically.

      NO


      Actually, I need to be more precise. Let me verify this more carefully:


      Zip code 07421 is in Stockholm, NJ, which is in the northern part of New Jersey.

      Zip code 06605 is in Bridgeport, CT, which is in the southern part of Connecticut.


      While New Jersey is generally south of Connecticut, the northern parts of New
      Jersey could potentially be at a similar latitude to southern Connecticut.


      Looking at the actual coordinates, Bridgeport, CT (06605) is indeed north of
      Stockholm, NJ (07421), as Connecticut is entirely north of New Jersey on the

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 43125 is a ZIP code in Ohio (OH)

      - 46235 is a ZIP code in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Ohio and Indiana.

      - Indiana is located west of Ohio

      - Both states share a border that runs roughly east-west


      Step 3: Analyze the ZIP code patterns.

      - In the US ZIP code system, generally lower numbers tend to be in the eastern
      and southern regions, while higher numbers tend to be in the western and northern
      regions

      - The first digit indicates a broad geographical region (4 covers several Midwestern
      states)

      - The second and third digits typically indicate more specific areas within
      that region


      Step 4: Compare the specific ZIP codes.

      - 43125 (OH) starts with 431xx, which is in the southern portion of Ohio

      - 46235 (IN) starts with 462xx, which is in the central/northern portion of
      Indiana

      - The higher first three digits of 46235 suggest it is further north than 43125


      Step 5: Verify with geographical knowledge.

      - ZIP codes beginning with 431xx are generally in the Columbus, OH area (central-southern
      Ohio)

      - ZIP codes beginning with 462xx are generally in the Indianapolis, IN area
      (central Indiana)

      is more southern


      Step 4: Verify with ZIP code patterns.

      - Ohio ZIP codes start with 43-45

      - Indiana ZIP codes start with 46-47

      - The lower first digits of the Ohio ZIP code (43xxx) compared to the Indiana

      Step 1: Let me identify these zip codes.

      - 35215 is a zip code in Alabama (AL)

      - 36201 is also a zip code in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: In the US zip code system, generally (though with some exceptions):

      - Lower zip codes in the same state tend to be in the northern parts

      - Higher zip codes tend to be in the southern parts


      Step 3: Comparing these zip codes:

      - 35215 has a lower numerical value than 36201

      - This suggests that 35215 is likely north of 36201, not south of it


      Step 4: To verify, I know that in Alabama specifically, zip codes starting with
      35xxx are generally in the northern/central part of the state (including Birmingham
      area), while 36xxx zip codes cover the central/southern regions.


      Based on this analysis, 35215 (Birmingham area) is located north of 36201 (Anniston
      area), not south.

      Step 1: I need to understand how US zip codes are organized in Alabama.

      In the US postal system, zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers
      tend to be in the northern parts of a state, and higher numbers tend to be in
      the southern parts. However, this is not always consistent, so I should verify.


      Step 2: Compare the two zip codes.

      35215 is a lower number than 36201.


      Step 3: For Alabama specifically, zip codes beginning with 35xxx are generally
      in the central/northern part of the state (including Birmingham area), while
      36xxx zip codes tend to be in the central/eastern parts.


      Step 4: 35215 is in the Birmingham area in central Alabama, while 36201 is in
      the Anniston area in eastern Alabama.


      Step 5: Looking at their relative positions, Birmingham (35215) is actually
      north and west of Anniston (36201), despite having the lower zip code. This
      is one of those exceptions to the general pattern.

      - 35215 is a zip code in Alabama (AL)

      - 36201 is also a zip code in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: In the US zip code system, generally (though with exceptions):

      - Zip codes increase as you move from south to north in the eastern United States

      - Alabama is in the eastern United States


      Step 3: Compare the numeric values:

      - 35215 is a lower number than 36201

      - In Alabama, lower zip codes tend to be in the southern part of the state compared
      to higher zip codes


      Step 4: Based on the zip code numbering pattern in Alabama, since 35215 is a

      - 35215 is a zip code in Alabama, likely in the Birmingham area.

      - 36201 is a zip code in Alabama, likely in the Anniston area.


      Step 2: Consider the zip code numbering system in the US.

      In the US postal system, zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers
      are typically assigned to areas in the northeastern US, and numbers increase
      as you move south and west.


      Step 3: Compare the zip codes.

      35215 is a lower number than 36201.


      Step 4: Apply the pattern to Alabama specifically.

      In Alabama, zip codes generally increase from south to north. Lower zip codes
      (like those starting with 35xxx) tend to be in the southern and central parts
      of Alabama, while higher zip codes (like 36xxx) tend to be in the northern parts.


      Step 5: Make the determination.

      Since 35215 is a lower number than 36201, and in Alabama lower zip codes are
      generally more southern than higher zip codes, 35215 is likely south of 36201.

      Step 3: Given that pattern, 35215 is a lower number than 36201, which suggests
      that 35215 would be located NORTH of 36201, not south.


      Step 4: To verify, 35215 is a ZIP code in the Birmingham area, which is in north-central
      Alabama, while 36201 is in the Anniston area, which is in east-central Alabama
      but further south than Birmingham.

      - 46761 is in Indiana (IN), which is also in the Midwest region.


      Step 2: Consider the relative north-south positioning of Iowa and Indiana.

      - Iowa is generally positioned to the west and slightly north of Indiana.

      - Indiana is east of Iowa.


      Step 3: Looking at their latitudes more specifically:

      - Iowa zip codes starting with 50 are typically in the central part of Iowa.

      - Indiana zip codes starting with 46 are typically in the central to southern
      part of Indiana.


      Step 4: When comparing states, Iowa''s southern border is approximately at the

      - 50322 is a ZIP code in Iowa (IA)

      - 46761 is a ZIP code in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Recall the general geographic arrangement of these states.

      - Iowa is located west of Indiana

      - Iowa is generally in the northern central part of the US

      - Indiana is in the east-central part of the US


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes based on ZIP code patterns.

      - In the US ZIP code system, generally (though not perfectly), lower numbers
      in the first three digits indicate more northerly locations

      - 503xx (Iowa) has a higher first three digits than 467xx (Indiana)

      - This suggests Iowa''s 50322 is likely south of Indiana''s 46761


      Step 4: Verify with knowledge of US geography.

      - Despite the ZIP code pattern, Iowa is actually positioned slightly north of
      Indiana on the map

      - The ZIP code system doesn''t perfectly correlate with north-south positioning
      between different states


      NO, 50322, IA is not located south of 46761, IN. Iowa is generally north of

      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 87102 is in New Mexico (NM)

      - 86005 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Arizona is west of New Mexico

      - However, the question asks about north/south positioning, not east/west


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code numbering system.

      - In the US zip code system, generally lower numbers are in the eastern and
      northern parts of the country, while higher numbers are in the western and southern
      parts

      - Within the same first digit (8 in this case), the second digit often indicates
      north-south positioning

      - 87xxx (New Mexico) has a higher second digit than 86xxx (Arizona)

      - This suggests 87xxx would typically be south of 86xxx


      Step 4: Verify with specific knowledge about these zip codes.

      - 87102 is in Albuquerque, New Mexico

      - 86005 is near Flagstaff, Arizona

      - Albuquerque is indeed south of Flagstaff

      - Maryland is generally east and northeast of West Virginia

      - West Virginia is positioned south and west of Maryland''s main body, though
      their borders are irregular


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Baltimore (21229) is located in northern Maryland, near the top of the state

      - Clarksburg (26301) is in north-central West Virginia

      - When comparing latitudes, Baltimore is further north than Clarksburg


      Step 4: Make the determination based on north-south positioning.

      - Since Baltimore (21229) is further north than Clarksburg (26301), it is NOT
      south of Clarksburg

      - Therefore, 21229, MD is NOT located south of 26301, WV

      Step 1: Identify the states for these zip codes.

      - 27233 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 38555 is in Tennessee (TN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between North Carolina and Tennessee.

      - Tennessee is located directly north of North Carolina.

      - North Carolina is south of Tennessee.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - Since 27233 is in NC and 38555 is in TN, and NC is south of TN, then 27233
      (NC) must be south of 38555 (TN).


      Step 4: Verify there are no unusual geographic anomalies.

      - These states share a fairly straight border, and there are no unusual geographic
      extensions that would change the north-south relationship.


      YES, 27233, NC is located south of 38555, TN.'

      if 27233, NC is south of 38555, TN.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 27233 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 38555 is a zip code in Tennessee (TN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of North Carolina and Tennessee.

      - Tennessee is located directly north of North Carolina

      - In general, North Carolina locations are south of Tennessee locations


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      - While zip codes aren''t perfectly aligned with latitude, they do follow some
      geographic patterns

      - The first three digits of a zip code represent a sectional center facility

      - Lower zip code numbers in this region generally correspond to more southern/eastern
      areas


      Step 4: Compare the specific zip codes.

      - 27233 (NC) has a lower number than 38555 (TN)

      - This aligns with the general geographic relationship between the states


      Step 5: Make a conclusion based on state boundaries.

      - Since 27233 is in North Carolina, and 38555 is in Tennessee, and North Carolina
      is south of Tennessee, 27233 NC is south of 38555 TN.

      - 27233 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 38555 is in Tennessee (TN)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographical positions of these states.

      - North Carolina is located on the east coast of the United States

      - Tennessee is located west of North Carolina

      - North Carolina is generally south of Tennessee, though they share a border
      where NC''s western portion meets TN''s eastern portion

      - 27233 is in central North Carolina

      - 38555 is in eastern Tennessee


      Step 4: Compare latitudes (north-south positioning).

      - North Carolina zip codes starting with 272xx are typically in the central
      part of NC

      - Tennessee zip codes starting with 385xx are in the eastern part of TN

      - The central part of NC is south of eastern TN

      MD is located south of zip code 21782, MD. Let me think through this step by
      step.


      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of these zip codes in Maryland.

      - 21057 is the zip code for Glen Arm, Maryland, which is in Baltimore County
      in the northeastern part of the state.

      - 21782 is the zip code for Sharpsburg, Maryland, which is in Washington County
      in the western part of the state.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Glen Arm (21057) is located in northeastern Maryland, close to Baltimore.

      - Sharpsburg (21782) is located in western Maryland, near the border with West
      Virginia.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Maryland generally runs east-west in shape.

      - Glen Arm is in the northeastern part of the state.

      - Sharpsburg is in the western part, but importantly, it''s located in the far
      western panhandle of Maryland.

      - Geographically, Sharpsburg is actually slightly north of Glen Arm when comparing
      their latitudes.


      Therefore, Glen Arm (21057) is NOT south of Sharpsburg (21782). In fact, it''s
      slightly south and considerably east of Sharpsburg.


      NO'

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 21057 is a zip code for Glen Arm, Maryland

      - 21782 is a zip code for Sharpsburg, Maryland


      Step 2: Let me determine their relative positions in Maryland.

      - Glen Arm (21057) is in Baltimore County, in the northeastern part of Maryland

      - Sharpsburg (21782) is in Washington County, in the western part of Maryland


      Step 3: Let me compare their north-south positions.

      - Glen Arm is located in the northern part of Maryland, near Baltimore

      - Sharpsburg is located in western Maryland near the Potomac River, but is still
      in the northern part of the state

      - When comparing their latitudes, Glen Arm is approximately at the same latitude
      or slightly north of Sharpsburg


      Step 4: Make the determination based on their relative positions.

      Since Glen Arm (21057) is not south of Sharpsburg (21782), but rather at a similar
      latitude or slightly north, the answer is:


      NO'

      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of these zip codes in Maryland.

      - 21057 is a zip code in Maryland, specifically in the Baltimore area (Glen
      Arm).

      - 21782 is a zip code in Maryland, located in the western part of the state
      (Sharpsburg).


      Step 2: Consider the geography of Maryland.

      - Maryland''s geography is such that Baltimore and its surrounding areas (including
      Glen Arm) are in the central-eastern part of the state.

      - Sharpsburg is in Washington County in the western part of Maryland.


      Step 3: Determine the north-south relationship.

      - In Maryland, locations are generally aligned on a similar east-west latitude.

      - However, Baltimore area (including Glen Arm) is slightly north of the western
      Maryland areas.

      - Sharpsburg (21782) is south of the direct east-west line from Baltimore.


      Based on Maryland''s geography, Glen Arm (21057) is generally north of Sharpsburg
      (21782), not south.

      - 76148 is in Texas (TX)

      - 88330 is in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Let me determine their relative positions.

      - Texas is generally located east and south of New Mexico, as New Mexico borders
      Texas on Texas''s western side.

      - However, I need to check the specific zip codes, as border areas could have
      different relationships.
