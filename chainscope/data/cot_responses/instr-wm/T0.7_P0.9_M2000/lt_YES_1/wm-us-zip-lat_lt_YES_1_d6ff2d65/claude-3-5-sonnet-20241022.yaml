      1. Let me identify these locations:

      - 35016 is in Alabama (AL)

      - 38655 is in Mississippi (MS)


      2. Let me analyze the zip codes:

      - First digits: 35xxx vs 38xxx

      - The first digits in ZIP codes generally increase as you go north

      - 35xxx is a lower number than 38xxx, meaning it''s generally more southern


      3. Cross-check the states:

      - Alabama and Mississippi are adjacent states

      - They are roughly at similar latitudes

      - This pattern of ZIP codes should be reliable for these neighboring states


      4. Therefore:

      Since 35016 (AL) has a lower first digit than 38655 (MS), and this pattern is
      reliable for adjacent states, 35016 must be located south of 38655.

      2) First digit rule for zip codes:

      - 3xxxx covers southeastern states

      - Alabama zip codes start with 35-36

      - Mississippi zip codes start with 38-39


      3) Looking at a map:

      - Alabama is east of Mississippi

      - 35016 is in northern Alabama

      - 38655 is in northern Mississippi (Oxford area)


      4) Comparing latitudes:

      - Both locations are in similar latitude ranges in their respective states

      - Northern Alabama and northern Mississippi are roughly at the same latitude

      - Neither location is significantly further north or south than the other


      5) Final comparison:

      - These zip codes are at approximately the same latitude

      - 35016 AL is not clearly south of 38655 MS

      2. Let me break down what the zip code numbers tell us:

      - The first 3 digits of a zip code indicate the geographic area

      - 350xx is in northern Alabama

      - 386xx is in northern Mississippi


      3. Looking at a map:

      2) In the US ZIP code system:

      - First digit indicates a certain geographical region

      - 3xxxx codes are generally more southern than 3xxxx codes with higher numbers


      3) Comparing the codes:

      - 35016 starts with 35

      - 38655 starts with 38

      - 35 is less than 38, which means 35016 is generally located more south than
      38655


      4) Verifying with state locations:

      - Alabama is indeed generally south of Mississippi in their shared region

      AL is south of 38655 MS.

      1. Let me identify the locations:

      - 40601 is in Frankfort, KY (the state capital)

      - 40211 is in Louisville, KY


      2. Let me visualize their positions:

      - Louisville is in the northern part of Kentucky, along the Ohio River

      - Frankfort is in central Kentucky, south of Louisville


      3. Looking at a mental map:

      - Louisville (40211) is definitely further north than Frankfort (40601)

      - Therefore, Frankfort (40601) must be south of Louisville (40211)

      - 67101 is in Kansas (KS)

      2) In the US zip code system:

      - 29640 is Easley, SC

      - 29730 is Rock Hill, SC


      2) Let me find their locations in South Carolina:

      - Easley is in the northwestern part of SC, near Greenville

      - Rock Hill is in the northern part of SC, near Charlotte, NC


      3) Comparing their positions:

      - Easley (29640) is slightly further south than Rock Hill (29730)

      - However, the difference is small - both are in the northern third of SC

      - Rock Hill is more northeastern, while Easley is more northwestern
