      extend south of New Mexico''s southern border, the question is about the specific
      zip codes.  Because California is primarily west of New Mexico, a California
      zip code is unlikely to be directly south of a New Mexico zip code.

      4. **We don''t need the exact latitudes:**  Since California is significantly
      west of New Mexico, even if the latitudes were very close, the California zip
      code would still be considered south of the New Mexico zip code due to the curvature
      of the Earth.

      2. **General US Geography:** California is west of New Mexico.

      3. **North/South relationship based on West/East:**  Since California is west
      of New Mexico, the north/south relationship between these zip codes is not directly
      determined by their numerical values.  A lower number zip code in New Mexico
      could still be north of a higher number zip code in California.  We need to
      look at their actual locations.

      4. **Consider Latitudes:** We need to determine the latitude of each zip code.  A
      lower latitude means further south.

      5. **(Hypothetical) If needed:** If we can''t easily find the exact latitudes,
      we can consider the general north-south placement of the cities associated with
      the zip codes within their respective states.


      Since California is significantly west of New Mexico, simply comparing the numerical
      values of the zip codes is not enough to determine which is further south.  Therefore,
      more information is needed.  However, general geography knowledge suggests California
      is generally south of New Mexico, and zip code 93657 in California (near Porterville)
      is indeed south of 87402 in New Mexico (near Aztec).

      more for North/South comparisons.

      3. **Zip code implications:** While zip codes *can* give a general sense of
      location, they are not strictly organized for perfect North/South or East/West
      comparisons.  However, since Ohio is significantly east of Illinois, the zip
      codes are unlikely to contradict a broader geographical truth.

      3. **Relative north/south positions:** Indiana is generally west and slightly
      south of New Jersey.  However, slight west doesn''t automatically mean south.
      We need to consider latitude.

      4. **Latitude is the determining factor for north/south:**  We need more specific
      location information than just the states to be certain. Zip code 46750 (Huntertown,
      IN) is around 41 degrees north latitude. Zip code 07803 (Andover, NJ) is about
      41 degrees north latitude as well. They are at roughly the same latitude. Since
      the question is about being *south*, we need to determine if 46750 is at a *lower*
      latitude.

      and MN is Minnesota.

      2. **General US Geography:** Wisconsin is directly east of Minnesota.  Latitude
      lines run horizontally (East-West).  Therefore, a location further south will
      have a lower latitude number.

      3. **Comparing Zip Codes Within a State:**  Zip codes generally increase from
      East to West. This information isn''t directly helpful in comparing across states,
      but it''s good background context.

      4. **East vs. South:** Since Wisconsin is east of Minnesota, and not directly
      south, the primary determinant of north/south will be the latitude, not the
      zip code number itself.  Zip code numbers are more useful for East/West comparisons
      within a state.

      2. **General US Geography:** Wisconsin is generally east of Minnesota.

      3. **Latitude vs. Longitude:**  South implies a lower latitude.  East/West implies
      different longitude. Since Wisconsin is east of Minnesota, the primary factor
      for "south" will be the latitude difference, but the longitudinal difference
      makes a purely north/south comparison slightly skewed.

      4. **Zip Code Approximation:** Zip codes generally increase from east to west,
      and from south to north. So, a lower zip code in Wisconsin compared to Minnesota
      *suggests* a more southerly location, but doesn''t definitively prove it due
      to the east/west offset of the states.

      5. **Need for More Precise Data:** To be absolutely certain, we''d need to look
      up the exact latitude and longitude of each zip code. However, given the significant
      east/west offset of the states, and the relatively similar zip codes, it is
      *highly likely* 54474, WI is south of 55055, MN.


      NO. (While likely, without specific coordinates, we can''t be 100% certain.  The
      East/West offset of the states makes the zip code comparison less reliable.)

      south of MN (Minnesota).


      2. **Zip Code Magnitude within State (General Trend):**  While not a perfect
      rule, zip codes generally increase from east to west and south to north.  Since
      Wisconsin is south of Minnesota, we would expect a lower WI zip code to be south
      of a higher MN zip code, *generally*.


      3. **Specific Zip Codes:** 54474 is in Stevens Point, WI. 55055 is in Marine
      on St. Croix, MN.  Marine on St. Croix is in eastern Minnesota, near the Wisconsin
      border. Stevens Point is in central Wisconsin.


      4. **Conclusion:**  Given the relative locations of central Wisconsin and eastern
      Minnesota, and the general south-to-north increasing trend of zip codes, it''s
      highly likely 54474, WI is south of 55055, MN.

      2. **General US Geography:** Wisconsin is directly east of Minnesota.  Latitude
      lines run east-west.  Therefore, a comparison of North/South is primarily based
      on the zip code''s associated latitude.

      3. **Zip Code Magnitude (a general rule, with exceptions):** Generally, lower
      numbered zip codes are further west and north. Higher numbers trend east and
      south.  While not a perfect rule, it can be a helpful guide. 54474 is less than
      55055. This suggests 54474 *might* be further north.

      4. **State Line Consideration:** Since Wisconsin is east of Minnesota, and zip
      codes increase as you go east, the fact that 54474 is smaller than 55055 doesn''t
      definitively mean it''s further north.  The state line shifts the comparison.

      simply knowing the states doesn''t definitively tell us the north/south relationship.


      4. **Zip Code specifics:** We need more information than just the states. Zip
      codes give finer location details. Looking up these zip codes online would be
      the most accurate way to determine their relative positions.  However, since
      we can''t do that here, we have to rely on general knowledge.


      5. **General Latitude Trend:**  Lower zip codes *tend* to be further west and
      south.  54474 is numerically lower than 55055.  This *hints* that 54474 might
      be further south, but it''s not a guarantee due to the state difference.

      is in the Midwest.  The East Coast is generally east and slightly north of the

      is. Lower latitude numbers are further south. Since Massachusetts is east and
      *north* of Illinois, a zip code in MA is highly unlikely to be south of a zip
      code in IL.

      Iowa is generally going to be north of a location in Indiana.

      4. **Specific zip codes are irrelevant in this case:** Given the general north/south

      IN is Indiana.


      2. **General US Geography:** Iowa is directly west of Indiana.  Latitude lines
      run east-west.  Therefore, the north-south positioning is primarily determined
      by the zip code''s associated latitude.


      3. **Inferring Latitude from Zip Codes:**  Zip codes generally increase from
      east to west *and* south to north. Since Iowa is west of Indiana, we cannot
      directly compare the zip codes numerically to determine which is further south.


      4. **Conclusion:** Since Iowa is west of Indiana, the numerical values of the
      zip codes are not directly comparable for north/south determination. We need
      more information to definitively say whether 50322, IA is south of 46761, IN.  However,
      it is likely that 50322 is further north, as Iowa is generally further north
      than Indiana.


      **Answer: NO** (It''s highly probable that 50322, IA is *not* south of 46761,
      IN, but we can''t be 100% certain without looking up the exact coordinates)

      3. **Zip code magnitude and latitude:**  In general, lower numbered zip codes
      are in the Northeast, and zip codes increase as you move West and South.  Since
      Iowa is west of Indiana, this suggests 50322 might be further south, but the
      difference in state location makes the zip code numbers less reliable for direct
      comparison.
