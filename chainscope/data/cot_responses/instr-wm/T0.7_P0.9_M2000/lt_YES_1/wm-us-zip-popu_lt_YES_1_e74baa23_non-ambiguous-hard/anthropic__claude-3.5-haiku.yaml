      - This is a zip code for Florida City

      - Florida City is a small city with around 12,000 residents


      2. Next, I''ll look up the population of the zip code 07201 (New Jersey):

      - This appears to be a rural zip code in Virginia

      - Likely a small population area


      Step 2: 60653 (IL)

      - This is a zip code in Chicago, Illinois

      1. To compare population, I''ll need to look up the population of the towns/cities
      associated with these zip codes.


      2. 01430 is a zip code for Ashland, Massachusetts

      3. 14586 is a zip code for Pittsford, New York


      4. Ashland, MA has a population of around 17,800 (as of recent census data)

      5. Pittsford, NY has a population of around 29,400 (as of recent census data)


      6. Comparing these populations: 17,800 < 29,400


      7. Therefore, the population of the town with zip code 01430 (Ashland, MA) is
      indeed less populous than the town with zip code 14586 (Pittsford, NY)

    a93f4653-02e0-4959-a5ee-cabbdc053357: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll need to find the population of zip code 30290 in Georgia

      2. Then, I''ll find the population of zip code 67042 in Kansas

      3. Then I''ll compare their populations


      Step 1: Researching 30290 (GA)

      - This is a zip code for Newnan, Georgia

      - According to population data, this zip code area has approximately 35,000-40,000
      residents


      Step 2: Researching 67042 (KS)

      - This is a zip code for Sedgwick, Kansas

      - This appears to be a rural area with a much smaller population

      - Population estimates suggest around 2,000-3,000 residents


      Step 3: Comparison

      - 30290 (GA) has significantly more people than 67042 (KS)


      Therefore, 30290, GA is NOT less populous than 67042, KS.
