      are located:


      Red Mesa, AZ is in Arizona, which is a southwestern state in the US.

      Hoback, WY is in Wyoming, which is in the western US, north of Arizona.


      Geographically:

      - Arizona is located south of Wyoming

      - Therefore, cities in Arizona would generally be south of cities in Wyoming


      Since Red Mesa is in Arizona, and Hoback is in Wyoming, Red Mesa would be located
      south of Hoback.


      To confirm with more certainty:

      Wyoming is directly north of Colorado, which is directly north of New Mexico,
      which borders Arizona on the east. So Wyoming is definitely north of Arizona.</think>I
      need to determine the relative positions of these two cities based on their
      states.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each city is located.

      - Red Mesa is in Arizona (AZ)

      - Hoback is in Wyoming (WY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Wyoming is located in the northern part of the western United States

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Wyoming shares its southern border with Colorado and Utah

      - Arizona is even further south, below both Utah and Colorado

      - Therefore, Wyoming is entirely north of Arizona


      Step 4: Apply this to the cities.

      - Since Red Mesa is in Arizona and Hoback is in Wyoming, Red Mesa must be south
      of Hoback

      1. The question is asking about the relative positions of two cities: Red Mesa,
      AZ and Hoback, WY.

      2. Specifically, is Red Mesa, AZ south of Hoback, WY?


      To answer this, I need to consider the geographical positions of these locations:


      3. Red Mesa is in Arizona (AZ), which is a state in the southwestern United
      States.

      4. Hoback is in Wyoming (WY), which is a state in the western/northwestern United
      States.


      Generally speaking, in the continental United States:

      - Wyoming is located north of Arizona

      - Arizona borders Mexico to the south and is one of the southernmost states

      - Wyoming is much further north, bordering Montana and other northern states


      5. Since Red Mesa is in Arizona, and Hoback is in Wyoming, and Arizona is south
      of Wyoming, Red Mesa must be south of Hoback.


      So the answer would be YES, Red Mesa, AZ is located south of Hoback, WY.</think>#
      Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine if Red Mesa, AZ is south of Hoback, WY, I need to consider the
      geographic locations of these cities and their states.


      1. Red Mesa is located in Arizona (AZ), which is in the southwestern United
      States.


      2. Hoback is located in Wyoming (WY), which is in the northwestern United States.


      3. Looking at the relative positions of these states: Wyoming is located significantly
      north of Arizona. Wyoming borders Montana to the north, while Arizona borders
      Mexico to the south.


      4. Since the states themselves have this north-south relationship (Wyoming being
      north, Arizona being south), cities within these states would maintain this
      same general relationship.


      5. Therefore, Red Mesa in Arizona would be south of Hoback in Wyoming.

    707da2d5-7103-4cdc-880e-7c75aaa8d996: '<think>This question is asking me to determine
      whether Red Mesa, AZ (Arizona) is located south of Hoback, WY (Wyoming).


      Let me reason through this geographically:


      1) Arizona (AZ) is a state in the southwestern United States.

      2) Wyoming (WY) is a state in the western United States, located north of Arizona.


      In terms of the north-south arrangement of US states, Wyoming is definitely
      north of Arizona. The entire state of Wyoming is north of the entire state of
      Arizona.

      - Red Mesa is in Arizona (AZ)

      - Hoback is in Wyoming (WY)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, while Wyoming is located
      in the western United States, significantly north of Arizona.


      Step 3: Determine north-south relationship.

      Wyoming is entirely north of Arizona on the map. All locations in Wyoming are
      north of all locations in Arizona.


      Step 4: Apply this relationship to the specific cities.

      Since Red Mesa is in Arizona, and Hoback is in Wyoming, Red Mesa must be south
      of Hoback.

      is located directly north of New Mexico, which borders Arizona to the east.
      This means Colorado is generally north of Arizona.


      Step 2: Consider the specific cities.

      Peridot is located in central-eastern Arizona on the San Carlos Apache Indian
      Reservation.

      Fruita is located in western Colorado, near the Utah border.


      Step 3: Compare latitudes.

      Since Peridot is in Arizona and Fruita is in Colorado, and Arizona is entirely
      south of Colorado geographically, Peridot must be south of Fruita.


      YES'

      1. I need to determine the relative positions of Peridot, AZ and Fruita, CO.

      2. I know that AZ (Arizona) is a state in the southwestern United States.

      3. CO (Colorado) is a state that is north of Arizona.

      4. Generally, locations in Arizona will be south of locations in Colorado due
      to their relative state positions.

      5. Peridot is in Arizona, so it should be south of any location in Colorado,
      including Fruita.


      To be completely certain, I would need the exact coordinates of both cities,
      but based on the state locations alone, I can be confident that Peridot, AZ
      is indeed south of Fruita, CO because Arizona is south of Colorado.</think>I
      need to determine the relative positions of these two cities.


      Step 1: Identify the states. Peridot is in Arizona (AZ), and Fruita is in Colorado
      (CO).


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states. Colorado
      is located directly north of Arizona in the western United States.


      Step 3: Since these cities are in their respective states, a city in Arizona
      would generally be south of a city in Colorado.


      Step 4: Peridot is located in central-eastern Arizona, while Fruita is in western
      Colorado. Even though they''re not directly above/below each other, the state
      boundary relationship means Peridot must be south of Fruita.


      YES'

      of Peridot, AZ and Fruita, CO and compare their north-south positions.


      First, let me identify the states:

      - AZ is Arizona, which is located in the southwestern United States

      - CO is Colorado, which is north of Arizona


      Generally speaking, Arizona is south of Colorado. Their positions on a north-south
      axis would mean that locations in Arizona tend to be south of locations in Colorado.


      Peridot is in Arizona, so it''s in the southern state.

      Fruita is in Colorado, so it''s in the northern state.


      Given the general geography of the United States, with Colorado being directly
      north of Arizona, it''s highly likely that Peridot, AZ is south of Fruita, CO.


      So my answer would be YES, Peridot, AZ is located south of Fruita, CO.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative north-south positions
      of these two cities.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these cities are located.

      - Peridot is in Arizona (AZ)

      - Fruita is in Colorado (CO)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Colorado is located directly north of Arizona on the US map

      - Arizona shares its northern border with Utah and Colorado


      Step 3: Even without knowing the exact locations of these specific cities within
      their states, I can determine that any city in Arizona would be south of any
      city in Colorado, due to the overall geographic positioning of these states.


      YES, Peridot, AZ is located south of Fruita, CO.'

      by step:


      1. First, I need to identify the locations of Peridot, AZ and Fruita, CO.


      2. Peridot is in Arizona (AZ), which is a state in the southwestern United States.


      3. Fruita is in Colorado (CO), which is a state that borders Arizona to the
      northeast.


      4. In the United States, states that are more northern generally have higher
      latitudes, while states that are more southern have lower latitudes.


      5. Colorado is north of Arizona in general, as Arizona shares its northern border
      with Utah and Colorado is north of Utah.


      6. This means that cities in Arizona are generally south of cities in Colorado.


      7. Specifically, Peridot is in central/eastern Arizona, while Fruita is in western
      Colorado.


      8. Given the general geography of the two states, a city in Arizona (like Peridot)
      would be south of a city in Colorado (like Fruita).</think>To answer this question,
      I need to consider the geographic positions of these two cities.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Arizona (AZ) is located directly south of Colorado (CO) in the United States.
      Colorado is in the Rocky Mountain region, while Arizona is in the southwestern
      region.


      Step 2: Consider the specific cities within these states.

      Peridot is located in eastern Arizona on the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation.

      Fruita is located in western Colorado near the Utah border.


      Step 3: Compare latitudes.

      Even though these cities are in different parts of their respective states (east
      vs. west), the entire state of Arizona lies south of Colorado. The northernmost
      points of Arizona are still south of the southernmost points of Colorado.


      Step 4: Draw conclusion.

      Since Peridot is in Arizona and Fruita is in Colorado, and Arizona is entirely
      south of Colorado, Peridot must be south of Fruita.

      1. Determine the location of Peridot, Arizona

      2. Determine the location of Fruita, Colorado

      3. Compare their latitudes to see if Peridot is south of Fruita


      First, let''s consider the geographic layout of the US states:

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States

      - Colorado is located in the western United States, north of Arizona


      Based on this general knowledge, Arizona is south of Colorado. So a city in
      Arizona would generally be south of a city in Colorado.


      Peridot is a community in Arizona, and Fruita is a city in Colorado. Given the
      geographic relationship between the two states, Peridot, AZ would be south of
      Fruita, CO.


      To be more precise:

      - Peridot, AZ is located in central-eastern Arizona on the San Carlos Apache
      Indian Reservation

      - Fruita, CO is located in western Colorado near the Utah border


      Since Arizona is directly south of Colorado in the US map, and these cities
      are not at extreme opposite edges of their states that might create an exception,
      Peridot would be south of Fruita.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: First, I need to identify the locations of both cities.

      - Peridot is a community located in Arizona (AZ)

      - Fruita is a city located in Colorado (CO)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Arizona and Colorado.

      - Arizona is positioned in the southwestern United States

      - Colorado is positioned in the western United States, directly north of Arizona


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      - Since Arizona borders Colorado to the south, cities in Arizona will generally
      be south of cities in Colorado

      - Both Peridot and Fruita are within their respective states, not near unusual
      border areas that might create exceptions


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Peridot, AZ must be south of Fruita, CO because Arizona is south of Colorado

      2. Fruita, Colorado (CO)


      Specifically, it''s asking if Peridot, AZ is located south of Fruita, CO.


      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - Arizona (AZ) is a state in the southwestern United States

      - Colorado (CO) is a state that is north of Arizona


      In general, Arizona is south of Colorado since Arizona borders Mexico while
      Colorado is further north. Colorado''s southern border connects with the northern
      border of New Mexico, and Arizona is west of New Mexico.


      Given this general geographical arrangement, a city in Arizona (Peridot) would
      typically be south of a city in Colorado (Fruita).


      To be more precise:

      - Peridot, AZ is located in central-eastern Arizona

      - Fruita, CO is located in western Colorado


      Since Arizona is entirely south of Colorado, Peridot must be south of Fruita.</think>To

      Step 1: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      Arizona is located directly south of Colorado in the southwestern United States.
      Colorado''s southern border connects with New Mexico and Arizona is west of
      New Mexico.


      Step 2: Examine the specific cities'' locations.

      Peridot is located in central-eastern Arizona on the San Carlos Apache Indian
      Reservation.

      Fruita is located in western Colorado near the Utah border.


      Step 3: Compare latitudes.

      Since all of Arizona is south of Colorado''s southern border, any city in Arizona
      (including Peridot) must be south of any city in Colorado (including Fruita).


      YES, Peridot, AZ is located south of Fruita, CO.'

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Colorado is located directly north of Arizona in the United States

      - Arizona shares its northern border with Colorado (among other states)


      Step 3: Even if these cities aren''t directly north/south of each other, their
      state positions determine their relative north/south relationship.

      - Any location in Arizona will be south of any location in Colorado

      - This is true regardless of where specifically within their respective states

      Is Lecompton, KS located south of Prior Lake, MN?


      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to consider the states: Kansas (KS) and Minnesota (MN).

      2) Minnesota is located in the northern part of the central United States, bordering

      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Minnesota (MN) is a northern state, bordering Canada

      - Kansas (KS) is located in the central United States, south of Minnesota


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - Minnesota is typically much further north than Kansas

      - Prior Lake, MN would be somewhere in Minnesota

      - Lecompton, KS would be somewhere in Kansas

      So the answer is YES.</think>To determine if Lecompton, KS is located south

      Minnesota (MN) is located in the northern United States, while Kansas (KS) is
      located in the central United States. Minnesota is significantly north of Kansas.


      Step 2: Consider the cities within these states.

      Prior Lake is a city in Minnesota, which means it shares Minnesota''s northern
      position.

      Lecompton is a city in Kansas, which means it shares Kansas''s more southern

      Generally speaking, Minnesota is north of Kansas. On a US map, Minnesota borders

      Let me think about the locations:

      - Bolinas, CA is in California, which is generally south of Oregon

      - Prineville, OR is in Oregon, which is generally north of California


      Since California is south of Oregon, and Bolinas is in California while Prineville
      is in Oregon, it seems that Bolinas would be south of Prineville.


      To be more precise:

      - California is directly south of Oregon on the west coast of the United States

      - Bolinas is in Marin County, which is in the northern part of California, near
      San Francisco

      - Prineville is in central Oregon

      - Bolinas is in California (CA)

      - Prineville is in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between California and Oregon.

      - Oregon is located directly north of California on the west coast of the United
      States.

      - California lies entirely south of Oregon.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions of the specific cities.

      - Since Bolinas is in California, and Prineville is in Oregon, Bolinas must
      be south of Prineville.

      - Even though Bolinas is in northern California (Marin County), it still lies
      south of the California-Oregon border.

      - Prineville is in central Oregon, which places it north of any point in California.

      to determine the relative geographical positions of Garner, NC and Capitol Heights,
      MD.


      Step 1: Let me recall where these cities are located.

      - Garner, NC is in North Carolina, which is a state in the southeastern United
      States.

      - Capitol Heights, MD is in Maryland, which is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region
      of the United States.


      Step 2: Let me consider the general north-south positioning of these states.

      - North Carolina is located south of Maryland on the US East Coast.

      - The states from north to south along this region would be: Maryland, Virginia,
      North Carolina, South Carolina, etc.


      Step 3: Since Garner is in North Carolina, and Capitol Heights is in Maryland,
      and North Carolina is south of Maryland, Garner must be south of Capitol Heights.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both cities.

      - Garner, NC is in North Carolina

      - Capitol Heights, MD is in Maryland


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - Maryland is located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the US

      - North Carolina is located in the Southeastern region of the US

      - On a map, Maryland is north of North Carolina


      Step 3: Compare the positions.

      - Since Garner is in North Carolina, and Capitol Heights is in Maryland

      - And North Carolina is south of Maryland

      - Therefore, Garner must be south of Capitol Heights

      Garner, NC is located in North Carolina, which is a state in the southeastern
      United States.

      Capitol Heights, MD is located in Maryland, which is a state in the mid-Atlantic
      region of the United States.


      Generally speaking, North Carolina is south of Maryland. Maryland is just north
      of Washington DC, while North Carolina is several states south. The states between
      them would typically include Virginia (and possibly West Virginia depending
      on the exact locations).


      So geographically speaking, Garner, NC should be south of Capitol Heights, MD,
      since North Carolina is south of Maryland.


      To be more precise:

      - Capitol Heights, MD is in the Washington DC metropolitan area, near the eastern
      border of the District of Columbia

      - Garner, NC is near Raleigh, in the central part of North Carolina


      North Carolina is definitely south of Maryland, so Garner, NC is south of Capitol
      Heights, MD.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions of
      these two cities by examining their locations.

      - Garner is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Capitol Heights is in Maryland (MD)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Maryland is in the Mid-Atlantic region, bordering Washington D.C.

      - North Carolina is in the Southeast region, significantly south of Maryland

      - Maryland is north of Virginia, which is north of North Carolina


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Capitol Heights, MD is in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area

      - Garner, NC is near Raleigh in central North Carolina

      - Both cities are relatively central within their respective states, so the
      state-level geographic relationship holds


      Since North Carolina is entirely south of Maryland, Garner must be south of
      Capitol Heights.

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - La Plata is in Maryland (MD)

      - Kenilworth is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states

      Maryland is generally south of New Jersey. Maryland is a mid-Atlantic state
      below Pennsylvania, while New Jersey is in the northeastern United States, east
      of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Be more specific about these cities

      La Plata is in southern Maryland, in Charles County

      Kenilworth is in northern New Jersey, in Union County


      Given the geography of the United States, cities in Maryland are almost always

      south of New Jersey.


      So La Plata, MD should be south of Kenilworth, NJ.</think>I''ll solve this step
      by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both cities.

      - La Plata is in Maryland (MD)

      - Kenilworth is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Maryland is located south of New Jersey in the United States. New Jersey is
      in the Northeast, while Maryland is in the Mid-Atlantic region.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      La Plata is in southern Maryland (Charles County).

      Kenilworth is in northeastern New Jersey (Union County).


      Step 4: Determine the north-south relationship.

      Since Maryland is entirely south of New Jersey, and La Plata is in Maryland
      while Kenilworth is in New Jersey, La Plata must be south of Kenilworth.

      First, let me identify the states:

      - Kenilworth is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Now I need to think about the geographic relationship between these states.
      In the eastern United States:

      - Maryland (MD) is south of New Jersey (NJ)


      Maryland is located in the Mid-Atlantic region, while New Jersey is further
      north in the Northeast region. Looking at a mental map of the US, Maryland is
      definitely south of New Jersey.


      Since La Plata is in Maryland and Kenilworth is in New Jersey, it follows that
      La Plata is south of Kenilworth.

      Step 1: Identify the states these cities are located in.

      - La Plata is in Maryland (MD)

      - Kenilworth is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Maryland and New Jersey.

      - New Jersey is located in the northeastern United States

      - Maryland is located in the mid-Atlantic region

      - Maryland is positioned south of New Jersey on the map


      Step 3: Since cities within these states will generally follow the same north-south
      relationship as their states, La Plata (being in Maryland) would be south of
      Kenilworth (being in New Jersey).


      YES, La Plata, MD is located south of Kenilworth, NJ.'

      First, let me identify the states:

      - MD = Maryland

      - NJ = New Jersey


      Now, I need to recall the relative positions of these states in the US:

      - Maryland is located in the Mid-Atlantic region, south of Pennsylvania

      - New Jersey is also in the Mid-Atlantic region, east of Pennsylvania and south
      of New York


      Generally speaking, New Jersey is north of Maryland. This is because:

      - Maryland borders Virginia to its south and Pennsylvania to its north

      - New Jersey borders Pennsylvania to its west and New York to its north


      Now, for the specific cities:

      - La Plata is in Maryland

      - Kenilworth is in New Jersey


      Given the general geographical position of the states, it''s very likely that
      La Plata, MD is south of Kenilworth, NJ. Maryland is south of New Jersey, so
      cities in Maryland would typically be south of cities in New Jersey.</think>I''ll

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - La Plata is in Maryland (MD)

      - Kenilworth is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Next, I need to consider the relative geographic positions of these states:

      - Maryland is located in the Mid-Atlantic region

      - New Jersey is also in the Mid-Atlantic region

      - Importantly, New Jersey is positioned north of Maryland on the US east coast


      When comparing states from north to south along the eastern seaboard, the order
      includes:

      - New York

      - New Jersey

      - Pennsylvania (eastern part)

      - Maryland

      - Virginia


      Since Kenilworth is in New Jersey and La Plata is in Maryland, and New Jersey

      be south of any city in New Jersey (including Kenilworth).

      of Texas, Pottsboro, TX would be south of Maize, KS.</think>To answer this question,
      I''ll think about the geographic locations of these cities and their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these cities are located.

      - Pottsboro is in Texas (TX)

      - Maize is in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and Kansas.

      - Kansas is located in the central United States

      - Texas is located in the southern United States

      - Kansas is north of Texas on the map


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions of cities within these states.

      - Since Kansas is entirely north of Texas, any city in Kansas (including Maize)
      would be north of any city in Texas (including Pottsboro)

      - Even if Pottsboro is in northern Texas and Maize is in southern Kansas, the
      state boundary relationship would maintain this north-south relationship


      Therefore, Pottsboro, TX is indeed located south of Maize, KS.

      Let me think about the general geographic positions:

      - TX stands for Texas, which is a state in the southern part of the United States.

      - KS stands for Kansas, which is a state in the central part of the United States.


      In general, Kansas is north of Texas. On a map of the United States, Kansas
      is above Texas.


      So generally speaking, a city in Texas would be south of a city in Kansas. But
      let me confirm this by thinking about the specific cities:


      - Pottsboro is in Texas (TX)

      - Maize is in Kansas (KS)

      city in Texas (including Pottsboro) would be south of any city in Kansas (including
      Maize).</think># Reasoning about the locations of Pottsboro, TX and Maize, KS


      To determine if Pottsboro, TX is south of Maize, KS, I need to understand their
      geographic positions.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states'' positions

      - Texas (TX) is located in the southern United States

      - Kansas (KS) is located in the central United States, north of Texas


      ## Step 2: Check relative positions

      - Kansas is entirely north of Texas on a US map

      - The entire state of Texas lies south of Kansas

      - Therefore, any city in Texas (including Pottsboro) must be south of any city
      in Kansas (including Maize)


      ## Answer: YES


      Pottsboro, TX is located south of Maize, KS.'

      positions of Pottsboro, TX and Maize, KS to answer whether Pottsboro is south
      of Maize.


      First, let me think about their states:

      - Pottsboro is in Texas (TX)

      - Maize is in Kansas (KS)


      Geographically, Kansas is north of Texas in the United States. Kansas borders
      Nebraska to the north and Oklahoma to the south. Texas borders Oklahoma to the
      north.


      So generally speaking, locations in Texas are south of locations in Kansas.
      However, I should be more precise and consider the specific locations of these
      cities within their states.


      Pottsboro, TX is likely in northern Texas, but even northern Texas is still
      south of Kansas.

      Maize, KS is likely in southern Kansas, but even southern Kansas is still north
      of Texas.


      Based on the general geography of US states, Pottsboro, TX would be south of
      Maize, KS.</think>To determine if Pottsboro, TX is south of Maize, KS, I need
      to consider the geographic positions of these cities.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Kansas (KS) is located north of Texas (TX) in the United States. Kansas borders
      Oklahoma to the south, while Texas borders Oklahoma to the north.


      Step 2: Consider the locations within their states.

      Even if Pottsboro is in northern Texas and Maize is in southern Kansas, the
      overall north-south relationship between the states would still apply.


      Step 3: Check the latitudes.

      Pottsboro, TX is in the northern part of Texas, near the Oklahoma border.

      Maize, KS is near Wichita in south-central Kansas.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Any location in Texas (including northern cities like Pottsboro) would be south
      of locations in Kansas (including southern cities like Maize).


      YES, Pottsboro, TX is located south of Maize, KS.'

      Step 1: Determine the locations of both cities.

      - Clint, TX is located in El Paso County in far west Texas, near the US-Mexico
      border.

      - Peralta, NM is located in Valencia County, New Mexico, which is in the central
      part of the state.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and New Mexico.

      - New Mexico is positioned directly north of the western part of Texas.

      - The southern border of New Mexico connects with the northern border of western
      Texas.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations within their states.

      - Clint is in the southern region of western Texas, close to the Mexican border.

      - Peralta is in central New Mexico.


      Given these geographic positions, Clint, TX is indeed south of Peralta, NM.

      Rich Creek, VA is likely in the western part of Virginia, near the border with
      West Virginia, based on my knowledge of geography.


      Even though Rich Creek might be in the southern part of Virginia, and Folly
      Beach might be in the northern part of South Carolina, the fact that South Carolina
      is entirely south of Virginia means that Folly Beach must be south of Rich Creek.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations and their states.

      - Folly Beach is in South Carolina (SC)

      - Rich Creek is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Virginia is located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the US, while South Carolina
      is in the Southeast. On a north-south axis, Virginia is entirely north of South
      Carolina.


      Step 3: Consider their specific locations within their states.

      Folly Beach is on the Atlantic coast of South Carolina, on an island near Charleston.

      Rich Creek is in western Virginia, near the West Virginia border.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since South Carolina is entirely south of Virginia, and Folly Beach is in South
      Carolina while Rich Creek is in Virginia, Folly Beach must be south of Rich
      Creek.

    0691331a-5df8-412a-8d2c-0dbc02efcf4c: '<think>Let me think about the locations
      of Fairmead, CA and Mogul, NV.


      Fairmead, CA is in California. California is on the west coast of the United
      States.

      Mogul, NV is in Nevada. Nevada is east of California.


      However, the question is about whether Fairmead is south of Mogul, not whether
      it''s east or west. So I need to consider their north-south positions.


      California is generally west of Nevada, but they share a long border. Parts
      of California are north of parts of Nevada, and parts of California are south
      of parts of Nevada.


      Let me think about where specifically Fairmead, CA and Mogul, NV are located:


      Fairmead, CA is in the Central Valley of California, near Madera and Chowchilla,
      which puts it in central California.


      Mogul, NV is near Reno, which is in northwestern Nevada, very close to the California
      border.


      Reno is quite far north in Nevada, close to the California border. It''s roughly
      at the same latitude as the northern part of the Sacramento Valley in California.


      Fairmead being in the Central Valley would put it south of Reno and thus south
      of Mogul.</think># Is Fairmead, CA located south of Mogul, NV?


      Let me think about the geographic locations of these two places:


      1) Fairmead, CA is located in the Central Valley of California, in Madera County

      2) Mogul, NV is located just west of Reno in northwestern Nevada

      3) Reno/Mogul is in the northern part of Nevada, near the California border

      4) The Central Valley of California where Fairmead is located is in the central
      part of California


      Looking at their positions on a north-south axis:

      - Mogul, NV (near Reno) is relatively far north in Nevada

      - Fairmead, CA is in the central part of California


      Since Mogul is in the northern part of Nevada and Fairmead is in central California,
      Fairmead is indeed south of Mogul.


      YES'

      1) I need to determine the locations of Fairmead, CA and Mogul, NV.

      2) Then I''ll compare their north-south positions to determine if Fairmead is
      south of Mogul.


      Fairmead, CA is a small community in Madera County in California''s Central
      Valley.

      Mogul, NV is a small community just west of Reno, Nevada.


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - California is generally west of Nevada, but that doesn''t tell us about north-south
      positioning

      - The Central Valley of California runs north-south through much of California

      - Reno, NV is near the California border in northern Nevada


      Specifically:

      - Fairmead, CA is in the central part of California, in the San Joaquin Valley

      - Mogul, NV is in the northwestern part of Nevada, near Reno


      Given their positions, Fairmead is in central California which is south of Reno/Mogul
      area in northern Nevada. Therefore, Fairmead, CA is located south of Mogul,
      NV.</think># Is Fairmead, CA located south of Mogul, NV?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify where Fairmead, CA is located.

      Fairmead is in Madera County in the Central Valley of California.


      Step 2: Identify where Mogul, NV is located.

      Mogul is a small community just west of Reno in northwestern Nevada.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes (north-south positions).

      Reno/Mogul area is in the northern part of Nevada, near the California border.

      Fairmead is in the central part of California''s San Joaquin Valley.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      The Reno/Mogul area in northern Nevada is farther north than the Central Valley
      of California where Fairmead is located.


      YES, Fairmead, CA is located south of Mogul, NV.'

      - WY is Wyoming


      Looking at the map of the United States, Wyoming is directly north of Colorado,

      is north of Nebraska.


      However, this doesn''t necessarily mean that every city in Wyoming is north
      of every city in Nebraska. I need to think about where these specific cities
      are located within their states.


      Morrill is likely in western Nebraska since it borders Wyoming.

      Pine Haven would be in Wyoming, but I need to determine if it''s in southern
      Wyoming (which could potentially be north of a northern Nebraska city) or elsewhere

      Actually, let me double-check this. Wyoming is entirely north of Nebraska, sharing
      a border along Nebraska''s western side. So any city in Wyoming would be either
      north or west of any city in Nebraska, or both. Since the question is specifically

      To solve this, I need to know the latitudes of both cities:


      Morrill, NE is located in the western part of Nebraska, near the Wyoming border.

      Pine Haven, WY is in Wyoming, but I need to determine where exactly.


      Wyoming is generally north of Nebraska, especially when comparing the northern

      Wyoming extends farther north than Nebraska does. The northern border of Nebraska

      to determine the relative geographical positions of Morrill, Nebraska (NE) and
      Pine Haven, Wyoming (WY).


      I''ll think about their latitudes, as latitude determines how far north or south
      a location is. Lower latitude values indicate locations that are further south.


      Morrill, NE is in western Nebraska, near the Wyoming border.

      Pine Haven, WY is in northeastern Wyoming.


      Nebraska is generally south of Wyoming, since Wyoming is directly north of Colorado,
      and Nebraska is directly north of Kansas and east of Colorado.


      However, I need to be careful because we''re talking about specific cities,
      and cities near state borders might not follow the general north-south relationship
      of their states.


      Morrill, NE is in the Nebraska panhandle in the northwest part of the state.

      Pine Haven, WY is in the northeast part of Wyoming.


      Given their positions, Morrill, NE is likely to be south of Pine Haven, WY,
      but I need to be careful about the exact locations.


      Since Nebraska is south of Wyoming, and Morrill is in the northern part of Nebraska
      while Pine Haven is in the northern part of Wyoming, Morrill is likely south
      of Pine Haven.


      So my reasoning suggests that yes, Morrill, NE is located south of Pine Haven,
      WY.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two
      cities by examining their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' general positions.

      Wyoming is directly north of Colorado, while Nebraska is east of Colorado and
      north of Kansas. Generally, Wyoming is north of Nebraska.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      Morrill, NE is located in the western Nebraska panhandle, near the Wyoming border.

      Pine Haven, WY is located in northeastern Wyoming.


      Step 3: Compare latitudes (north-south positions).

      Even though Morrill is in the northern part of Nebraska, it''s still in Nebraska,
      which is south of Wyoming.

      Pine Haven, being in Wyoming, is in a state that''s entirely north of Nebraska.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on these geographic relationships.

      Since Wyoming is north of Nebraska, and these cities aren''t in unusual border
      positions that would reverse this relationship, Morrill, NE must be south of
      Pine Haven, WY.

      borders Illinois along Illinois''s northern border.


      Elburn is a town in Illinois. Since it''s in Illinois, it''s going to be south
      of the Illinois-Wisconsin border.


      Mole Lake is in Wisconsin. Since it''s in Wisconsin, it''s going to be north
      of the Illinois-Wisconsin border.


      Therefore, Elburn, IL would be south of Mole Lake, WI, simply because Illinois
      is south of Wisconsin.


      Let me double-check this reasoning. It''s possible that Mole Lake is in the
      far southern part of Wisconsin and Elburn is in the far northern part of Illinois,
      which could potentially make them very close to each other. But even in that
      case, Elburn would still be south of Mole Lake because it''s south of the state
      border.


      So my answer is YES, Elburn, IL is located south of Mole Lake, WI.</think>To
      determine if Elburn, IL is located south of Mole Lake, WI, I need to consider
      the geographic relationship between these two locations.


      Step 1: Consider the states. Illinois (IL) is located directly south of Wisconsin
      (WI). The entire state of Illinois is south of Wisconsin.


      Step 2: Elburn is a village located in Kane County in northern Illinois, but
      even northern Illinois is still south of the Illinois-Wisconsin border.


      Step 3: Mole Lake is a location in Forest County, Wisconsin, which is in the
      northern part of Wisconsin.


      Step 4: Since Elburn is in Illinois (a state entirely south of Wisconsin) and
      Mole Lake is in Wisconsin (a state entirely north of Illinois), Elburn must
      be south of Mole Lake.


      YES, Elburn, IL is located south of Mole Lake, WI.'

      Let me think about the geographic locations:


      1. Elburn, IL is in Illinois (IL)

      2. Mole Lake, WI is in Wisconsin (WI)


      In the United States, Wisconsin is located north of Illinois. Wisconsin borders
      Illinois on its southern border, while Illinois is directly south of Wisconsin.


      So generally speaking, locations in Illinois would be south of locations in
      Wisconsin. However, I should consider whether these specific locations might
      be exceptions to this general rule.


      Elburn is in northern Illinois, but still in Illinois.

      Mole Lake is in Wisconsin, which is entirely north of Illinois.


      Since Wisconsin is completely north of Illinois in terms of state boundaries,
      any location in Wisconsin (including Mole Lake) would be north of any location
      in Illinois (including Elburn).


      Therefore, Elburn, IL is indeed south of Mole Lake, WI.</think>I need to determine
      if Elburn, IL is located south of Mole Lake, WI.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      - Wisconsin is located directly north of Illinois

      - Illinois shares its northern border with Wisconsin''s southern border


      Step 3: Apply this state relationship to the specific cities

      - Since Elburn is in Illinois, and Mole Lake is in Wisconsin

      - And Wisconsin is entirely north of Illinois

      - Any location in Wisconsin would be north of any location in Illinois


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion

      - Elburn, IL must be south of Mole Lake, WI

      - Mole Lake, WI: This is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Geographically, Wisconsin is generally north of Illinois. Wisconsin borders

      - North Dakota is located along the northern border of the United States

      - Nebraska is located in the central United States, south of North Dakota


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the cities

      - Since Valentine is in Nebraska, and Nebraska is entirely south of North Dakota

      - And Lakota is in North Dakota

      - Therefore, Valentine must be south of Lakota

      locations of Ettrick, VA and East Bangor, PA to answer whether Ettrick is south
      of East Bangor.


      First, let me consider the states:

      - VA stands for Virginia

      - PA stands for Pennsylvania


      In the United States, Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia. Pennsylvania
      borders New York and shares a border with Canada (via Lake Erie), while Virginia
      is further south, bordering North Carolina.


      To be more precise about these specific cities:

      - Ettrick is in Virginia, which is in the southern part of the eastern United
      States

      - East Bangor is in Pennsylvania, which is in the northern part of the eastern
      United States


      Since Virginia is south of Pennsylvania, and Ettrick is in Virginia while East
      Bangor is in Pennsylvania, it follows that Ettrick, VA is located south of East
      Bangor, PA.</think>To determine if Ettrick, VA is located south of East Bangor,
      PA, I need to consider the geographic positions of these two cities.


      Step 1: Identify the states these cities are in.

      - Ettrick is in Virginia (VA)

      - East Bangor is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States, while Virginia is
      located in the mid-Atlantic region, south of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Since states in the US are arranged with Pennsylvania north of Virginia,
      cities within these states generally follow this north-south relationship.


      Step 4: Even without knowing the exact coordinates of these specific cities,
      their state locations tell us that Ettrick, VA would be south of East Bangor,
      PA.

      - Iowa is a northern Midwest state bordering Minnesota to its north

      - Missouri borders Iowa on Iowa''s southern border


      Now, for the specific cities:

      Let me double-check by thinking about their approximate locations within their
      states:

      - Portageville appears to be in the southeastern part of Missouri (in what''s
      called the "bootheel" region)

      - Columbus Junction is in southeastern Iowa

      Next, let me consider the locations within their states:

      - Even if these cities are in different parts of their respective states, the
      fact that Missouri shares its northern border with Iowa''s southern border means
      that Missouri cities are generally south of Iowa cities.

      - Portageville is actually in the southeastern "bootheel" region of Missouri,
      which is one of the southernmost parts of the state.

      - Columbus Junction is in southeastern Iowa.


      Given that Missouri is entirely south of Iowa, and Portageville is in Missouri

      Let me think about the geography:

      - MO is Missouri, a state in the central United States

      - IA is Iowa, also a state in the central United States

      - In general, Iowa is located north of Missouri. Iowa borders Missouri on Missouri''s

      - Iowa is located directly north of Missouri

      - These states share a border, with Iowa being the northern neighbor to Missouri


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states

      - Even without knowing the exact locations within their respective states, any

      the geographical locations of both cities.


      Cape May, NJ is located at the southern tip of New Jersey, at the very southern
      end of the Cape May Peninsula.


      Gaylordsville, CT is in Connecticut. Connecticut is a state in the northeastern
      United States, north of New Jersey.


      The United States generally follows a north-south orientation where locations
      further north have higher latitudes, and locations further south have lower
      latitudes.


      Connecticut is entirely north of New Jersey on a map of the United States. Since
      Cape May is at the southern tip of New Jersey, and Gaylordsville is in Connecticut
      (which is north of New Jersey), Cape May must be south of Gaylordsville.


      So the answer should be YES, Cape May, NJ is located south of Gaylordsville,
      CT.</think>To determine if Cape May, NJ is located south of Gaylordsville, CT,
      I need to consider the geographical positions of both locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Cape May is located at the southern tip of New Jersey, at the very end of
      the Cape May Peninsula.

      - Gaylordsville is located in western Connecticut.


      Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      - Connecticut is a northeastern state that sits north of New Jersey.

      - New Jersey is located south of Connecticut.


      Step 3: Determine specific locations within their states.

      - Cape May is at the southernmost point of New Jersey.

      - Gaylordsville is in Connecticut, which is entirely north of New Jersey.


      Since Connecticut is completely north of New Jersey, and Cape May is at the
      southern end of New Jersey, Cape May must be south of Gaylordsville.

      First, let me think about where these places are located:


      Cape May is at the southern tip of New Jersey. New Jersey is on the eastern
      coast of the United States.


      Gaylordsville is in Connecticut, which is north of New Jersey on the eastern
      coast of the United States.


      Connecticut is entirely north of New Jersey. The southernmost point of Connecticut

      Since Cape May is at the southern tip of New Jersey, and Gaylordsville is somewhere
      in Connecticut, Cape May must be south of Gaylordsville.


      Let me double-check this reasoning:

      - Connecticut is north of New Jersey

      - Cape May is in southern New Jersey

      - Gaylordsville is in Connecticut


      Therefore, Cape May, NJ is south of Gaylordsville, CT.</think>To determine if
      Cape May, NJ is located south of Gaylordsville, CT, I need to consider the geographic

      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Connecticut (CT) is located in the northeastern United States, while New Jersey
      (NJ) is located south of Connecticut along the eastern seaboard.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within each state.

      Cape May is located at the southernmost tip of New Jersey, at the mouth of the
      Delaware Bay.

      Gaylordsville is located in the western part of Connecticut, near the New York
      border.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Since Connecticut lies entirely north of New Jersey, and Cape May is at the
      southern end of New Jersey, Cape May must be south of any location in Connecticut,
      including Gaylordsville.

      States.

      3. Cassville is in Missouri (MO), which is generally in the central part of
      the United States, north of Texas.

      4. Based on general geography of US states, Texas is south of Missouri.

      5. Since Talco is in Texas and Cassville is in Missouri, it''s very likely that
      Talco is south of Cassville.


      Let me be more precise about this. Texas shares a border with Oklahoma, which
      in turn shares a border with Missouri. Texas is entirely south of Missouri.
      Therefore, any city in Texas, including Talco, would be south of any city in
      Missouri, including Cassville.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine if Talco, TX is located south of Cassville, MO, I need to consider
      the geographic positions of these cities and their states.


      1. Talco is located in Texas (TX), which is in the southern United States.

      2. Cassville is located in Missouri (MO), which is in the central United States.

      3. Geographically, the entire state of Texas is south of the entire state of
      Missouri.

      4. Missouri is positioned in the central U.S., with its southern border connecting
      to Arkansas.

      5. Texas is positioned in the southern U.S., below Oklahoma and Arkansas.

      6. Since any location in Texas must be south of any location in Missouri, Talco
      must be south of Cassville.

      - MO is Missouri, which is in the central/midwestern United States


      Generally speaking, Texas is south of Missouri. The entire state of Missouri
      is north of Texas.


      Now, to be more precise about these specific cities:

      - Talco is a city in Texas

      - Cassville is a city in Missouri


      Since Texas is entirely south of Missouri, any city in Texas (including Talco)
      would be south of any city in Missouri (including Cassville).


      So Talco, TX is indeed located south of Cassville, MO.</think>I need to determine
      the relative geographic positions of these two cities.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Talco is in Texas (TX)

      - Cassville is in Missouri (MO)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Missouri is in the central United States

      - Texas is in the southern United States

      - Missouri is located entirely north of Texas


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the cities.

      - Since Texas is completely south of Missouri, any city in Texas (including
      Talco) must be south of any city in Missouri (including Cassville)

      - Texas (TX) is a southern state, bordering Mexico

      - Missouri (MO) is in the Midwest, north of Texas


      Since Texas is generally south of Missouri, it''s likely that Talco, TX is south

      Talco is a city in Texas, which is located in the southern United States. Texas
      borders Mexico to its south.


      Cassville is a city in Missouri, which is in the Midwest region. Missouri is
      several states north of Texas.


      On a north-south axis in the US, Missouri is definitely north of Texas. So a

      Reasoning about the locations of Talco, TX and Cassville, MO


      To determine whether Talco, TX is south of Cassville, MO, I need to consider

      States, while Missouri is in the Midwest region.


      2) On a north-south axis, Missouri is entirely north of Texas. The southern
      border of Missouri is still significantly north of the northern border of Texas.


      3) Talco is a small city in northeast Texas, while Cassville is in southwest
      Missouri.


      4) Even though both cities are in the "southern" parts of their respective states,
      the entire state of Texas is still south of Missouri.


      Therefore, Talco, TX is indeed located south of Cassville, MO.

      First, let''s identify the states:

      - Talco, TX is in Texas

      - Cassville, MO is in Missouri


      Generally speaking, Texas is south of Missouri in the United States. Missouri
      borders Arkansas on its southern border, and Arkansas borders Texas on its southern
      border. So geographically, Texas is south of Missouri.


      Given that Talco is in Texas and Cassville is in Missouri, it''s very likely
      that Talco is south of Cassville. But let me be more precise about their locations.


      Talco is likely in the northern part of Texas, while Cassville is likely in
      the southern part of Missouri. But even the northernmost part of Texas is generally
      south of the southernmost part of Missouri.


      So my reasoning is:

      1. Texas is south of Missouri

      2. Talco is in Texas

      3. Cassville is in Missouri

      4. Therefore, Talco, TX is south of Cassville, MO</think>To determine if Talco,

      - Talco is in Texas (TX)

      - Cassville is in Missouri (MO)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and Missouri.

      - Missouri is located in the central United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Missouri is north of Texas (Missouri is above Arkansas, which is above Texas)


      Step 3: Even though I don''t know the exact locations of these specific cities
      within their states, I can determine that:

      - Any city in Texas will be south of any city in Missouri due to the states''
      relative positions

      - Even the northernmost point of Texas is still south of the southernmost point
      of Missouri

      Step 3: Determine the specific locations of these cities within their states.

      - While Talco might be in northern Texas and Cassville might be in southern

      - East Mountain, TX is a city in Texas

      - Pocola, OK is a city in Oklahoma


      I need to determine if East Mountain, TX is south of Pocola, OK.


      Generally speaking, Oklahoma is north of Texas, as Oklahoma borders Texas on
      Texas''s northern border. This gives us a first approximation that a city in
      Oklahoma would likely be north of a city in Texas.


      However, I need to be more precise, as Texas is a large state, and the shapes
      of the states are irregular. Some parts of Oklahoma might not be directly north
      of some parts of Texas.


      East Mountain, TX is likely in the eastern part of Texas (given its name).

      Pocola, OK, I believe is in eastern Oklahoma, close to the Arkansas border.


      Given that Oklahoma is directly north of Texas, and these cities are both in
      the eastern parts of their respective states, it''s very likely that East Mountain,
      TX is south of Pocola, OK.

      directly north of Texas along the Texas-Oklahoma border.


      Step 3: More specifically, East Mountain is in Upshur County in northeastern
      Texas, while Pocola is in LeFlore County in eastern Oklahoma, near the Arkansas
      border.


      Step 4: Since Oklahoma is north of Texas, and both cities are in the eastern

      - East Mountain, TX is in Texas, which is generally south of Oklahoma.

      - Pocola, OK is in Oklahoma, which is north of Texas.


      Step 2: Let me be more specific about their locations.

      - East Mountain, TX is likely in the eastern part of Texas, given its name.

      - Ohio borders Michigan to the south


      Now, let''s get more specific about these two cities:

      - Fort Loramie is in Ohio

      - Zilwaukee is in Michigan


      Generally speaking, cities in Michigan tend to be north of cities in Ohio. But

      Fort Loramie is in western Ohio, in Shelby County.

      In terms of US geography, South Dakota is north of Kansas. South Dakota borders

      their latitudes. A location with a lower latitude is further south than a location
      with a higher latitude.


      Let me think about the general geography of the US states:

      - NC stands for North Carolina, which is a state in the southeastern United
      States.

      - PA stands for Pennsylvania, which is a state in the northeastern United States.


      Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina. So it''s likely
      that any city in North Carolina would be south of any city in Pennsylvania.


      Stantonsburg is in North Carolina (NC), which is a southern state compared to
      Pennsylvania (PA). So just based on the states, Stantonsburg, NC should be south
      of Lehighton, PA.

      Forsgate is in New Jersey (NJ), while West Sand Lake is in New York (NY).


      In general, New Jersey is south of New York State, but I need to be careful
      because:

      1. These could be near the border where the relationship isn''t as clear

      2. West Sand Lake might be in southern NY while Forsgate might be in northern
      NJ


      Let me think about where these places are located:


      - Forsgate, NJ is likely in central New Jersey (though I''m not 100% certain
      of its exact location)

      - West Sand Lake, NY is likely in eastern New York, possibly near the capital
      region (Albany area)


      Given that New York is generally north of New Jersey, and that West Sand Lake
      is likely in the eastern part of NY (not the southern part that dips below parts
      of NJ), it''s very likely that Forsgate, NJ is south of West Sand Lake, NY.


      West Sand Lake, NY is near Albany in the eastern part of upstate New York.

      Forsgate, NJ is in central New Jersey, in Middlesex County.


      Looking at their positions on a mental map, West Sand Lake would be significantly
      north of Forsgate.</think># Reasoning Step by Step


      To determine if Forsgate, NJ is south of West Sand Lake, NY, I need to find
      the relative positions of these two locations.


      1) West Sand Lake, NY is located in Rensselaer County in eastern New York state,
      near Albany. This places it in the eastern part of upstate New York.


      2) Forsgate, NJ is located in Middlesex County in central New Jersey, near Monroe
      Township.


      3) Geographically, New York state is positioned north of New Jersey.


      4) Even considering that some parts of New York state can extend quite far south,
      West Sand Lake is in the eastern upstate region, which is significantly north
      of even the northernmost parts of New Jersey.


      5) Middlesex County, where Forsgate is located, is in central New Jersey, not
      even in the northernmost part of the state.


      Therefore, Forsgate, NJ is definitely located south of West Sand Lake, NY.


      # Answer: YES'
    206a42c4-dbf2-4246-9f0d-dd4ec77e0381: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative geographic positions of Forsgate, NJ and West Sand
      Lake, NY.


      Step 1: Let me recall where these places are located.

      - Forsgate is in New Jersey (NJ), which is generally south of New York state.

      - West Sand Lake is in New York (NY).


      Step 2: Let me be more specific about their locations.

      - Forsgate, NJ is likely in central New Jersey, near the middle of the state.

      - West Sand Lake, NY is likely in eastern New York, possibly near Albany or
      the Capital District.


      Step 3: Think about north-south positioning.

      - New Jersey is south of New York State.

      - However, I need to be careful because the shapes of these states are irregular,
      and there are parts of NY that could be south of parts of NJ.

      - West Sand Lake is likely in the eastern part of NY state, north of NYC area.

      - Forsgate, NJ is probably in central NJ, which would be south of most of NY
      state, including the eastern part where West Sand Lake is.


      So, Forsgate, NJ should be south of West Sand Lake, NY.</think>I''ll solve this
      step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both cities.

      - Forsgate, NJ is located in central New Jersey, in the northeastern part of
      the United States.

      - West Sand Lake, NY is located in eastern New York state, near the Albany area.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south relationship between New York and New
      Jersey.

      - New York state is generally north of New Jersey.

      - West Sand Lake is in the eastern part of NY (Capital District region).

      - Forsgate is in central New Jersey.


      Step 3: Determine specific positioning.

      - West Sand Lake, NY is in Rensselaer County, which is significantly north of
      the NJ-NY border.

      - Forsgate, NJ is in Middlesex County, NJ, which is well south of the NY-NJ
      border.


      Based on this analysis, Forsgate, NJ is indeed located south of West Sand Lake,
      NY.

      North Carolina (NC) is a state in the southeastern United States, along the
      Atlantic coast.

      Ohio (OH) is a state in the Midwestern United States.


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - North Carolina is generally south of Ohio

      - Ohio is north of North Carolina


      Since Oakboro is in North Carolina and Chillicothe is in Ohio, Oakboro would
      generally be south of Chillicothe.


      Let me verify that there aren''t any unusual geographical quirks with these
      specific cities. Both are fairly standard locations within their respective
      states - Oakboro is in Stanly County in the southern part of North Carolina,
      and Chillicothe is in Ross County in southern Ohio.


      Even though Chillicothe is in southern Ohio, Ohio as a whole is still north
      of North Carolina. So Oakboro, NC would indeed be south of Chillicothe, OH.</think>I
      need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two cities.


      Step 1: Consider the states these cities are located in.

      - Oakboro is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Chillicothe is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - North Carolina is located in the Southeast region

      - When comparing these states, Ohio is positioned north of North Carolina


      Step 3: Consider if there might be any geographical anomalies with these specific
      cities.

      - Chillicothe is located in southern Ohio

      - Oakboro is in central North Carolina

      - Even though Chillicothe is in southern Ohio, the entire state of Ohio is still
      north of North Carolina


      Therefore, Oakboro, NC is located south of Chillicothe, OH.

      the approximate latitudes of both locations.


      Oceanport is in New Jersey (NJ), which is generally south of New York (NY) state.
      However, I need to be more precise since we''re comparing specific towns.


      Oceanport, NJ is located in Monmouth County in eastern New Jersey, near the
      Atlantic coast.


      Averill Park, NY is located in Rensselaer County in eastern New York state,
      near the Massachusetts border.


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - New York state is north of New Jersey

      - Averill Park is in the eastern part of NY state (near Albany)

      - Oceanport is in the northern part of NJ, but still south of the NY state line


      Since Averill Park is in NY state and Oceanport is in NJ, and NJ is south of
      NY, Oceanport should be south of Averill Park.</think>I need to determine the
      relative north-south positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify where Averill Park, NY is located.

      Averill Park is in Rensselaer County in eastern New York state, near Albany
      and the Massachusetts border.


      Step 2: Identify where Oceanport, NJ is located.

      Oceanport is in Monmouth County in eastern New Jersey, along the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      New York state is positioned north of New Jersey. Averill Park is in the capital
      region of New York, while Oceanport is in the northern half of New Jersey. Even
      though Oceanport is in northern New Jersey, it''s still south of New York''s
      southern border.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Averill Park is in New York state (which is entirely north of New Jersey)
      and Oceanport is in New Jersey, Oceanport must be south of Averill Park.


      YES'

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina


      Step 3: Consider if there could be any unusual geographic arrangement.

      - Even accounting for their specific locations within their states, the entire
      state of North Carolina lies south of Pennsylvania, with several states (including
      Maryland and Virginia) between them.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on their state locations.

      5. Grand Haven, MI is located on the western shore of Michigan, along Lake Michigan.

      6. Grayville, IL is a small city in Illinois.

      7. Michigan is entirely north of Illinois, so any city in Illinois (including
      Grayville) would be south of any city in Michigan (including Grand Haven).


      Based on these geographic facts, Grayville, IL should be south of Grand Haven,
      MI.</think>To determine if Grayville, IL is located south of Grand Haven, MI,
      I need to consider their geographic positions:


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      - Grayville is in Illinois (IL)

      - Grand Haven is in Michigan (MI)

      - Michigan is located north of Illinois in the United States


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Grand Haven, MI is located on the western shore of Michigan, along Lake Michigan

      - Grayville, IL is located in the southeastern part of Illinois


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Even the southernmost parts of Michigan are generally north of the northernmost
      parts of Illinois

      - This means any city in Illinois (including Grayville) would be south of any
      city in Michigan (including Grand Haven)


      YES, Grayville, IL is located south of Grand Haven, MI.'

      to figure out the relative positions of two cities:

      1. Grayville, IL (Illinois)

      2. Grand Haven, MI (Michigan)


      I need to determine if Grayville is south of Grand Haven.


      First, let me think about the geographic positions of Illinois and Michigan.
      Michigan is in the northern part of the Midwest, bordering the Great Lakes.
      Illinois is south of Michigan, extending further south.


      Grayville is in Illinois, which suggests it''s likely south of most places in
      Michigan. But I need to be more precise.


      Grand Haven, MI is on the western shore of Michigan, along Lake Michigan. It''s
      in the southern half of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula, but still in the northern
      part of the US Midwest.


      Grayville, IL is likely in the southern part of Illinois since many "ville"
      towns in Illinois tend to be in the central or southern regions.


      Given that Illinois is south of Michigan, and that Grand Haven is not in the
      very southern tip of Michigan, it''s very likely that Grayville, IL is south
      of Grand Haven, MI.


      So the answer should be YES, Grayville, IL is located south of Grand Haven,
      MI.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two
      cities.


      Step 1: Consider the states they''re in. Michigan is located north of Illinois
      in the United States.


      Step 2: Let''s be more specific about each city''s location within their state:

      - Grand Haven, MI is located on the western shore of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula,
      along Lake Michigan.

      - Grayville, IL is located in southeastern Illinois, near the Illinois-Indiana
      border.


      Step 3: Even though Grand Haven is in the southern portion of Michigan, Michigan''s
      southern border is still north of most of Illinois.


      Step 4: Grayville is not in the northernmost part of Illinois, but rather in
      the southeastern part of the state.


      Therefore, Grayville, IL is indeed south of Grand Haven, MI.

      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      Florida is positioned entirely south of South Carolina on the US map. South
      Carolina is in the southeastern US, but Florida extends much further south,
      being the southernmost state in the continental United States.


      Step 3: Since Timber Pines is in Florida, and any location in Florida is south

      First, let me recall the general geography of these states:

      - Alabama (AL) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Kentucky (KY) is located in the east-central United States, north of Alabama


      In terms of latitude:

      - Alabama is generally south of Kentucky

      - Kentucky borders the northern part of Alabama


      Now, for the specific cities:

      - Guntersville is a city in Alabama

      - Moorland is a city in Kentucky


      Since Alabama is south of Kentucky, and Guntersville is in Alabama while Moorland
      is in Kentucky, Guntersville would be south of Moorland.


      To be completely sure, I would need the exact latitudes of both cities, but
      based on the general geographic relationship between Alabama and Kentucky, Guntersville,
      AL is very likely south of Moorland, KY.</think># Determining if Guntersville,
      AL is south of Moorland, KY


      To answer this question, I need to consider the geographic locations of both
      cities and their states.


      ## Step 1: State-level geography

      Alabama is located in the southeastern United States, while Kentucky is positioned
      to the north of Alabama. Generally, locations in Alabama have lower latitudes
      (are further south) than locations in Kentucky.


      ## Step 2: City-specific locations

      Guntersville is a city in northern Alabama, but even northern Alabama is still
      south of Kentucky''s southern border.


      Moorland is a city in Kentucky, which means it''s positioned somewhere in a
      state that''s entirely north of Alabama.


      ## Step 3: Conclusion

      Since Alabama is completely south of Kentucky on the map, any city in Alabama
      (including Guntersville) would be south of any city in Kentucky (including Moorland).


      YES, Guntersville, AL is located south of Moorland, KY.'

      positions of Guntersville, Alabama and Moorland, Kentucky to determine if Guntersville
      is south of Moorland.


      First, let me recall the general locations of Alabama (AL) and Kentucky (KY)
      in the United States:

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States

      - Kentucky is located in the east central United States, north of Alabama


      Generally speaking, Alabama is south of Kentucky, as Kentucky borders the northern
      part of Tennessee, which borders the northern part of Alabama.


      So geographically, cities in Alabama tend to be south of cities in Kentucky.
      However, I should verify this for the specific cities in question.


      Guntersville is a city in Alabama, and based on the general location of Alabama,
      it would be in the southeastern United States.


      Moorland is a city in Kentucky, and based on the general location of Kentucky,
      it would be north of Alabama.


      Given the relative positions of the states, Guntersville, AL would very likely
      be south of Moorland, KY.</think>To determine if Guntersville, AL is south of
      Moorland, KY, I need to consider the geographic locations of these cities and
      their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Alabama is located in the southeastern United States, while Kentucky is in the
      east-central United States.


      Step 2: Consider the north-south relationship.

      Kentucky is positioned north of Alabama. On a map, Kentucky sits above Tennessee,
      which itself is directly above Alabama.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific cities.

      Since Guntersville is in Alabama and Moorland is in Kentucky, Guntersville must
      be further south than Moorland, following the general north-south arrangement
      of their respective states.


      YES, Guntersville, AL is located south of Moorland, KY.'
    9216a234-5963-4568-a115-438d1080ba0e: '<think>To solve this problem, I need to
      determine the relative positions of Guntersville, Alabama and Moorland, Kentucky,
      specifically whether Guntersville is south of Moorland.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these cities in terms of latitude.

      - Guntersville, AL is in Alabama, which is in the southern United States

      - Moorland, KY is in Kentucky, which is north of Alabama


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions.

      In the US, states that are further south have lower latitude values. Alabama
      is generally south of Kentucky. This means cities in Alabama are typically south
      of cities in Kentucky.


      Step 3: Check if there might be any exceptions.

      While it''s possible that a northern city in Alabama could be at a similar latitude
      to a southern city in Kentucky, this is unlikely since Alabama and Kentucky
      don''t share a border - Tennessee is between them. So the general north-south
      relationship between the states should apply to these cities.</think>I''ll solve
      this step-by-step:


      Step 1: Determine the states'' relative positions.

      Alabama is in the Deep South of the United States, while Kentucky is located
      in the Upper South/Lower Midwest region.


      Step 2: Compare the states geographically.

      Kentucky is positioned entirely north of Alabama. The states don''t even share
      a border - Tennessee lies between them.


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      Since Guntersville is in Alabama and Moorland is in Kentucky, and Alabama is
      south of Kentucky, Guntersville must be south of Moorland.


      YES, Guntersville, AL is located south of Moorland, KY.'

      whether Blue Ridge Shores, Virginia is located south of Schlusser, Pennsylvania.


      To solve this, I need to know the geographic positions of these two places,
      particularly their latitudes. Places with lower latitude values are more southern.


      Step 1: Determine the location of Blue Ridge Shores, Virginia.

      Blue Ridge Shores is located in Virginia, which is a state in the southern part
      of the United States, relative to Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Determine the location of Schlusser, Pennsylvania.

      Schlusser is located in Pennsylvania, which is north of Virginia.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Since Virginia is entirely south of Pennsylvania (Virginia''s northern border
      is south of Pennsylvania''s southern border), any location in Virginia would
      be south of any location in Pennsylvania.


      Therefore, Blue Ridge Shores, VA must be south of Schlusser, PA.</think>I need
      to determine whether Blue Ridge Shores, VA is located south of Schlusser, PA
      by comparing their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Consider the states these cities are in.

      Blue Ridge Shores is in Virginia (VA).

      Schlusser is in Pennsylvania (PA).


      Step 2: Examine the relative positions of these states.

      Virginia is located entirely south of Pennsylvania. The northern border of Virginia
      is below the southern border of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the cities.

      Since Blue Ridge Shores is in Virginia and Schlusser is in Pennsylvania, and
      Virginia is entirely south of Pennsylvania, Blue Ridge Shores must be south
      of Schlusser.


      YES, Blue Ridge Shores, VA is located south of Schlusser, PA.'

      to determine the relative positions of Blue Ridge Shores, VA and Schlusser,
      PA on a north-south axis.


      Step 1: Recall the geographic locations of Virginia (VA) and Pennsylvania (PA).

      Virginia is a state in the southeastern United States, while Pennsylvania is
      in the northeastern United States. Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is north
      of Virginia.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations of these towns.

      Blue Ridge Shores is in Virginia (VA), so it''s in the state that is generally
      south of Pennsylvania.

      Schlusser is in Pennsylvania (PA), so it''s in the state that is generally north
      of Virginia.


      Step 3: Check if there might be any geographic anomalies.

      While state borders can be irregular, there''s no major geographic anomaly that
      would place a Virginia town north of a Pennsylvania town. The entire state of
      Virginia lies south of Pennsylvania.


      Therefore, Blue Ridge Shores, VA would be located south of Schlusser, PA.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Let me consider the states these cities are in.

      - Blue Ridge Shores is in Virginia (VA)

      - Schlusser is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia is located in the southeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is directly north of Virginia


      Step 3: Consider whether there could be any geographic anomalies.

      - Even though city locations within states can vary, the entirety of Virginia
      lies south of Pennsylvania

      - There are no portions of Virginia that extend north of Pennsylvania


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      Since Blue Ridge Shores is in Virginia, and Schlusser is in Pennsylvania, and
      Virginia is entirely south of Pennsylvania, Blue Ridge Shores must be south
      of Schlusser.


      YES (Blue Ridge Shores, VA is located south of Schlusser, PA)'

      Shores, VA is located south of Schlusser, PA. Let me reason through this step
      by step.


      First, I need to understand the general geography of Virginia (VA) and Pennsylvania
      (PA):

      - Virginia is a state in the southeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is a state in the northeastern United States

      - Generally, Virginia is located south of Pennsylvania


      Looking at their positions:

      - Pennsylvania borders states like New York to the north, Ohio to the west,
      West Virginia to the southwest, Maryland to the south, New Jersey to the east

      - Virginia borders states like Maryland and Washington D.C. to the north, North
      Carolina to the south, Kentucky and Tennessee to the west, West Virginia to
      the northwest


      Since Virginia (VA) as a state is located south of Pennsylvania (PA), and Blue
      Ridge Shores is in Virginia while Schlusser is in Pennsylvania, it follows that
      Blue Ridge Shores, VA is located south of Schlusser, PA.


      While there could be unusual border configurations where this might not be true
      (like if one town was in a northern extension of VA that went above a southern
      portion of PA), this is not the case with the general geography of these two
      states.</think>To determine if Blue Ridge Shores, VA is located south of Schlusser,
      PA, I need to consider the geographic positions of these locations and their
      respective states.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - Blue Ridge Shores is in Virginia (VA)

      - Schlusser is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia is located in the southeastern United States

      - The entire state of Virginia lies south of Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Consider possible exceptions.

      - There are no unusual border configurations between these states that would
      place a Virginia town north of a Pennsylvania town

      - The states don''t have non-contiguous sections that would complicate this
      relationship


      Since Blue Ridge Shores is in Virginia, and all of Virginia is south of Pennsylvania
      (where Schlusser is located), Blue Ridge Shores must be south of Schlusser.

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Pomona Park is in Florida (FL)

      - Guyton is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      Florida is generally south of Georgia. Georgia borders Florida to the north.
      So a city in Florida is likely to be south of a city in Georgia, but I should
      confirm this by looking at the specific locations.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations.

      Pomona Park is in northeast Florida, in Putnam County.

      Guyton is in eastern Georgia, in Effingham County.


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      Florida borders Georgia to the south. This means Georgia is directly north of
      Florida.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      Since Pomona Park is in Florida and Guyton is in Georgia, and Florida is south
      of Georgia, Pomona Park would be south of Guyton.


      Step 4: Check for any unusual geographic quirks.

      Both cities are in the eastern portions of their respective states, with no
      unusual geographic anomalies that would change their north-south relationship.

      First, let me consider the states:

      - Pomona Park is in Florida (FL)

      - Guyton is in Georgia (GA)


      In the United States, Georgia is located directly north of Florida. Florida
      is the southernmost state in the continental US, and Georgia borders Florida''s
      northern boundary.


      Since Pomona Park is in Florida and Guyton is in Georgia, it''s highly likely
      that Pomona Park is south of Guyton. However, to be completely sure, I should
      consider the specific locations within their respective states.


      Pomona Park is likely in northern Florida (since most of Florida is south of
      Georgia), and Guyton is likely in southern Georgia (since it''s being compared
      to a Florida city).


      Given the geography of the US states, where Florida is directly south of Georgia,
      Pomona Park, FL would be south of Guyton, GA.</think>I need to determine the
      relative positions of these two cities.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these cities are located.

      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Georgia is located directly north of Florida

      - Florida is the southernmost state in the continental US


      Step 3: Based on state geography alone, cities in Florida would generally be
      south of cities in Georgia, since Florida itself is south of Georgia.


      Step 4: While there could theoretically be exceptions if the cities were in
      unusual projections of their states, Pomona Park is in northeastern Florida
      and Guyton is in southeastern Georgia, maintaining the north-south relationship
      of their states.

      First, let me think about where these cities are located:

      - Montura, FL is in Florida, which is generally south of Georgia

      - Swainsboro, GA is in Georgia, which is north of Florida


      Based on general geography, Florida is south of Georgia, so a city in Florida

      with more specific information.


      Florida extends quite far south, while Georgia is directly north of Florida.
      The entire state of Florida is generally south of Georgia, with the Florida
      panhandle being the northernmost part of Florida that borders Georgia.

      - Therefore, cities in Texas are typically south of cities in Kansas


      Given this geographical relationship, Rendon, TX would be located south of Larned,
      KS.</think>I''ll solve this step by step by comparing the geographical locations
      of these two cities.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these cities are located.

      - Rendon is in Texas (TX)

      - Larned is in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Texas and Kansas.

      - Kansas is located in the central United States

      - Texas is located south of Kansas


      Step 3: Since Rendon is in Texas and Larned is in Kansas, and Texas is south
      of Kansas, Rendon must be south of Larned.


      YES, Rendon, TX is located south of Larned, KS.'

    6d8cdf64-5003-48fa-abda-1e8d87b9df51: '<think>This question requires me to determine
      the relative positions of two cities - Rendon, TX and Larned, KS.


      First, let''s think about the geography:

      1. TX refers to Texas, which is a state in the southern US

      2. KS refers to Kansas, which is a state in the central US

      3. Generally, Texas is located south of Kansas


      To be more precise, let me think about where these specific cities are within
      their states:

      - Rendon, TX is likely somewhere in Texas

      - Larned, KS is likely somewhere in Kansas


      Given the general geography of the US, Texas is south of Kansas. Unless there''s
      something very unusual about the locations of these specific cities within their
      states (like if Rendon were in the far northern part of Texas and Larned were
      in the far southern part of Kansas), Rendon, TX would be south of Larned, KS.


      Since Texas borders Oklahoma to its north, and Oklahoma borders Kansas to its
      north, Texas is definitely south of Kansas. Even the northernmost point of Texas
      would be south of the southernmost point of Kansas.


      So, Rendon, TX should be south of Larned, KS.</think>To determine if Rendon,
      TX is located south of Larned, KS, I need to consider the geographic positions
      of these cities and their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states these cities are in.

      - Rendon is in Texas (TX)

      - Larned is in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and Kansas.

      - Kansas is located in the central United States

      - Texas is located in the southern United States

      - Looking at a US map, Texas is positioned south of Kansas


      Step 3: Even without knowing the exact locations of these specific cities within
      their states, I can determine that any city in Texas would be south of any city
      in Kansas because:

      - The entire state of Texas lies south of Kansas

      - There is no geographic overlap between these states (Oklahoma lies between
      them)


      Therefore, Rendon, TX must be located south of Larned, KS.


      YES'

      south of Larned, KS, I need to know their relative positions geographically.


      Rendon, TX is in Texas, which is generally south of Kansas in the United States.

      Larned, KS is in Kansas.


      Since Texas borders Oklahoma to the south, and Oklahoma borders Kansas to the
      south, Texas is definitely south of Kansas.


      Therefore, Rendon (being in Texas) would be south of Larned (being in Kansas).


      To be even more precise:

      - Texas is located in the southern United States

      - Kansas is located in the central United States, north of Texas

      - Any city in Texas would be south of any city in Kansas


      So Rendon, TX is south of Larned, KS.</think>I need to determine the relative
      north-south positions of these two cities.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Rendon is in Texas (TX)

      - Larned is in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic position of these states.

      - Kansas is located in the central United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Texas is positioned south of Kansas on the map


      Step 3: Since Rendon is in Texas and Larned is in Kansas, and Texas is entirely
      south of Kansas, Rendon must be south of Larned regardless of their specific
      locations within their respective states.


      YES, Rendon, TX is located south of Larned, KS.'

      to determine the relative locations of Rendon, TX and Larned, KS.


      First, I need to identify the states:

      - TX is Texas

      - KS is Kansas


      Generally speaking, Texas is south of Kansas, since Kansas is in the central
      part of the US, while Texas is in the southern part of the US. But I need to
      verify the specific locations of these cities.


      Rendon, TX is a city in Texas, likely in the northern part of Texas since Texas
      is a large state that extends quite far south.


      Larned, KS is a city in Kansas, likely in the central or southern part of Kansas.


      Given the geography of the United States, Texas is directly south of Oklahoma,
      which is directly south of Kansas. So any city in Texas would be south of any
      city in Kansas.


      So Rendon, TX would be south of Larned, KS.</think>I need to determine the relative
