    03def1ae-7947-47f7-b435-697747714b71: 'To determine if Riverwood, KY is located
      south of Bloomdale, OH, let''s break down the locations of both places step
      by step.


      1. **Locate Bloomdale, OH**: Bloomdale is a small village in Wood County, Ohio.
      It is situated in the northwestern part of the state.


      2. **Locate Riverwood, KY**: Riverwood is an unincorporated community in Kentucky.
      It is not a widely recognized city, and its exact location might not be prominent
      on maps.


      3. **Geographical Positioning**: To understand their relative positions, we
      need to consider the overall geography of Ohio and Kentucky. Kentucky is directly
      south of Ohio.


      4. **Relative Locations**: Since Riverwood is in Kentucky, and Ohio is to the
      north of Kentucky, we can deduce that Riverwood is generally south of any location
      in Ohio, including Bloomdale.


      Therefore, after considering these points, the answer to the question "Is Riverwood,
      KY located south of Bloomdale, OH?" is:


      **YES**.'
    173637ee-e7cc-43e0-8138-f4256dec658b: 'To answer the question, we need to determine
      the locations of both Riverwood, KY and Bloomdale, OH relative to each other.


      1. **Identify the Location of Bloomdale, OH**: Bloomdale is a village located
      in Wood County, Ohio. It is situated in the northern part of the state.


      2. **Identify the Location of Riverwood, KY**: Riverwood is not a widely recognized
      city or town, and in fact, there may be some confusion here as there is no prominent
      town named Riverwood in Kentucky. However, for the sake of this question, let''s
      assume Riverwood refers to a hypothetical location in Kentucky.


      3. **Determine the General Directions**: Kentucky is located south of Ohio.
      Therefore, any location in Kentucky would generally be south of locations in
      Ohio. However, since Riverwood''s specific location is not defined, we cannot
      pinpoint it accurately.


      4. **Conclusion**: Assuming Riverwood is anywhere in Kentucky, it would be correct
      to say that it is located south of Bloomdale, OH, based on the geographical
      positioning of the two states.

      2. **Identify the Location of Riverwood, KY**: Riverwood is an unincorporated
      community in Kentucky. However, it is important to clarify that there is no
      prominent or well-known place called Riverwood in Kentucky. If we assume that
      it is a small community, we need to check its approximate coordinates or its
      position relative to Bloomdale.


      3. **Geographical Comparison**: Ohio is north of Kentucky, so if Riverwood,
      KY is below the latitude of Bloomdale, then it indeed would be south.


      4. **Conclusion**: Without definitive coordinates for Riverwood, KY, but knowing
      that Kentucky is generally south of Ohio, we conclude that if Riverwood exists
      in Kentucky, it would be south of Bloomdale, OH.
