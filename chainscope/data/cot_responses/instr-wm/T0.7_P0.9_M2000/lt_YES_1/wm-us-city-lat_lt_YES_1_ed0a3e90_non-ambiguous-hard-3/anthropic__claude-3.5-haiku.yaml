      - Salt Creek is in Colorado, which is north of New Mexico


      4. Determine their relative north-south positioning

      - Since La Mesilla is south of Colorado, and Salt Creek is in Colorado, La Mesilla
      is indeed south of Salt Creek


      5. Final reasoning check

      - La Mesilla is south of Salt Creek, CO


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'
