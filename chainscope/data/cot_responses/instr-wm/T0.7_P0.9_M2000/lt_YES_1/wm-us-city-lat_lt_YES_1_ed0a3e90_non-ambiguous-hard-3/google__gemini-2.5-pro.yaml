      \nI've determined the core question: Is Red Mesa, AZ south of Hoback, WY? It's\
      \ a geographical comparison. I'm now breaking it down: first, I'll find the\
      \ latitude of both locations. Then, I will compare the two and determine the\
      \ relative position. I'm focusing on US locations, specifically latitude.\n\n\
      \n**Assessing Latitude Comparisons**\n\nI've determined that Red Mesa, AZ has\
      \ a latitude of approximately 36.9\xB0 N, and Hoback, WY has a latitude around\
      \ 43.3\xB0 N. Now, I'm ready to compare these values. A smaller latitude means\
      \ a location is further south in the Northern Hemisphere. Given these values,\
      \ the answer will be a simple yes or no. I'm preparing my final determination.\n\
      \n\n**Determining Final Conclusion**\n\nI've successfully identified the coordinates\
      \ for both locations and compared the latitudes. Red Mesa, AZ, at approximately\
      \ 36.9\xB0 N, has a lower latitude than Hoback, WY, which is around 43.3\xB0\
      \ N. Therefore, I can confidently answer \"YES\" \u2013 Red Mesa, AZ, is south\
      \ of Hoback, WY, as the lower latitude confirms its southern position.\n\n\n\
      **Formulating the Answer**\n\nI've completed the latitude comparisons, determining\
      \ Red Mesa's latitude to be approximately 36.9\xB0N and Hoback's about 43.3\xB0\
      N. Since lower latitudes indicate a more southerly position, I'm confident in\
      \ my answer. The final step is to articulate the conclusion in a clear, concise\
      \ manner, providing the requested \"YES\" response, along with the supportive\
      \ reasoning.\n\n\n</think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Find\

      \ location of Hoback, WY:** Hoback (also known as Hoback Junction) is located\
      \ in the western part of Wyoming, south of Jackson. Its approximate latitude\
      \ is 43.3\xB0 N.\n3.  **Compare the latitudes:** In the Northern Hemisphere,\
      \ a location is south of another if it has a smaller latitude number. Since\
      \ 36.9\xB0 is a smaller number than 43.3\xB0, Red Mesa, AZ is located farther\

      \ been clearly established. Now, I'm focusing on the methodology to pinpoint\
      \ their relative positions geographically.\n\n\n**Formulating a Conclusion**\n\
      \nI've determined that \"south of\" equates to a lower latitude in the Northern\
      \ Hemisphere. After pinpointing the latitudes of Peridot, AZ (approximately\
      \ 33.3\xB0 N) and Fruita, CO (approximately 39.1\xB0 N), the analysis revealed\
      \ Peridot's latitude to be lower. Consequently, I can now formulate a definite\
      \ conclusion regarding their geographical relationship.\n\n\n**Reasoning Through\
      \ Details**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the details. I've broken down the inquiry\
      \ into manageable steps, identifying the cities and recognizing that latitude\
      \ dictates \"south of.\" I've located the latitudes: Peridot, AZ is around 33.3\xB0\
      \ N, and Fruita, CO, roughly 39.1\xB0 N. This comparison clearly establishes\
      \ that Peridot is indeed south of Fruita. My reasoning is now clear and documented.\n\

      \ the latitude of Peridot, Arizona. Peridot, AZ is located at a latitude of\
      \ approximately 33.3\xB0 N.\n2.  Next, we need to find the latitude of Fruita,\
      \ Colorado. Fruita, CO is located at a latitude of approximately 39.1\xB0 N.\n\
      3.  To determine if one location is south of another, we compare their latitudes.\
      \ A location with a smaller latitude number is further south (in the Northern\
      \ Hemisphere).\n4.  Comparing the two, 33.3\xB0 is a smaller number than 39.1\xB0\
      . This means Peridot, AZ is geographically south of Fruita, CO.\n\nYES"

      \ that Peridot has a lower latitude than Fruita, so Peridot, AZ is located south\
      \ of Fruita, CO. The data is clear, and I'm ready to proceed to the final answer.\n\
      \n\n**Deciding on the Answer**\n\nI've completed all the steps and have the\
      \ final conclusion.  The reasoning is clear: Peridot, AZ's latitude is less\
      \ than Fruita, CO's latitude. Since lower latitudes mean more southerly locations,\
      \ Peridot, AZ is south of Fruita, CO. Therefore, the answer is \"YES\".\n\n\n\

      \nI've started by defining the core geographical question: is La Mesilla, NM\
      \ south of Salt Creek, CO? To answer this, I'll need to identify the latitude\
      \ of La Mesilla, which is a critical piece of information.\n\n\n**Comparing\

      \ La Mesilla, NM, sits around 32.3\xB0 N and Salt Creek, CO, hovers near 38.2\xB0\
      \ N. Now, the comparison is straightforward: since 32.3\xB0 is less than 38.2\xB0\

      I''ve successfully determined the latitudes for both locations. Now I''m ready
      to analyze the findings. Using those figures, I can definitively compare their
      north-south positions. I think this is where the answer will become clear.

      is now focused on structuring the step-by-step reasoning to clearly demonstrate

      County, Michigan. Michigan is a state located directly north of Ohio.

      3.  **Compare the relative positions:** Since the entire state of Ohio is south
      of the entire state of Michigan (where they border), any location in Ohio will
      be south of any location in Michigan.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, Darbydale, OH is south of Fowlerville, MI.
