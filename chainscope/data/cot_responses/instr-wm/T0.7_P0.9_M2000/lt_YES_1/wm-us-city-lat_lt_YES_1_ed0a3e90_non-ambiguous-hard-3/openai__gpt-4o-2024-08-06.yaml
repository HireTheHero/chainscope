      eastern part of Arizona.


      2. **Locate Fruita, CO**: Fruita is located in the state of Colorado, which

      3. **Determine Relative Latitude**: Since Arizona is south of Colorado, and

      Pueblo County, in south-central Colorado.


      3. **Compare their latitudes**: Generally, New Mexico lies to the south of Colorado.
      Given that La Mesilla is in southern New Mexico and Salt Creek is in south-central
      Colorado, La Mesilla is likely to be south of Salt Creek.


      Based on these steps, the answer is YES, La Mesilla, NM is located south of
      Salt Creek, CO.'
