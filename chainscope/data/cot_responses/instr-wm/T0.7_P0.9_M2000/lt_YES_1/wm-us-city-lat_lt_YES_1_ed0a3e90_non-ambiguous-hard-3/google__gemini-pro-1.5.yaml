      city/town:** Red Mesa, AZ is in northeastern Arizona, near the Four Corners
      region. Hoback, WY is in northwestern Wyoming, near Jackson Hole.


      2. **Compare latitudes:** Arizona is south of Wyoming.


      3. **Consider the specific locations within the states:** While Red Mesa is
      in *northeastern* Arizona, and Hoback is in *northwestern* Wyoming, Arizona
      as a whole is still considerably south of Wyoming as a whole.  The east/west
      offset isn''t enough to change the fundamental north/south relationship.
