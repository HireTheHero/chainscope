      Step 1: Identify the locations of both cities.

      - Red Mesa, AZ is in Arizona, which is in the southwestern United States.

      - Hoback, WY is in Wyoming, which is in the northwestern United States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions.

      - Arizona is located south of Wyoming on a map of the United States.

      - Wyoming shares its southern border with Colorado and Utah, while Arizona is
      south of Utah.


      Step 3: Verify the specific locations within their states.

      - The exact locations within their states wouldn''t change the north-south relationship
      since the entirety of Arizona is south of the entirety of Wyoming.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on U.S. geography.

      - Since Arizona is entirely south of Wyoming, any city in Arizona (including
      Red Mesa) must be south of any city in Wyoming (including Hoback).


      YES, Red Mesa, AZ is located south of Hoback, WY.'

      Step 1: Recall the general geographic positions of Arizona and Wyoming.

      - Arizona is in the southwestern United States

      - Wyoming is in the northwestern United States

      - Generally, Wyoming is north of Arizona


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Red Mesa is in Arizona, which is already south of Wyoming

      - Hoback is in Wyoming, which is already north of Arizona

      - The specific locations within their states won''t change the north-south relationship
      between states


      Step 3: Confirm the north-south relationship.

      - Arizona shares its northern border with Utah, while Wyoming is north of both

      - Therefore, any location in Arizona must be south of any location in Wyoming


      Based on this reasoning, Red Mesa, AZ must be located south of Hoback, WY.

      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States

      - Wyoming is located in the western United States, but north of Arizona


      Step 3: Compare their general north-south positions.

      - Wyoming shares a border with Montana to its north and Colorado to its south

      - Arizona is south of Colorado, bordering Mexico to its south

      - This means Wyoming is entirely north of Arizona


      Step 4: Since Red Mesa is in Arizona and Hoback is in Wyoming, and Arizona is
      entirely south of Wyoming, Red Mesa must be south of Hoback.

      Step 1: Consider the states. Arizona (AZ) is located in the southwestern United
      States, while Wyoming (WY) is located in the northwestern part of the country.


      Step 2: In terms of latitude, states in the northern US generally have higher
      latitudes than states in the southern US. Wyoming is significantly north of
      Arizona.


      Step 3: Red Mesa is in Arizona, so it would be in the southern state. Hoback
      is in Wyoming, so it would be in the northern state.


      Step 4: Cities within these states would generally follow the same north-south
      relationship as their states, unless they were located at extreme edges that
      might overlap. However, given the substantial distance between Wyoming and Arizona,
      this is unlikely.


      Step 5: Since Red Mesa, AZ is in a southern state (Arizona) and Hoback, WY is
      in a northern state (Wyoming), Red Mesa would be south of Hoback.

      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of both Peridot, AZ and Fruita, CO.

      - Peridot is in Arizona (AZ), which is a state in the southwestern United States.

      - Fruita is in Colorado (CO), which is a state north of Arizona.


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Arizona and Colorado.

      - Arizona shares its northern border with Utah and Colorado is north of that.

      - Colorado is directly north of the Four Corners region (where Arizona, New
      Mexico, Colorado, and Utah meet).


      Step 3: Looking at the specific locations within their states:

      - Peridot is located in central-eastern Arizona, on the San Carlos Apache Indian
      Reservation.

      - Fruita is located in western Colorado, near the Utah border.


      Step 4: Comparing latitudes:

      - All of Arizona is south of Colorado (except for the very northernmost part
      of Arizona which is at similar latitude to the southernmost part of Colorado).

      - Since Peridot is not in the extreme northern part of Arizona, and Fruita is
      not in the extreme southern part of Colorado, Peridot must be south of Fruita.

      First, I need to determine the geographical locations of both cities:

      - Lecompton is in Kansas (KS)

      - Prior Lake is in Minnesota (MN)


      Looking at the relative positions of these states:

      - Minnesota (MN) is in the northern part of the central United States

      - Kansas (KS) is in the central United States, south of Minnesota


      Since Lecompton is in Kansas, and Kansas is entirely south of Minnesota, and
      Prior Lake is in Minnesota, it follows that Lecompton must be south of Prior
      Lake.


      NO WAIT - I need to be precise. While Kansas is generally south of Minnesota,
      I should verify the specific locations of these cities.


      Lecompton, KS is located in northeastern Kansas.

      Prior Lake, MN is located in southeastern Minnesota.


      Minnesota''s southern border is entirely north of Kansas''s northern border.
      Therefore, any city in Kansas (including Lecompton) must be south of any city
      in Minnesota (including Prior Lake).

      NO WAIT - I need to be more precise. Let me verify this more carefully:


      Step 3 (revised): While Florida is generally south of Georgia, I need to check
      the specific locations. Pomona Park is in northeastern Florida, while Guyton
      is in southeastern Georgia. Looking at their positions:

      - Guyton, GA is in the southeastern part of Georgia

      - Pomona Park, FL is in the northeastern part of Florida
