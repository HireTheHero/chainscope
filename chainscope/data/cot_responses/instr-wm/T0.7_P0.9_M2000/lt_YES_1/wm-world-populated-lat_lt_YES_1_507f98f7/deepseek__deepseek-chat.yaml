      \ Sampang Regency is indeed south of Soreang.\n\nLet's start with **Sampang\
      \ Regency**.\n\n### Step 1: Locate Sampang Regency\n\nI'll begin by searching\
      \ for Sampang Regency. From what I recall, Sampang is a regency in Indonesia.\
      \ Let me confirm that.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that Sampang Regency\
      \ is located in the Madura Island of East Java Province, Indonesia. Its coordinates\
      \ are approximately **7.05\xB0 S latitude** and **113.25\xB0 E longitude**.\n\
      \n### Step 2: Locate Soreang\n\nNext, I need to find out where Soreang is. I\
      \ think Soreang might be in Indonesia as well, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\n\
      Upon researching, I discover that Soreang is a town located in West Java Province,\
      \ Indonesia. Its coordinates are roughly **6.92\xB0 S latitude** and **107.53\xB0\
      \ E longitude**.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Latitudes\n\nNow that I have the\
      \ coordinates for both places, I can compare their latitudes to determine which\
      \ one is further south.\n\n- **Sampang Regency:** 7.05\xB0 S latitude\n- **Soreang:**\
      \ 6.92\xB0 S latitude\n\nIn terms of latitude, the further south a location\
      \ is, the higher its southern latitude value. So, 7.05\xB0 S is further south\
      \ than 6.92\xB0 S.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nSince Sampang Regency is located\
      \ at a higher southern latitude (7.05\xB0 S) compared to Soreang's latitude\

    20e48093-2dd1-4595-bca7-ddee1055c793: "Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether\
      \ Toretsk is located south of Maza, North Dakota. To answer this, I need to\
      \ know where both places are located geographically. Let's break it down step\
      \ by step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Location of Maza, North Dakota\n\nFirst,\
      \ I need to find out where Maza, North Dakota is. I recall that North Dakota\
      \ is a state in the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada. Maza\
      \ seems like a small town, so I'll look up its exact location.\n\nAfter a quick\
      \ search, I find that Maza is indeed a small town in North Dakota, located in\
      \ the northeastern part of the state. Its coordinates are approximately 48.3911\xB0\
      \ N latitude and 97.6994\xB0 W longitude.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Location\
      \ of Toretsk\n\nNext, I need to determine where Toretsk is. I'm not immediately\
      \ familiar with this name, so I'll look it up.\n\nUpon researching, I discover\
      \ that Toretsk is a city in Ukraine. Ukraine is a country in Eastern Europe,\
      \ and Toretsk is located in the Donetsk region. Its coordinates are approximately\
      \ 48.4000\xB0 N latitude and 37.8500\xB0 E longitude.\n\n### Step 3: Compare\
      \ the Latitudes of Both Locations\n\nNow that I have the coordinates of both\
      \ places, I can compare their latitudes to determine which one is further south.\n\
      \n- Maza, North Dakota: 48.3911\xB0 N\n- Toretsk, Ukraine: 48.4000\xB0 N\n\n\
      Latitude measures how far north or south a location is from the equator. A higher\
      \ latitude means a location is further north.\n\nComparing the two:\n- Toretsk\
      \ is at 48.4000\xB0 N\n- Maza is at 48.3911\xB0 N\n\nSince 48.4000\xB0 N is\
      \ slightly higher than 48.3911\xB0 N, Toretsk is marginally further north than\
      \ Maza.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nBased on the latitude comparison:\n\n-\
      \ Toretsk is at a higher latitude (48.4000\xB0 N) than Maza (48.3911\xB0 N).\n\
      - Therefore, Toretsk is located north of Maza, North Dakota.\n\n### Final Answer\n\
      \nNO, Toretsk is not located south of Maza, North Dakota; it is actually slightly\
      \ to the north."

      \ I need to determine the geographical locations of both places and compare\
      \ their latitudes. The place with the lower latitude is further south.\n\n###\
      \ Identifying Utran\n\nFirst, I need to locate **Utran**. A quick search reveals\
      \ that Utran is a village in the state of **Gujarat**, **India**. To find its\
      \ exact coordinates:\n\n1. **Country**: India\n2. **State**: Gujarat\n3. **Region**:\
      \ Surat district\n\nUsing a reliable map or geographical database, I find that\
      \ **Utran** is situated at approximately **21.1667\xB0 N latitude** and **72.8333\xB0\
      \ E longitude**.\n\n### Identifying Isla Mujeres\n\nNext, I need to locate **Isla\
      \ Mujeres**. This is an island in the **Caribbean Sea**, part of **Mexico**.\
      \ To find its coordinates:\n\n1. **Country**: Mexico\n2. **State**: Quintana\
      \ Roo\n3. **Region**: Near Canc\xFAn\n\nFrom geographical resources, **Isla\
      \ Mujeres** is located at roughly **21.2333\xB0 N latitude** and **86.7333\xB0\
      \ W longitude**.\n\n### Comparing Latitudes\n\nNow, I compare the latitudes\
      \ of both locations:\n\n- **Utran**: 21.1667\xB0 N\n- **Isla Mujeres**: 21.2333\xB0\
      \ N\n\nSince latitude increases as one moves north from the equator, a lower\
      \ latitude means a location is further south.\n\n### Determining Which is Further\
      \ South\n\nComparing the two:\n\n- 21.1667\xB0 N (Utran) is less than 21.2333\xB0\
      \ N (Isla Mujeres)\n\nTherefore, **Utran** is further south than **Isla Mujeres**.\n\

      \ This is a small town in the Western Cape province of South Africa. It's known\

      \ commune in the Santiago Metropolitan Region of Chile. It's part of the greater\
      \ Santiago area.\n\n### Determining the Hemispheres\n\nBefore comparing latitudes,\
      \ it's essential to note the hemispheres these places are in:\n\n- **Riebeek-Kasteel**:\
      \ Located in the **Southern Hemisphere** since it's in South Africa.\n- **Conchal\xED\
      **: Also located in the **Southern Hemisphere** as it's in Chile.\n\n### Finding\
      \ the Latitudes\n\nTo determine which place is further south, I need their specific\
      \ latitudes:\n\n1. **Riebeek-Kasteel**:\n   - Latitude: Approximately **33.38\xB0\
      \ S**\n2. **Conchal\xED**:\n   - Latitude: Approximately **33.38\xB0 S**\n\n\

      \ S**\n- **Conchal\xED**: Latitude is around **33.38\xB0 S**\n\nIt seems both\
      \ places share the same latitude. This would imply they are at the same line\
      \ of latitude, meaning neither is north or south of the other in terms of latitude.\n\
      \n### Considering Longitude\n\nSince latitude doesn't provide a distinction,\
      \ perhaps longitude could, but the question specifically asks about the south-north\
      \ positioning, which is determined by latitude.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven that\
      \ both Riebeek-Kasteel and Conchal\xED share the same latitude of approximately\
      \ **33.38\xB0 S**, neither is located south of the other. They are at the same\
      \ degree of latitude in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nTherefore, the answer to\

      metropolitan area is located south of Thiruvananthapuram itself. This seems
      contradictory because the metropolitan area typically includes the city and
      its surrounding regions.


      2. **What is a metropolitan area?**: A metropolitan area includes a central
      city and its surrounding suburbs, towns, and other urban areas that are economically
      and socially connected to it. Therefore, the metropolitan area of Thiruvananthapuram
      would include Thiruvananthapuram city and its nearby regions.

      in India, located in the state of Kerala. Its metropolitan area would naturally
      extend in all directions (north, south, east, and west) from the city center.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since the metropolitan area includes the city itself and

      \ by step.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Ochota and Enschede**\n- Ochota: To figure\
      \ out where Ochota is, I'll start by recalling that Ochota is a district in\
      \ Warsaw, the capital of Poland. So, Ochota is located in Poland.\n- Enschede:\
      \ Enschede is a city in the eastern part of the Netherlands. So, Enschede is\
      \ located in the Netherlands.\n\n**Step 2: Locate Poland and the Netherlands\
      \ on a map**\n- Poland is in Central Europe, bordered by Germany to the west,\
      \ the Czech Republic to the southwest, Slovakia to the south, Ukraine and Belarus\
      \ to the east, and Lithuania and Russia (Kaliningrad Oblast) to the northeast.\n\
      - The Netherlands is in Northwestern Europe, bordered by Germany to the east\
      \ and Belgium to the south.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the relative positions of\
      \ Poland and the Netherlands**\n- Looking at a map of Europe, Poland is generally\
      \ to the east of Germany, while the Netherlands is to the northwest of Germany.\
      \ This means that Poland is located to the east of the Netherlands.\n\n**Step\
      \ 4: Compare the latitudes of Ochota and Enschede**\n- To determine if Ochota\
      \ is south of Enschede, we need to compare their latitudes. Latitude lines run\
      \ horizontally around the Earth, with the equator at 0 degrees. The higher the\
      \ latitude number, the further north a place is.\n- Warsaw (where Ochota is\
      \ located) has a latitude of approximately 52.2297\xB0 N.\n- Enschede has a\
      \ latitude of approximately 52.2215\xB0 N.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the latitude\
      \ differences**\n- Both Ochota and Enschede have very similar latitudes, with\
      \ Ochota at approximately 52.2297\xB0 N and Enschede at approximately 52.2215\xB0\
      \ N.\n- Since 52.2297\xB0 N is slightly higher than 52.2215\xB0 N, Ochota is\
      \ actually a tiny bit north of Enschede, not south.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased\

      \ by step. The goal is to determine whether Jesen\xEDk District is located south\
      \ of Karlovy Vary District in the Czech Republic. Here's how we can approach\
      \ this:\n\n### 1. **Understanding the Locations**\n   \n   - **Jesen\xEDk District**\
      \ is located in the northern part of the Czech Republic, specifically in the\
      \ Olomouc Region.\n   - **Karlovy Vary District** is situated in the western\
      \ part of the Czech Republic, in the Karlovy Vary Region.\n\n### 2. **Locating\
      \ the Districts on a Map**\n\n   To determine the relative positions, we need\
      \ to visualize or refer to a map of the Czech Republic.\n\n   - **Karlovy Vary**\
      \ is in the westernmost part, near the border with Germany.\n   - **Jesen\xED\
      k** is in the northeastern part, near the border with Poland.\n\n### 3. **Determining\
      \ Latitude**\n\n   Generally, the southernmost parts of the Czech Republic are\
      \ closer to Austria, while the northernmost parts are near Poland and Germany.\n\
      \n   - **Karlovy Vary** is at a latitude of approximately 50.23\xB0 N.\n   -\
      \ **Jesen\xEDk** is at a latitude of approximately 50.23\xB0 N as well.\n\n\
      Wait, that's interesting. Both districts are at almost the same latitude.\n\n\
      ### 4. **Analyzing the Latitude**\n\n   If both districts are at the same latitude,\
      \ it suggests they are at the same north-south position. Therefore, Jesen\xED\
      k District is neither north nor south of Karlovy Vary District; they are at\
      \ the same latitudinal level.\n\n### 5. **Considering Longitude**\n\n   While\
      \ latitude determines north-south positioning, longitude determines east-west\
      \ positioning.\n\n   - **Karlovy Vary** is at approximately 12.87\xB0 E.\n \
      \  - **Jesen\xEDk** is at approximately 17.00\xB0 E.\n\n   This means Jesen\xED\
      k is further east than Karlovy Vary.\n\n### 6. **Conclusion on North-South Positioning**\n\
      \n   Since both districts share the same latitude, Jesen\xEDk District is not\
      \ located south of Karlovy Vary District. Instead, they are at the same north-south\
      \ level, with Jesen\xEDk being east of Karlovy Vary.\n\n**Final Answer:** NO"
