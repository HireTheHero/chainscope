    3dc79cbc-9aae-43b7-ae0d-a830e5402407: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Litlington, East Sussex and Bettiscombe are both
      in the United Kingdom.


      2. **Determine the general positions**: Litlington is in the county of East
      Sussex, which is located in the southeast of England. Bettiscombe is in the
      county of Dorset, which is also in the southern part of England but more towards
      the southwest.


      3. **Consider the latitude**: To determine if one location is south of another,
      we need to consider their latitude. Both East Sussex and Dorset are in the southern
      part of England, but Dorset is slightly more towards the southwest.


      4. **Compare the latitudes**: Based on the general geographical positions, Bettiscombe
      (in Dorset) would be slightly more to the southwest compared to Litlington (in
      East Sussex).


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the general positions, it is not accurate to say that
      Litlington, East Sussex is located south of Bettiscombe, as Bettiscombe is more
      towards the southwest. However, the difference in latitude is not significant,
      and both are in the southern part of England.


      The final answer is: **NO**'

      2. **Determine the countries**: Next, we need to determine the countries where
      these locations are situated. Truro is in Australia, and Cabo Polonio is in
      Uruguay.


      3. **Understand geographical context**: Knowing that Australia is a continent
      in the Southern Hemisphere and Uruguay is a country in South America, also in
      the Southern Hemisphere, helps in understanding their relative positions on
      the globe.


      4. **Compare the positions**: Australia is located in the southern part of the
      world, and Uruguay is also in the southern part of the world. However, Uruguay
      is located further north than Australia in terms of latitude.


      5. **Determine the latitude**: To determine if Truro is south of Cabo Polonio,
      we need to consider their latitudes. Generally, Australia is at a lower latitude
      than Uruguay, meaning it is more to the south.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical positions, Truro, being in Australia,
      would generally be south of Cabo Polonio in Uruguay, considering the overall
      geographical layout of the Southern Hemisphere.

      west of Nigeria, where Apapa is located. Considering the general geographical
      layout of West Africa, Bekwai would be south of Apapa.


      Given these considerations, the answer is: **YES**'

      3. **Understand geographical context**: Knowing that Italy and Greece are both
      countries in Europe helps in understanding their relative positions.


      4. **Compare the positions**: Italy is located to the west of Greece. Vulcano,
      being an island off the coast of Italy, would be further west than Amarynthos
      in Greece.


      5. **Determine the latitude**: To determine if Vulcano is south of Amarynthos,
      we need to consider their latitudes. Generally, locations further west in the
      northern hemisphere have lower latitudes, meaning they are more to the south.

      state in the western part of the U.S., while California is also a western state
      but with a diverse geography that includes mountains, deserts, and coastal areas.


      3. **Compare the positions**: Colorado is generally located east of California.
      Within Colorado, Silverton is situated in the southwestern part of the state,
      specifically in San Juan County. Buck Meadows, on the other hand, is in Mariposa
      County in central California, east of the San Francisco Bay Area.


      4. **Determine the latitude**: To determine if Silverton is south of Buck Meadows,
      we need to consider their latitudes. Generally, Silverton, being in the southwestern
      part of Colorado, would have a lower latitude than Buck Meadows in central California.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical positions, Silverton, being in the
      southwestern part of Colorado, would generally be south of Buck Meadows in central
      California, considering the overall layout of the U.S. states.

      Norway.


      2. **Determine the countries**: Next, we need to determine the countries where
      these locations are situated. Viikki is in Finland, and Sotra is in Norway.


      3. **Understand geographical context**: Knowing that both Finland and Norway
      are countries in Northern Europe helps in understanding their relative positions
      on the continent.


      4. **Compare the positions**: Finland is east of Norway. Within Finland, Helsinki
      is located in the southern part of the country. Sotra, on the other hand, is
      an island located off the western coast of Norway.


      5. **Determine the latitude**: To determine if Viikki is south of Sotra, we
      need to consider their latitudes. Generally, Norway is at a higher latitude
      than Finland, meaning it is more to the north.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical positions, Viikki, being in Helsinki,
      Finland, would generally be south of Sotra in Norway, considering the overall
      geographical layout of Northern Europe.


      The final answer is: **YES**'

      \ how far east or west a location is from the prime meridian, which runs through\
      \ Greenwich, England. Locations east of the prime meridian have positive longitudes,\
      \ while locations west of the prime meridian have negative longitudes.\n\n6.\
