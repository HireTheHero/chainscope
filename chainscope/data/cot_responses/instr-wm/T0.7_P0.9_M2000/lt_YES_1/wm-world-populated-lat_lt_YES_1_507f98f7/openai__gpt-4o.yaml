      - Chhattisgarh is located in central India.

      - Gujarat is located to the west of Chhattisgarh.

      - Bounds Green, being in North London, is situated roughly north of central
      London.

      - Risca, being in South Wales, is situated west of Bristol and south-west of
      central London.


      Given these locations, Bounds Green (North London) is north of Risca (South
      Wales).


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Bounds Green is not located south of Risca.'

    0ffc0b93-c3e7-4c12-9857-c162de8e7ec6: 'To determine if Argentine Antarctica is
      located south of Rothera Research Station, let''s break this down:


      1. **Identify the Location of Rothera Research Station**: Rothera Research Station
      is a British research station located on the Antarctic Peninsula. It is situated
      on Adelaide Island, which is on the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula.


      2. **Identify the Location of Argentine Antarctica**: Argentine Antarctica is
      a sector claimed by Argentina in Antarctica. This claim overlaps with the British
      and Chilean claims and is largely located on the Antarctic Peninsula and the
      surrounding islands.


      3. **Geographical Orientation**: The Antarctic Peninsula stretches towards South
      America and is one of the northernmost parts of the mainland of Antarctica.
      Since Rothera Research Station is on Adelaide Island, part of the western side
      of the peninsula, and Argentine Antarctica includes a large portion of the Antarctic
      Peninsula, it is important to note the orientation and extent of Argentine Antarctica.


      4. **Relative Position**: Argentine Antarctica covers a broad area that includes
      parts both north and south of Rothera Research Station. However, considering
      the specific question of whether the entire Argentine Antarctica is south of
      Rothera, the answer hinges on whether any part of Argentine Antarctica extends
      further south than Rothera.


      Since Rothera is situated relatively far south on the Antarctic Peninsula but
      not at the furthest southern extent, Argentine Antarctica would indeed have
      portions that extend further south than Rothera Research Station.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      NO. Argentine Antarctica is not located entirely south of Rothera Research Station;
      parts of it extend further south, but it also includes areas north of Rothera.'

      Antarctic Survey base located on Adelaide Island, which is off the west coast
      of the Antarctic Peninsula.


      2. **Location of Argentine Antarctica**: Argentine Antarctica is a sector claimed

      is part of the Antarctic Peninsula region. Argentine Antarctica encompasses
      the Antarctic Peninsula and areas to the south as part of Argentina''s territorial
      claim.


      Therefore, considering the general geographic understanding, Argentine Antarctica

      - **Benishangul-Gumuz Region** is situated in Ethiopia, which is in the eastern
      part of Africa.

      - **Thuvakudi**, being in Tamil Nadu, is in the southern part of India.


      India is generally located east of Africa and, more specifically, Tamil Nadu
      is situated south of the northern regions of the African continent, including
      Ethiopia.
