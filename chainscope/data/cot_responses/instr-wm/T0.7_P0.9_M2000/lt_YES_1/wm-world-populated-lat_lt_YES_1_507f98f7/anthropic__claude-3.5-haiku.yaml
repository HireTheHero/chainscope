      3. By definition, a metropolitan area includes the city and its surrounding
      urban and suburban areas.


      4. A metropolitan area cannot be located south of itself, as it encompasses
      the city.


      5. Therefore, it would be impossible for the metropolitan area to be south of
      the city it contains.


      The answer is: NO.'

      - Fernando de Noronha is an archipelago located in the Atlantic Ocean

      - It is part of Brazil

      - It is situated off the northeast coast of Brazil, specifically in the state
      of Pernambuco


      2. Next, let''s locate Mbulu District:

      - Mbulu District is located in Tanzania

      - It is in the northern part of Tanzania, specifically in the Manyara Region


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Fernando de Noronha is in the Northern Hemisphere (around 3-4 degrees south
      latitude)

      - Mbulu District is also in the Northern Hemisphere (around 4-5 degrees south
      latitude)


      4. Relative positioning:

      - Both locations are relatively close to the equator

      - Fernando de Noronha is slightly closer to the equator than Mbulu District


      5. Conclusion:

      - Fernando de Noronha is NOT south of Mbulu District

      1. First, Hasbaya District is a district located in Lebanon, in the Middle East.


      2. Globe, Arizona is a town located in the United States, specifically in Arizona.
