      However, based on the known filmography of Richard Stanley, there is no record
      of a movie titled "Brave" directed by him. Given this, we can only conclude
      based on available information.


      Since there is no verifiable release date for a film titled "Brave" by Richard
      Stanley, we cannot confirm a direct comparison. However, based on the premise
      that such a film does not exist in his known filmography, we can infer that

      Richard Stanley does not have a film titled "Brave." However, if you''re referring

      - **Love! Valour! Compassion!** was released on May 16, 1997.

      Given that "Penda''s Fen" has a known release date of March 21, 1974, and without

      1. "The Boatniks" is a film directed by Norman Tokar and was released in 1970.

      2. "Hello-Goodbye" is a film directed by Jean Negulesco and was released in
      1970.


      Since both films were released in the same year, we need to check the specific
      release dates:


      - "The Boatniks" was released on July 1, 1970.

      - "Hello-Goodbye" was released on May 20, 1970.


      Therefore, "Hello-Goodbye" was released earlier than "The Boatniks."


      The answer is NO. "The Boatniks" was not released earlier than "Hello-Goodbye."'
