      before *Quest for Love*''s 1971 release.


      4. **Answer the question.** Potentially YES, though more precise release information
      is needed for absolute certainty.  However, given the information available,
      it''s possible *The Bloodstained Butterfly* saw an earlier release.  For the
      purpose of a YES/NO answer, and given the likelihood of the Italian release
      predating the other: YES.

      1968, but saw wider release in 1969. *The Guru* was released in April 1969.


      Therefore, *Me and My Brother* had its initial release before *The Guru*, though
      its general release may have been concurrent or later in the year.  Focusing
      on wider release, the question is ambiguous.  However, given the initial premiere,
      the answer is likely YES.

      3. **Compare release dates:** If the question refers to the 1993 "East Wind",
      both films were released in the same year, meaning one wasn''t necessarily *earlier*
      than the other.  If it refers to the 1970 "East Wind", then Fight Back to School
      III was released much later.


      4. **Determine YES/NO based on most likely intended meaning:**  Since the question
      mentions a director for "East Wind", it is more likely referring to the 1993
      film.  As both were released in the same year, one wasn''t earlier than the
      other.


      NO

      premiered in October 2010 in the US.  I have been unable to pinpoint the exact
      dates of the premieres to definitively say which came first. However, *A Woman*
      does not appear to have had a US release and *Red* had a wide US release on
      October 15, 2010.  Therefore, it''s highly likely *Red* had a general release
      before *A Woman* if you are considering a US audience.


      4. **Answer the question.**  It''s probable but not definitively confirmable
      without more specific release information.  Therefore, leaning towards NO.
