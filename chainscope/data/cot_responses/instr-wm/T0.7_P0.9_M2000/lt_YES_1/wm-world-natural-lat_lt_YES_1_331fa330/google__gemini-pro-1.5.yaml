      2. **Locate Margalla Hills:** The Margalla Hills are a range of hills located
      north of Islamabad, Pakistan.


      3. **Compare Locations:** Southern California is in North America, while Islamabad
      is in Asia.  Therefore, the Temescal Mountains and Margalla Hills are located
      on different continents.  South implies a relative direction within a reasonably
      proximate area.  Given they are on different continents, the concept of ''south''
      in this context isn''t meaningful.  It''s like asking if London is East of Tokyo
      - while technically true based on absolute coordinates, it''s not a useful geographic
      comparison.

      Therefore, Bali Sea is *partially* south of Madura Strait, but not entirely.  Since
      the question asks if it''s located *south* without qualification, a fully accurate
      answer considering the geography would lean towards no. However, a simplified
      answer, considering the significant portion that lies south, could be yes.  Given
