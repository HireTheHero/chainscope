      3. In the Southern Hemisphere (where New Zealand is located), going downhill
      generally means going northward in this valley.

      it is actually north of Inferno Crater Lake, not south.

      1. First, let me recall the locations:

      - Loch of the Lowes is in Perthshire, Scotland

      - Blackwater Reservoir is in Highland, Scotland
