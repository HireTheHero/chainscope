      Step 1: Identify the location of Gagra Range.

      The Gagra Range is a mountain range located in the northwestern part of Georgia

      the Greater Caucasus mountain system.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lizard Pond, New York.

      United States.


      Step 3: Compare the global positions.

      Georgia (country) is located in the Caucasus region between Eastern Europe and
      Western Asia, roughly between 41-43 degrees North latitude.

      New York State is located in the northeastern United States, roughly between
      40-45 degrees North latitude.

      Since both locations are in roughly the same latitude range, I need to be precise.
      New York State is in North America, while the Gagra Range is in Eurasia. On
      a global north-south comparison, they are at similar latitudes, but the Gagra

      Step 1: Determine the location of Temescal Mountains.

      The Temescal Mountains are located in Southern California, USA, specifically
      in Riverside County.


      Step 2: Determine the location of Margalla Hills.

      The Margalla Hills are located in northern Pakistan, near Islamabad (the capital
      city).


      Step 3: Compare their global positions.

      Southern California is located in North America, roughly between 32-34 degrees
      North latitude.

      Northern Pakistan is located in Asia, with the Margalla Hills at approximately
      33.7 degrees North latitude.


      Step 4: Determine north-south relationship.

      When comparing locations globally, "south of" means at a lower latitude.

      Both mountain ranges are at similar latitudes, but their east-west positions
      are very different (different continents).


      Step 5: Make the final determination.

      Since both are at similar latitudes but on opposite sides of the world, neither
      is truly "south of" the other in a direct sense. However, if we''re being precise
      about latitude values, the Temescal Mountains in Southern California extend
      slightly further south than the Margalla Hills.

      and Tolay Lake, and then compare their positions to see if Panachaiko is south
      of Tolay Lake.


      Step 1: Identify where Panachaiko is located.

      Panachaiko is a mountain in Greece, specifically in the northern Peloponnese
      region. Greece is in southeastern Europe.


      Step 2: Identify where Tolay Lake is located.

      Tolay Lake is located in Sonoma County, California, in the United States. California
      is on the west coast of North America.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes to determine north-south positioning.

      Greece is located at approximately 35-42 degrees north latitude.

      California is located at approximately 32-42 degrees north latitude.


      However, more specifically:

      - Panachaiko mountain is located at about 38 degrees north latitude

      - Tolay Lake in Sonoma County is at about 38 degrees north latitude


      Step 4: Make the final comparison.

      While they are at similar latitudes, Greece is in the Eastern Hemisphere while
      California is in the Western Hemisphere. When comparing locations across hemispheres,
      we need to consider global positioning.


      Since both are in the Northern Hemisphere at similar latitudes, the north-south

      locations, Panachaiko in Greece is not south of Tolay Lake in California - they
      are at approximately the same latitude.

      of Pentland Hills and Castle Semple Loch to answer this question.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Pentland Hills.

      The Pentland Hills are a range of hills located just southwest of Edinburgh,
      Scotland, in the central belt of Scotland.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Castle Semple Loch.

      Castle Semple Loch is a freshwater loch located in Renfrewshire, in the western
      central Lowlands of Scotland, near the town of Lochwinnoch.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      When looking at their positions on a map of Scotland:

      - Pentland Hills are in the east-central part of Scotland''s central belt

      - Castle Semple Loch is in the western part of Scotland''s central belt


      Step 4: Determine north-south relationship.

      Both locations are roughly on the same latitude in Scotland''s central belt.
      However, Castle Semple Loch is to the west of the Pentland Hills, not directly
      north or south of them. If anything, Castle Semple Loch is very slightly south
      of the Pentland Hills, which would mean the Pentland Hills are north of Castle
      Semple Loch, not south.

      Step 1: Identify where Pentland Hills is located.

      The Pentland Hills are located in central Scotland, just southwest of Edinburgh.


      Step 2: Identify where Castle Semple Loch is located.

      Castle Semple Loch is located in Renfrewshire, west of Glasgow in Scotland.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Edinburgh is in the east of Scotland''s central belt, while Glasgow is to the
      west, but they''re at roughly similar latitudes. Castle Semple Loch, being west
      of Glasgow, is in the western part of central Scotland.


      When comparing their positions, the Pentland Hills (near Edinburgh) are in the
      eastern part of central Scotland, while Castle Semple Loch is in the western
      part. In terms of north-south positioning, Castle Semple Loch is actually slightly
      south of the Pentland Hills.

      Castle Semple Loch is located in western Scotland, while the Pentland Hills
      are located near Edinburgh in central/eastern Scotland.

      In Scotland, when comparing west to east locations, the western locations (like
      Castle Semple Loch) are generally to the north and west of central/eastern locations
      (like the Pentland Hills near Edinburgh).


      Step 4: Make the north-south determination.

      Castle Semple Loch is actually located to the west and slightly north of the
      Pentland Hills. The Pentland Hills are not south of Castle Semple Loch; they
      are east and slightly south of it.

      1) Wicklow Mountains are located in County Wicklow on the east coast of Ireland,

      The Transantarctic Mountains form a major mountain range that extends across
      Antarctica, essentially dividing the continent into East Antarctica and West

      Mountains are located in the interior of Antarctica, in a position that is south
      of parts of the Transantarctic Mountain range.


      Step 4: Consider the directional relationship.

      In Antarctica, directions become somewhat complicated because of the convergence
      of meridians at the South Pole. However, when we consider the general orientation

      Step 3: Let me determine their relative positions.

      Mount Cayley volcanic field is located approximately 45 km northwest of Squamish
      and about 20-25 km west of Whistler. Wedge Mountain is located just north of
      Whistler.


      Step 4: Compare their north-south positions.

      Since Mount Cayley volcanic field is west of Whistler, and Wedge Mountain is
      north of Whistler, this would place Mount Cayley volcanic field south of Wedge
      Mountain.


      NO.


      Actually, I need to reconsider. Mount Cayley volcanic field is northwest of
      Squamish and west of Whistler, while Wedge Mountain is north of Whistler. This
      means Mount Cayley volcanic field is southwest of Wedge Mountain, not directly
      south, but still south of it in terms of latitude.

      2-6 degrees north.

      - Colombia is also relatively close to the equator, but in South America, with
      Cali located at approximately 3.4 degrees north latitude.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Both locations are in the northern hemisphere, but they''re on different continents.
      Chini Lake in Malaysia and Farallones de Cali in Colombia are at similar latitudes,
      both just a few degrees north of the equator. However, Chini Lake in Malaysia
      is slightly further north than Farallones de Cali.


      NO - Chini Lake is not located south of Farallones de Cali. It is actually slightly
      north, though both are in the northern hemisphere near the equator.'
