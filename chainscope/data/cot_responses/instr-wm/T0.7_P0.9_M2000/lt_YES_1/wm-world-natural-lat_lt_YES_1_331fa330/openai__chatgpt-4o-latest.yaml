      2. The Moonbi Range is located in Australia, specifically in New South Wales.

      3. To determine relative location, we note that South Africa is in the Southern
      Hemisphere, while the Moonbi Range is in Australia, which is also in the Southern
      Hemisphere.

      4. However, South Africa is much farther south compared to the location of the
      Moonbi Range in Australia.

      5. Thus, the Stormberg Mountains are located south of the Moonbi Range.


      **Final Answer: YES**'

      lake named "Mountain Lodge Lake" in the region. However, if you are referring
      to a lake near a mountain lodge in the Gokyo area, clarification would be needed.

      Lake," it is not possible to determine its exact geographical relation to the
      Gokyo Lakes.

      feature).'

      \ **48\xB0 N latitude**.  \n   - The Cabox is at approximately **49\xB0 N latitude**.\
      \  \n\n4. **Determine if Kanas Lake is south of The Cabox:**  \n   - Since Kanas\
      \ Lake is at **48\xB0 N** and The Cabox is at **49\xB0 N**, Kanas Lake is **south**\
      \ of The Cabox.  \n\n**Final Answer: YES**."
    e4d58b86-43ae-46f3-b309-197a9e32073d: "1. **Identify Kanas Lake's location**:\
      \  \n   - Kanas Lake is in China, specifically in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous\
      \ Region.  \n   - It is in the northern part of Xinjiang, near the borders of\
      \ Kazakhstan, Russia, and Mongolia.  \n\n2. **Identify The Cabox's location**:\
      \  \n   - The Cabox is the highest point of the Long Range Mountains in Newfoundland\
      \ and Labrador, Canada.  \n   - It is located on the western part of Newfoundland\
      \ island.  \n\n3. **Compare their relative positions**:  \n   - Kanas Lake is\
      \ in China (Asia).  \n   - The Cabox is in Canada (North America).  \n   - Since\
      \ China is generally at a lower latitude compared to Newfoundland and Labrador,\
      \ we need to check specific latitudes.  \n   - Kanas Lake is around **48\xB0\
      \ N** latitude.  \n   - The Cabox is around **49\xB0 N** latitude.  \n\n4. **Determine\
      \ if Kanas Lake is south of The Cabox**:  \n   - Since 48\xB0 N (Kanas Lake)\
      \ is slightly south of 49\xB0 N (The Cabox), Kanas Lake is indeed south of The\
      \ Cabox.  \n\n**Final Answer: YES.**"
