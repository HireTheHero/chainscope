      Africa and Australia. The Moonbi Range in Australia is situated in the southern
      hemisphere, but since it is in Australia, it is north of the Stormberg Mountains

      of Africa.

      - The Philippines (where the Visayan Sea is located) is in Southeast Asia.


      Since the Philippines is generally situated north of the equator, and Djibouti
      is also north of the equator but closer to it, we need to determine which is
      further south.


      - **Latitude of Djibouti**: Approximately 11 degrees north.

      - **Latitude of the Visayan Sea**: Approximately 11 to 12 degrees north.


      Given these approximate latitudes, the Visayan Sea is slightly north of the
      latitude of Djibouti.


      Therefore, with this information:


      NO, the Visayan Sea is not located south of Ghoubbet-el-Kharab.'

      is in Europe, specifically between Corsica and Sardinia in the Mediterranean
      region.

      - Geographically, the Korean Peninsula (where the Rangrim Mountains are located)
      is significantly farther north compared to the Mediterranean region.


      Based on these steps, we can conclude that the Rangrim Mountains are not located
      south of the Strait of Bonifacio. Therefore, the answer is:


      NO.'

      range located in the Basque Country, an autonomous community in northern Spain.
      They are part of the larger Cantabrian Mountains.


      3. **Relative Positions**: The Basque Mountains are located in northern Spain,
      while Gazivoda Lake is in the Balkans, specifically in Kosovo.


      Based on these locations, the Basque Mountains are not south of Gazivoda Lake.

      Now, considering the general global geography:

      - Fronalpstock is in Switzerland, which is in Europe.

      - Woman Lake is in Minnesota, which is in the United States, North America.


      Given the locations of these places:

      - Switzerland (Europe) is generally located at a higher latitude than the United

      Bali Sea because the Madura Strait lies between Java and Madura, which is further
      north compared to the position of the Bali Sea.


      Based on this analysis, the Bali Sea is indeed located south of the Madura Strait.

      1. **Location of the Madura Strait**: The Madura Strait is a body of water in
      Indonesia that separates the island of Madura from the northeastern coast of
      Java.


      2. **Location of the Bali Sea**: The Bali Sea is situated north of Bali and
      the eastern part of Java.


      3. **Relative Positioning**: The Madura Strait is located to the north of the
      eastern part of Java, which connects to the Java Sea. The Bali Sea is located
      further east and south compared to the Madura Strait, lying to the north of
      Bali.


      Now, putting these pieces together: The Bali Sea is situated to the east and
      slightly south of the Madura Strait, given that it is north of Bali and the
      eastern coast of Java.

      - **Ireland** is located in Europe, and Lough Ree is situated relatively centrally
      within Ireland.

      - **Alberta, Canada**, is in North America, and Wabamun Lake is located in the

      northern part of Middle Harbour, which is an estuary in the northern suburbs
      of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.


      2. **Identify the location of Middle Harbour:** Middle Harbour is an arm of
      Sydney Harbour, extending north from the main part of the harbour. It includes
      several bays and is located in the northern suburbs of Sydney.


      3. **Determine the relative positions:** Since Bantry Bay is part of Middle
