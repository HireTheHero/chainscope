    6efe3d2d-f5c2-452d-8c52-62878e113f45: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. "Don''t Go Breaking My Heart" is a duet by Elton John and Kiki Dee

      2. This song was released in 1976

      3. "One Way or Another" is a song by Blondie (not Uriah Heep), released in 1978

      4. So the question contains an error about the band for "One Way or Another"


      However, even with the band name error, I can still compare the years:

      - Kiki Dee''s song: 1976

      - Blondie''s song: 1978


      Therefore, Kiki Dee''s song was released earlier.

      months/dates

      - "Fox on the Run" was released in May 1975

      - "Hair of the Dog" was released in April 1975


      4. Comparing the dates:

      - "Hair of the Dog" came out in April 1975

      - "Fox on the Run" came out in May 1975

      - This means "Hair of the Dog" was released earlier


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'
