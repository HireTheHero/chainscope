      "Get Busy":**  "Get Busy" was released in 2002 (specifically, September in Jamaica
      and February 2003 in the US/UK).


      2. **Find release date of The Used''s "Buried Myself Alive":** "Buried Myself
      Alive" was released in 2002 (as part of the album "In Love and Death," released
      in September 2002).


      3. **Compare the release dates:** Both songs were released in 2002. "Get Busy"''s
      initial release in Jamaica was in September, while "Buried Myself Alive" was
      released as part of the album also in September.  "Get Busy"''s wider US/UK
      release was in February 2003.  This means depending on which release of "Get
      Busy" we consider, the answer could change.


      4. **Consider the question:** The question asks if "Get Busy" was released *earlier*
      than "Buried Myself Alive." The Jamaican release of "Get Busy" could have been
      earlier in September than the album release of "In Love and Death," but we don''t
      have that level of precision. The US/UK release was definitely *later*.


      5. **Choose the most likely intended comparison:** Since the question doesn''t
      specify a region, it''s likely referring to the wider release dates.  Therefore,
      "Get Busy''s" US/UK release was *after* "Buried Myself Alive."


      **Answer:** NO

      written by Paul McCartney, is generally considered his first song, written when
      he was 14 in 1956. It wasn''t commercially released until much later (on the
      "Anthology" albums in the 1990s).


      2. **Love and Understanding:** This song was released by Cher in 1991.


      3. **Comparison:** Although "I Lost My Little Girl" was *written* much earlier

      2. **Love and Understanding:** This song was released by Cher in 1991.

      whether "I Lost My Little Girl" was released *earlier in the year* than "Love
      and Understanding".  This would require further research.  However, "Love and
      Understanding" was released as a single in June 1991, while "Anthology" (containing
      "I Lost My Little Girl") was released in November 1991.

      stick with the explicit title given. Since no such song exists by Sam Smith,
      it has no release date.
