    9c5e996d-292e-4b03-be61-f0b6c54d7b2a: '1. *"Jimmy James"* by Beastie Boys was
      released as a single from their album *Check Your Head*. The album was released

      2. *"Pull Me Under"* by Dream Theater was released as a single from their album
      *Images and Words*. The album was released on **July 7, 1992**.

      3. Since *Check Your Head* (which contains *"Jimmy James"*) was released earlier
      than *Images and Words* (which contains *"Pull Me Under"*), we now check the
      single release dates.

      4. *"Jimmy James"* was released as a single on **August 1992**.

      5. *"Pull Me Under"* was released as a single on **August 1992** as well.


      Since both songs were released as singles in the same month but exact dates
      are unclear, we rely on the album release dates. *"Jimmy James"* appeared on
      an album that was released earlier.


      Thus, the answer is: **YES**.'
