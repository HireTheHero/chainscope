      Dream Theater was released as a single in 1992 and was included in their album

      Given that both songs were released in 1992, without the exact release date
      of the single "Pull Me Under", it''s challenging to definitively say which was
      released first based solely on the year. However, considering the album release
      date for "Jimmy James" (April 1992), if "Pull Me Under" was released after this
      date, then "Jimmy James" was released earlier.


      Since "Pull Me Under" was indeed released in 1992 and considering typical release
      practices, it''s plausible that "Jimmy James", being part of an album released
      in April 1992, could have been available to the public before a single released
      later in the year. However, without the exact release date of the single "Pull
      Me Under", this reasoning relies on the assumption of its release being later
      in 1992.


      Based on this step-by-step analysis and the information available, the answer
      leans towards "Jimmy James" potentially being released earlier due to its album
      release date, but it''s essential to acknowledge the lack of precise information

      exact dates are crucial for comparison. "A Night like This" by Caro Emerald
      was released on her album in 2009, which means it was likely available earlier
      in the year. "3 Words" by Cheryl was released on October 26, 2009.


      Given that both songs were released in 2009, without the exact release date
      of "A Night like This", it''s challenging to definitively say which was released
      first based solely on the year. However, considering the typical release patterns,
      if "A Night like This" was released on an album earlier in the year, it''s plausible
      that it was available to the public before "3 Words", which was released later
      in the year.


      So, based on the steps and the information available, the answer leans towards
      "A Night like This" potentially being released earlier due to its album release,
      but it''s essential to acknowledge the lack of precise information regarding
      the album''s release date.

      the release dates of both songs.


      1. **Identify the release date of Zedd''s "Shave It"**: Zedd released "Shave
      It" in 2011. It was part of his debut EP "Shave It - The Aftershave".


      2. **Identify the release date of Lana Del Rey''s "Video Games"**: Lana Del
      Rey released "Video Games" as a single in 2011. It was also included in her
      album "Born to Die", which was released in 2012.


      3. **Compare the release dates**: Both songs were released in 2011, but the
      exact dates are crucial for comparison. Zedd''s "Shave It" was released in 2011
      as part of his EP, while Lana Del Rey''s "Video Games" was released as a single
      in 2011.


      Given that both songs were released in 2011, without the exact day of release
      for "Video Games", it''s challenging to definitively say which was released
      first based solely on the year. However, considering typical release practices,
      it''s plausible that "Shave It", being part of an EP released in 2011, could
      have been available to the public before a single released later in the year.
      However, without the exact release date of the single "Video Games", this reasoning
      relies on the assumption of its release being later in 2011.


      Based on this step-by-step analysis and the information available, the answer
      leans towards "Shave It" potentially being released earlier due to its EP release
      in 2011, but it''s essential to acknowledge the lack of precise information
      regarding the single''s release date.

    4f40c65a-f242-47ca-ae9b-972ccba03819: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the release dates of both "Give It All" by Rise Against and "Only U" by Ashanti.


      1. **Identify the release date of "Give It All" by Rise Against**: "Give It
      All" is a song by Rise Against from their album "Siren Song of the Counter Culture",
      which was released on August 10, 2004.


      2. **Identify the release date of "Only U" by Ashanti**: Ashanti released several
      songs over the years, but without a specific album or release date for "Only
      U", it''s a bit challenging. However, Ashanti''s most popular period was in
      the early 2000s, so it''s reasonable to assume that "Only U" might have been
      released around that time.


      Given the general knowledge:

      - "Give It All" by Rise Against was released on August 10, 2004.

      - Ashanti''s most popular period was in the early 2000s.


      Without the exact release date of "Only U" by Ashanti, we can still make an
      educated guess based on the typical active period of Ashanti, which suggests
      that if "Only U" was one of her hits, it likely came out before 2004, making
      it earlier than "Give It All".


      So, considering the steps and the information typically available:

      - If "Only U" by Ashanti is considered one of her earlier works, it would have
      been released before "Give It All" by Rise Against.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Rise Against''s "Give It All" was released
      earlier than Ashanti''s "Only U" is: **NO**'

      the release dates of both songs.


      1. **Identify the release date of Rise Against''s "Give It All"**: The song
      "Give It All" by Rise Against was released in 2004 on their album "Siren Song
      of the Counter Culture".


      2. **Identify the release date of Ashanti''s "Only U"**: The song "Only U" by
      Ashanti was released in 2004 as well, on her album "Concrete Rose".


      3. **Compare the release dates**: Both songs were released in 2004. Without
      the exact release dates within the year, it''s challenging to determine which
      one came out first. However, considering that both songs were released on albums,
      it''s possible that "Give It All" by Rise Against was released earlier, as "Siren
      Song of the Counter Culture" was released on August 10, 2004, while "Concrete
      Rose" by Ashanti was released on December 14, 2004.


      Given the release dates of the albums:

      - "Siren Song of the Counter Culture" (containing "Give It All") was released
      on August 10, 2004.

      - "Concrete Rose" (containing "Only U") was released on December 14, 2004.


      Since "Siren Song of the Counter Culture" was released earlier in the year compared
      to "Concrete Rose", it''s likely that "Give It All" by Rise Against was released
      earlier than "Only U" by Ashanti.


      Based on the steps and the available information, the answer leans towards "Give
      It All" being released earlier due to the earlier album release date, but it''s
      important to acknowledge the lack of precise release dates for the songs within
      the year.

    ead1ea5a-f1f8-4823-8987-ea811d481789: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the release dates of both songs.


      1. **Identify the release date of Tracy Lawrence''s "Time Marches On"**: The
      song "Time Marches On" by Tracy Lawrence was released in 1996.


      2. **Identify the release date of Jay-Z''s "Ain''t No Nigga"**: The song "Ain''t
      No Nigga" by Jay-Z was released in 1996 as well.


      3. **Compare the release dates**: Both songs were released in the same year,
      1996. However, the exact dates are crucial for comparison. "Time Marches On"
      by Tracy Lawrence was released as a single in 1996, and "Ain''t No Nigga" by
      Jay-Z was released as a single in 1996 as well.


      Given that both songs were released in the same year, without the exact day
      of release for each song, it''s challenging to definitively say which was released
      first based solely on the year. However, considering the typical release practices
      for singles, it''s plausible that they were released within a similar timeframe
      in 1996.


      Since both songs were released as singles in the same year, 1996, without the
      exact release dates, we cannot definitively say which one was released earlier.
      It''s important to note that even though they were released in the same year,
      they might have been released on different days within the year, making one
      earlier than the other.

      is a song by Lana Del Rey from her album "Born to Die". The album was released
      on January 27, 2012, which is also the release date for "Dark Paradise".


      2. **Identify the release date of Arlissa''s "Sticks & Stones"**: Arlissa is
      a British singer-songwriter. "Sticks & Stones" is a song from her debut album
      "Battles". However, without specific information about the release date of the
      album or the song, it''s challenging to pinpoint an exact date. It''s possible
      that "Sticks & Stones" was released before 2012, given the general knowledge
      that artists often release music before their debut album.


      3. **Compare the release dates**: Since "Dark Paradise" was released on January
      27, 2012, and we don''t have a specific release date for "Sticks & Stones",
      it''s difficult to definitively say which song was released earlier. However,
      based on the assumption that "Sticks & Stones" was released before 2012, it''s
      plausible that it was released earlier than "Dark Paradise".

      date for "Sticks & Stones".

      and "Don''t Go Breaking My Heart" was released as a single on June 21, 1976,
      "One Way or Another" was indeed released earlier.

      1. **Identify the release date of Kiki Dee''s "Don''t Go Breaking My Heart"**:
      The song "Don''t Go Breaking My Heart" by Kiki Dee was released in 1976 as a
      single.


      2. **Identify the release date of Uriah Heep''s "One Way or Another"**: The
      song "One Way or Another" by Uriah Heep was released in 1971 on their album
      "Look at Yourself".


      3. **Compare the release dates**: Based on the information provided, "Don''t
      Go Breaking My Heart" by Kiki Dee was released in 1976, while "One Way or Another"

    ddf02572-aa58-4938-9514-199c7e7c7a8b: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the release dates of both songs.


      1. **Identify the release date of Kiki Dee''s "Don''t Go Breaking My Heart"**:
      The song "Don''t Go Breaking My Heart" by Kiki Dee was released in 1976 as a
      single.


      2. **Identify the release date of Uriah Heep''s "One Way or Another"**: The
      song "One Way or Another" by Uriah Heep was released in 1976 as part of their
      album "High and Mighty".


      3. **Compare the release dates**: Both songs were released in 1976, but the
      exact dates are crucial for comparison. "Don''t Go Breaking My Heart" by Kiki
      Dee was released as a single in 1976, while "One Way or Another" by Uriah Heep
      was part of their album "High and Mighty" released in 1976.


      Given that both songs were released in 1976, without the exact day of release
      for each song, it''s challenging to definitively say which was released first
      based solely on the year. However, considering the album release date for "One
      Way or Another" (1976), if "Don''t Go Breaking My Heart" was released as a single
      before this date, then Kiki Dee''s song was released earlier.


      Since "Don''t Go Breaking My Heart" was indeed released as a single in 1976
      and considering typical release practices, it''s plausible that Kiki Dee''s
      single could have been available to the public before an album released later
      in the year. However, without the exact release date of both songs, this reasoning
      relies on the assumption of the single''s release being earlier in 1976.


      Based on this step-by-step analysis and the information available, the answer
      leans towards "Don''t Go Breaking My Heart" potentially being released earlier
      due to its single release, but it''s essential to acknowledge the lack of precise
      information regarding the exact release dates.

      3. **Compare the release dates**: Both songs were released in 1980, but the

      Given that both songs were released in 1980, without the exact day of release

      Since "Happy Birthday" was indeed released in 1980, it''s plausible that "Ride

      have been available to the public before a song released in 1980. However, without

      3. **Compare the release dates**: Both songs were released in 1973. However,
      the exact dates are crucial for comparison. "Teacher I Need You" by Elton John
      was released as part of an album, and albums typically have a single release

      3. **Compare the release dates**: Both songs were released in 1984. However,
      the exact dates within the year are crucial for comparison.


      Given that both songs were released in 1984, without specific dates within the
      year, it''s challenging to determine which song was released first based solely
      on the year. However, we can consider the general release patterns of albums
      and singles during that time.


      - "Smooth Operator" was released as part of Sade''s debut album, which was released
      on July 16, 1984.

      - "Sex Shooter" was released as part of the album "Apollonia 6", which was released
      on October 2, 1984.


      Since "Smooth Operator" was released on July 16, 1984, and "Sex Shooter" was
      released on October 2, 1984, we can conclude that "Smooth Operator" was released
      earlier.

      Twisters Only".


      3. **Compare the release dates**: Both songs were released in 1961. However,
      without specific release dates, it''s challenging to determine which song was
      released first. Typically, songs from the same year would have been released
      at different times.


      Given the general knowledge about the songs'' release dates:

      - Marvin Gaye''s "Let Your Conscience Be Your Guide" was released as a single
      in 1961.

      - Chubby Checker''s "Let''s Twist Again" was released as part of his album "For
      Twisters Only" in 1961.


      Since both songs were released in the same year (1961) and without specific
      release dates, it''s plausible that they were released at different times during
      the year. However, without precise information, it''s challenging to definitively
      say which song was released first.


      Therefore, based on the available information, it''s not possible to conclude
      with certainty whether Marvin Gaye''s "Let Your Conscience Be Your Guide" was
      released earlier than Chubby Checker''s "Let''s Twist Again".

      in 1977 as well.


      3. **Compare the release dates**: Both songs were released in 1977, but the

      of their debut album released on March 8, 1977. "(The Angels Wanna Wear My)

      Given that both songs were released in 1977, without the exact day of release

      Since "(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes" was released as a single in 1977

      "On My Level" was released in 2011 as a single.


      2. **Identify the release date of Kylie Minogue''s "Put Your Hands Up (If You
      Feel Love)"**: Kylie Minogue''s "Put Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love)" was released
      in 2011 as part of her album "Aphrodite".


      3. **Compare the release dates**: Both songs were released in 2011. However,
      the exact dates are crucial for comparison.


      Given that both songs were released in 2011, without the exact day of release
      for "Put Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love)", it''s challenging to definitively
      say which was released first based solely on the month. However, considering
      typical release practices, it''s plausible that "On My Level" could have been
      available to the public before an album track released later in the month.


      Since "On My Level" was indeed released as a single in 2011 and considering
      typical release practices, it''s plausible that "On My Level", being a single,
      could have been available to the public before an album track released later
      in the month. However, without the exact release date of the album track "Put
      Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love)", this reasoning relies on the assumption of
      its release being later in 2011.


      Based on this step-by-step analysis and the information available, the answer
      leans towards "On My Level" potentially being released earlier due to its release
      as a single, but it''s essential to acknowledge the lack of precise information
      regarding the album track''s release date.

      1. **Identify the release date of "Civil War" by Guns N'' Roses**: "Civil War"
      was released in 1993 on the Guns N'' Roses album "Use Your Illusion II", although
      it was initially released as a B-side in 1990 for the song "Patience" in some
      countries. However, its more recognized and official release was in 1993, but
      considering its initial release, it''s safe to say it was available in some
      form before 1993.


      2. **Identify the release date of "Goodbye" by Air Supply**: Air Supply released
      several songs with the band''s history spanning many years, but without a specific
      album or release date for "Goodbye", it''s a bit challenging. However, Air Supply
      is known for hits in the 80s, and if "Goodbye" is one of their earlier hits,
      it could potentially be from the 80s.


      Given the general knowledge:

      - "Civil War" by Guns N'' Roses was initially available in some form by 1990
      but officially recognized in 1993.

      - Air Supply''s most popular period was in the 80s.


      Without the exact release date of "Goodbye" by Air Supply, we can still make
      an educated guess based on the typical active period of Air Supply, which suggests
      that if "Goodbye" was one of their hits, it likely came out before 1990, making
      it earlier than "Civil War".


      So, considering the steps and the information typically available:

      - If "Goodbye" by Air Supply is considered one of their earlier works, it would
      have been released before "Civil War" by Guns N'' Roses.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Guns N'' Roses''s "Civil War" was released
      earlier than Air Supply''s "Goodbye" is: **NO**'

      Given that both songs were released in August 2000, without the exact day of

      The song "I Don''t Want to Do It" by George Harrison was released in 1985 as
      well.


      3. **Compare the release dates**: Both songs were released in 1985. However,
      the exact dates within the year are crucial for comparison.


      Given the information available:

      - "40 Hour Week (For a Livin'')" by Alabama was released in 1985 as part of
      their album "40-Hour Week".

      - "I Don''t Want to Do It" by George Harrison was released in 1985 as well.


      Without the exact dates within the year, it''s difficult to definitively say
      which song was released earlier. However, considering the typical release patterns
      and the fact that both songs were released in the same year, it''s plausible
      that they were released around the same time or within a similar timeframe in
      1985.

      the release dates of both songs:


      1. **Identify the release date of Alabama''s "40 Hour Week (For a Livin'')"**:
      This song was released by Alabama in 1985 as a single from their album "40-Hour
      Week".


      2. **Identify the release date of George Harrison''s "I Don''t Want to Do It"**:
      George Harrison released "I Don''t Want to Do It" in 1985 as well, although
      it''s unclear whether it was released as a single or part of an album.


      3. **Compare the release dates**: Both songs were released in 1985, but without
      specific dates for "I Don''t Want to Do It", it''s challenging to determine
      which one came first. However, considering typical release practices, if "I
      Don''t Want to Do It" was released later in 1985 than "40 Hour Week (For a Livin'')",
      then Alabama''s song was released earlier.


      Given the information available, it''s plausible that Alabama''s "40 Hour Week
      (For a Livin'')" was released earlier than George Harrison''s "I Don''t Want
      to Do It" based on the album release date for "40 Hour Week (For a Livin'')".
      However, without the exact release date of "I Don''t Want to Do It", this reasoning
      relies on the assumption of its release being later in 1985.


      Based on this step-by-step analysis and the information available, the answer
      leans towards Alabama''s "40 Hour Week (For a Livin'')" potentially being released
      earlier due to its album release date, but it''s essential to acknowledge the
      lack of precise information regarding the release date of "I Don''t Want to
      Do It".

      1. **Identify the release date of "The Boss" by Diana Ross**: "The Boss" by
      Diana Ross was released in 1979 as a single and was included in her album "The
      Boss" released the same year.


      2. **Identify the release date of "Girls Talk" by Dave Edmunds**: "Girls Talk"
      by Dave Edmunds was released in 1979 as well, on his album "Repeat When Necessary".


      3. **Compare the release dates**: Both songs were released in 1979. Without
      specific dates for the single release of "The Boss" and the album release of
      "Girls Talk", it''s challenging to determine which was released first based
      solely on the year. However, considering the typical album release practices,
      it''s likely that "Girls Talk" was available to the public before "The Boss"
      if the single was released later in the year.


      Given that both songs were released in 1979, without the exact release dates,
      it''s difficult to definitively say which was released first. However, considering
      typical release practices, it''s plausible that "Girls Talk" could have been
      available to the public before "The Boss".


      Based on this step-by-step analysis and the information available, the answer
      leans towards "Girls Talk" potentially being released earlier, but it''s essential
      to acknowledge the lack of precise information regarding the single''s release
      date.

      the release dates of both "The Lightning Strike" by Snow Patrol and "Get Shaky"
      by Ian Carey.


      1. **Identify the release date of "The Lightning Strike" by Snow Patrol**: The
      song "The Lightning Strike" was released as a part of Snow Patrol''s album "A
      Hundred Million Suns" in 2008.


      2. **Identify the release date of "Get Shaky" by Ian Carey**: The song "Get
      Shaky" was released as a single by Ian Carey in 2009.


      3. **Compare the release dates**: Since "The Lightning Strike" was released
      in 2008 and "Get Shaky" was released in 2009, it''s clear that "The Lightning
      Strike" was released earlier.

      the release dates of both songs.


      1. **Identify the release date of Snow Patrol''s "The Lightning Strike"**: "The
      Lightning Strike" by Snow Patrol was released on their album "A Hundred Million
      Suns" in October 2008.


      2. **Identify the release date of Ian Carey''s "Get Shaky"**: "Get Shaky" by
      Ian Carey was released as a single in 2008 as well.


      3. **Compare the release dates**: Both songs were released in 2008, but the
      exact dates are crucial for comparison. "The Lightning Strike" by Snow Patrol
      was part of an album released in October 2008. "Get Shaky" by Ian Carey was
      released as a single in 2008.


      Given that both songs were released in 2008, without the exact month and day
      of release for "Get Shaky", it''s challenging to definitively say which was
      released first based solely on the year. However, considering the album release
      date for "The Lightning Strike" in October 2008, if "Get Shaky" was released
      earlier in the year, then "Get Shaky" was released earlier.


      Since "Get Shaky" was indeed released as a single in 2008 and considering typical
      release practices, it''s plausible that "Get Shaky" could have been available
      to the public earlier in the year compared to an album released in October.
      However, without the exact release date of the single "Get Shaky", this reasoning
      relies on the assumption of its release being earlier in the year.


      Based on this step-by-step analysis and the information available, the answer
      leans towards "Get Shaky" potentially being released earlier due to its single
      release in 2008, but it''s essential to acknowledge the lack of precise information
      regarding the single''s release date.
