      - "Blank Space" was released in November 2014

      - It was the second single from her album "1989"


      2. Now, let me recall when "Honey, I''m Good" by Andy Grammer was released

      - "Honey, I''m Good" was released in November 2014 initially

      - It gained mainstream popularity in early 2015


      3. Let me compare the dates:

      - Both songs were actually released in November 2014
