      "Blue Monday" was released as a single by New Order in March 1983.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      U2''s "War" album (containing "Seconds") was released in February 1983.

      New Order''s "Blue Monday" was released in March 1983.

      February comes before March in the same year (1983).


      Step 4: Determine which was released earlier.

      Since February 1983 is earlier than March 1983, "Seconds" by U2 was released
      earlier than "Blue Monday" by New Order.


      NO


      Wait, I made a mistake in my final answer. Since "Seconds" by U2 was released
      earlier than "Blue Monday" by New Order, the correct answer is:


      YES'

      earlier: U2''s "Seconds" or New Order''s "Blue Monday".


      Step 1: Find the release date of U2''s "Seconds".

      "Seconds" appears on U2''s album "War" which was released in February 1983.
      The song itself wasn''t released as a single, so its release date would be the
      same as the album.


      Step 2: Find the release date of New Order''s "Blue Monday".

      "Blue Monday" was released as a single on March 7, 1983.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      U2''s "Seconds" (February 1983) was released before New Order''s "Blue Monday"
      (March 7, 1983).


      NO.


      Wait, I need to be careful here. If "Seconds" was released in February 1983
      and "Blue Monday" was released in March 1983, then "Seconds" came EARLIER, not
      later.


      So the correct answer is:


      YES.'

      Step 1: Let me identify when U2''s "Seconds" was released.

      "Seconds" appears on U2''s album "War" which was released in February 1983.
      The song itself wasn''t released as a single, so the album release date is what
      matters here.


      Step 2: Let me identify when New Order''s "Blue Monday" was released.

      "Blue Monday" was released as a single on March 7, 1983.


      Step 3: Compare the two dates.

      February 1983 (U2''s "Seconds" as part of "War") comes before March 7, 1983
      (New Order''s "Blue Monday").


      NO. U2''s "Seconds" was not released earlier than New Order''s "Blue Monday."
      They were released very close to each other in early 1983, but "Blue Monday"
      came out in March while "Seconds" was on an album released in February.


      Wait, I made an error in my conclusion. Let me correct that:


      YES. U2''s "Seconds" was released earlier than New Order''s "Blue Monday." The

      released in February 1983.


      Step 2: Identify when New Order''s "Blue Monday" was released.

      "Blue Monday" by New Order was released as a single on March 7, 1983.

      U2''s "War" album containing "Seconds" was released in February 1983.

      in February 1983.

      "Blue Monday" was released as a single by New Order on March 7, 1983.

      known as a Doobie Brothers song (with Michael McDonald on lead vocals), not
      a Kenny Loggins song, though Kenny Loggins did co-write it with Michael McDonald.
      The Doobie Brothers version was released in 1979.


      Kenny Loggins did record his own version of the song, but it was released after
      the Doobie Brothers version.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      Donna Summer''s "Last Dance" (1978) was released before the Doobie Brothers''
      "What a Fool Believes" (1979).

      which was released in 1999.


      Step 2: Identify when Project Pat''s "Sippin'' on Some Syrup" was released.

      "Sippin'' on Some Syrup" by Project Pat (featuring Three 6 Mafia and UGK) was
      released in 2000 on Project Pat''s album "Mista Don''t Play: Everythangs Workin."


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      Tina Turner''s song was released in 1999, while Project Pat''s song was released
      in 2000.


      Step 4: Determine which came first.

      Since 1999 comes before 2000, Tina Turner''s "Whatever You Need" was released
      earlier than Project Pat''s "Sippin'' on Some Syrup."


      NO

      was released earlier, and I''ve determined that it was. So the correct answer
      is:

      - "All Good" featuring Chaka Khan was released in 2001 as a single from their
      album "AOI: Bionix."


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      - LeAnn Rimes''s "Can''t Fight the Moonlight": 2000

      - De La Soul''s "All Good": 2001


      Step 4: Determine which was released earlier.

      - 2000 comes before 2001, so "Can''t Fight the Moonlight" was released earlier
      than "All Good."


      NO


      Wait, I made a mistake in my final answer. The question asks if "Can''t Fight
      the Moonlight" was released earlier than "All Good," and since 2000 is earlier
      than 2001, the correct answer is:
