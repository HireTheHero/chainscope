      1. **Nirvana''s "Old Age"**: This song was initially recorded during the sessions

      until it appeared on the compilation album "With the Lights Out" in 2004. However,
      a version by the band Hole, which included Nirvana''s Kurt Cobain''s wife Courtney
      Love, was released on their album "My Body, the Hand Grenade" in 1997.

      - Nirvana''s "Old Age" was released by Hole in 1997.

      a definitive publicly known exact day for each single''s release to determine
      which came first. However, based on the general information available, they
