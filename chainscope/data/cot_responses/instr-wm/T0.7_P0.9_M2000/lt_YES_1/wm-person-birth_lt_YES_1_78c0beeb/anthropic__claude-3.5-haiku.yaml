      2. Protagoras was also a pre-Socratic philosopher, famous as a sophist and for
      his statement "man is the measure of all things".

      4. Protagoras lived approximately from 490 BCE to 420 BCE.

      6. Zeno was actually slightly older than Protagoras, as he was born around the

      was born slightly later, around 485-480 BCE.
