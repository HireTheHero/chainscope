      After research:


      Zhu Ling''s birth date is unknown, but he died in 248 AD. Sima Lang was born
      in 217 AD and died in 282 AD.


      Since Sima Lang''s birth date is 217 AD and Zhu Ling died in 248 AD, Zhu Ling
      *must* have been born earlier than 248 AD.  Therefore, Zhu Ling was born before
      Sima Lang.

      \ as there could be multiple individuals with this name throughout history.\
      \  Without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific birthdate. However,\
      \ a prominent Ren Xiang was a calligrapher during the Ming Dynasty.\n\n2. **Identify\
      \ Antonina:**  Similarly, \"Antonina\" is a common name, and we need more information.\
      \  The most famous Antonina is likely Antonina Makarova, a Soviet executioner\
      \ during World War II.\n\n3. **Compare potential birthdates:** Assuming we are\
      \ talking about the calligrapher Ren Xiang and Antonina Makarova, Ren Xiang\
      \ lived during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), while Antonina Makarova was born\
      \ in 1921.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the Ming Dynasty ended long before 1921,\
      \ Ren Xiang was born earlier than Antonina Makarova.\n\nYES\n"

      dates are not definitively known, but she is generally placed within the late
      Eastern Han/early Three Kingdoms period (roughly late 2nd to early 3rd century
      CE). Cao Zhi lived from 192 to 232 CE.


      * **Step 3: Compare the timeframes.** Since Xin Xianying''s dates are uncertain
      but placed generally within the late Eastern Han/early Three Kingdoms period,
      and Cao Zhi was born in 192 CE, within that same period, it''s possible she
      was born before him, but not definitively known.

      between them that might hint at relative ages, nor definitive dates for Xin
      Xianying.

      Xin Xianying was a female advisor during the Three Kingdoms period of China,

      and poet of the same era, son of Cao Cao.


      * **Step 2: Determine approximate lifespans.**  Xin Xianying''s birth and death
      dates are not definitively known. She is believed to have lived around the late
      Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period (roughly 169-263 AD). Cao
      Zhi''s lifespan is known: 192-232 AD.


      * **Step 3: Compare the information.** Since Xin Xianying''s birth date is uncertain
      but she was active during a period that overlaps with Cao Zhi''s entire lifespan,
      it''s possible she was born earlier, at the same time, or even later. However,
      the general consensus places her activity around the same time as Cao Zhi''s,
      meaning she was likely born around the same time or slightly earlier to be active
      in the same period.  The earliest she could have been born is 169 AD, which
      *is* earlier than Cao Zhi''s birth year of 192 AD.

      * **Step 2: Find Cao Zhi''s birth date.** Cao Zhi''s birth date is known: 192
      AD.


      * **Step 3: Compare the information.**  Since Xin Xianying lived during the
      late Eastern Han Dynasty and Three Kingdoms period (which began in 220 AD),
      it''s highly likely she was alive during Cao Zhi''s lifetime (192-232 AD).  It''s

      born slightly before him. The most likely scenario is that she was born during

      Sun Guoting was a Chinese calligrapher who lived during the Tang dynasty.  He
      is known for his treatise *Preface to the Running Script*, which is believed
      to have been written around 687 CE.  So, he must have been born sometime before
      then.


      2. **Find approximate dates for Abbas ibn Ali:** Abbas ibn Ali, also known as
      Abbas the Elder, was the son of Ali ibn Abi Talib, the fourth Caliph of Islam.  Ali
      lived from approximately 601 to 661 CE.  Abbas was killed in the Battle of Karbala
      in 680 CE.  Therefore, he must have been born between approximately 645 and
      660 CE (allowing for Ali to be a teenager/young adult when Abbas was born).


      3. **Compare the dates:** Sun Guoting was born sometime before 687 CE. Abbas
      ibn Ali was born sometime between 645 and 660 CE.


      4. **Conclusion:** Since Sun Guoting''s birth date is less certain but had to
      be before 687 CE, and Abbas'' birth was likely between 645 and 660 CE, it is
      possible Sun Guoting could have been born before Abbas. However, it''s also
      possible Sun Guoting was born after Abbas. We cannot definitively say who was

      4. **Further research (if available):**  A quick search indicates Sun Guoting

      5. **Final comparison:** Given Sun Guoting lived approximately between 648 and
