      1. **Identify the Historical Figures**: Wang Chong was a Chinese philosopher
      and author from the Han Dynasty. Berenice is likely referring to Berenice IV
      of Egypt, a queen from the Ptolemaic dynasty.


      2. **Determine Their Time Periods**: Wang Chong lived during the Eastern Han
      Dynasty, which lasted from 25 to 220 AD. Berenice IV of Egypt ruled from 58
      to 55 BC.


      3. **Compare Their Birth Dates**: Without specific birth dates for both figures,
      we can''t make a direct comparison. However, based on their time periods, we
      can infer that Wang Chong lived significantly later than Berenice.


      4. **Historical Context**: Given the vast time difference between their time
      periods, it''s highly unlikely that Wang Chong was born earlier than Berenice.


      Based on the information available and the steps followed, it''s safe to conclude
      that Wang Chong was not born earlier than Berenice.

      2. **Establish Time Periods**: Wang Chong lived during the Eastern Han dynasty
      in China, while Berenice lived during the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt. This provides
      us with the approximate time periods for both figures.

      born earlier than Duke Cheng of Qi. However, without more specific information,
      it''s difficult to provide a definitive answer.


      Given the lack of specific birth dates and the historical context, I will provide
      a YES answer based on the assumption that more detailed historical research
      might reveal the necessary details, but as of my knowledge cutoff, I don''t
      have enough information to accurately answer this question.

      the steps required:


      1. **Identify Zhao Tingmei and Emma of Blois**: Zhao Tingmei was a Chinese poet
      and calligrapher, and Emma of Blois was a medieval French noblewoman.


      2. **Determine birth dates**: The birth dates of Zhao Tingmei and Emma of Blois
      are not widely documented, making it challenging to compare their ages accurately.


      3. **Historical context**: Zhao Tingmei lived during the Song dynasty in China,
      and Emma of Blois lived during the medieval period in France. The time periods
      are separated by centuries, making a direct comparison of birth dates difficult.


      4. **Assumptions**: Without specific birth dates, we can make assumptions based
      on the historical context. Zhao Tingmei, being a Chinese poet and calligrapher,
      likely lived during the Song dynasty (960-1279 AD). Emma of Blois, a medieval
      French noblewoman, likely lived during the medieval period in France (around
      the 11th to 13th centuries).


      5. **Comparison**: Based on the assumptions, Zhao Tingmei would have lived earlier
      than Emma of Blois. The Song dynasty in China predates the medieval period in
      France by several centuries.


      Given the lack of specific birth dates and the separation of time periods, it''s
      not possible to definitively answer the question. However, based on the historical

      1. **Zhao Tingmei**: Zhao Tingmei was a Chinese mathematician who lived during
      the Song Dynasty. However, specific information about her birth date is not
      readily available. She is known for her contributions to mathematics, particularly
      in the field of algebra.


      2. **Emma of Blois**: Emma of Blois was a French noblewoman who lived during
      the 11th century. She was the daughter of Theobald III, Count of Blois. Unfortunately,
      her exact birth date is also not widely documented.


      3. **Comparison**: Without specific birth dates for both individuals, it''s
      challenging to compare their birth dates directly. However, given the historical
      context, it''s reasonable to assume that Zhao Tingmei lived during the Song
      Dynasty, which spanned from 960 to 1279 AD. Emma of Blois, on the other hand,
      lived during the 11th century, which falls within the range of the Song Dynasty.


      4. **Historical Context**: Considering the broader historical context, the Song
      Dynasty in China and the 11th century in France were both periods of significant
      cultural, scientific, and political developments. While there''s a lack of specific
      birth dates, it''s plausible that Zhao Tingmei and Emma of Blois could have
      lived during overlapping time periods, given the historical contexts of their

      Qian and Judah Maccabee are. Zhang Qian was a Chinese diplomat and explorer
      who lived around the 2nd century BCE. Judah Maccabee was a Jewish leader who
      lived around the 2nd century BCE as well.


      2. **Determine their time periods**: Both Zhang Qian and Judah Maccabee lived
      around the 2nd century BCE, which is approximately the same time period.


      3. **Compare their birth dates**: Without specific birth dates for both figures,
      it''s challenging to make a direct comparison. However, knowing that they lived
      in the same general time period, it''s possible to make an estimate.


      4. **Consider historical context**: Both figures are from different regions
      and cultures, but they were active during the same historical era. This suggests
      that they were likely born around the same time, but without more specific information,
      it''s difficult to provide a definitive answer.


      Given the lack of specific information about their exact birth dates and the
      historical context, it''s not possible to definitively answer the question based
      on the information provided. However, since the question requires a YES or NO
      answer, I will provide one based on the assumption that more specific historical
      research might reveal the necessary details, but as of my knowledge cutoff,
      I don''t have enough information to accurately answer this question.

      Emperor Xizong of Tang''s birth date is well-documented as 862.


      Given the lack of specific information about Abu Bakr Shiblie''s birth date
      and the known birth date of Emperor Xizong of Tang (862), it''s not possible
      to definitively answer whether Abu Bakr Shiblie was born earlier. However, since
      the question requires a YES or NO answer, and considering that Emperor Xizong
      of Tang''s birth date is known and Abu Bakr Shiblie''s is not, I will provide
      an answer based on the available information.


      The answer is: NO

      Tiberias lived during the 4th century. The 4th century spans from 301 to 400
      AD, which means that Joseph of Tiberias was born much later than Zhuge Hui.


      Based on the available information, we can conclude that Zhuge Hui was indeed
      born earlier than Joseph of Tiberias.


      The answer is: YES
