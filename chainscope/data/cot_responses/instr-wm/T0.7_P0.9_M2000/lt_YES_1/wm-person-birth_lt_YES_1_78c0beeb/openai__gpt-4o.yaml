      1. **King Hiram I**: He was the king of Tyre, a Phoenician city, and is traditionally
      believed to have reigned from around 980 BCE to 947 BCE. His exact birth date
      is not well-documented, but it would be reasonable to assume he was born at
      least a few decades before his reign began, possibly around 1000 BCE or earlier.


      2. **Duke Cheng of Qi**: He was a ruler of the State of Qi during the Western
      Zhou dynasty in ancient China. He is believed to have ruled from approximately
      805 BCE to 795 BCE. If we assume he was born several decades before his reign,
      his birth date might be around 830 BCE or earlier.


      Comparing the estimated birth dates:

      - King Hiram I: Around 1000 BCE or earlier

      - Duke Cheng of Qi: Around 830 BCE or earlier

    ab2222c7-fe2f-4f0c-b5f8-1a752ab31ef9: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the birth years of Thomas Wykes and Eleanor of Provence.


      1. **Thomas Wykes**: He was an English chronicler, and although the exact year
      of his birth is not well-documented, he was active in the late 13th century.
      It is generally estimated that he was born around the 1220s or 1230s.


      2. **Eleanor of Provence**: She was born in 1223. She became the Queen consort
      of England by marrying King Henry III.


      Comparing the two:


      - Eleanor of Provence was born in 1223.

      - Thomas Wykes was likely born in the 1220s or 1230s, but even assuming the
      earliest possible date, it would be around the same time as Eleanor.


      Given the information and estimates, it''s not definitively clear that Thomas
      Wykes was born earlier than Eleanor of Provence, and the evidence suggests it''s
      unlikely.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**.'

      Since 578 BCE is earlier than 560 BCE, Yan Ying was born earlier than Anaxandridas
      II.


      **Answer: YES**'
    65a01498-ea98-45d4-a5f4-4f42621a4e06: 'To determine if Yan Ying was born earlier
      than Anaxandridas II, we need to look at the time periods during which each
      figure lived.


      1. **Yan Ying**: Yan Ying, also known as Yan Zi, was a prominent statesman and
      diplomat in ancient China. He served as a minister of the state of Qi during
      the Spring and Autumn period, which is generally dated from 771 to 476 BCE.
      Yan Ying is believed to have been active in the 6th century BCE, with estimates
      of his birth around 578 BCE.


      2. **Anaxandridas II**: Anaxandridas II was a king of Sparta and belonged to
      the Agiad dynasty. He reigned during the 6th century BCE. Historical sources
      suggest he was king around 560 BCE, and his birth is often estimated to be around
      the early part of the 6th century BCE, possibly around 600 BCE.


      Based on these estimates:


      - Yan Ying: circa 578 BCE.

      - Anaxandridas II: circa 600 BCE.


      With Anaxandridas II believed to have been born around 600 BCE and Yan Ying
      around 578 BCE, Anaxandridas II was born earlier than Yan Ying.


      Thus, the answer is: **NO**, Yan Ying was not born earlier than Anaxandridas
      II.'

      1. **Yan Ying**: Yan Ying, also known as Yan Zi, was a prominent statesman of
      the State of Qi during the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history. He is
      traditionally said to have lived around the 6th century BCE. Historical records
      suggest he was active during the reign of Duke Jing of Qi, which places his
      period of activity around the mid to late 6th century BCE.


      2. **Anaxandridas II**: Anaxandridas II was a king of Sparta, and he ruled during
      the 6th century BCE. Historical estimates suggest he reigned from approximately
      560 to 520 BCE, which implies he was likely born sometime in the early 6th century
      BCE.


      Based on these estimates, Yan Ying was likely born in the early part of the
      6th century BCE, possibly around the same time or slightly earlier than Anaxandridas
      II.

      1. **Yan Ying**: Yan Ying, also known as Yanzi, was a Chinese statesman and
      philosopher during the Spring and Autumn period. He served as the chancellor
      of the State of Qi. He is generally believed to have been active around the
      6th century BCE, but exact birth and death dates are not well-documented. However,
      he is often associated with events around the middle of the 6th century BCE.


      2. **Anaxandridas II**: Anaxandridas II was a king of Sparta and is known for
      being the father of King Leonidas I. He reigned from approximately 560 BCE to
      520 BCE, which suggests he was born around the early 6th century BCE, possibly
      around 590 BCE.

      - Yan Ying was active during the mid-6th century BCE, but his exact birth date

      Given that Anaxandridas II was likely born in the early 6th century BCE, and
      Yan Ying was active during the mid-6th century BCE, it is reasonable to conclude
      that Anaxandridas II was born earlier.

      born in the late 6th century, though his exact birth year is not well-documented.

      1. **Wu Shihuo**: He was the father of Wu Zetian, the only female emperor in
      Chinese history. Wu Zetian was born in 624 AD, and Wu Shihuo was likely born
      in the late 6th century or early 7th century. Historical records do not provide
      an exact birth date for Wu Shihuo, but it is reasonable to estimate his birth
      around the late 500s or early 600s AD.


      2. **Chu Liang**: This name is less commonly known, and there might be some
      confusion. Assuming you mean "Cheng Liang" or a historical figure from a similar
      period, more context would be needed. If it''s a lesser-known historical figure,
      specific birth dates might not be readily available.


      Without specific information on Chu Liang, it''s challenging to make a direct

      dynasty than the Tang dynasty (when Wu Zetian ruled), then Wu Shihuo was likely

      the historical periods in which Xiao Fang and Al-Darimi lived.


      1. **Xiao Fang**: There is limited information about a historical figure named
      Xiao Fang. It''s possible that this refers to a figure from Chinese history,
      but without specific details, it is challenging to pinpoint an exact time period.


      2. **Al-Darimi**: Abu Muhammad Abd Allah ibn Abd ar-Rahman al-Darimi was an
      Islamic scholar who lived during the 9th century, specifically from around 797
      to 869 AD.


      If Xiao Fang refers to a figure from ancient Chinese history, such as the Tang
      or earlier dynasties, then it is plausible that he predates Al-Darimi. However,
      without precise information about Xiao Fang''s identity and time period, we
      cannot definitively conclude this.

      historical figures with that name. However, if you are referring to a notable
      figure from Chinese history, more context is needed to identify the exact individual.

      than 647 CE. Thus, Sun Guoting would have been born earlier than Abbas ibn Ali.

      earlier than Abbas ibn Ali, we need to find out the birth years of both historical

      1. **Sun Guoting**: Sun Guoting was a Chinese calligrapher and scholar during
      the Tang Dynasty. He is best known for his work "Shu Pu" (A Treatise on Calligraphy).
      He was born in the year 646 AD.


      2. **Abbas ibn Ali**: Abbas ibn Ali was a prominent figure in Islamic history,
      known for his role in the Battle of Karbala. He was born in the year 647 AD.


      Now, comparing their birth years:


      - Sun Guoting was born in 646 AD.

      - Abbas ibn Ali was born in 647 AD.


      Since 646 AD is earlier than 647 AD, Sun Guoting was born earlier than Abbas
      ibn Ali.

      in the 1st century BC. He was a contemporary and friend of Pompey the Great,
      who lived from 106 BC to 48 BC. While the exact birth date of Theophanes is
      not well-documented, it is reasonable to estimate that he was born around the
      early 1st century BC, possibly around 100 BC.


      2. **Cleopatra VI of Egypt**: Cleopatra VI is a somewhat obscure figure, and
      there is some confusion regarding her identity and exact timeline. However,
      she is generally believed to have lived in the 1st century BC. Some sources
      suggest she may have been a sister of the more famous Cleopatra VII, who was
      born in 69 BC. If Cleopatra VI was indeed a sister and part of the same generation,
      her birth would likely be around the same time or slightly earlier.


      Given the lack of precise birth dates and the overlap in their timelines, there
      is no definitive evidence to conclude that Theophanes was born earlier than
      Cleopatra VI. However, based on the estimation that Theophanes might have been
      born around 100 BC and Cleopatra VI likely closer to the mid-1st century BC,
      it is reasonable to suggest that Theophanes was likely born earlier.

      he was a contemporary and close friend of the Roman general Pompey. This places
      his life around the early to mid-1st century BC.


      2. **Cleopatra VI of Egypt**: Cleopatra VI is a less well-known figure compared
      to Cleopatra VII. There is some historical ambiguity about her identity, but
      she is generally thought to have lived in the 1st century BC as well, possibly
      being a sister of Ptolemy XII and Cleopatra VII. Some historians suggest she
      might have been born around the mid-1st century BC or slightly earlier.


      Given the lack of precise birth dates for both figures, we rely on the general

      1. Thomas Corneille was born on August 20, 1625. He was a French dramatist and
      the younger brother of Pierre Corneille.


      2. Abraham Miguel Cardoso was born in 1630. He was a Sephardic Jewish physician
      and a prominent figure in the Sabbatean movement.


      Now, comparing the two birth years:


      - Thomas Corneille: 1625

      - Abraham Miguel Cardoso: 1630


      Thomas Corneille was indeed born earlier than Abraham Miguel Cardoso.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.'
