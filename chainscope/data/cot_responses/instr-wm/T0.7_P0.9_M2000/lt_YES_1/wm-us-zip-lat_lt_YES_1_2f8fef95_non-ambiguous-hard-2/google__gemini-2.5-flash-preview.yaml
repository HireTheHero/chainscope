      4.  **Compare the latitudes:** While a precise latitude lookup isn''t strictly
      necessary for this general comparison, we know that the contiguous US is roughly
      rectangular, and California is generally located at latitudes that are similar
      to or slightly lower than Pennsylvania, but the main difference is longitudinal
      (east vs. west). However, the question is about *south* of. California is significantly
      *west* of Pennsylvania.

      5.  **Visualize or recall the US map:** California is on the Pacific coast.
      Pennsylvania is inland on the Atlantic side. On a US map, California is located
      to the southwest of Pennsylvania.

      6.  **Evaluate the "south of" condition:** Since California is to the southwest
      of Pennsylvania, parts of California are indeed south of parts of Pennsylvania.
      Specifically, the latitude range of California is generally lower than the latitude
      range of Pennsylvania.

      1.  **Identify the core question:** The question asks if one zip code (27707,
      NC) is located south of another zip code (11782, NY).

      2.  **Recognize the need for geographical comparison:** Zip codes are geographical
      areas. To determine if one is south of another, I need to know their relative
      latitudes.

      3.  **Identify the key information needed:** The states (NC and NY) are provided,
      which is a good starting point for general location. I need to know the approximate
      locations of these specific zip codes or at least the general relative latitudes
      of North Carolina and New York.

      4.  **Recall general geography of the US East Coast:** North Carolina is a state
      generally considered to be in the South Atlantic region. New York is a state
      generally considered to be in the Northeast region.

      higher latitudes (further north). North Carolina is south of New York.

      southeastern United States. New York (NY) is a state in the northeastern United
      States.

      3.  **Consider their relative latitudes:** States in the southeastern US are
      generally located at lower latitudes (further south) than states in the northeastern
      US. North Carolina is significantly further south than New York.

      4.  **Consider the specific zip codes:** While zip codes delineate specific
      areas within states, a zip code in North Carolina will inherently be located
      within the state of North Carolina, and a zip code in New York will be located
      within the state of New York. The general north-south relationship between the
      states holds for specific locations within them, unless you are comparing extreme
      edges and there are unusual geographic features (which isn''t the case here).

      zip code in western Pennsylvania. The overall state-level positioning is the
      dominant factor. General location within the states reinforces this: 23832 is
      in Chesterfield, Virginia (south of Richmond), and 15061 is in Monongahela,
      Pennsylvania (south of Pittsburgh). Both are roughly central/southern within
      their respective states.


      4.  **Formulate the comparison:** We are comparing the latitude of a location
      in VA to the latitude of a location in PA. Since VA is generally south of PA,
      a location in VA will generally have a lower latitude (be further south) than
      a location in PA.


      5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the relative geographical position of the states,
      23832, VA is south of 15061, PA.

    b5b71372-376b-4b90-abd0-b533c8cae203: "Here's my thought process for determining\
      \ the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks if a\
      \ specific Virginia zip code (23832) is located geographically south of a specific\
      \ Pennsylvania zip code (15061).\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Data Points:**\n\
      \    *   Zip Code 1: 23832\n    *   State 1: Virginia (VA)\n    *   Zip Code\
      \ 2: 15061\n    *   State 2: Pennsylvania (PA)\n\n3.  **Determine the Relative\
      \ Geographic Locations of the States:** I know that Virginia is located south\
      \ of Pennsylvania on a standard map of the United States. Pennsylvania is a\
      \ Mid-Atlantic state, bordering states like New York, New Jersey, Delaware,\
      \ Maryland, West Virginia, and Ohio. Virginia is a Southern state (or sometimes\
      \ considered Mid-Atlantic/Southern), bordering states like Maryland, West Virginia,\
      \ Kentucky, Tennessee, and North Carolina. Virginia is clearly further south\
      \ than Pennsylvania as a whole.\n\n4.  **Consider if Specific Zip Codes Could\
      \ Reverse the Trend:** While the states have a general north/south relationship,\
      \ it's *theoretically* possible (though highly unlikely given these specific\
      \ states) that a northern part of Virginia could be north of a southern part\
      \ of Pennsylvania. However, this requires knowing the *specific* locations within\
      \ the states.\n\n5.  **Locate the Specific Zip Codes (Mental or Actual Search):**\n\
      \    *   23832 VA: A quick search reveals this zip code is for Chester, Virginia,\
      \ which is near Richmond.\n    *   15061 PA: A quick search reveals this zip\
      \ code is for Monaca, Pennsylvania, which is near Pittsburgh, in the western\
      \ part of the state.\n\n6.  **Confirm Relative Positions of the Specific Locations:**\n\
      \    *   Chester, VA is near Richmond, VA. Richmond is in central Virginia.\n\
      \    *   Monaca, PA is near Pittsburgh, PA. Pittsburgh is in western Pennsylvania,\
      \ in the southern half of the state, but still well within Pennsylvania's borders.\n\
      \n7.  **Compare the Specific Locations:** Based on my knowledge of US geography,\
      \ Richmond (and thus Chester) is significantly further south than Pittsburgh\
      \ (and thus Monaca).\n\n8.  **Synthesize the Findings:** Virginia is generally\
      \ south of Pennsylvania. The specific locations (Chester, VA and Monaca, PA)\
      \ confirm this general relationship. Chester, VA is indeed south of Monaca,\
      \ PA.\n\n9.  **Formulate the Final Answer:** The question asks \"Is 23832, VA\
      \ located south of 15061, PA?\". My analysis confirms that it is.\n\n10. **Provide\
      \ the YES/NO Answer:** The answer is YES.\n\n**Self-Correction/Refinement:**\
      \ Is there any edge case where this wouldn't be true? No, not with these states\
      \ and these locations. Pennsylvania's southernmost point is still north of Virginia's\
      \ northernmost point. Therefore, *any* location in Virginia will be south of\
      \ *any* location in Pennsylvania. However, using the specific zip code locations\
      \ makes the reasoning more precise and confirms the general state relationship.\n\
      \nOkay, planning complete. I will now provide the YES/NO answer based on this\
      \ reasoning.\n\nThe answer is:"

      Virginia is a state located in the southeastern United States. Pennsylvania
      is a state located in the northeastern United States. Virginia is generally

      a southern state to extend north of parts of a northern state (e.g., a western
      part of Virginia might be further north than a southern tip of Pennsylvania),
      the general orientation of Virginia relative to Pennsylvania strongly suggests
      that locations in Virginia will be south of locations in Pennsylvania.

      5.  **Conclusion based on general state location:** Given that Virginia is broadly
      south of Pennsylvania, it is highly probable that a specific location in Virginia

      latitudes of the US.

      7.  **Synthesize:** To be south of something, you must be at a lower latitude.
      While both states span a range of latitudes, New York is generally further south
      than Oregon. Specifically, 14892 is in the Finger Lakes region of NY, which
      is roughly around 42 degrees North latitude. 97227 is in Portland, OR, which
      is around 45.5 degrees North latitude.

      8.  **Conclusion:** 42 degrees North is a lower latitude than 45.5 degrees North.
      Therefore, 14892, NY is located south of 97227, OR.

      the locations of the zip code 14892, NY and 97227, OR.

      2. **Determine the general location of each state:** New York (NY) is located
      on the east coast of the United States, while Oregon (OR) is located on the
      west coast.

      3. **Consider the latitudes of the states:** In general, the US is wider than
      it is tall. The eastern and western coasts roughly extend from similar northern
      to southern latitudes.

      4. **Consider the specific zip codes:** While the states cover a range of latitudes,
      we need to consider the specific zip codes. 14892 is in upstate New York, which
      is in the northern part of the state. 97227 is in Portland, Oregon, which is
      in the northern part of that state.

      5. **Compare the latitudes:** Without looking up the exact latitudes, we can
      reason that both locations are in the northern half of the continental US. Since
      both are in the northern parts of their respective states, and both states are
      at roughly similar latitudes across the country, it''s likely they are at similar
      latitudes. However, to be definitively south, one would need to be significantly
      further south than the other.

      6. **Consider the relative latitudes:** Upstate New York is generally considered
      to be at a higher latitude than Portland, Oregon.


      Therefore, 14892, NY is likely further north than 97227, OR.

      southeastern/east-central United States. Utah (UT) is in the western United
      States.

      3.  **Compare the general latitudes:** States in the southeastern US are generally
      at lower latitudes (further south) than states in the western US, particularly
      those like Utah which is in the mountain region.

      4.  **Conclusion based on state location:** Kentucky is geographically located
      south of Utah.

      5.  **Consider zip codes:** While specific zip codes pinpoint locations within
      a state, the question asks if *a location* in 40475, KY is south of *a location*
      in 84009, UT. Since the entire state of Kentucky is south of the entire state
      of Utah, any specific location within Kentucky will be south of any specific

    b3a1ddc7-a1a3-460b-af98-6a4b02b7832c: 'Step 1: Identify the locations corresponding
      to the zip codes.

      91356 is in California (CA).

      61610 is in Illinois (IL).


      Step 2: Determine the general geographic position of California and Illinois
      within the United States.

      California is on the west coast of the United States.

      Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare the relative latitude of California and Illinois.

      Generally, the western states are located at a similar or slightly lower latitude
      than the midwestern states at similar longitudes. While specific locations within
      each state matter, the question asks if 91356, CA is south of 61610, IL. Given
      the general east-west and north-south positions of the states, a location in
      California is generally at a lower latitude (further south or at the same latitude)
      than a location in Illinois.


      Step 4: Consider the specific zip codes.

      91356 is in Valencia, California.

      61610 is in Peoria, Illinois.


      Step 5: Compare the latitudes of Valencia, CA and Peoria, IL.

      Valencia, CA is located around 34.4 degrees North latitude.

      Peoria, IL is located around 40.7 degrees North latitude.


      Step 6: Determine if 91356, CA is south of 61610, IL based on latitude.

      Since 34.4 degrees North is a lower latitude than 40.7 degrees North, Valencia,
      CA (91356) is located south of Peoria, IL (61610).

    e90ee721-93ef-4405-aaae-2adb03f7cbbb: '1.  **Identify the locations:** The question
      asks about the relative positions of Forestville, CA (zip code 95436) and Randolph,
      NJ (zip code 07871).

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** California is on the west
      coast of the United States. New Jersey is on the east coast of the United States.

      3.  **Consider the overall latitude of the states:** Both California and New
      Jersey span a range of latitudes. However, as a general rule, the continental
      US is wider east-to-west than it is tall north-to-south.

      4.  **Compare the specific locations:** While a precise latitude comparison
      would require looking up the coordinates, we know California is significantly
      to the west of New Jersey. To determine if one is south of the other, we need
      to compare their latitudes. Forestville, CA is in Northern California. Randolph,
      NJ is in Northern New Jersey. Both are in the northern halves of their respective
      states.

      5.  **Visualize the US map:** Imagine the US map. California is far to the west.
      New Jersey is far to the east. If you draw a horizontal line across the US,
      Northern California is roughly at a similar or slightly higher latitude than
      Northern New Jersey.

      6.  **Conclusion based on general location:** Given that both locations are
      in the northern parts of their respective countries (relative to the US as a
      whole), and California is significantly west of New Jersey, it is highly unlikely
      that a location in Northern California is south of a location in Northern New
      Jersey. A quick check confirms that Forestville, CA is approximately at 38.5
      degrees North latitude, and Randolph, NJ is approximately at 40.8 degrees North
      latitude. A lower latitude means further south.

      \ **Determine the Location of 80465, CO:**\n    *   \"CO\" stands for Colorado.\n\
      \    *   80465 is a zip code in Colorado.\n    *   A quick search or internal\

      \ on the Atlantic coast, further north and east of Mississippi.\n\n3.  **Determine\
      \ the general latitude:** States further south generally have lower latitudes\
      \ than states further north. Mississippi is geographically south of North Carolina.\n\
      \n4.  **Consider the specific zip codes:** While specific zip codes within a\
      \ state can vary in latitude, the *general* location of the states is the primary\
      \ factor. A zip code in Mississippi will almost certainly be at a lower (more\
      \ southern) latitude than a zip code in North Carolina.\n\n5.  **Confirm the\

    8db2732c-769c-4611-8c66-eb28fa38ba80: '**Step 1: Identify the locations associated
      with the zip codes.**


      *   39525 is in Mississippi (MS).

      *   28216 is in North Carolina (NC).


      **Step 2: Determine the approximate geographic locations of the states.**


      *   Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States, generally considered
      to be west of North Carolina.

      *   North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States, generally considered
      to be east of Mississippi.


      **Step 3: Consider the general latitudinal positions of the states.**


      While both states are in the Southeast, Mississippi is generally located at
      a more southerly latitude than North Carolina.


      **Step 4: Confirm the relative North/South relationship.**


      Looking at a map, Mississippi is situated to the south and west of North Carolina.


      **Step 5: Apply this to the specific zip codes.**


      Since Mississippi is generally south of North Carolina, a location within Mississippi
      (39525) is likely south of a location within North Carolina (28216).


      **Step 6: Final Conclusion.**


      Based on the relative geographic positions of Mississippi and North Carolina,
      39525, MS is located south of 28216, NC.

      \ latitudes to see if the Indiana location is south of the Wisconsin location.\n\
      \n3.  **Find the location of 46013, IN:**\n    *   I access my internal knowledge\
      \ base about US geography and zip codes, or use a simulated search/mapping tool.\n\
      \    *   46013 corresponds to Anderson, Indiana.\n    *   I know Indiana is\

      \  Marinette, WI is in northeastern Wisconsin, right on the border with Michigan,\
      \ near Green Bay.\n\n4.  **Compare latitudes:** Locations further south have\
      \ a lower latitude (closer to the equator), while locations further north have\
      \ a higher latitude (closer to the North Pole). Since Indiana is south of Wisconsin,\
      \ and considering the specific locations within those states (central IN vs.\
      \ northern WI), the latitude of Anderson, IN will be lower than the latitude\
      \ of Marinette, WI.\n\n5.  **Conclusion based on latitude:** A lower latitude\
      \ means the location is south of the location with a higher latitude. Therefore,\
      \ 46013, IN is located south of 54143, WI.\n\nYES"

      zip code, 32818, is in Florida (FL). The second zip code, 35951, is in Alabama
      (AL).

      2.  **Consider the general geographic relationship:** Florida is generally south
      of Alabama in the southeastern United States.

      3.  **Consider potential exceptions:** While Florida is *generally* south of
      Alabama, the border between the two states runs roughly east-west. It''s possible
      that a location in northern Florida could be north of a location in southern
      Alabama, or vice versa, depending on the specific coordinates.

      4.  **Determine the need for specific coordinates:** To definitively answer
      whether one *specific* zip code is south of another *specific* zip code, especially
      when the states share a border or are relatively close geographically, you need
      the actual latitude of the central point or centroid of each zip code.

      5.  **Find the latitude for 32818, FL:** A quick search reveals that 32818 is
      in Orlando, Florida. The approximate latitude is around 28.5 degrees North.

      6.  **Find the latitude for 35951, AL:** A quick search reveals that 35951 is
      in Albertville, Alabama. The approximate latitude is around 34.3 degrees North.

      7.  **Compare the latitudes:** 28.5 degrees North (Florida) is a smaller number
      than 34.3 degrees North (Alabama). In the Northern Hemisphere, smaller latitude
      numbers indicate a location further south.

      codes are 33025 in Florida (FL) and 36869 in Alabama (AL).

      2.  **Determine the general geographical relationship:** Florida is a state
      in the southeastern US, known for being a peninsula extending south. Alabama
      is also in the southeastern US, located to the west and north of Florida.

      3.  **Consider the latitude:** Southern locations generally have lower latitudes
      (closer to the equator). Northern locations have higher latitudes.

      4.  **General knowledge of state locations:** Florida is generally considered
      the southernmost state in the contiguous US (with Key West being the southernmost
      point). While northern Florida is roughly at the same latitude as southern Alabama,
      the state of Florida extends much further south than any part of Alabama.

      5.  **Focus on the specific zip codes:** We don''t need precise coordinates,
      just the general location within their states. 33025 is in Hollywood, Florida
      (south Florida). 36869 is in Smiths Station, Alabama (eastern Alabama, near
      the Georgia border). Looking at a map confirms Hollywood, FL is significantly
      further south than Smiths Station, AL.

      asks about the relative location of 77386, TX and 29205, SC.

      2.  **Determine the states:** 77386 is in Texas (TX). 29205 is in South Carolina
      (SC).

      3.  **Determine the relative location of the states:** Texas is in the southwestern
      part of the US. South Carolina is in the southeastern part of the US. On a map,
      Texas is significantly west of South Carolina.

      4.  **Consider latitude:** To be "south of" another location, the first location
      must have a lower latitude (be closer to the equator). While exact latitudes
      of the specific zip codes aren''t strictly necessary for this comparison of
      states, Texas generally lies at lower latitudes than South Carolina. For example,
      southern Texas is much further south than any part of South Carolina. Even northern
      Texas is roughly at a similar latitude or slightly south of parts of South Carolina.

      5.  **Compare the states geographically:** Texas is generally considered south
      and west of South Carolina.

      6.  **Determine relative position of the specific zip codes:** Since Texas is
      geographically south of South Carolina, a zip code in Texas (77386, The Woodlands,
      TX) is generally going to be south of a zip code in South Carolina (29205, Columbia,
      SC). The Woodlands, TX is around 30.1 degrees North latitude. Columbia, SC is
      around 34.0 degrees North latitude. A lower latitude means further south.


      Therefore, 77386, TX is located south of 29205, SC.

      This is the zip code for Gainesville, Florida.

      2.  Determine the approximate latitude of Gainesville, FL. Gainesville is in
      northern Florida, roughly around 29.65 degrees North latitude.

      3.  Determine the location of 75149, TX. This is a zip code in Mesquite, Texas
      (a suburb of Dallas).

      4.  Determine the approximate latitude of Mesquite, TX. Mesquite is in northern
      Texas, roughly around 32.78 degrees North latitude.

      5.  Compare the latitudes. 29.65 degrees North is a lower latitude than 32.78
      degrees North. Lower latitudes are further south (closer to the equator).

      at a lower latitude (further south) than any point in Texas.

      4. **Reason about specific locations within the states:** Even without knowing
      the exact locations within each state for these specific zip codes, the fact
      that Florida is generally further south than Texas makes it highly likely that
      a location in Florida will be south of a location in Texas, especially when
      comparing a zip code in the northern half of Florida (32601 is in Gainesville)
      to a zip code in the northern half of Texas (75149 is in Forney, near Dallas).

      5. **Confirm with a mapping tool (optional but helpful):** Looking up the locations
      of 32601 (Gainesville, FL) and 75149 (Forney, TX) on a map confirms that Gainesville,

      to the zip codes.

      95476 is associated with Sonoma, California.

      02790 is associated with Westport, Massachusetts.


      Step 2: Determine the relative locations of California and Massachusetts within
      the United States.

      California is on the west coast of the United States.

      Massachusetts is on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Determine the general latitude of Sonoma, CA and Westport, MA.

      Sonoma, CA is located in Northern California. Its approximate latitude is around
      38.3 degrees North.

      Westport, MA is located in southeastern Massachusetts. Its approximate latitude
      is around 41.5 degrees North.


      Step 4: Compare the latitudes to determine which location is further south.

      A lower latitude number indicates a location further south in the Northern Hemisphere.

      38.3 degrees North (Sonoma, CA) is lower than 41.5 degrees North (Westport,
      MA).


      Step 5: Based on the latitude comparison, determine if 95476, CA is located

      4.  **Confirm relative positions:** Falmouth, MA is on Cape Cod. Salem, OR is
      in the Willamette Valley. Geographically, the East Coast of the US is significantly
      north of the West Coast at comparable longitudes. More precisely, Salem, OR
      is roughly at latitude 44.9 degrees North. Falmouth, MA is roughly at latitude
      41.5 degrees North.

      5.  **Compare latitudes directly:** 41.5 degrees North (Falmouth, MA) is a lower
      latitude than 44.9 degrees North (Salem, OR). A lower latitude means the location
      is further south.


      Therefore, 02540, MA is located south of 97330, OR.

      \ if a specific zip code in Massachusetts (02540) is geographically south of\
      \ a specific zip code in Oregon (97330). The answer must be a simple YES or\
      \ NO.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Information:**\n    *   Zip Code 1: 02540, MA\n\

      \    *   Where is Massachusetts (MA) located in the US? It's on the East Coast,\
      \ in the northeastern part of the country.\n    *   Where is Oregon (OR) located\
      \ in the US? It's on the West Coast, in the northwestern part of the country.\n\
      \n4.  **Mentally Visualize or Recall a US Map:** Imagine the relative positions\
      \ of Massachusetts and Oregon. Massachusetts is far to the east and slightly\
      \ north of the central latitude of the US. Oregon is far to the west and also\
      \ in the northern half of the US.\n\n5.  **Compare Latitudes (Implicit or Explicit):**\
      \ To determine if one location is south of another, you need to compare their\
      \ latitudes. A lower latitude means a location is further south.\n    *   Massachusetts\
      \ is generally located at higher latitudes than many southern states, but it's\
      \ still in the northern hemisphere. Its approximate latitude range is around\
      \ 41\xB0 to 42.5\xB0 North. The specific zip code 02540 (Falmouth, MA) is on\
      \ Cape Cod, which is relatively southern for MA, but still firmly in the northern\
      \ latitudes. A quick check (mental or actual) reveals Falmouth is around 41.5\xB0\

      \ parts of the country. The latitude difference is significant enough (around\
      \ 3 degrees) that there's no overlap or edge case where the southern part of\
      \ the Oregon zip code area is south of the northern part of the Massachusetts\
      \ zip code area.\n\nOkay, proceeding with the determined steps and conclusion.\n\
      \nStep 1: Identify the locations by state: 02540 is in Massachusetts (MA), and\
      \ 97330 is in Oregon (OR).\nStep 2: Recall the relative geographic positions\

      \ on the West Coast, in the Northwest.\nStep 3: To determine if one location\
      \ is south of another, we need to compare their latitudes. Locations further\
      \ south have lower latitudes (in the Northern Hemisphere).\nStep 4: Massachusetts\

      Texas is in the south-central part of the US.

      Arizona is in the southwestern part of the US.


      Step 3: Consider the relative latitudes of the states. Texas generally lies
      at lower latitudes than Arizona, especially when comparing the southern parts
      of Texas to the central parts of Arizona.


      Step 4: Consider the specific locations within the states if possible. 77360
      is Spring, TX, which is north of Houston. 85254 is Scottsdale, AZ, which is
      north of Phoenix.


      Step 5: Visually compare the geographic positions of Spring, TX and Scottsdale,
      AZ on a map, or consider their approximate latitudes. Spring, TX is roughly
      at a latitude of 30.08 degrees North. Scottsdale, AZ (85254 area) is roughly
      at a latitude of 33.60 degrees North. A lower latitude means a location is further

      asks if the location corresponding to zip code 78148, TX is south of the location
      corresponding to zip code 93434, CA.

      2.  **Understand the data:** Zip codes are geographical identifiers. The first
      few digits often indicate a general region.

      3.  **Analyze 78148, TX:** The state is Texas. Texas is generally located in
      the southern part of the United States (relative to the whole country).

      4.  **Analyze 93434, CA:** The state is California. California is located on
      the west coast. The 9xxxx series of zip codes are generally on the West Coast.

      5.  **Compare the general locations:** Texas is located east of California.
      More importantly for the "south of" question, Texas is generally at a lower
      latitude than central or northern California.

      6.  **Refine the comparison:** While California spans a large range of latitudes,
      93434 is in the 93xxx series, which are typically in central or southern California.
      78148 is in the 78xxx series, which are typically in southern Texas.

      7.  **Consider latitude:** Southern Texas (where 78148 is located, specifically
      Cibolo, TX) is at a latitude around 29.5 degrees North. Central/Southern California
      (where 93434 is located, specifically Lompoc, CA) is at a latitude around 34.6
      degrees North.

      8.  **Determine relative position:** A lower latitude means a location is further
      south. Since 29.5 degrees North is lower than 34.6 degrees North, 78148, TX
      is located south of 93434, CA.

      4.  **Compare their latitudes:** Pennsylvania is generally located further north
      than Iowa. While there''s some overlap in latitudes, the core of Pennsylvania
      is significantly north of the core of Iowa.

      5.  **Consider the question:** The question asks if the PA zip code (19362)
      is located *south* of the IA zip code (51109).

      6.  **Evaluate the comparison:** Since PA is generally north of IA, a location
      in PA is unlikely to be south of a location in IA. It is more likely to be north
      of it, or roughly at the same latitude but further east.


      Given that Pennsylvania is located to the northeast of Iowa, it is highly improbable
      that a specific location within Pennsylvania is geographically south of a specific
      location within Iowa.
