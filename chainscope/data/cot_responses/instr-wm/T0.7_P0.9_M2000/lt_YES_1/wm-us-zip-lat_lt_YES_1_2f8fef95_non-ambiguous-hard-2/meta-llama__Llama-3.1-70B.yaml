      3. **Understand the relative positions**: Given their general geographic locations,
      Kentucky is generally south of New Hampshire.

      4. **Apply this knowledge to the zip codes**: Since Kentucky is generally south
      of New Hampshire, we can assume that 40108, KY is located south of 03079, NH.


      Based on the above steps, the answer to whether 40108, KY is located south of
      03079, NH is:


      YES'

      south of 91351, CA, we need to understand the geographic locations of the two
      zip codes and compare them.


      1. **Identify the states**: 77007 is located in Texas (TX), while 91351 is located
      in California (CA).

      2. **Understand general locations**: Texas is generally located in the southern
      part of the United States, while California is located in the western part of
