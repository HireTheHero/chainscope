    6ca7a250-a0c4-4f70-965f-c5eafd8d0d63: 'The first step is to find the latitude
      of both zip codes. The latitude of 94930, CA is 37.740333 and the latitude of
      15137, PA is 40.433333.

      The next step is to find the longitude of both zip codes. The longitude of 94930,
      CA is -122.4375 and the longitude of 15137, PA is -75.883333.

      Now we need to find the distance between the two zip codes. The distance between
      two points is given by the formula:


      distance = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)


      where x1, y1 are the coordinates of the first point and x2, y2 are the coordinates
      of the second point.


      Plugging in the values, we get:


      distance = sqrt((-122.4375-75.883333)^2 + (37.740333-40.433333)^2)


      distance = sqrt((-198.320833)^2 + (-2.693333)^2)


      distance = sqrt(395131.09875 + 7.173289)


      distance = sqrt(395138.2725)


      distance = 198.320833


      So, the distance between 94930, CA and 15137, PA is 198.320833 miles.

      Since the distance between the two zip codes is greater than 100 miles, we can
      conclude that 94930, CA is located south of 15137, PA.

      that 95110 is south of 61611.


      In order to prove that, you have to show that 95110 is south of 61611.


      You can do this by finding the latitude of 95110 and the latitude of 61611,
      and then comparing them.


      For example, if 95110 is located at 38.1836743 and 61611 is located at 42.8836743,
      then you can see that 95110 is south of 61611.

      are not geographic locations. They are just codes used to identify addresses.
      So, for example, the zip code 95110, CA is located in the state of California.


      However, zip codes are not the same as geographic locations. They are just codes
      used to identify addresses. So, for example, the zip code 95110, CA is located
      in the state of California.


      So, in your question, the zip code 95110, CA is not located south of 61611,

      The zip code 95110, CA is located in the state of California. The zip code 61611,

      but I need to ask it.

      Is there a way to get the number of miles from two zip codes?


      For example, 32073 and 32068?


      The number of miles from 32073 and 32068 is 3.4.


      Is there a way to find the number of miles between two zip codes?

      use Google Maps or other online tools to find the latitude and longitude coordinates
      of each zip code.


      Once you have the coordinates, you can use a tool like the Google Distance Matrix

      \ is south. This can be tricky, but there are a few ways to figure it out. One\
      \ way is to use a map or online tool to find the location of the zip codes and\
      \ draw a line between them. Another way is to use a compass or ruler to measure\
      \ the angle between the two zip codes.\n\n3. Draw a line:\n\nOnce you have the\
      \ location of the zip codes, draw a line between them to see if it goes through\
      \ the center of the state. In this case, the line would go through the center\
      \ of Arizona.\n\n4. Determine the location:\n\nIf the line goes through the\
      \ center of the state, then 85614 is located south of 34145. If the line does\
      \ not go through the center of the state, then 85614 is located north of 34145.\n\
      \n5. Check the answer:\n\nOnce you have determined the location of the zip code,\
      \ check to see if it is located south of 34145. If it is, then the answer is\
      \ yes. If it is not, then the answer is no.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation\
      \ of how to find the answer to the question \"Is 85614, AZ located south of\
      \ 34145, FL?\"\n\n1. Determine the state:\n\nFirst, you need to determine which\
      \ state the zip codes are in. In this case, 85614 is in Arizona, and 34145 is\
      \ in Florida.\n\n2. Determine the direction:\n\nTo determine if 85614 is located\
      \ south of 34145, you need to know which direction is south. In this case, south\
      \ is towards the equator.\n\n3. Draw a line:\n\nTo find the answer, you need\
      \ to draw a line between the two zip codes. This can be done using a compass\
      \ or ruler, or by using a map or online tool.\n\n4. Determine the location:\n\
      \nOnce you have drawn the line, you need to determine where it intersects the\
      \ equator. If the line intersects the equator at the same latitude as 85614,\
      \ then 85614 is located south of 34145. If the line intersects the equator at\
      \ a different latitude, then 85614 is not located south of 34145.\n\n5. Check\
      \ the answer:\n\nTo check the answer, you can use a map or online tool to find\
      \ the location of the zip codes and draw a line between them. If the line goes\
      \ through the equator at the same latitude as 85614, then the answer is yes.\
      \ If the line does not go through the equator at the same latitude as 85614,\
      \ then the answer is no.\n\nIn conclusion, to find the answer to the question\
      \ \"Is 85614, AZ located south of 34145, FL?\" you need to draw a line between\
      \ the two zip codes, and determine where it intersects the equator. If the line\
      \ intersects the equator at the same latitude as 85614, then 85614 is located\
      \ south of 34145.\nHere's a step-by-step approach to finding the answer to the\
      \ question:\n\n1. Determine the states:\n\nFirst, identify the states that the\
      \ zip codes are located in. In this case, the zip codes are 39506 and 39533,\
      \ and they are both located in Alabama.\n\n2. Determine the direction:\n\nTo\
      \ determine if 39506 is located south of 39533, you need to know which direction\
      \ is south. In this case, south is towards the equator.\n\n3. Draw a line:\n\
      \nTo find the answer, you need to draw a line between the two zip codes. This\
      \ can be done using a compass or ruler, or by using a map or online tool.\n\n\
      4. Determine the location:\n\nOnce you have drawn the line, you need to determine\
      \ where it intersects the equator. If the line intersects the equator at the\
      \ same latitude as 39506, then 39506 is located south of 39533. If the line\
      \ intersects the equator at a different latitude, then 39506 is not located\
      \ south of 39533.\n\n5. Check the answer:\n\nTo check the answer, you can use\
      \ a map or online tool to find the location of the zip codes and draw a line\
      \ between them. If the line goes through the equator at the same latitude as\
      \ 39506, then the answer is yes. If the line does not go through the equator\
      \ at the same latitude as 39506, then the answer is no.\n\nIn conclusion, to\
      \ find the answer to the question \"Is 39506, AL located south of 39533, AL?\"\
      , you need to draw a line between the two zip codes, and determine where it\
      \ intersects the equator. If the line intersects the equator at the same latitude\
      \ as 39506, then 39506 is located south of 39533.\nHere is a step-by-step guide\
      \ on how to determine if a zip code is located south of another zip code:\n\n\
      1. Identify the two zip codes:\n  - In this case, let's say you want to know\
      \ if 34755 is located south of 34763.\n\n2. Determine the states:\n  - The first\
      \ step is to determine which states the zip codes are in. In this case, 34755\
      \ is in Texas, and 34763 is in Texas as well.\n\n3. Determine the direction:\n\
      \  - To determine if 34755 is located south of 34763, you need to know which\
      \ direction is south. In this case, south is towards the equator.\n\n4. Draw\
      \ a line:\n  - To find the answer, you need to draw a line between the two zip\
      \ codes. This can be done using a compass or ruler, or by using a map or online\
      \ tool.\n\n5. Determine the location:\n  - Once you have drawn the line, you\
      \ need to determine where it intersects the equator. If the line intersects\
      \ the equator at the same latitude as 34755, then 34755 is located south of\
      \ 34763. If the line intersects the equator at a different latitude, then 34755\
      \ is not located south of 34763.\n\n6. Check the answer:\n  - To check the answer,\
      \ you can use a map or online tool to find the location of the zip codes and\
      \ draw a line between them. If the line goes through the equator at the same\
      \ latitude as 34755, then the answer is yes. If the line does not go through\
      \ the equator at the same latitude as 34755, then the answer is no.\n\nIn conclusion,\
      \ determining if a zip code is located south of another zip code requires you\
      \ to draw a line between the two zip codes, and determine where it intersects\
      \ the equator. If the line intersects the equator at the same latitude as the\
      \ first zip code, then it is located south of the second zip code.\nHere is\
      \ a step-by-step guide on how to determine if a zip code is located south of\
      \ another zip code:\n\n1. Identify the two zip codes:\n\n  * In this case, let's\
      \ say you want to know if 39526 is located south of 39530.\n\n2. Determine the\
      \ states:\n\n  * The first step is to determine which states the zip codes are\
      \ located in. In this case, 39526 is in Florida and 39530 is in Florida as well.\n\
      \n3. Determine the direction:\n\n  * To determine if 39526 is located south\
      \ of 39530, you need to know which direction is south. In this case, south is\
      \ towards the equator.\n\n4. Draw a line:\n\n  * To find the answer, you need\
      \ to draw a line between the two zip codes. This can be done using a compass\
      \ or ruler, or by using a map or online tool.\n\n5. Determine the location:\n\
      \n  * Once you have drawn the line, you need to determine where it intersects\
      \ the equator. If the line intersects the equator at the same latitude as 39526,\
      \ then 39526 is located south of 39530. If the line intersects the equator at\
      \ a different latitude, then 39526 is not located south of 39530."

    975e77cb-5f76-4b75-8eec-0c998e2e3d2b: 'I am going to give you the steps I would
      take to figure this out.


      1. Are you sure you want to go this route? This is a lot of work. I would find
      the latitude and longitude of the zip code and then find the latitude and longitude
      of the city and state you want to compare to. That will save you a lot of work.


      2. If you want to go this route, you need to find the latitude and longitude
      of 95110. You can find that at the link below.


      https://www.google.com/maps/place/95110,+CA/@37.346855,-122.389958,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x808f52866a14b609:0x8872f1799925959!8m2!3d37.346855!4d-122.387152


      3. Once you have the latitude and longitude of 95110, you can find the latitude
      and longitude of 61611. You can do that here.


      https://www.google.com/maps/place/61611,+IL/@41.736288,-87.848697,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x882930f7a50c155b:0x266c8a50d0265556!8m2!3d41.736288!4d-87.846495


      4. Once you have the latitude and longitude of 61611, you can figure out if
      95110 is located south of 61611. You can do that with the following steps.


      a. Subtract the latitude of 95110 from the latitude of 61611.


      b. Subtract the longitude of 95110 from the longitude of 61611.


      5. If the result of step 4a is less than 0, then 95110 is south of 61611. If
      the result of step 4b is less than 0, then 95110 is north of 61611.


      6. If the result of step 4a is greater than 0, then 95110 is north of 61611.
      If the result of step 4b is greater than 0, then 95110 is south of 61611.


      7. If you have done all the steps above, you should be able to figure out if
      95110 is located south of 61611.

      RE:


      is 95110, CA located south of 61611, IL?


      is 95110, CA located south of 61611, IL?

      First, you need to know the latitude and longitude of 95110 and 61611. You can
      find these on Google Maps. Then, you can use a formula to figure out if one
      is north or south of the other.


      The formula is:

      latitude1 - latitude2 = north or south

      longitude1 - longitude2 = east or west


      For example, let''s say the latitude of 95110 is 37.346855 and the latitude
      of 61611 is 41.736288.


      (37.346855 - 41.736288) = -4.389433


      This means 95110 is south of 61611.


      Now, if you have the latitude and longitude of two places, you can figure out
      which place is north or south of the other.


      Here are the steps:


      1. Find the latitude and longitude of the place you want to compare to.


      2. Find the latitude and longitude of the place you want to compare to.


      3. Subtract the latitude of the place you want to compare to from the latitude
      of the place you want to compare to.


      4. Subtract the longitude of the place you want to compare to from the longitude
      of the place you want to compare to.


      5. If the result is less than 0, then the place you want to compare to is south
      of the place you want to compare to. If the result is greater than 0, then the
      place you want to compare to is north of the place you want to compare to.

      I am not sure what you are trying to accomplish with this. If you are trying
      to find a city within a state, then you can use a zip code as a starting point.
      You can use the Google maps zip code search tool. You can also use the Google
      maps reverse geocode tool.


      Here is a link to the Google maps zip code search tool.

      http://www.google.com/maps/place?hl=en&q=zip+code+search&aq=0&oq=zip+code+search&aqz1=2&aqz2=d&aqi=&aql=&btnG=Search+Maps&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&biw=1024&bih=589&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=lcl&safe=strict&sspn=0.054581&hq=zip+code+search&gl=us&hq=&hnear=0x882930f7a50c155b:0x266c8a50d0265556,San+Francisco,+CA&cid=14287960856824243482&ll=37.346855,-122.389958&spn=0.054581,0.072405&z=16&om=1&aq=0&oq=zip+code+search&aqi=g10&aql=&gs_l=map.3..0l7.1576.2349.0.2424.5.5.0.0.0.0.156.337.1j1.5.0...0.0...1c.1.64.m106

      You have to know the latitude and longitude of the city or town. Then you can
      use this formula to find out if it is located south or north of the other city
      or town:


      (latitude1 - latitude2) / (longitude1 - longitude2)


      For example, if you wanted to find out if 95110 is south of 61611, you would
      use this formula:


      (37.346855 - 41.736288) / (-122.389958 - 87.848697)


      This would give you a result of -4.389433. This means that 95110 is south of
      61611.

      You can find the latitude and longitude of a place by using the Google maps
      place finder tool.
