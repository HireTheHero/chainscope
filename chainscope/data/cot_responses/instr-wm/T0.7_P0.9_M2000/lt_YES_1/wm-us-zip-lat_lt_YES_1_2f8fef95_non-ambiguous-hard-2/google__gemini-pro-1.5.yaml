      latitude number means further south.  Since Texas is west of Louisiana, the
      question of "south" is more complex than just comparing zip codes directly.  We

      Louisiana, 78401, TX is likely to be at a similar latitude or slightly north
      of a location in Louisiana.  We would need to check if the longitude difference
      is significant enough to place it further south despite being further west.

      2. **Latitude implications:** Generally, locations further south have lower
      latitude numbers.

      3. **General US geography:**  Moving from west to east, you generally stay at
      roughly the same latitude, or even move slightly north. Ohio is definitively
      north of the typical latitude for Washington state.


      Therefore, 44094, OH is NOT south of 98104, WA.


      NO

      the eastern part of the US, while Washington (WA) is in the western part.


      2. **Latitude and "South":** Latitude determines how far north or south a location
      is. Lower latitude values are further south.


      3. **General US Geography:**  Moving from west to east across the US does not
      significantly change latitude (north/south position).


      4. **Therefore:**  44094, OH and 98104, WA are at roughly similar latitudes.  One
      is not significantly south of the other.

      2. **Latitude and "south":** Latitude determines how far north or south a location
      is.  Lower latitude means further south.

      3. **General US geography:**  Locations further west do *not* inherently correlate
      with being further north or south.


      Therefore, simply knowing that one zip code is in OH and the other is in WA
      doesn''t tell us which is further south. We need to look up the latitudes.


      However, Ohio is generally south of Washington.


      Answer: YES
