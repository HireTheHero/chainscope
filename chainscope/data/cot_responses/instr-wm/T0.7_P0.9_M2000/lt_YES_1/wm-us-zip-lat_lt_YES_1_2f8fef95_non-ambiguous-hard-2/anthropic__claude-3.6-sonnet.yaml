      SC (29404) is in South Carolina, and Florida is south of South Carolina, 34108
      must be south of 29404.

      1. First, let me identify the locations:

      - 77807 is in Bryan, Texas

      - 72601 is in Harrison, Arkansas


      2. In general, for US ZIP codes:

      - First digit represents a certain geographical region

      - 7xxxx covers states in the central region

      - Both ZIPs start with 7, so they''re in the same general region


      3. Looking at relative positions:

      - Texas is south of Arkansas (Texas borders Arkansas''s southern border)

      - Bryan, TX (77807) is in central/eastern Texas

      - Harrison, AR (72601) is in northern Arkansas


      4. Since Bryan, TX is in Texas, and Texas is south of Arkansas where Harrison
      is located, then 77807 must be south of 72601.

      - 25601 is in West Virginia (WV)

      - 49445 is in Michigan (MI)


      2. In general:

      - Michigan is a northern state, bordering the Great Lakes

      - West Virginia is a mid-Atlantic state, south of Michigan


      3. More specifically:

      - Michigan zip codes starting with 494 are in the western part of the state

      - West Virginia zip codes starting with 256 are in the southern part of WV


      4. Since Michigan is entirely north of West Virginia, any location in WV will
      be south of any location in MI.


      Therefore: YES, 25601, WV is located south of 49445, MI.'
