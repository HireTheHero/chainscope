      2. **Pennsylvania (PA)** is located in the northeastern part of the United States.

      part of California but still much farther south than most of Pennsylvania.

      which is near Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh is located in the western part of Pennsylvania
      but is still considerably north of the northern parts of California.


      Given the general north-south positioning of the United States, with California

      with each zip code. 77807 is in Texas, and 72601 is in Arkansas.


      2. **General Location of States**: Next, we need to know the general geographic
      location of these states. Texas is located in the south-central part of the
      United States, and Arkansas is located to the east of Texas, also in the southern
      United States but more towards the eastern part of the south.


      3. **Specific Locations within States**: Now, we need to consider the specific
      locations within these states. The zip code 77807 is associated with College
      Station, Texas, which is in the eastern part of Texas. The zip code 72601 is
      associated with Eureka Springs, Arkansas, which is in the northwest part of
      Arkansas.

      \ or at a similar latitude compared to parts of California. However, to determine\
      \ if 37127 is specifically south of 95605, we consider that 95605 is likely\
      \ to be in the northern part of California's range given its zip code, and Tennessee,\

      \nGiven these steps, since California is generally west and somewhat south of\
      \ Virginia, but considering the \"south of\" requirement specifically, we must\
      \ acknowledge that California, as a whole, is not directly south but rather\
      \ southwest of Virginia. However, for two points, one being in California and\

      of 54180, WI, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the states**: 11767 is located in New York (NY), and 54180 is
      located in Wisconsin (WI).

      2. **General geographic location of the states**: New York is located in the
      northeastern part of the United States, while Wisconsin is located in the upper
      midwestern part of the United States.

      3. **Latitude comparison**: Generally, the farther north a location is, the
      higher its latitude. To determine if one location is south of another, we need
      to compare their latitudes. Without exact latitude values, we can use general
      knowledge that Wisconsin is west and slightly north of New York, given their
      positions in the country.

      4. **Zip code specifics**: The zip code 11767 refers to a specific area within
      New York, and 54180 refers to a specific area within Wisconsin. To precisely
      answer the question, we would ideally compare the latitudes of these specific
      zip code areas.


      Given the general geographic positions:

      - New York is generally southeast of Wisconsin.

      - Without exact coordinates, the general rule is that locations in Wisconsin
      tend to be more north than locations in New York due to their state-wide positions.


      Therefore, based on the general geographic relationship between New York and
      Wisconsin, it is reasonable to conclude that 11767, NY would be south of 54180,
      WI, considering the overall positioning of these states in the United States.

      \ south than parts of Florida, but overall, Arizona's southern parts are not\
      \ as far south as Florida's southern tip.\n\n4. **Specific Zip Code Knowledge**:\n\
      \   - 34990, FL is specifically in the Stuart area, which is on the east coast\
      \ of Florida, not as far south as Key West but still in the southern part of\
      \ the state.\n   - 85345, AZ is near Phoenix, which is relatively central in\
      \ Arizona, not as far south as the southern border of Arizona but certainly\
      \ not as far north as parts of the state like Flagstaff.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n\
      \   - Given the general positions of Florida and Arizona, and considering that\
      \ 34990, FL is in a southern state and 85345, AZ is in a state that, while having\
      \ southern parts, is generally more north than Florida, we can infer that 34990,\
      \ FL is indeed south of 85345, AZ, especially since Phoenix (near 85345) is\
      \ at a higher latitude than Stuart (near 34990).\n\nSo, considering the above\
