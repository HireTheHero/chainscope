      - Virginia (VA) is located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the eastern United
      States

      - Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Generally, Georgia is south of Virginia


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      While zip codes aren''t perfectly aligned with latitude, there is a general
      pattern where lower numbers are in the northeast and numbers increase as you
      go south and west. The first digit of 3 for Georgia vs 2 for Virginia supports
      the general north-south relationship.


      Step 4: Verify the specific locations.

      - 30350 is in the Atlanta metropolitan area in northern Georgia

      - 24482 is in western Virginia


      Even though 30350 is in northern Georgia and 24482 is in western Virginia, the
      entire state of Georgia lies south of Virginia geographically.


      YES, 30350, GA is located south of 24482, VA.'

      - 14892 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 97227 is a zip code in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Determine their approximate geographic positions.

      - New York is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Oregon is on the West Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Consider their north-south positioning.

      further north have higher latitudes.

      - Oregon is in the northern part of the West Coast, roughly at the same latitude
      as the northern parts of New York state.

      - New York zip codes in the 14xxx range are typically in the western/central
      parts of New York state.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 27408 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 18210 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is a northern state, located in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States, south of Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Since North Carolina is entirely south of Pennsylvania on a map of the United
      States, any location in North Carolina (including zip code 27408) would be south
      of any location in Pennsylvania (including zip code 18210)

      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 27408 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 18210 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - North Carolina is a southern state, located in the southeastern United States.

      - Pennsylvania is a northern state, located in the northeastern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their geographic positions.

      - States in the US are generally arranged with higher latitude (more northern)
      states having lower zip code numbers, and lower latitude (more southern) states
      having higher zip code numbers.

      - This pattern is reflected in these zip codes: 18xxx for PA (north) and 27xxx
      for NC (south).

      - North Carolina is geographically south of Pennsylvania on a map of the United
      States.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since North Carolina (where 27408 is located) is south of Pennsylvania (where
      18210 is located), the answer is YES.

      - 76148 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      - 87301 is a zip code in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Texas and New Mexico.

      - New Mexico is located west of Texas

      - New Mexico is generally north of Texas, especially when comparing the northern
      parts of NM with the central/northern parts of TX


      Step 3: More specifically, let me consider the likely locations of these zip

      - 76148 appears to be in the northern part of Texas (based on the numbering
      system)

      - 87301 appears to be in the western part of New Mexico


      Step 4: In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Texas zip codes in the 76xxx range are typically in the north-central part
      of Texas

      - New Mexico zip codes in the 873xx range are in the northwestern part of New
      Mexico

      - Northwestern New Mexico is generally north of north-central Texas


      Based on this reasoning, 76148, TX would be south of 87301, NM on a north-south
      axis.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 80465 is in Colorado (CO)

      - 12009 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Colorado and New York within the
      United States.

      - Colorado is located in the western part of the United States

      - New York is located in the northeastern part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions (latitudes).

      - Colorado is generally located south of New York on a map of the United States

      - New York state is much further north than Colorado


      Step 4: While specific zip codes within states could potentially vary from this
      general relationship, the north-south positioning of these states is significant
      enough that any zip code in Colorado would be south of any zip code in New York.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 80465 is a zip code in Colorado (CO)

      - 12009 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - New York is in the northeastern part of the United States

      - Colorado is in the western/central part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare latitudes.

      - New York is generally located much further north than Colorado

      - New York state''s southern border is approximately around 40-41 degrees North
      latitude

      - Colorado is mostly between 37-41 degrees North latitude


      Step 4: More specifically for these zip codes:

      - 80465 appears to be in the Morrison/Conifer area of Colorado, which is in
      the central part of Colorado

      - 12009 would be in upstate New York, which is in the northern part of New York
      state


      Since New York is significantly further north than Colorado in the United States,
      and these specific zip codes follow that general pattern, 80465, CO would be
      south of 12009, NY.

      - 34108 is in Florida (FL)

      - 29404 is in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      - Florida is located south of South Carolina on the US East Coast.

      - South Carolina borders North Carolina to its north and Georgia to its south.

      - Florida is south of Georgia, which is south of South Carolina.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - The first digits of zip codes generally follow a north-to-south pattern in
      the eastern US.

      - Zip codes starting with 2 (like 29404) are more northern than those starting
      with 3 (like 34108).

      - The 29xxx series covers South Carolina, while 34xxx covers central/southern
      Florida.

      - 77807 is in Texas (TX)

      - 72601 is in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the eastern/northeastern
      parts of the country, and higher numbers are in the western/southwestern parts.

      - The first digit indicates the general region: 7 covers the central south region
      including Texas and Arkansas.

      - Since both zip codes start with 7, I need to look at the second digit.

      - 77xxx (Texas) vs 72xxx (Arkansas)


      Step 3: Analyze the geographical relationship.

      - Texas is generally located south and southwest of Arkansas.

      - The higher second digit (7 vs 2) confirms that 77807 is in a more western/southwestern
      zone than 72601.

      - Specifically, 77807 is in the College Station area of Texas, which is indeed

      IN is located south of zip code 54143, WI. Let me think about this step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 46013 is in Indiana (IN)

      - 54143 is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship of these states.

      - Wisconsin is located in the northern part of the Midwest

      - Indiana is located in the central/southern part of the Midwest


      Step 3: Consider their relative positions.

      - Wisconsin borders the northern edge of the United States (along Lake Superior
      and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan)

      - Indiana is positioned entirely south of Wisconsin, with Illinois and Lake
      Michigan between them


      Step 4: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - The first digits of US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers
      are in the northeast and higher numbers in the southwest

      - However, within states, the specific pattern varies

      - The important factor here is that the entire state of Indiana lies south of
      Wisconsin


      Since any location in Indiana (including zip code 46013) is geographically south
      of any location in Wisconsin (including zip code 54143), I can conclude:


      YES, 46013, IN is located south of 54143, WI.'

      - 54143 is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Wisconsin is in the northern part of the Midwest, bordering Lake Superior
      and Michigan to the north.

      - Indiana is in the Midwest but positioned further south, below Michigan.


      Step 3: Consider the structure of US ZIP codes.

      - The first digit in ZIP codes generally follows a geographical pattern, with
      lower numbers in the northeast/east and higher numbers in the west.

      - The first three digits (460 vs 541) don''t directly tell us about north-south
      positioning.


      Step 4: Compare the states'' geographical positions.

      - Wisconsin is entirely north of Indiana on a map of the United States.

      - Any location in Indiana would be south of any location in Wisconsin.

      - 54143 is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      - Wisconsin is located in the northern part of the Midwest

      - Indiana is located in the central/southern part of the Midwest

      - Generally, Wisconsin is north of Indiana


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      - While zip codes aren''t perfectly aligned with latitude, the first digit does
      roughly correspond to geographic regions from east to west

      - The second and third digits generally represent sectional centers from north
      to south

      - 54xxx (Wisconsin) is in a more northern zone than 46xxx (Indiana)

      - 54180 is a zip code in Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of New York and Wisconsin.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Wisconsin is located in the north-central/midwestern United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes (north-south positioning).

      - Wisconsin is generally located further north in the United States

      - New York, while also northern, is typically south of Wisconsin


      Step 4: More specifically, Wisconsin zip codes (especially those starting with
      54) are in the northern part of Wisconsin, which is quite far north in the continental
      US.

      - New York zip codes in the 11xxx range are typically on Long Island, which
      is in the southern part of New York state.


      Based on the general geography of the United States, a location in New York
      (especially on Long Island) would be south of a location in northern Wisconsin.


      NO


      Wait, I need to verify my answer. Let me reconsider:


      New York is east of Wisconsin, but the question is about north-south positioning.
      Wisconsin is generally north of New York state, especially when comparing northern
      Wisconsin (54xxx) to Long Island, NY (11xxx). Therefore, 11767, NY would be
      south of 54180, WI.

      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 32818 is in Florida (FL)

      - 35951 is in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Florida is located south of Alabama on the US map.

      - Alabama borders Florida to the north.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code patterns.

      - US zip codes generally follow patterns where lower numbers tend to be in the
      eastern and southern parts of the country.

      - The first digit "3" indicates both are in the southeastern region.

      - Within the same first digit, the second digit often indicates more specific
      regions.


      Step 4: Analyze the specific zip codes.

      - 32818 (FL) starts with "32", which is assigned to central Florida.

      - 35951 (AL) starts with "35", which is assigned to northern/central Alabama.


      Since Florida is entirely south of Alabama, and these zip codes follow the standard
      geographical distribution pattern, any location in Florida (including 32818)
      would be south of any location in Alabama (including 35951).

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Florida and Alabama.

      Florida is located south of Alabama. Alabama borders Florida on Florida''s northern
      border.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      The numbering of US zip codes generally follows a pattern where lower numbers

      - 35951 starts with "35", which is used for parts of Alabama


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Florida is south of Alabama, and these zip codes follow the standard pattern

      - 32818 is in Florida (FL)

      - 35951 is in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Florida and Alabama.

      - Florida is located south of Alabama in the United States.

      - Alabama borders Florida to the north.


      Step 3: Check the specific zip codes.

      - 32818 is in Orlando, Florida, which is in central Florida.

      - 35951 is in Alabama, and Alabama zip codes in the 359xx range are typically
      in the northern part of the state.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since Florida is entirely south of Alabama, and 32818 is in Florida while
      35951 is in Alabama, the Florida zip code must be south of the Alabama zip code.


      NO, wait. I need to be more precise. Let me verify:

      1) 32092 is a zip code in Florida (FL), while 27704 is a zip code in North Carolina
      (NC).


      2) Florida is a state that is located south of North Carolina on the US East
      Coast. The entire state of Florida is geographically south of North Carolina.


      3) Since 32092 is in Florida and 27704 is in North Carolina, and Florida is
      south of North Carolina, it follows that zip code 32092, FL must be south of
      zip code 27704, NC.

      To determine if one zip code is south of another, I need to compare their geographical
      locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 32092 is in Florida (FL)

      - 27704 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Florida is located at the southeastern corner of the United States

      - North Carolina is on the eastern seaboard, but further north than Florida


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Florida''s northern border is south of North Carolina''s southern border

      - Any location in Florida must therefore be south of any location in North Carolina


      Step 4: Specific zip codes don''t change this relationship.

      - Since 32092 is in Florida and 27704 is in North Carolina, the Florida zip
      code must be south of the North Carolina zip code

      - 75024 (in TX) is in the Texas numbering range.

      - Since Oklahoma is north of Texas, and these ZIP codes follow the standard
      geographical pattern, 75024 in TX would be south of 74104 in OK.


      YES, 75024, TX is located south of 74104, OK.'
    8edcb596-0855-47f6-be99-e95a51a72d69: 'I need to determine if 75024, TX is located
      south of 74104, OK.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      - 75024 is a ZIP code in Texas (TX)

      - 74104 is a ZIP code in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and Oklahoma.

      - Oklahoma is directly north of Texas along their shared border.


      Step 3: Look at the ZIP code patterns.

      - In the US postal system, ZIP codes generally increase from north to south
      within regions.

      - 75024 (in TX) has a higher number than 74104 (in OK).

      - This suggests 75024 is further south than 74104.


      Step 4: Verify based on state locations.

      - Since 75024 is in Texas, which is south of Oklahoma, and 74104 is in Oklahoma,
      the ZIP code 75024 must be south of 74104.


      NO


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me correct myself:


      ZIP codes don''t consistently increase from north to south across state boundaries.
      The first digit indicates a broad region, but beyond that, there isn''t a strict
      north-south pattern between states.


      What we do know for certain is that 75024 is in Texas and 74104 is in Oklahoma.
      Since Texas is geographically south of Oklahoma, any location in Texas (including
      75024) would be south of any location in Oklahoma (including 74104).


      YES'

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central region of the United States

      - New York is located in the northeastern region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare latitudes (north-south positioning).

      - States in the northeastern US (like New York) are generally at higher latitudes
      (more northern)

      - States in the south-central US (like Oklahoma) are generally at lower latitudes
      (more southern)


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Oklahoma is south of New York in terms of latitude, a zip code in Oklahoma

      - 33025 is in Florida (FL)

      - 36869 is in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Florida and Alabama.

      - Florida is located south of Alabama in the United States.

      - Alabama''s southern border connects with Florida''s northern panhandle.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      - While zip codes aren''t perfectly sequential by latitude, Florida zip codes
      generally start with 32-34, with lower numbers in the north and higher in the
      south.

      - Alabama zip codes generally start with 35-36, with 36xxx often being in the
      southern part of Alabama.


      Step 4: Specifically for these zip codes:

      - 33025 is in Hollywood, Florida (in the southern part of Florida near Miami)

      - 36869 is in Phenix City, Alabama (in the eastern part of Alabama near the
      Georgia border)


      Step 5: Compare their relative positions.

      - Hollywood, FL (33025) is significantly south of Phenix City, AL (36869)

      - Florida''s southern location places virtually all of its zip codes south of
      Alabama


      YES, 33025, FL is located south of 36869, AL.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 61104 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 98310 is in Washington (WA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Washington is in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Washington state is located in the northernmost part of the contiguous United
      States, bordering Canada

      - Illinois is located much further south in the central United States


      Step 4: Make the specific comparison.

      - Any location in Illinois (including 61104) would be south of most locations
      in Washington state

      - 98310 in Washington would be north of 61104 in Illinois

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 39350 is in Mississippi (MS)

      - 27896 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic locations of these states.

      - Mississippi is located in the southern United States, along the Gulf of Mexico

      - North Carolina is located on the eastern seaboard, north of South Carolina
      and south of Virginia


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Mississippi is generally located west and south of North Carolina

      - North Carolina is positioned further north than Mississippi


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Mississippi is geographically south of North Carolina, and zip codes within
      these states follow this general positioning, 39350, MS would be south of 27896,
      NC.

      if 25601, WV is located south of 49445, MI.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 25601 is in West Virginia (WV)

      - 49445 is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - West Virginia is located in the Appalachian region of the eastern United States.

      - Michigan is located in the Great Lakes region of the northern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Michigan is significantly further north than West Virginia.

      - West Virginia is positioned south of Michigan.


      Step 4: While specific zip codes within states could potentially change this
      relationship, the north-south difference between Michigan and West Virginia
      is substantial enough that any zip code in West Virginia would be south of any
      zip code in Michigan.
