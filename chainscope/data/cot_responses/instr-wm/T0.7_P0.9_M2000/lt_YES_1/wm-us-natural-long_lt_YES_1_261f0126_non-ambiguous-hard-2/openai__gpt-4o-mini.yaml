      3. **Geographical Orientation**: To compare their locations, we can visualize
      or map the United States. California is located on the West Coast, while Iowa
      is situated in the Midwest, towards the east of California.


      4. **Relative Position**: Since California is to the west of Iowa, and Bristol
      Lake is in California, it is inherently to the west of any location in Iowa,
      including West Okoboji Lake.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:


      YES.'

      locations of both places.


      1. **Location of Funeral Mountains, NV**: The Funeral Mountains are located
      in Death Valley National Park in Nevada, which is situated in the eastern part
      of California and the western part of Nevada.


      2. **Location of White Oak Lake State Park, AR**: White Oak Lake State Park
