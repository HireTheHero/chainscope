      of both.


      1. **Suisun Bay, CA**: Suisun Bay is located in the state of California, on
      the western coast of the United States. Specifically, it is situated near the
      city of Fairfield, California, which is in the northern part of the state but
      still along the coast.


      2. **Mosquito Range, CO**: The Mosquito Range is a mountain range located in
      the state of Colorado. Colorado is a landlocked state in the western United
      States but is considered part of the Mountain States, situated east of California.


      Given these locations:

      - California is on the western edge of the United States.

      - Colorado is landlocked and east of California.


      Therefore, any location in California, including Suisun Bay, is west of any
      location in Colorado, including the Mosquito Range.

      2. **Location of Shinall Mountain, AR**: Shinall Mountain is located in Arkansas.
      Arkansas is situated in the southern United States, more specifically in the
      southeastern part of the country but is considered part of both the South and
      the Midwest by some definitions. It is east of the Rocky Mountains and significantly
      east of Montana.


      3. **Comparison**: Given that Montana is in the northwest and Arkansas is in
      the southeast, we can infer that the Bitterroot Range in Montana is west of
      Shinall Mountain in Arkansas. The general geography of the United States places
      the Rocky Mountains (where the Bitterroot Range is located) to the west of the
      regions where Arkansas is situated.


      Based on these steps, the Bitterroot Range in Montana is indeed located west
      of Shinall Mountain in Arkansas.

    5acba837-2647-4867-a45f-f75571561055: 'To determine if Big Sandy Lake, MN is located
      west of West Caroga Lake, NY, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Big Sandy Lake is located in Minnesota (MN),
      and West Caroga Lake is located in New York (NY).


      2. **Understand the geography of the United States**: Minnesota is in the north-central
      United States, often considered part of the Midwest, while New York is in the
      northeastern United States.


      3. **Determine general directional relationships**: Generally, moving from New
      York to Minnesota, you would be moving westward because New York is east of
      Minnesota.


      4. **Consider specific locations**: Without needing the exact longitudes, knowing
      that Minnesota is west of New York State in general terms allows us to infer
      directional relationships between locations within these states.


      Based on these steps, since Minnesota is west of New York, any location in Minnesota
      (like Big Sandy Lake) would be west of any location in New York (like West Caroga
      Lake).


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'
    65609bf0-6f79-4780-be3e-ca42fa6997b9: 'To answer this question, we need to follow
      a few steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Big Sandy
      Lake, MN, and West Caroga Lake, NY. Big Sandy Lake is located in Minnesota,
      and West Caroga Lake is located in New York.


      2. **Determine General Geographic Locations**: Minnesota is in the Midwestern
      United States, which places it in the central part of the northern U.S. New
      York, where West Caroga Lake is located, is in the Northeastern United States.


      3. **Compare Longitudes**: To determine if one location is west of the other,
      we need to compare their longitudes. Generally, the farther west a location
      is, the larger its longitude (in terms of negative values, since we''re dealing
      with the Western Hemisphere). Minnesota''s longitude is roughly around -93 to
      -97 degrees west, while New York''s is approximately -73 to -79 degrees west.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Minnesota is significantly farther west than New York
      based on their general geographic locations and longitudes, any point in Minnesota,
      including Big Sandy Lake, would be west of any point in New York, including
      West Caroga Lake.

      1. **Location of Calapooya Mountains, OR**: The Calapooya Mountains are located
      in the U.S. state of Oregon. Oregon is in the Pacific Northwest region of the
      United States, which is in the northwestern part of the country, bordering the
      Pacific Ocean to the west.

      part of the country but is located south of Oregon.

      of the United States, the southeastern states (like Florida) are generally south
      and slightly west of the northeastern states (like New Hampshire). However,
      the primary distinction here is the north-south axis rather than the east-west
      axis because New Hampshire is significantly north of Florida.


      5. **Conclusion based on geography**: Given that New Hampshire is northeast
      and Florida is southeast, Florida (and Lake DeFuniak) is indeed west of New
      Hampshire (and Lake Sunapee) when considering their longitudinal positions (east-west
      positioning), even though the more pronounced difference is their latitudinal
      positions (north-south).


      The final answer is: YES'
    cb75cee6-943d-401c-98e3-38e02af9b6ff: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Lake DeFuniak is located in Florida (FL), and
      Lake Sunapee is located in New Hampshire (NH).


      2. **Understand the geography of the United States**: Florida is in the southeastern
      part of the United States, while New Hampshire is in the northeastern part.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Since Florida is to the southeast and New Hampshire
      is to the northeast, we need to determine the relative east-west positions of
      these two states.


      4. **East-west comparison**: New Hampshire is east of Florida because it is
      part of the Northeast, which is directly east of the Southeast where Florida
      is located.


      5. **Apply to the lakes**: Given that Lake Sunapee is in New Hampshire and Lake
      DeFuniak is in Florida, and knowing that New Hampshire is east of Florida, we
      can conclude that Lake DeFuniak is west of Lake Sunapee.


      The final answer is: YES'
    e57bf57d-13cf-40c4-9964-8c275db2434e: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Lake DeFuniak is located in Florida (FL), and
      Lake Sunapee is located in New Hampshire (NH).


      2. **Understand the geography of the United States**: Florida is located in
      the southeastern part of the United States, while New Hampshire is located in
      the northeastern part of the United States.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Since Florida is to the south and New Hampshire
      is to the north, we need to consider their relative positions from east to west
      as well. Florida is generally east of the majority of the United States, given
      its eastern coastal position. New Hampshire, while also eastern, is directly
      east of the Great Lakes and north of New York, which places it in a more northeastern
      position rather than being directly west or east of Florida in a straightforward
      manner.


      4. **Consider the general geography from east to west**: The United States goes
      from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean (west). Florida is on the
      Atlantic coast, and its western parts are still east of most of the continental
      United States. New Hampshire is also on the Atlantic coast but much farther
      north.


      5. **Conclusion based on geography**: Since both lakes are on the eastern side
      of the United States (with Lake DeFuniak being more southeast and Lake Sunapee
      being more northeast), we need to determine their relative east-west positions.
      Given that Florida extends westward into the panhandle but remains east of the
      Mississippi River and the bulk of the U.S. landmass, and New Hampshire is directly
      adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean in the northeast, Lake DeFuniak (in Florida)
      would indeed be south and potentially west or more accurately, southwest of
      Lake Sunapee (in New Hampshire), considering the overall geography.


      However, the question asks if Lake DeFuniak is **west** of Lake Sunapee. Given
      the general east-west line across the U.S., Lake DeFuniak, being in Florida
      and thus more to the southeast, would generally be south and slightly west or
      more accurately described as southwest in relation to the northeastern position
      of Lake Sunapee in New Hampshire.


      Given this analysis, and focusing strictly on the east-west axis as the question
      implies, Lake DeFuniak is indeed to the west of Lake Sunapee when considering
      their longitudinal positions (with Lake Sunapee being at a higher latitude and
      longitude that places it east of Lake DeFuniak''s longitude).


      The final answer is: YES'

      locations of both.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Williams Lake is in New Mexico, which is in the
      southwestern United States. Hubbard Lake is in Michigan, which is in the northern
      United States, in the Great Lakes region.


      2. **Determine the general direction**: New Mexico is generally west of Michigan.
      The United States is laid out in such a way that moving from the east coast
      to the west coast means moving westward. Michigan is closer to the eastern part
      of the United States, while New Mexico is closer to the western part.


      3. **Consider the specific locations within their states**: Without needing
      the exact longitudes, we know that New Mexico is a western state and Michigan
      is more eastern. The specific locations of Williams Lake in New Mexico and Hubbard
      Lake in Michigan do not change the overall east-west relationship between the
      two states.


      Given these considerations, since New Mexico (where Williams Lake is located)
