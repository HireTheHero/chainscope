      1. First, let me recall the general geography of these states:

      - Kentucky (KY) is in the southeastern US

      - New Hampshire (NH) is in the northeastern US


      2. More specifically:

      - Kentucky is west of New Hampshire

      - Any location in Kentucky will be west of any location in New Hampshire


      3. Therefore:

      - Lake Linville in Kentucky must be west of the Sandwich Range in New Hampshire,

      - Sierra Madre Range is in south-central Wyoming

      - Misquah Hills are in northeastern Minnesota


      2) Now, let''s consider their relative positions:

      - Wyoming is west of Minnesota

      - Since Sierra Madre Range is in Wyoming and Misquah Hills are in Minnesota,
      Sierra Madre Range must be west of Misquah Hills


      3) This is a straightforward case of relative state positions - anything in
      Wyoming will be west of anything in Minnesota due to their geographic positions.

      1) First, let me recall the general locations:

      - Ouachita Mountains are in western Arkansas (and eastern Oklahoma)

      - Mount Monroe is in New Hampshire, in the northeastern United States


      2) To determine which is further west, I need to consider their relative positions:

      - Arkansas is in the south-central United States

      - New Hampshire is on the East Coast


      3) Any location in Arkansas will be significantly west of any location in New
      Hampshire, since Arkansas is several states west of the East Coast.


      4) Therefore, the Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas must be west of Mount Monroe
      in New Hampshire.

      - Nevada is significantly west of Texas

      - Nevada is roughly 2-3 states west of Texas


      3) Therefore, since:

      - Walker Lake is in western Nevada

      - And Nevada is well west of Texas

      - Then Walker Lake must be west of any point in Texas, including the Guadalupe
      Mountains


      YES, Walker Lake (Nevada) is located west of Guadalupe Mountains (Texas).'
