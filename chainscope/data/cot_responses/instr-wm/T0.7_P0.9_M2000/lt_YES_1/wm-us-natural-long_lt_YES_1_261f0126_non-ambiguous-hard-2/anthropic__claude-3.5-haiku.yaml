      1. Locate Temblor Range, CA:

      - The Temblor Range is located in central California

      - Specifically, it is in San Luis Obispo and Kern Counties

      - It is west of the San Joaquin Valley


      2. Locate Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO:

      - The Sangre de Cristo Mountains are located in southern Colorado

      - They run north-south through Colorado


      3. Compare their geographic positions:

      - Temblor Range is in California (west coast)

      - Sangre de Cristo Mountains are in Colorado (interior western US)

      - Colorado is east of California

      - The Strait of Georgia is located between Vancouver Island and the mainland
      of British Columbia, Canada

      - It is in the Pacific Northwest region

      - Specifically, it is in Washington state (WA)


      2. Next, let''s locate the Park Range:

      - The Park Range is a mountain range located in Colorado (CO)

      - It is in the central part of Colorado


      3. Consider their geographic positions:

      - The Strait of Georgia is in the northwest of North America (Washington/British
      Columbia)

      - The Park Range is in the central part of the United States (Colorado)

      - These locations are quite far apart, in different regions of the continent


      4. Determine their relative positions:

      - The Strait of Georgia is west of the Park Range

      - This is because the Strait of Georgia is on the Pacific coast, while the Park
      Range is inland in Colorado


      5. Conclusion:

      - The Strait of Georgia is indeed west of the Park Range


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      - It is west of Portland, in the northwestern part of Oregon


      2. Next, locate Christmas Mountains, TX:

      - The Christmas Mountains are located in Brewster County, Texas

      - They are in the far western part of Texas, near Big Bend National Park


      3. Compare the geographical locations:

      - Henry Hagg Lake is in northwestern Oregon

      - Christmas Mountains are in far western Texas

      - These locations are in completely different states and regions of the United
      States


      4. Determine relative positioning:

      - Oregon is west of Texas

      - Henry Hagg Lake''s specific location is much further west than the Christmas
      Mountains


      5. Conclusion:

      - Since Henry Hagg Lake is in Oregon (which is west of Texas), and the lake
      itself is in northwestern Oregon, it is definitively west of the Christmas Mountains.

      1. First, I''ll locate American Lake in Washington state

      2. Then, I''ll locate the Never Summer Mountains in Colorado

      3. I''ll determine their relative geographic positions


      Step 1: American Lake is located in Pierce County, Washington state, near Mount
      Rainier.


      Step 2: The Never Summer Mountains are located in Rocky Mountain National Park
      in northern Colorado.


      Step 3: These locations are in completely different states - Washington is in
      the Pacific Northwest, while Colorado is in the Rocky Mountain region of the
      western United States.


      Comparing their locations on a map, Washington is west of Colorado. However,
      the question asks if American Lake specifically is west of the Never Summer
      Mountains.


      Since American Lake is located in Washington and the Never Summer Mountains
      are in Colorado, and Washington is west of Colorado, the answer is:


      YES'

      1. First, let''s locate Calapooya Mountains:

      - The Calapooya Mountains are located in western Oregon, specifically in the
      western part of the Cascade Range.

      - They are situated in western Oregon, west of the Willamette Valley.


      2. Next, let''s locate Luna Lake:

      - Luna Lake is located in Arizona, in the eastern part of the state.


      3. Comparing their geographical locations:

      - Calapooya Mountains are in western Oregon

      - Luna Lake is in Arizona

      - These are in completely different states, with Oregon being west of Arizona


      4. Reasoning about their relative positions:

      - Since Calapooya Mountains are in Oregon (west of Arizona) and Luna Lake is
      in Arizona, the Calapooya Mountains would indeed be west of Luna Lake.


      5. Conclusion:

      The Calapooya Mountains are located west of Luna Lake.

      2. Next, let''s locate the Magdalena Mountains, NM:

      - The Magdalena Mountains are located in central New Mexico

      - They are situated in the southwestern part of the United States


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Boundary Bay is in the northwest of the United States

      - The Magdalena Mountains are in the southwest of the United States

      - These locations are quite far apart


      4. Determining relative position:

      - Northwest (Boundary Bay) is west of southwest (Magdalena Mountains)

      - This means Boundary Bay is indeed west of the Magdalena Mountains


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      - It''s in the eastern part of Wisconsin


      3. Comparing their geographic positions

      - Bear Canyon Lake is in Arizona (southwest US)

      - Green Lake is in Wisconsin (midwest US)

      - Arizona is west of Wisconsin


      4. Therefore, Bear Canyon Lake is indeed west of Green Lake.


      The answer is: YES.'
