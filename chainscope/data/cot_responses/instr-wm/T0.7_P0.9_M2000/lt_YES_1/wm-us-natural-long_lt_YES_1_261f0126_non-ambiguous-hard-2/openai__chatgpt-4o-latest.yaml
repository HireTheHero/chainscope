      longitudes of both locations.


      **Step 1: Identify the location of Alice Lake (Sawtooth Wilderness), Idaho.**

      - Alice Lake is located in the Sawtooth Wilderness, which is in central Idaho.

      - Idaho is a western state in the United States.


      **Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Osakis, Minnesota.**

      - Lake Osakis is located in central Minnesota.

      - Minnesota is in the Upper Midwest region of the United States, to the east
      of Idaho.


      **Step 3: Consider the relative longitudes.**

      - Idaho lies significantly west of Minnesota.

      - Therefore, Alice Lake, being in Idaho, is west of Lake Osakis, which is in
      Minnesota.


      **Conclusion:**

      Since Idaho is west of Minnesota, Alice Lake is west of Lake Osakis.

      is located west of Spednic Lake in Maine, we need to consider their geographic
      positions in terms of longitude.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Lake Noquebay, Wisconsin.

      - Lake Noquebay is located in northeastern Wisconsin, in Marinette County.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Spednic Lake, Maine.

      - Spednic Lake is located in eastern Maine, near the border with Canada (New
      Brunswick).


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes.

      - Wisconsin is part of the Midwest and is generally west of Maine.

      - Maine is the easternmost state in the continental U.S.

      - Therefore, any location in Wisconsin, including Lake Noquebay, will be farther
      west than any location in Maine, including Spednic Lake.


      Conclusion: Since Wisconsin is west of Maine, Lake Noquebay is west of Spednic
      Lake.

      3. **Use approximate longitudes for confirmation:**\n   - Quake Lake: approximately\
      \ 111.3\xB0W longitude.\n   - Lake Bemidji: approximately 94.9\xB0W longitude.\n\
      \n4. **Compare the longitudes:**\n   - Since 111.3\xB0W is farther west than\
      \ 94.9\xB0W, Quake Lake is indeed west of Lake Bemidji.\n\n**Answer: YES**."
    e987089e-6256-46a2-8f1c-8a757869b0bc: "To determine whether Quake Lake, MT is\
      \ located west of Lake Bemidji, MN, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify\
      \ the Location of Quake Lake, MT**:\n   - Quake Lake, also known as Earthquake\
      \ Lake, is located in southwestern Montana.\n   - It was formed by a landslide\
      \ caused by an earthquake in 1959.\n   - It is near Yellowstone National Park,\
      \ which is in the western part of the state.\n\n2. **Identify the Location of\
      \ Lake Bemidji, MN**:\n   - Lake Bemidji is in northern Minnesota.\n   - It's\
      \ located near the city of Bemidji, which is in north-central Minnesota.\n\n\
      3. **Compare the Longitudes**:\n   - Montana is generally located west of Minnesota.\n\
      \   - Specifically, southwestern Montana (where Quake Lake is) is significantly\
      \ west of north-central Minnesota (where Lake Bemidji is).\n   - Longitudinally,\
      \ Quake Lake is around 111\xB0W.\n   - Lake Bemidji is around 94.9\xB0W.\n\n\
      Since 111\xB0W (Quake Lake) is clearly west of 94.9\xB0W (Lake Bemidji), the\
      \ answer is:\n\n**YES**."
