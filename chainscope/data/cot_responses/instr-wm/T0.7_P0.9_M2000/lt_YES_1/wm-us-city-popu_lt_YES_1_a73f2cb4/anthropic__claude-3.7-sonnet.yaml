      Step 1: Let me find the population of Dorr, MI.

      Dorr is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Allegan County,
      Michigan. According to census data, Dorr has a population of approximately 2,000-2,500
      people.


      Step 2: Let me find the population of County Center, VA.

      I need to search for information about County Center, VA. However, County Center
      doesn''t appear to be a well-known census-designated place in Virginia. In fact,
      it may not be an officially recognized community with population statistics,
      or it might be extremely small.


      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      Since Dorr, MI has a documented population of around 2,000-2,500 people, and
      County Center, VA appears to be either extremely small or not officially tracked
      in census data, it''s reasonable to conclude that Dorr, MI has a larger population.


      NO, Dorr, MI is not less populous than County Center, VA. Dorr appears to have
      a larger population.'

      Step 1: I need to find the population of Dorr, Michigan.

      Dorr is a small township in Allegan County, Michigan. Based on my knowledge,
      Dorr Township has a population of approximately 7,000-8,000 people.


      Step 2: I need to find the population of County Center, Virginia.

      This is challenging because "County Center" is not a well-known incorporated
      place in Virginia. In fact, it appears to be either an unincorporated community
      or a census-designated place (CDP) with a very small population, likely under
      1,000 people.


      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      Dorr Township, MI has a population of several thousand people, while County
      Center, VA appears to be a much smaller community with a population likely in
      the hundreds.


      Step 4: Make a determination.

      Based on this information, Dorr, MI is more populous than County Center, VA.

      a traditional city or town.


      Step 2: Military bases don''t typically have standard "population" figures like

      Step 4: Based on available information, Willis, TX has a population of approximately
      6,000-7,000 residents.


      Step 5: Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor has several thousand military and civilian
      personnel, but the exact residential population would depend on how it''s counted.


      Step 6: Comparing the two, Willis, TX is likely more populous than Bangor Base

      Bangor Base appears to be referring to Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor, a U.S. Navy
      submarine base located near Silverdale, Washington.


      Step 2: Determine the population of Bangor Base, WA.

      As a military installation, it doesn''t have a traditional "city population"

      Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor is not a city but a military installation. Its population
      would be counted as part of the military personnel and their dependents living
      on base, which is typically in the thousands.


      Willis, TX had a population of approximately 6,800 as of recent estimates.
