      1. I need to find and compare the populations of these two Maryland locations.


      2. Paramount-Long Meadow is an unincorporated community in Washington County,
      Maryland.

      - It''s a very small community

      - Population estimates are around a few hundred people


      3. Aberdeen Proving Ground is a U.S. Army facility and census-designated place
      in Harford County, Maryland

      - As a major military installation, it has a significant population

      - The resident population is approximately 3,000-4,000 people


      4. Comparing the two:

      - Paramount-Long Meadow: ~few hundred

      - Aberdeen Proving Ground: ~3,000-4,000


      5. Since Aberdeen Proving Ground has several thousand residents compared to
      just a few hundred in Paramount-Long Meadow, Aberdeen Proving Ground is more
      populous.

      3. Now I can compare:

      * Bealeton: 4,435

      * Pinetop-Lakeside: 4,282

      * 4,435 > 4,282


      Since Bealeton has a larger population than Pinetop-Lakeside, it is NOT less
      populous.

      - Capitan, NM is a small village in Lincoln County

      - Population is approximately 1,400 people


      2. Next, I need to find population data for Rouse, CA

      - I''m actually unable to find a place called Rouse, CA

      - It either doesn''t exist or is too small to have reliable population data


      3. Reasoning:

      - Since one location exists with known population (Capitan)

      - And the other location (Rouse) either doesn''t exist or is essentially unpopulated

      - Any populated place would be larger than a non-existent/unpopulated place


      NO (Capitan, NM is NOT less populous than Rouse, CA)'
