      1. **Tubac, AZ**: Tubac is a census-designated place (CDP) in Santa Cruz County,
      Arizona. As a small community, its population is relatively low. According to
      the 2020 U.S. Census, the population of Tubac was approximately 1,191.


      2. **Brickerville, PA**: Brickerville is an unincorporated community in Lancaster
      County, Pennsylvania. Being unincorporated, it does not have a formal population
      count like incorporated cities or towns. As such, specific population figures
      are not readily available, but it is generally considered a small community
      within Warwick Township.


      Considering these points, Tubac has a known population of about 1,191, whereas
      Brickerville, being unincorporated, does not have a specific population count
      but is likely to be smaller or comparable in size to Tubac due to its unincorporated
      nature and geographical context.


      Thus, based on available data and typical characteristics of such communities,
      we would assume:


      YES, Tubac, AZ is less populous than Brickerville, PA.'

      populous than Brickerville, PA, let''s break down the steps involved:


      1. **Identify the Populations**: We need to find the population of Tubac, AZ
      and Brickerville, PA.


      2. **Research Tubac, AZ**: Tubac is a census-designated place (CDP) in Arizona.
      According to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau, Tubac has a population
      of a few thousand people.


      3. **Research Brickerville, PA**: Brickerville is an unincorporated community
      in Pennsylvania. As an unincorporated community, it does not have a defined
      population count like a city or town. However, it is part of a larger township
      and is generally considered small.


      4. **Comparison**: Typically, small unincorporated communities like Brickerville
      have smaller populations compared to census-designated places.


      Based on these steps, it is likely that Tubac, AZ, with its status as a CDP,
      has a larger population than Brickerville, PA, an unincorporated community.

      1. **Tubac, AZ**: Tubac is a census-designated place (CDP) in Santa Cruz County,
      Arizona. It is known for its art colony and historic significance. As a CDP,
      its population is relatively small. According to recent estimates, its population
      is generally a few thousand people.


      2. **Brickerville, PA**: Brickerville is an unincorporated community in Lancaster
      County, Pennsylvania. As an unincorporated community, it is not tracked by the
      U.S. Census Bureau as a standalone entity, unlike Tubac which is a CDP. This
      makes it challenging to find specific population data for Brickerville. However,
      unincorporated communities like Brickerville typically have smaller populations

      Based on these points, Tubac, AZ, having a population in the range of a few
      thousand, is likely more populous than Brickerville, PA, which is an unincorporated

      1. **Walla Walla East, WA**: This is a census-designated place in Washington
      state. Its population is relatively small, especially compared to larger cities
      or towns.


      2. **Tracy City, TN**: This is a town in Tennessee. Tracy City is also relatively

      places like Walla Walla East, WA tend to have smaller populations than towns
      like Tracy City, TN.

      community in Harford County, Maryland. As it is not incorporated, detailed population
      statistics like those for cities might not be readily available. However, the
      population size is typically small, likely in the range of a few thousand residents.


      2. **Identify the population of Refugio, TX:** Refugio is a town in Refugio
      County, Texas. According to the most recent data available, Refugio has a population
      of approximately 2,500 to 3,000 residents.
