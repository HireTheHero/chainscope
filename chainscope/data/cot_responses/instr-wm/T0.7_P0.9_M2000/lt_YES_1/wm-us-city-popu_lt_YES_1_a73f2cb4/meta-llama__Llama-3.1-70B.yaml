      1. **Identify the Population of Landover, MD**: According to the 2020 United
      States Census, the population of Landover, Maryland, is approximately 23,078.


      2. **Identify the Population of White Bear Lake, MN**: The 2020 United States
      Census reports the population of White Bear Lake, Minnesota, to be around 24,883.


      3. **Compare the Populations**: Now, we compare the populations of Landover,
      MD (23,078) and White Bear Lake, MN (24,883).


      4. **Conclusion**: Since 23,078 (Landover, MD) is less than 24,883 (White Bear
      Lake, MN), we can conclude that Landover, MD is indeed less populous than White
      Bear Lake, MN.
