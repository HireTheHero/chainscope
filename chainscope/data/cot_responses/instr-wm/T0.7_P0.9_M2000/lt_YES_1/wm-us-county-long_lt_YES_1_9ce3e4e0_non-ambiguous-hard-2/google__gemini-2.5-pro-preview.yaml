      1.  **Locate Hood River County, OR:** Hood River County is in the northern part
      of Oregon, along the Columbia River. Oregon is a Pacific Coast state, meaning
      it''s on the western edge of the contiguous United States.


      2.  **Locate Winkler County, TX:** Winkler County is in West Texas, relatively
      close to the border with New Mexico.


      3.  **Compare their east-west positions:** Oregon, as a whole, is significantly
      further west than Texas. Even West Texas is considerably east of any part of
      Oregon.

      1.  **Locate Oregon (OR) on a map of the USA.** Oregon is on the Pacific coast,
      in the western part of the country.

      2.  **Locate Hood River County within Oregon.** Hood River County is in northern
      Oregon, along the Columbia River. Its general position is therefore in the western
