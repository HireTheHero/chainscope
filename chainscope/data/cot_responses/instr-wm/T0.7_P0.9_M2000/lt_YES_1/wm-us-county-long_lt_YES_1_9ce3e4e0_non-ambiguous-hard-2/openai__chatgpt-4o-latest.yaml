      located in the central United States, and Bates County is near the border with
      Kansas.

      to understand the relative geographical positions of these two counties.


      Step 1: Locate Hickman County, Tennessee.

      - Hickman County is located in central Tennessee. Tennessee is in the southeastern
      region of the United States.


      Step 2: Locate Fall River County, South Dakota.

      - Fall River County is located in the southwestern corner of South Dakota. South
      Dakota is in the north-central part of the United States, part of the Great
      Plains region.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes.

      - Tennessee is generally east of the Mississippi River.

      - South Dakota is west of the Mississippi River.

      - Specifically, Fall River County, SD is located close to the Wyoming border,
      which is far west compared to central Tennessee.

      the geographical locations of both counties in terms of longitude.


      Step 1: Identify the general location of each county within its state.

      - Gregory County is in the south-central part of South Dakota.

      - Terrell County is in the southwestern part of Georgia.


      Step 2: Understand the general east-west positioning of the two states.

      - South Dakota is located in the north-central region of the United States.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern region of the United States.


      Step 3: Consider the longitudinal positions.

      - South Dakota as a whole lies west of Georgia.

      - Therefore, any county in South Dakota, including Gregory County, would be

      is located west of Jewell County, KS, we need to consider their geographic locations
      in the United States.


      1. Kittitas County is in the state of Washington. Washington is located in the
      Pacific Northwest region of the United States, which is on the western side
      of the country.


      2. Jewell County is in the state of Kansas. Kansas is located in the central
      part of the United States, specifically in the Midwest.


      3. Since Washington is west of Kansas in general, and Kittitas County is not
      on the far eastern edge of Washington, it''s safe to say Kittitas County is
      located well into the western half of the country.


      4. Jewell County is situated in north-central Kansas, which is significantly
      farther east than any part of Washington.


      Therefore, based on the general geographical orientation of these counties within
      their respective states and the states'' positions within the U.S., Kittitas
      County, WA is located west of Jewell County, KS.

      1. Identify the general geographical locations of both counties within the United
      States.

      2. Compare their longitudinal positions, since longitude determines east-west
      positioning.


      Step 1: Location of Otsego County, NY:

      - Otsego County is located in central New York state.

      - New York is in the northeastern part of the United States.


      Step 2: Location of Karnes County, TX:

      - Karnes County is located in southern Texas.

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the United States, and Karnes County
      is southeast of San Antonio.


      Step 3: Compare longitudes:

      - Otsego County, NY is roughly around 75-76 degrees West longitude.

      - Karnes County, TX is roughly around 97-98 degrees West longitude.


      Since higher degrees west indicate a location farther west, Karnes County, TX

      is located west of Ionia County, MI, we need to compare their geographic locations
      in terms of longitude.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Ionia County, Michigan.

      - Ionia County is located in the lower peninsula of Michigan, in the central
      part of the state. Michigan is in the eastern part of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Tillman County, Oklahoma.

      - Tillman County is located in the southwestern part of Oklahoma, which is in
      the south-central region of the United States.

      (NE) is located west of Mercer County, New Jersey (NJ), we need to compare their
      geographic locations in terms of longitude.


      Step 1: Identify the general geographic region of each county.


      - Sarpy County is in the state of Nebraska, which is located in the central
      United States.

      - Mercer County is in the state of New Jersey, which is located in the northeastern
      United States.


      Step 2: Understand the relative positions of Nebraska and New Jersey.


      - Nebraska is west of New Jersey. The entire state of Nebraska lies west of
      the entire state of New Jersey.


      Step 3: Confirm that Sarpy County is not on the extreme eastern edge of Nebraska,
      and Mercer County is not on the extreme western edge of New Jersey.


      - Sarpy County is in eastern Nebraska, near the city of Omaha.

      - Mercer County is in central New Jersey, including the city of Trenton.


      Even though Sarpy County is on the eastern side of Nebraska and Mercer County
      is in central New Jersey, Nebraska as a whole is much farther west than New
      Jersey.


      Therefore, Sarpy County, NE is located west of Mercer County, NJ.


      Answer: YES.'
