    0572dd94-3343-4f37-b91d-0e6a8bfb31a4: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let me recall where these counties are located:

      - Calaveras County is in California, in the Sierra Nevada region

      - Hudspeth County is in far west Texas, along the Mexican border


      2) Let me consider their relative positions:

      - California is entirely west of Texas

      3) Even though Rains County is in eastern Texas, any point in Texas is still
      going to be west of any point in New York due to their relative positions in
      the country.


      4) Therefore, Rains County, TX must be west of Oneida County, NY.

      1. First, I need to know roughly where these counties are located:

      - Bullock County is in Alabama, which is in the southeastern United States

      - Windsor County is in Vermont, which is in the northeastern United States


      2. To determine which is further west, I can think about the general geography:

      - Alabama is part of the Deep South, positioned much further west than New England

      - Vermont is part of New England, positioned near the eastern seaboard


      3. When comparing any point in Alabama to any point in Vermont:

      - Alabama locations will always be further west than Vermont locations

      - This is because the entire state of Alabama lies west of Vermont

      - Oklahoma is in the central part of the US

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern part of the US

      - Oklahoma is clearly west of Pennsylvania


      3) Since Coal County is in Oklahoma and Indiana County is in Pennsylvania, and
      Oklahoma is west of Pennsylvania, Coal County must be west of Indiana County.
