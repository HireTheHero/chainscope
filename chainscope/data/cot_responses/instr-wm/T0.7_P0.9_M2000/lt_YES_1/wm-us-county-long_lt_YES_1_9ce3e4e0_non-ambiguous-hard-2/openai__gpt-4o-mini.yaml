      of Montana. It is bordered by the Little Snowy Mountains to the west and is
      generally in the north-central region of the state.

      is located west of Crane County, TX, let''s analyze the geographic locations
      of both counties step by step.


      1. **Identify the Location of Shoshone County, ID**: Shoshone County is located
      in the northern part of Idaho. It is situated in the Pacific Northwest region
      of the United States.


      2. **Identify the Location of Crane County, TX**: Crane County is located in
      the western part of Texas, near the border with New Mexico.


      3. **Determine the Relative Position**: To find out if Shoshone County is west
      of Crane County, we need to consider their longitudes. Idaho is to the north
      of Texas, and while both counties are in the western United States, Idaho is
      further north than Texas.


      4. **Compare the Longitudes**: Shoshone County, ID is approximately at a longitude
      of around 115 degrees West, while Crane County, TX is at about 102 degrees West.
      Since 115 degrees West is further west than 102 degrees West, it indicates that

      is located west of Catawba County, NC, let''s analyze the locations of both
      counties.


      1. **Locate Pembina County, ND**: Pembina County is in the northeastern part
      of North Dakota, near the Canadian border.


      2. **Locate Catawba County, NC**: Catawba County is in the western part of North
      Carolina.

      3. **Geographical Orientation**: To establish whether Yavapai County is west
      of Rankin County, we need to consider their respective positions on a map of
      the United States. Arizona is situated to the west of Mississippi.


      4. **Determine Relative Position**: Since Arizona is west of Mississippi, and
      Yavapai County is within Arizona, it follows that Yavapai County is also west
      of Rankin County.

      OR is located west of Winkler County, TX, we need to look at the geographical
      locations of both counties.


      1. **Hood River County, OR**: This county is located in the northern part of
      Oregon, near the Columbia River Gorge. It is generally situated to the west
      of the Cascade Range and east of Portland.


      2. **Winkler County, TX**: This county is located in the western part of Texas,
      bordering New Mexico. It is situated in the Permian Basin region.


      Now, we need to establish their relative positions on a map:


      - Oregon is to the northwest of Texas.

      - Hood River County is in the northwestern part of Oregon.

      - Winkler County is in the far western part of Texas, but still further south
      compared to Hood River County.


      Given that Hood River County is located in the northwest of the United States
      and Winkler County is in the west of Texas but further south, we can conclude
      that:


      Hood River County, OR is indeed located to the west of Winkler County, TX.
