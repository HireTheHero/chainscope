    2de6f858-9dc1-42b6-ac1b-8beaa363a8c8: 'I''m going to try to answer this with a
      simple example:


      Suppose you have 2 points on a map. One is located at 30 degrees, 12 minutes,
      54 seconds north latitude, and the other is located at 70 degrees, 45 minutes,
      12 seconds west longitude.


      If you were to draw a line between the two points, you would end up with a line
      that goes through the point 30 degrees, 12 minutes, 54 seconds north latitude.


      This is because the line that goes through the point 70 degrees, 45 minutes,
      12 seconds west longitude is not a straight line, but a curve.


      So, the answer is NO. The line between the two points is not a straight line,
