      its counties typically have western longitudes.


      2. **Locate Gladwin County, MI:** Gladwin County is located in the central part

      1. **Location of Sarpy County, NE**: Sarpy County is located in the state of
      Nebraska. Nebraska is in the central part of the United States, generally considered
      part of the Midwest. Sarpy County is near Omaha, which is in the eastern part
      of Nebraska.
