      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of both counties.

      - Eddy County is in New Mexico (NM), which is in the southwestern United States.

      - Greenup County is in Kentucky (KY), which is in the eastern part of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west positioning of these states.

      - New Mexico is located in the western half of the continental United States.

      - Kentucky is located in the eastern half of the continental United States.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - States in the west (like New Mexico) are generally west of states in the east
      (like Kentucky).

      - Therefore, any county in New Mexico would be west of any county in Kentucky.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since Eddy County is in New Mexico and Greenup County is in Kentucky, Eddy
      County must be west of Greenup County.


      YES, Eddy County, NM is located west of Greenup County, KY.'

      - Ontonagon County is located in Michigan (MI), which is in the northern part
      of the Midwest.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions east-west.

      - Texas is generally located in the south-central part of the United States.

      - Michigan is in the Great Lakes region in the eastern part of the Midwest.

      - On a west-east axis, Texas is positioned to the west of Michigan.


      Step 3: More specifically for these counties:

      - Upton County is in west Texas.

      - Ontonagon County is in the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan.


      Step 4: Even though Ontonagon is in the western part of Michigan, Michigan as
      a whole is still east of Texas. The westernmost parts of Michigan are still
      east of the easternmost parts of Texas.


      Therefore, Upton County, TX is located west of Ontonagon County, MI.

      in the southeastern United States. Dade County is in the northwestern corner
      of Georgia.


      3) To determine which is further west, I need to compare their relative positions
      on a west-east axis. The United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to
      the Atlantic Ocean (east).


      4) Montana is significantly west of Georgia in the United States. Any county
      in Montana would be west of any county in Georgia, regardless of their specific
      positions within their respective states.

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographical positions
      of these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Whatcom County is in Washington (WA), which is on the west coast of the United
      States.

      - Charles Mix County is in South Dakota (SD), which is in the Midwest region.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Washington state is on the Pacific coast, at the northwestern corner of the
      contiguous United States.

      - South Dakota is in the north-central United States, several states east of
      Washington.


      Step 3: Compare the relative east-west positions.

      - All of Washington state is west of all of South Dakota.

      - Therefore, any county in Washington (including Whatcom) must be west of any
      county in South Dakota (including Charles Mix).

      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - Roseau County is in Minnesota (MN)

      Step 2: Recall the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Minnesota is in the Upper Midwest, bordering Canada

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, east of Minnesota


      Step 3: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      - Minnesota is significantly west of Ohio in the United States


      Step 4: Consider county positions within their states.

      - While specific counties might be in different parts of their respective states,
      the east-west distance between Minnesota and Ohio is so substantial that even
      the easternmost county in Minnesota would likely be west of the westernmost
      county in Ohio.


      Step 5: Specifically for Roseau County, MN and Morrow County, OH:

      - Roseau County is actually in the northern part of Minnesota, near the Canadian
      border

      - Morrow County is in central Ohio

      - Given the substantial east-west distance between these states, Roseau County
      must be west of Morrow County

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Minnesota is in the Upper Midwest region of the United States

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, but further east than Minnesota


      Step 3: Compare their positions more specifically.

      Step 2: Let me identify where Morrow County, Ohio is located.

      Morrow County is located in north-central Ohio. Ohio is in the eastern part

      Step 4: Consider county-specific locations.

      - Roseau County is in northern Minnesota, but its east-west position doesn''t
      change the fact that all of Minnesota is west of all of Ohio

      - Morrow County''s specific location within Ohio doesn''t change the fact that
      all of Ohio is east of all of Minnesota

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Bledsoe County is in Tennessee (TN)

      - Belknap County is in New Hampshire (NH)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States

      - New Hampshire is located in the northeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Tennessee is significantly west of New Hampshire on a map of the United States

      - All counties in Tennessee would be west of all counties in New Hampshire


      Step 4: Confirm the specific counties.

      - Since Bledsoe County is in Tennessee, it must be west of any county in New
      Hampshire

      - Since Belknap County is in New Hampshire, it must be east of any county in
      Tennessee


      Therefore, Bledsoe County, TN is indeed located west of Belknap County, NH.
