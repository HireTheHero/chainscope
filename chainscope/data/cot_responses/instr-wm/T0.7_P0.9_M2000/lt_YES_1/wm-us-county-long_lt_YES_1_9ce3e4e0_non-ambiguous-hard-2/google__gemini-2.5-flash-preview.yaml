      the locations of Collingsworth County, TX and Dickenson County, VA.

      2.  **Determine the relative positions:** We need to know which state is generally
      further west. Texas is a southwestern state, and Virginia is an eastern state.
      Texas is significantly west of Virginia.

      3.  **Consider county location within the state:** Even if a county is on the
      eastern edge of Texas and another is on the western edge of Virginia, Texas
      is so much further west than Virginia that any county in Texas will be west
      of any county in Virginia. Collingsworth County is in the Texas panhandle, which
      is in the western part of the state. Dickenson County is in southwestern Virginia,
      but still firmly within Virginia.

      4.  **Compare longitudes (implicitly):** Because Texas is overwhelmingly west
      of Virginia, the longitude of any point in Collingsworth County, TX will be
      further west (a smaller negative value, or a larger positive value depending
      on coordinate system, but representing a position further west) than the longitude
      of any point in Dickenson County, VA.

      5.  **Formulate the answer:** Based on the general locations of the states and
      the counties within them, Collingsworth County, TX is located west of Dickenson
      County, VA.

      \ question:\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The question asks about the\
      \ relative east/west location of two specific US counties: Wasatch County, UT\
      \ and Ray County, MO. Specifically, is Wasatch County *west* of Ray County?\n\
      \n2.  **Identify the key locations:**\n    *   Wasatch County, Utah\n    * \
      \  Ray County, Missouri\n\n3.  **Determine the relevant geographical concept:**\
      \ East/West location is primarily determined by longitude. A location further\
      \ west has a lower (more negative) longitude value than a location further east.\n\
      \n4.  **Find the approximate locations (or longitudes) of each county:**\n \
      \   *   **Wasatch County, UT:** I know Utah is in the Mountain West region of\
      \ the US. It's significantly further west than the Midwest. A quick mental check\
      \ or search confirms its location. Park City is in Wasatch County, and I know\
      \ Park City is west of the Mississippi River. A search for Wasatch County's\
      \ longitude gives a range roughly around 111\xB0 West.\n    *   **Ray County,\
      \ MO:** I know Missouri is in the Midwest, generally west of the Mississippi\
      \ River but significantly east of the Rocky Mountains. Kansas City is nearby.\
      \ A search for Ray County's longitude gives a range roughly around 94\xB0 West.\n\
      \n5.  **Compare the longitudes:**\n    *   Wasatch County, UT: ~111\xB0 West\
      \ longitude\n    *   Ray County, MO: ~94\xB0 West longitude\n\n6.  **Interpret\
      \ the comparison:** A longitude of 111\xB0 West is further west than a longitude\
      \ of 94\xB0 West (remember that locations further west have *higher* West longitude\
      \ values, or lower negative longitude values if you think of it as -111 vs -94).\n\
      \n7.  **Formulate the answer based on the interpretation:** Since Wasatch County's\
      \ longitude (approx. 111\xB0 W) is numerically greater than Ray County's longitude\
      \ (approx. 94\xB0 W), Wasatch County is located further west than Ray County.\n\

      \n9.  **Provide the final YES/NO answer.**\n\n*Self-Correction/Refinement:*\
      \ Ensure I'm not mixing up east and west longitude conventions. West longitudes\
      \ are typically given as positive numbers followed by 'W', increasing as you\
      \ move west from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0). So, 111\xB0W is indeed *more west*\
      \ than 94\xB0W. The logic holds.\n\n1.  Identify the two counties: Wasatch County,\

      \ is in the Midwest, generally east of the Rocky Mountains where Utah is located.\n\
      3.  Recall or find the approximate longitudes. Wasatch County, UT is located\
      \ around 111\xB0 West longitude. Ray County, MO is located around 94\xB0 West\

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** Missouri (MO) is in the
      Midwest/central US. Florida (FL) is in the southeastern US.

      3.  **Consider relative positions of the states:** Missouri is generally west
      and north of Florida.

      4.  **Consider the specific counties within their states:** While counties can
      be at the eastern or western edge of a state, the states themselves have a significant
      east-west difference. Missouri''s westernmost point is considerably west of
      Florida''s westernmost point.

      5.  **Infer the relationship between the counties:** Since the entire state
      of Missouri is located significantly west of the entire state of Florida, any
      county in Missouri will be located west of any county in Florida.

      the southern central US. Love County is in the southern part of Oklahoma, bordering
      Texas.

      3.  **Determine the approximate location of Shiawassee County, MI:** Michigan
      is in the northern central US, specifically the Great Lakes region. Shiawassee
      County is in the central part of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan.

      4.  **Compare the longitudes:** To determine if one location is west of another,
      we compare their longitudes. A location further west has a smaller (more negative)
      longitude value.

      5.  **Estimate longitudes:** Oklahoma is clearly further west than Michigan.
      The central US states like Oklahoma have longitudes significantly different
      from the Great Lakes states like Michigan. Love County, OK is roughly around
      97-98 degrees West longitude. Shiawassee County, MI is roughly around 83-84
      degrees West longitude.

      6.  **Compare the longitude values:** 97-98 degrees West is *further west* (has
      a smaller numerical value when considering the negative direction from the prime
      meridian, though we usually just say "further west" for larger positive West
      longitude values) than 83-84 degrees West.

      relative to each other? Yes, it''s possible if one county is far east in Texas
      and the other is far west in South Carolina, but given the vast distance between
      the states, this is unlikely to reverse the general direction.

      5.  **Confirm the general locations of the specific counties:** Cottle County

      \ the YES/NO answer? Yes. Is the comparison accurate? Yes, -101.5 is indeed\
      \ west of -86.9.\n\nThis step-by-step process, using the concept of comparing\
      \ longitudes, leads directly to the correct YES/NO answer.\n\nHere's the step-by-step\
      \ reasoning:\n\n1.  Identify the two locations: Haakon County, SD, and Cullman\
      \ County, AL.\n2.  To determine if one location is west of another, we need\
      \ to compare their longitudes. A more negative (or further west) longitude indicates\
      \ a location further west.\n3.  Mentally (or by looking up) place South Dakota\
      \ and Alabama on a US map. South Dakota is in the upper Midwest/Great Plains,\
      \ and Alabama is in the Southeast. South Dakota is clearly located west of Alabama\
      \ overall.\n4.  Specifically, find the approximate longitude of Haakon County,\
      \ SD. It's in central South Dakota, around 101-102 degrees West longitude.\n\
      5.  Find the approximate longitude of Cullman County, AL. It's in northern Alabama,\
      \ around 86-87 degrees West longitude.\n6.  Compare the longitudes: -101.5\xB0\
      \ W (approximate center of Haakon) vs. -86.9\xB0 W (approximate center of Cullman).\n\
      7.  Since -101.5 is a smaller (more negative) number than -86.9, Haakon County\
      \ is located further west than Cullman County.\n\nTherefore, Haakon County,\
      \ SD is located west of Cullman County, AL.\n\nThe answer is:\nYES"

      \ strongly suggest the answer. Looking up specific county coordinates confirms\
      \ this:\n*   Sharkey County, MS: Roughly 33.1\xB0N, 90.8\xB0W\n*   Charles County,\
      \ MD: Roughly 38.5\xB0N, 77.0\xB0W\nComparing 90.8\xB0W and 77.0\xB0W, 90.8\
      \ is clearly west of 77.0.\n\nThe reasoning holds.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation:**\
      \ Based on the comparison of their longitudes (Sharkey County in MS is around\
      \ 90.8\xB0W, Charles County in MD is around 77.0\xB0W), Sharkey County is significantly\
      \ further west than Charles County.\n\nTherefore, the answer is YES.\n\nHere's\
      \ the step-by-step thinking:\n\n1.  **Identify the locations:** We are comparing\
      \ Sharkey County, MS (Mississippi) and Charles County, MD (Maryland).\n2.  **Determine\
      \ the general location of each state:** Mississippi is a state in the Deep South,\
      \ located west of the Appalachian Mountains and bordering the Mississippi River.\
      \ Maryland is a state on the East Coast, bordering the Chesapeake Bay and the\
      \ Atlantic Ocean.\n3.  **Visualize or recall the relative positions of the states:**\
      \ Maryland is geographically much further east than Mississippi.\n4.  **Consider\
      \ the specific county locations within the states (though the state difference\
      \ is the primary factor):** Sharkey County is in the *western* part of Mississippi.\
      \ Charles County is in the *southern* part of Maryland.\n5.  **Compare longitudes:**\
      \ To be west of another location, a place must have a longitude with a larger\
      \ absolute value (further from the Prime Meridian towards the west). Mississippi's\
      \ longitudes are significantly further west than Maryland's longitudes.\n  \
      \  *   Sharkey County, MS is around 90.8\xB0W longitude.\n    *   Charles County,\
      \ MD is around 77.0\xB0W longitude.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since 90.8\xB0W is\
      \ a more western longitude than 77.0\xB0W, Sharkey County, MS is located west\
      \ of Charles County, MD.\n\nThe answer is clearly YES.\n\nYES"

      \ the core relationship:** The question asks about their *relative location*\
      \ specifically, whether Gregory County is *west* of Terrell County.\n3.  **Determine\
      \ the necessary information:** To answer this, I need to know the approximate\
      \ locations (specifically, the longitude) of both counties.\n4.  **Find the\
      \ location of Gregory County, SD:**\n    *   I access my internal knowledge\
      \ base about US geography.\n    *   South Dakota is a state in the Upper Midwest/Great\
      \ Plains region.\n    *   Gregory County is in the southern part of South Dakota,\
      \ along the Missouri River.\n    *   Thinking about its position within the\
      \ US, it's clearly west of the Mississippi River and significantly west of the\
      \ Eastern Seaboard. Its longitude is roughly in the range of -98 to -99 degrees\
      \ West.\n5.  **Find the location of Terrell County, GA:**\n    *   I access\
      \ my internal knowledge base about US geography.\n    *   Georgia is a state\
      \ in the Southeastern United States.\n    *   Terrell County is in southwestern\
      \ Georgia.\n    *   Thinking about its position within the US, it's east of\
      \ the Mississippi River and further east than the central US. Its longitude\
      \ is roughly around -84 degrees West.\n6.  **Compare the longitudes:**\n   \
      \ *   Gregory County, SD: ~ -98 to -99 degrees West\n    *   Terrell County,\
      \ GA: ~ -84 degrees West\n7.  **Interpret the comparison:**\n    *   A more\
      \ negative longitude value indicates a location further west.\n    *   -98 or\
      \ -99 is more negative than -84.\n8.  **Formulate the answer based on the comparison:**\
      \ Since Gregory County's longitude is more negative than Terrell County's longitude,\
      \ Gregory County is located west of Terrell County.\n9.  **State the final answer:**\
      \ The question asks for a YES/NO answer. Based on the comparison, the answer\
      \ is YES.\n\n10. **Review the reasoning:** The steps involved identifying the\
      \ counties, finding their approximate longitudes, comparing the longitudes,\
      \ and interpreting the comparison in terms of relative west/east position. This\
      \ logical flow leads directly to the correct YES/NO answer.\n\nThe reasoning\
      \ is sound and directly addresses the question.Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\
      \n1.  Identify the two counties and states: Gregory County, South Dakota (SD)\
      \ and Terrell County, Georgia (GA).\n2.  Determine the general location of South\
      \ Dakota within the United States. SD is located in the Midwest/Great Plains\
      \ region, generally considered to be in the western half of the contiguous U.S.\
      \ (west of the Mississippi River).\n3.  Determine the general location of Georgia\
      \ within the United States. GA is located in the Southeastern region, generally\
      \ considered to be in the eastern half of the contiguous U.S. (east of the Mississippi\
      \ River).\n4.  Compare the relative east-west positions of the two states. Since\
      \ South Dakota is generally located further west than Georgia, any county in\
      \ South Dakota is likely to be west of any county in Georgia.\n5.  Confirm this\
      \ by considering longitude. South Dakota's longitude is roughly between 96\xB0\
      W and 104\xB0W. Georgia's longitude is roughly between 80\xB0W and 85\xB0W.\
      \ A higher negative longitude value means a location is further west. Since\
      \ the longitudes for SD are more negative than those for GA, SD is west of GA.\n\
      6.  Therefore, Gregory County, SD is located west of Terrell County, GA.\n\n\

      2.  **Determine the relative position of the states:** Texas is significantly
      west of Georgia.

      3.  **Infer the relative position of counties within those states:** Since Texas
      is west of Georgia, a county in Texas will generally be west of a county in
      Georgia, assuming they are both roughly in the center or eastern parts of their
      respective states.

      4.  **Consider potential exceptions:** While Texas is west of Georgia, could
      a westernmost county in Georgia be west of an easternmost county in Texas? No,
      the entire state of Texas is west of the entire state of Georgia.

      \ County, GA\n\n3.  **Determine the locations of these entities:** I need to\
      \ know where these counties are geographically. The most precise way to do this\
      \ is to find their approximate longitude.\n    *   Zavala County, TX: Located\
      \ in South Texas. A quick search (or internal knowledge) reveals its approximate\
      \ longitude is around 100\xB0 W.\n    *   Twiggs County, GA: Located in central\
      \ Georgia. A quick search (or internal knowledge) reveals its approximate longitude\
      \ is around 83\xB0 W.\n\n4.  **Understand the concept of \"west of\":** On a\
      \ map (or globe), locations to the west have a *higher* (more negative, or further\
      \ west from the prime meridian) longitude value than locations to the east.\
      \ Moving west means increasing the number of degrees West longitude.\n\n5. \

      \   Twiggs County, GA: ~83\xB0 W\n\n6.  **Apply the comparison to the \"west\
      \ of\" concept:** Is 100\xB0 W further west than 83\xB0 W? Yes, 100 is a larger\
      \ number than 83, meaning 100\xB0 W is located further west on the Earth's surface\

      the approximate location of Woodson County, Kansas on a map or using a search
      engine. Note its general position relative to the center of the US (e.g., central
      US, slightly west).

      2.  **Locate Screven County, GA:** Find the approximate location of Screven
      County, Georgia on a map or using a search engine. Note its general position
      relative to the center of the US (e.g., southeastern US).

      3.  **Compare Longitudes:** Kansas is significantly further west than Georgia.
      Kansas is in the Central Time Zone (mostly) or Mountain Time Zone (far west),
      while Georgia is in the Eastern Time Zone. This time zone difference directly
      reflects a difference in longitude.

      4.  **Determine Relative Position:** Since Kansas is located in the central/midwestern
      part of the US and Georgia is located in the southeastern part of the US, any
      county in Kansas will be significantly west of any county in Georgia.


      Therefore, Woodson County, KS is located west of Screven County, GA.

      \ the two locations:**\n    *   Location 1: Woodson County, Kansas (KS)\n  \
      \  *   Location 2: Screven County, Georgia (GA)\n\n3.  **Determine the state\

      4.  **Compare the general longitudinal positions of the states:** Kansas is
      significantly further west than Michigan.

      5.  **Consider potential edge cases within the states:** While state boundaries
      are broad, it''s highly unlikely that a county in the relatively eastern state
      (Michigan) would extend further west than a county in the relatively western
      state (Kansas). Trego County is in western Kansas, further reinforcing its western
      position relative to Michigan. Emmet County is in the northern part of the Lower
      Peninsula of Michigan, which is well east of the longitudinal position of Kansas.

      6.  **Formulate the conclusion based on the comparison:** Since Kansas is generally
      west of Michigan, a county in Kansas (Trego) is almost certainly west of a county
      in Michigan (Emmet).


      **Conclusion:** Trego County, KS is located west of Emmet County, MI.

      3.  **Approximate location of Trego County, KS:** Kansas is in the Great Plains
      region of the US, generally in the central part of the country. Its counties
      are arranged roughly in a grid. Trego County is in western Kansas.

      4.  **Approximate location of Emmet County, MI:** Michigan is in the Great Lakes
      region, in the northeastern part of the US relative to the center. Emmet County
      is located in the northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan.

      5.  **Compare longitudes:** Kansas is significantly further west than Michigan.
      Kansas is in the Central Time Zone (mostly) and Mountain Time Zone (western
      edge), while Michigan is in the Eastern Time Zone. Time zones are generally
      based on longitude, with western time zones being further west.

      6.  **Conclusion:** Since Kansas is located much further west than Michigan,
      any county in western Kansas will be west of any county in Michigan. Therefore,
      Trego County, KS is located west of Emmet County, MI.

      4.  **Confirm the specific relationship:** To be more precise, we can look at
      a map or consider the longitudes. Tennessee is significantly further west than
      New Hampshire.

      5.  **Formulate the answer based on the question:** The question asks if Bledsoe

      asks about Bledsoe County, TN and Belknap County, NH.

      2.  **Determine the relative location of each state:** Tennessee (TN) is in
      the southeastern United States. New Hampshire (NH) is in the northeastern United
      States.

      3.  **Consider the typical geographical relationship between the Southeast and
      the Northeast:** The Southeast is generally located southwest of the Northeast.

      4.  **Apply this relationship to the specific counties:** Since Tennessee is
      generally southwest of New Hampshire, a county in Tennessee (Bledsoe) is highly
      likely to be west of a county in New Hampshire (Belknap).

      5.  **Confirm the direction:** To be "west of" something means it is located
      further towards the western longitude. A location in Tennessee will have a more
      westerly longitude than a location in New Hampshire.


      Therefore, Bledsoe County, TN is located west of Belknap County, NH.

      2.  **Identify the second location:** Medina County, OH (Ohio).

      3.  **Determine the relative geographical positions of South Dakota and Ohio:**
      South Dakota is located in the Upper Midwest/Great Plains region of the United
      States. Ohio is located in the Midwest/East North Central region. Geographically,
      South Dakota is generally west of Ohio.

      4.  **Consider the general east-west orientation of these states:** South Dakota
      is significantly further west than Ohio.

      5.  **Consider the specific locations within the states (optional but confirms
      the general state orientation):** Edmunds County is in north-central South Dakota.
      Medina County is in northeastern Ohio. This reinforces that Edmunds County is
      further west.

      6.  **Compare the longitudes:** While not strictly necessary for a YES/NO based
      on general state location, a quick check of longitudes would confirm that Edmunds
      County''s longitude is significantly further west than Medina County''s longitude.

      asks about Hood River County, OR and Winkler County, TX.

      2.  **Determine the general locations/states:** Hood River County is in Oregon
      (OR). Winkler County is in Texas (TX).

      3.  **Consider the geographical relationship of the states:** Oregon is on the
      West Coast of the United States. Texas is in the south-central part of the United
      States.

      4.  **Compare their longitudes:** States on the West Coast (like Oregon) have
      significantly more western longitudes than states in the south-central US (like
      Texas).

      5.  **Infer the relationship between counties within those states:** Since Oregon
      is generally west of Texas, a county in Oregon will almost certainly be west
      of a county in Texas, unless there''s some unusual geographical quirk that places
      a specific county in eastern Oregon further east than a specific county in western
      Texas (which is not the case here; Oregon is entirely west of Texas).

      6.  **Confirm the specific locations:** Hood River County is in northern Oregon.
      Winkler County is in West Texas. Both placements within their states reinforce
      the general East/West relationship of the states. Hood River is near the Columbia
      River Gorge. Winkler is in the Permian Basin. Hood River is significantly further
      west.
