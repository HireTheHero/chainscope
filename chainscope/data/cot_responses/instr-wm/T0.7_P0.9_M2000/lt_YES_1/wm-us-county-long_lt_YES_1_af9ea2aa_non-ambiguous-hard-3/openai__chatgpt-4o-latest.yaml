    7884ee1d-2cdf-4afa-9327-a1b51b67abb4: 'To determine whether Navajo County, Arizona
      is located west of Arkansas County, Arkansas, we need to consider their geographical
      locations in terms of longitude.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - Navajo County is in the state of Arizona.

      - Arkansas County is in the state of Arkansas.


      Step 2: Understand the general position of these states.

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions of Arizona and Arkansas.

      - Arizona is west of Arkansas. Therefore, most counties in Arizona are also
      west of most counties in Arkansas.


      Step 4: Confirm the locations of the specific counties.

      - Navajo County is in northeastern Arizona.

      - Arkansas County is in southeastern Arkansas.


      Step 5: Even though Navajo County is in northeastern Arizona, and Arkansas County
      is in southeastern Arkansas, Arizona is still generally west of Arkansas.


      Conclusion: Since Navajo County, AZ is in a state that is geographically west
      of Arkansas, and even the northeastern part of Arizona is still west of the
      southeastern part of Arkansas, we can conclude that Navajo County, AZ is located
      west of Arkansas County, AR.

      Step 1: Identify the location of Wicomico County, Maryland.

      - Wicomico County is located on the eastern shore of Maryland. It is part of
      the Delmarva Peninsula, bordering Delaware and the Atlantic Ocean.

      - This places Wicomico County in the eastern portion of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Reynolds County, Missouri.

      - Reynolds County is located in southeastern Missouri.

      - Missouri is generally situated in the central United States, and Reynolds
      County is in the southeastern quadrant of the state.


      Step 3: Compare the relative longitudinal positions (east-west).

      - Maryland is on the East Coast of the U.S., and Missouri is farther west.

      - Therefore, Reynolds County is to the west of Wicomico County.

      is located west of Pasquotank County, North Carolina, we need to:


      1. Identify the geographic locations of both counties.

      2. Compare their positions longitudinally (east-west direction).


      Step 1: Locate Pasquotank County, NC

      - Pasquotank County is in the northeastern part of North Carolina. It borders
      the Albemarle Sound and is close to the Atlantic coast.


      Step 2: Locate White County, AR

      - White County is in central Arkansas, located northeast of Little Rock.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes

      - North Carolina is on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      - Arkansas is farther inland and to the west of North Carolina.


      Therefore, since Arkansas lies west of North Carolina, and White County is in
      Arkansas while Pasquotank County is in North Carolina, White County is indeed
      west of Pasquotank County.

      is located west of Hyde County, North Carolina, we need to:


      1. Identify the approximate geographic locations of both counties.

      2. Compare their longitudes, since longitude determines east-west positioning.


      **Step 1: Locate Pemiscot County, MO**

      - Pemiscot County is in the southeastern corner of Missouri.

      - It borders the Mississippi River and is part of the Missouri Bootheel.

      - This places it in the central United States, relatively close to the state
      of Tennessee.


      **Step 2: Locate Hyde County, NC**

      - Hyde County is in eastern North Carolina.

      - It is located along the coast and includes part of the Outer Banks.

      - This places it on the eastern side of the United States.


      **Step 3: Compare Longitudes**

      - Missouri lies west of North Carolina in general.

      - Since Pemiscot County is in southeastern Missouri, and Hyde County is in eastern
      North Carolina, Pemiscot County is significantly farther west in terms of longitude.


      **Conclusion:**

      Yes, Pemiscot County, MO is located west of Hyde County, NC.

      is in the Southeastern United States.


      3. In general, New Mexico lies to the west of Alabama on the U.S. map. Specifically,
      New Mexico is in the Mountain Time Zone, while Alabama is in the Central Time
      Zone, indicating that New Mexico is further west.


      4. Even though Eddy County is in the southeastern part of New Mexico and Marengo
      County is in the western part of Alabama, the entire state of New Mexico is
      still geographically west of Alabama.


      Therefore, when comparing the longitudinal positions, Eddy County, NM is west
      of Marengo County, AL.

      is located west of Brookings County, South Dakota, we need to look at their
      relative geographic positions based on longitude.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Bingham County, Idaho.

      - Bingham County is in southeastern Idaho.

      - Idaho is in the western United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Brookings County, South Dakota.

      - Brookings County is in eastern South Dakota.

      - South Dakota is located in the north-central part of the United States, and
      Brookings is toward the eastern edge of the state.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes.

      - Idaho is west of South Dakota in general.

      - Since Bingham County is in Idaho and Brookings County is in eastern South
      Dakota, it is very likely that Bingham County is west of Brookings County.


      Therefore, based on geographic reasoning:


      Answer: YES.'

      **Step 1: Locate Yavapai County, Arizona**

      - Yavapai County is located in central Arizona.

      - Arizona is a southwestern U.S. state.

      - Therefore, Yavapai County is in the western United States.


      **Step 2: Locate Sunflower County, Mississippi**

      - Sunflower County is located in the Mississippi Delta region of western Mississippi.

      - Mississippi is in the southeastern United States.


      **Step 3: Compare relative longitudes**

      - Arizona is generally much farther west than Mississippi.

      - Yavapai County, being in central Arizona, is significantly west of any location
      in Mississippi, including Sunflower County.


      **Conclusion:**

      Given that Arizona is west of Mississippi, and both counties are centrally located
      within their respective states, Yavapai County is indeed west of Sunflower County.
