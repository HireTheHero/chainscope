      AR is located west of Perquimans County, NC, we need to look at the geographic
      locations of both counties.


      1. **Identify the location of Perquimans County, NC**: Perquimans County is
      situated in the northeastern part of North Carolina, along the Albemarle Sound.


      2. **Identify the location of Mississippi County, AR**: Mississippi County is
      located in the northeastern corner of Arkansas, bordering the Mississippi River.


      3. **Compare the locations**: To assess whether Mississippi County, AR is west
      of Perquimans County, NC, we consider their relative positions on a map. Since
      Perquimans County is in North Carolina and Mississippi County is in Arkansas,
      we can observe that Arkansas is located to the west of North Carolina.


      4. **Determine the relative west-east positions**: Given that Mississippi County
      is on the western side of the Mississippi River (which forms a natural border),
      and North Carolina is further east, we can conclude that Mississippi County
      is indeed west of Perquimans County.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is:


      YES'

      located west of Champaign County, IL, let''s first identify the locations of
      both counties.


      1. **Location of Champaign County, IL**: Champaign County is in the east-central
      part of Illinois. The city of Champaign is near the eastern border of the state.


      2. **Location of Uinta County, WY**: Uinta County is located in the western
      part of Wyoming. It is bordered by Utah to the south and is situated much farther
      west compared to Illinois.


      3. **Comparative Position**: To determine if Uinta County is west of Champaign
      County, we can note that Wyoming is situated to the west of Illinois on the
      US map. Therefore, any county in Wyoming, including Uinta County, would be west
      of any county in Illinois, including Champaign County.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      YES'

      1. **Identify the Location of Boundary County, ID**: Boundary County is located
      in the northern part of Idaho. It shares a border with Canada to the north and
      is situated near the state of Washington to the west.


      2. **Identify the Location of Beltrami County, MN**: Beltrami County is located
      in the north-central part of Minnesota. It is bordered by Canada to the north,
      and its eastern border is close to the state of Wisconsin.


      3. **Compare the Locations**: To determine if Boundary County, ID is west of
      Beltrami County, MN, we can visualize or look at a map. Minnesota is east of
      Idaho, meaning that any location within Idaho, including Boundary County, would
      generally be west of counties in Minnesota.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Boundary County, ID is located in Idaho, which is to
      the west of Minnesota, it follows that Boundary County is indeed west of Beltrami
      County, MN.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:
