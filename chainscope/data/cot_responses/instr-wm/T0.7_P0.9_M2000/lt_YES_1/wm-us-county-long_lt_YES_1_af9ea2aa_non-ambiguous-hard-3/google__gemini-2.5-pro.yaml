      while Sac County, Iowa, is situated in the Midwest. The next step, comparing
      their locations, reveals Utah is entirely west of Iowa. I''m now certain Cache
      County lies west of Sac County.



      **Analyzing Geographical Placement**


      I''ve meticulously mapped out the geographical reasoning: identifying the states
      of each county (Utah and Iowa), their regional positions within the US, and
      their east-west relationship. My analysis of these locations conclusively demonstrates
      that Cache County, in Utah, is indeed west of Sac County, Iowa. I''m now crafting
      a concise presentation of this logical progression.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of Cache County:** Cache County is located in the
      state of Utah.

      2.  **Identify the location of Sac County:** Sac County is located in the state
      of Iowa.

      3.  **Compare the locations of the states:** The state of Utah is located in
      the Mountain West region of the United States. The state of Iowa is located
      in the Midwest.

      4.  **Determine the relative position:** Geographically, the entire state of
      Utah is west of the entire state of Iowa.

      5.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, Cache County, UT, is located west of Sac County,
      IA.

      I''ve zeroed in on the core question: whether Cache County, UT is west of Sac
      County, IA. My initial approach is clear: pinpoint the geographical coordinates
      of each county. Currently, I''m working on strategies for efficiently obtaining
      and comparing these coordinates.



      **Pinpointing County Positions**


      I''ve determined that Utah is clearly west of Iowa, simplifying the problem.
      Cache County, UT, lies within the western state of Utah. Sac County, IA, resides
      in the midwestern state of Iowa. Therefore, Cache County, UT is unequivocally
      west of Sac County, IA.



      **Revising the Geographical Logic**


      I''ve refined the logic. Comparing states'' regions is sufficient. Utah''s Mountain
      West location and Iowa''s Midwestern location confirm that Cache County, UT,
      lies west of Sac County, IA. This approach simplifies the need for precise coordinates.
      The answer is a resounding yes.

      western part of the state of Iowa.

      3.  **Compare the locations of the states:** The state of Utah is in the Mountain
      West region of the United States. The state of Iowa is in the Midwest. On a
      map of the U.S., the entire state of Utah is located to the west of the entire
      state of Iowa.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Since all of Utah is west of all of Iowa, Cache County,
      UT, must be west of Sac County, IA.

      their general US region is enough: Appanoose County in the Midwest, Mercer County
      on the East Coast. Now, it''s clear: Iowa''s location, in the Midwest, means
      it must be west of New Jersey.



      **Defining Geographical Locations**


      My process now focuses on the states, then the counties. The geographical locations

      I''m starting to delineate the core issue: the user needs to know the relative
      east-west positioning of two counties. My current focus is on finding the location
      of Mississippi County, AR. I need to confirm its longitude to compare it to
      Perquimans County, NC.



      **Pinpointing Relative Positions**


      Now, I''m consolidating the county locations. I''ve established that Mississippi
      County, AR, resides in the northeast corner of Arkansas, while Perquimans County,
      NC, is situated in the northeastern part of North Carolina. The next step is
      to definitively state Mississippi County is west of Perquimans.



      **Mapping the Solution Path**


      I''ve broken down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks. I first established
      the need to find the locations of both counties. I then determined their relative
      positions within their respective states, Arkansas and North Carolina. Now,
      I''m ready to formalize the longitude comparison for a definitive answer.



      **Structuring the Logical Flow**


      I''m now distilling the reasoning into a concise, step-by-step explanation.
      I''ll begin by pinpointing the counties'' respective states, then outlining
      their general geographical relationship. Subsequently, I''ll finalize the answer
      with a clear, confirming "YES," as the final verification. The longitude values
      will also be included.

      2.  **Identify the location of the second county:** Perquimans County is in
      the state of North Carolina (NC). It is located in the northeastern, coastal
      region of North Carolina.

      3.  **Compare the locations of the states:** The state of Arkansas is located
      in the southern central United States, while the state of North Carolina is
      on the Atlantic coast in the southeastern United States.

      4.  **Determine the relative direction:** Geographically, the entire state of
      Arkansas is west of the entire state of North Carolina. Therefore, any county
      in Arkansas must be west of any county in North Carolina.

      I''ve started by identifying the core question: determining the relative east-west
      positions of two counties. Now, I''m breaking it down. First, I must pinpoint
      the precise geographical coordinates for each county. This involves researching
      their locations, likely using a map or other geographical data sources.



      **Assessing County Locations**


      I''ve now moved to the next step: pinpointing the locations of each county.
      I''ve confirmed Ochiltree County, Texas, is indeed in the Panhandle, bordering
      Oklahoma, in the western part of the Central Time Zone. Next, I recalled that
      Cocke County, Tennessee, is situated in the eastern part of the state, near
      the North Carolina border.



      **Confirming County Positioning**


      I''ve finished identifying Ochiltree County''s and Cocke County''s locations.
      Texas is west of Tennessee. Ochiltree County is in the Texas panhandle, while
      Cocke County is in eastern Tennessee. The Texas Panhandle is more west than
      eastern Tennessee. Therefore, I''ve concluded Ochiltree County, Texas, is west
      of Cocke County, Tennessee.



      **Confirming the Solution**


      I''ve now rigorously worked through the logic. I started with the key inquiry,
      then broke it into smaller steps. I''ve located both counties, verifying Ochiltree''s
      position in the Texas Panhandle and Cocke''s in eastern Tennessee. The geographical
      comparison clearly demonstrates Ochiltree County, TX is west of Cocke County,
      TN.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Locate Ochiltree County, Texas:** Ochiltree County is located in the northernmost
      part of the Texas Panhandle, bordering Oklahoma.

      2.  **Locate Cocke County, Tennessee:** Cocke County is located in the eastern
      part of Tennessee, on the border with North Carolina, within the Appalachian
      Mountains.

      3.  **Compare their positions:** On a map of the United States, the Texas Panhandle
      is significantly to the west of eastern Tennessee.


      Therefore, Ochiltree County, TX is west of Cocke County, TN.

      relative locations of Winneshiek County, IA, and Steuben County, NY, is the
      main task. I''m focusing on defining how to locate these counties, and how to
      represent them spatially so I can arrive at an answer.



      **Confirming Spatial Relationships**


      I''ve clarified the core question: Determining the east-west relationship between
      Winneshiek and Steuben Counties. I''ve broken it down to identify and compare
      their longitude. I know Winneshiek is in Iowa, a Midwestern state, and Steuben
      is in New York, a Northeastern state. Midwest states are generally west of Northeast
      states. So, Winneshiek must be west of Steuben. Now I''ll outline the reasoning
      for clarity.



      **Structuring the Logical Path**


      I''m now solidifying the step-by-step logic. The essential components are in
      place: identifying the locations, comparing states, and definitively concluding
      the east-west relationship. My next goal is to refine this process so that it''s
      airtight and can be easily explained to others.

      3.  Finally, we compare the geographical locations of the two states. The state
      of Iowa is located in the Midwest, entirely to the west of the state of New
      York, which is in the Northeast.

      4.  Therefore, any county in Iowa is west of any county in New York.

      The core question seeks to determine the relative positioning, specifically
      if one is west of the other. Next, I''ll use the two counties and attempt a
      comparison.



      **Confirming Relative Positioning**


      I''m now zeroing in on the geographical relationship. Washington State''s location
      on the Pacific coast establishes its position relative to Minnesota in the Upper
      Midwest. My analysis then focused on the specifics: Spokane County in eastern
      Washington versus Roseau County in northern Minnesota. Since Washington is west
      of Minnesota overall, and both counties are within their respective states,
      it is evident that Spokane County is, indeed, west of Roseau County. This confirms
      the initial geographical assessment.



      **Revisiting State Proximity**


      I''m now revisiting the state-level comparison, solidifying the initial geographical
      assessment. My process involves analyzing the broader context: Washington State''s
      Pacific location versus Minnesota''s Upper Midwest position. This lays the groundwork
      for understanding the relative placement of the counties within their respective
      states. I''ll make sure to note that the state-level positioning directly influences

      positions. This helps determine whether Spokane County is west of Roseau County.



      **Analyzing Geographical Positions**


      I''ve started by isolating the core question: is Spokane County west of Roseau
      County? Breaking it down, I see two key entities: the counties. I know Spokane
      is in Washington (Pacific Northwest), and Roseau is in Minnesota (Midwest).
      Comparing their state locations, I see Washington is far west of Minnesota.
      Even considering the counties'' positions within their states (eastern Washington,
      northern Minnesota), the conclusion holds: Spokane County is indeed west of
      Roseau County.



      **Finalizing the Geographical Conclusion**


      I''ve clarified the core question and broke it down, identifying key entities:
      Spokane and Roseau counties. Locating their respective states, Washington and
      Minnesota, I compared their positions and confirmed Washington''s westward location.
      Even accounting for specific county placements within their states, the conclusion
      holds. Therefore, the answer is a definitive yes: Spokane County, Washington,
      is west of Roseau County, Minnesota.

      I''ve determined the core question: Does Hill County, TX, lie west of Lanier
      County, GA? I''ve started breaking this down by identifying necessary facts.
      My immediate focus: pinpointing the precise location of Hill County, Texas,
      and Lanier County, Georgia. Next, I plan to compare their longitudes to establish
      the direction. This initial phase seems straightforward.



      **Revising the Approach**


      I''ve determined that Hill County, TX, is indeed west of Lanier County, GA.
      Initially, I planned to meticulously calculate longitudes, but a simpler geographical
      principle suffices. Texas lies entirely west of Georgia; therefore, any Texas
      county must be west of any Georgia county. This observation streamlines the
      process considerably.



      **Formulating a Concise Response**


      After refining my reasoning, I am confident in the conclusion. The location
      of Hill County, TX, and Lanier County, GA, is clear now. I have carefully constructed
      a step-by-step argument. I am ready to finalize the response by streamlining
      the reasoning to its essential components. The answer will be presented in a
      clear, concise format.

      I''ve identified the core question: determining if Edmunds County, SD, is west
      of Missaukee County, MI. My next step is to pinpoint the geographical locations
      of each county. I plan to gather the necessary latitude and longitude coordinates
      to compare them and definitively answer the question.



      **Pinpointing Coordinates**


      I''ve gathered preliminary data on the county locations. Now, I''m zeroing in
      on obtaining precise latitude and longitude coordinates for each county. My
      plan involves leveraging online resources to cross-reference and validate the
      data for accuracy. I''m leaning toward using a mapping API to automate this
      process efficiently.



      **Deducing Relative Positioning**


      Okay, I''ve broken down the core question and identified the required steps.
      I''m now moving to gather the necessary location data. I''ll determine each
      county''s location, focusing on longitude. Then, I''ll compare those longitudes
      and deduce whether Edmunds County is west of Missaukee County. I will use the
      states as a point of reference to simplify the final comparison.



      **Mapping Out the Solution**


      I''ve broken down the problem: I''ll determine the locations of both counties,
      focusing on longitude. Then, based on state locations, I''ll conclude whether
      Edmunds County is west of Missaukee County. My analysis will use a structured
      approach, outlining each step and confirming the final "YES" answer.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to locate Edmunds County, South Dakota. Edmunds County is
      in the north-central part of the state of South Dakota.

      2.  Next, we need to locate Missaukee County, Michigan. Missaukee County is
      in the northern part of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan.

      3.  Finally, we compare the locations of the two states. The entire state of
      South Dakota is located to the west of the entire state of Michigan.

      4.  Therefore, any county in South Dakota, including Edmunds County, must be
      west of any county in Michigan, including Missaukee County.

      County, MO, and am confident it''s in Missouri''s southwest. I''ve also found
      Bland County, VA, situated in Virginia''s southwest. Since Missouri is west
      of Virginia, it''s clear: Jasper County, MO, is west of Bland County, VA.



      **Refining Geographic Comparison**


      I''ve refined my approach to comparing the counties. I''m focusing on the states
      they reside in and their relative positions. Missouri, where Jasper County is
      located, is clearly west of Virginia, the home of Bland County. This simplifies
      the comparison and confirms the answer. I will now finalize the response with
      the requested step-by-step reasoning.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Locate Jasper County, MO:** Jasper County is in the state of Missouri.
      Specifically, it is in the southwestern corner of Missouri.

      2.  **Locate Bland County, VA:** Bland County is in the state of Virginia. Specifically,
      it is in the southwestern part of Virginia, in the Appalachian Mountains.

      3.  **Compare the locations:** The entire state of Missouri is geographically
      west of the entire state of Virginia. Therefore, any county in Missouri will
      be west of any county in Virginia.

      I''m zeroing in on the fundamental question: is Jasper County, MO west of Bland
      County, VA? I''ve started by pinpointing Jasper County''s location in Missouri
      and then am seeking the coordinates of Bland County in Virginia. Next, I will
      be comparing the longitude of the counties.



      **Analyzing Geographical Placement**


      I''ve successfully located Jasper County, Missouri, confirming its position
      in the southwestern portion of the state near Joplin. Similarly, I''ve pinpointed
      Bland County, Virginia, and verified its location within the Appalachian region
      of southwestern Virginia. The next step is comparing their longitudes. I believe
      it''s safe to say, Missouri is located to the west of Virginia.



      **Establishing a Definitive Answer**


      After solidifying the locations of Jasper County and Bland County, I''ve confirmed
      my initial assessments. Jasper County is squarely in Missouri''s southwestern
      region, and Bland County resides in the Appalachian southwest of Virginia. Reasoning
      logically, Missouri is unequivocally west of Virginia. Hence, Jasper County,
      MO, must necessarily be positioned west of Bland County, VA. The answer is definitively
      YES.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Locate Jasper County, MO:** Jasper County is located in the southwestern
      corner of the state of Missouri.

      2.  **Locate Bland County, VA:** Bland County is located in the southwestern

      I''ve got the core question: figuring out if Jasper County, MO, is west of Bland
      County, VA. My next move is to locate both counties. I''ll need to pinpoint
      their geographic coordinates to make a proper comparison.



      **Analyzing Geographic Positions**


      I''ve determined I''ll need to pinpoint Jasper County in Missouri and Bland
      County in Virginia. I quickly recalled Missouri is in the Midwest, specifically
      southwestern, and Virginia is on the East Coast. My current task is to refine
      the location of Jasper County in Missouri, noting Joplin as a key city, and
      pinpoint Bland County in Virginia, finding it in the southwest of the state.
      I know both counties'' positions can be used to compare their east-west locations.



      **Finalizing Geographic Comparison**


      I''ve got the answer.  Jasper County, Missouri, is west of Bland County, Virginia.  I''ve
      systematically located both counties, noting their state contexts. Missouri''s
      western position relative to Virginia made the comparison straightforward.  Now,
      I''m ready to move on to the next challenge.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **First, we need to locate Jasper County, MO.** Jasper County is in the
      state of Missouri. More specifically, it is in the southwestern corner of Missouri.

      2.  **Next, we need to locate Bland County, VA.** Bland County is in the state
      of Virginia. It is located in the southwestern part of Virginia, within the
      Appalachian Mountains.

      3.  **Finally, we compare the locations of the two states.** The state of Missouri
      is located in the Midwestern United States, while the state of Virginia is on
      the East Coast. The entire state of Missouri is geographically west of the entire
      state of Virginia.

      4.  **Therefore**, since Jasper County is in Missouri and Bland County is in
      Virginia, Jasper County must be west of Bland County.

      My initial focus is crystal clear: establishing if Jasper County, MO, lies west
      of Bland County, VA. I''m starting by zeroing in on the location of Jasper County,
      MO.



      **Assessing Relative Positions**


      I''m now zeroing in on Bland County, VA, to determine its position. My preliminary
      understanding of US geography suggests Virginia is east of Missouri. While I
      need to pinpoint Bland County precisely within Virginia, this initial mental
      mapping provides a strong indication of the final answer. I''m building momentum
      towards comparing longitudes, but first, confirming Bland County''s coordinates.



      **Determining Westward Position**


      My focus has shifted. I now have the locations of both counties: Jasper County,
      Missouri, and Bland County, Virginia. After a mental mapping exercise, I''ve
      confirmed that the entirety of Missouri sits west of Virginia. I''m now analyzing
      the implications of this broader state-level positioning, and I realize there''s
      no need to meticulously compare the coordinates. Any location in Missouri, including
      Jasper County, must inherently be west of any location in Virginia, including
      Bland County.



      **Establishing Westward Superiority**


      The reasoning is fully developed. I''ve pinpointed both counties and confirmed
      Missouri''s westward positioning relative to Virginia. Further analysis is unnecessary;
      any location in Missouri, like Jasper County, is demonstrably west of any Virginia
      location, including Bland County.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Locate Jasper County, MO:** Jasper County is in the state of Missouri.

      it is in the southwestern part of Virginia.

      3.  **Compare the states'' locations:** The state of Missouri is located in
      the Midwestern United States, west of the Mississippi River. The state of Virginia
      is an East Coast state.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Since the entire state of Missouri is geographically west
      of the entire state of Virginia, Jasper County, MO must be west of Bland County,
      VA.

      I''ve pinpointed the core question: comparing the east-west positioning of Bernalillo
      County, NM, and Crittenden County, AR. I''ve broken this down. First, the location
      of Bernalillo County is needed, followed by Crittenden County. This seems simple
      enough.



      **Pinpointing Geographical Coordinates**


      I''m now zeroing in on the specifics. I''ve successfully gathered the necessary
      county locations: Bernalillo, New Mexico, and Crittenden, Arkansas. My next
      step is a direct longitudinal comparison. The east-west positions are clearer
      now, with Albuquerque being further west than Marion. This confirms my initial
      assessment.



      **Establishing Geographical Westwardness**


      My reasoning''s clear now, and I''ve established the counties'' relative positions.
      I''ve pinpointed the essential logic: higher west longitudes signify a more
      westward location. Albuquerque''s longitude is greater than Marion''s, confirming
      Bernalillo County''s westward positioning. This fully answers the user''s initial
      inquiry.



      **Formulating a Logical Proof**


      The logical structure is now well-defined. I''ve broken down the problem and
      gathered the data on the county locations, states, and longitudes. Step-by-step
      reasoning clearly demonstrates the geographical positions. I''m now crafting
      a concise answer to the initial question. It''s a "YES," Bernalillo County is
      west of Crittenden County.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of Bernalillo County, NM:** Bernalillo County is
      located in the central part of the state of New Mexico.
