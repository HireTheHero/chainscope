      Tripp County, SD is located in the central part of South Dakota. A quick search
      reveals its approximate longitude is **-99.8 degrees West**.


      **Step 2: Find the Longitude of Oceana County, MI**

      Oceana County, MI is located on the western side of Michigan, along Lake Michigan.
      A quick search reveals its approximate longitude is **-86.4 degrees West**.


      **Step 3: Compare the Longitudes**

      * Tripp County, SD: -99.8 degrees West

      * Oceana County, MI: -86.4 degrees West


      On a longitude scale, numbers further west are more negative (or further from

      answer.


      **Step 1: Locate Garden County, NE.**

      Garden County is in Nebraska. Nebraska is a state in the Great Plains region
      of the United States. Geographically, it''s roughly in the middle of the US,
      west of the Mississippi River.


      **Step 2: Locate Morrow County, OH.**

      Morrow County is in Ohio. Ohio is a state in the Midwestern United States, east
      of the Mississippi River.


      **Step 3: Compare their general longitudinal positions.**

      Nebraska is generally west of Ohio. States further west have higher (more negative)
      longitudes.


      **Step 4: More precise comparison (optional but confirms).**

      *   The approximate longitude of Garden County, NE (e.g., near Oshkosh, the
      county seat) is around -102.3 degrees West.

      *   The approximate longitude of Morrow County, OH (e.g., near Mount Gilead,
      the county seat) is around -82.8 degrees West.


      On a standard map, locations with more negative longitudes are further west.
      Since -102.3 is a more negative number than -82.8, Garden County, NE is west
      of Morrow County, OH.


      The final answer is $\boxed{Yes}$'

      **Step 1: Find the approximate longitude of Okmulgee County, OK.**

      Okmulgee County is in eastern Oklahoma. Oklahoma is in the Central Time Zone,
      and its eastern border is roughly around 94-95 degrees West longitude. Okmulgee
      is west of Tulsa, which is around 96 degrees West. Let''s estimate Okmulgee
      County''s longitude to be roughly **96 degrees West**.


      **Step 2: Find the approximate longitude of Nash County, NC.**

      Nash County is in eastern North Carolina. North Carolina is in the Eastern Time
      Zone. Its eastern coast is around 75-76 degrees West longitude. Nash County
      is inland but still in the eastern part of the state. Let''s estimate Nash County''s
      longitude to be roughly **78 degrees West**.

      *   Okmulgee County, OK: ~96 degrees West

      *   Nash County, NC: ~78 degrees West


      **Step 4: Determine which is "west of" the other.**

      On a map, as you move to higher numerical degrees of West longitude, you are
      moving further west.

      Since 96 degrees West is a higher numerical value than 78 degrees West, Okmulgee
      County is further west than Nash County.

      answer.


      **Step 1: Find the approximate longitude of Treasure County, MT.**

      Treasure County, MT is located in southeastern Montana. A quick search reveals
      that Montana is largely west of the 100th meridian west. Counties in southeastern
      Montana, like Treasure County, are generally around **107-108 degrees West longitude**.


      **Step 2: Find the approximate longitude of Alger County, MI.**

      Alger County, MI is located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Michigan is
      in the Eastern Time Zone for the most part, and its westernmost points are still
      significantly east of the 100th meridian. Alger County is generally around **86-87
      degrees West longitude**.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      * Treasure County, MT: ~107-108 degrees West

      * Alger County, MI: ~86-87 degrees West


      On a map, as you move further west, the longitude numbers increase (e.g., 90W
      is west of 80W, and 100W is west of 90W).


      Since 107-108 degrees West is a larger number than 86-87 degrees West, Treasure
      County, MT is located further west than Alger County, MI.
