      Emmet County is in Michigan, which is in the Midwest region of the United States.
      It''s in the northern part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula, bordering Lake Michigan.


      Oxford County is in Maine, which is in the northeastern corner of the United
      States (New England region).


      In the United States, states in the Midwest like Michigan are generally west
      of states in the Northeast like Maine. Michigan is considerably west of Maine.

      States.

      - Oxford County is in Maine (ME), which is in the northeastern corner of the
      United States (New England).


      Step 2: Consider the relative east-west positioning of these states.

      - Michigan is located much further west than Maine on the US map.

      - Maine is the easternmost state in the continental United States.

      - Michigan is in the Great Lakes region, significantly to the west of Maine.


      Step 3: Since the counties are in their respective states, their relative positions
      follow the same pattern.

      - Emmet County, MI must be west of Oxford County, ME because the entire state
      of Michigan is west of the entire state of Maine.

      east-west positions of Emmet County, Michigan (MI) and Oxford County, Maine
      (ME).


      First, let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region

      - Maine is in the Northeast/New England region, at the eastern edge of the country


      Since Maine is on the eastern coast of the United States, and Michigan is in

      west of Maine.


      Therefore, Emmet County, MI would be west of Oxford County, ME.</think># Is
      Emmet County, MI located west of Oxford County, ME?


      Let me think about this step by step:


      1. Emmet County is located in Michigan (MI), which is in the Midwest region
      of the United States.

      2. Oxford County is located in Maine (ME), which is in the Northeast region
      of the United States.

      3. Maine is positioned on the far eastern coast of the United States.

      4. Michigan is positioned much more centrally in the United States, around the
      Great Lakes region.

      5. When comparing east-west positions in the United States, states in the Northeast
      (like Maine) are generally east of states in the Midwest (like Michigan).


      Therefore, Emmet County, MI is located west of Oxford County, ME.

      step.


      The question is asking about the relative locations of two US counties:

      1. Emmet County, Michigan (MI)

      2. Oxford County, Maine (ME)


      Specifically, it''s asking if Emmet County is located west of Oxford County.


      To answer this, I need to think about the geographic locations of Michigan and
      Maine within the United States.


      Michigan is located in the Great Lakes region of the upper Midwest.

      Maine is located in the northeastern corner of the United States, in the New
      England region.


      In the United States, states that are further west have a larger longitude value
      (when using the standard notation where west longitudes are negative numbers).
      But that''s not the right way to think about it - west means closer to the Pacific
      Ocean, east means closer to the Atlantic Ocean.


      Michigan is significantly west of Maine. Maine is one of the easternmost states
      in the US, bordering the Atlantic Ocean, while Michigan is in the Midwest.


      So if Emmet County is in Michigan, and Oxford County is in Maine, then Emmet
      County would be west of Oxford County.</think>I need to determine the relative
      east-west positions of these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these counties are located.

      - Emmet County is in Michigan (MI)

      - Oxford County is in Maine (ME)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Michigan is located in the Great Lakes region of the Midwest

      - Maine is located in the far northeastern corner of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Maine is one of the easternmost states in the continental US, bordering the
      Atlantic Ocean

      - Michigan is much further west, in the Midwest region


      Step 4: Determine the relative positions of the counties.

      - Since Emmet County is in Michigan and Oxford County is in Maine, Emmet County
      must be west of Oxford County based on the positions of their respective states.


      YES'

      looking at a standard map. States in the eastern part of the country include
      Maine (ME), which is actually the easternmost state in the continental US. Michigan
      (MI) is located in the Midwest region.


      Since Michigan is in the Midwest and Maine is on the far eastern edge of the
      country, Michigan is west of Maine. This means that any county in Michigan would
      be west of any county in Maine.


      Therefore, Emmet County, MI is west of Oxford County, ME.</think>I need to determine

      - Michigan is significantly west of Maine

      - Maine is the easternmost state in the continental United States

      - Michigan is much closer to the center of the country


      Since Michigan is west of Maine, any county in Michigan (including Emmet County)

      to determine the relative east-west positions of Cache County, UT and Sac County,
      IA.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      UT = Utah

      IA = Iowa


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      Utah is in the western United States, part of the Mountain West region.

      Iowa is in the midwestern United States, in the center of the country.


      Generally speaking, Utah is west of Iowa. This is because the United States
      extends from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west,
      and Utah is much closer to the Pacific than Iowa is.


      Step 3: Specifically for the counties in question:

      Cache County is in Utah, so it would follow the general positioning of Utah.

      Sac County is in Iowa, so it would follow the general positioning of Iowa.


      Therefore, Cache County, UT is west of Sac County, IA.</think>I''ll solve this
      step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Cache County is in Utah (UT)

      - Sac County is in Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of Utah and Iowa.

      - Utah is located in the western United States (in the Mountain West region)

      - Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Utah is significantly west of Iowa on the US map

      - Any county in Utah would be west of any county in Iowa


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion.

      Since Cache County is in Utah, and Sac County is in Iowa, Cache County must
      be west of Sac County.

      First, let''s identify the states:

      - ND is North Dakota, which is in the upper Midwest of the United States


      Since Washington is on the west coast and North Dakota is in the Midwest, generally

      Asotin County is in Washington state, and Oliver County is in North Dakota.
      So geographically, Asotin County would be west of Oliver County.


      Let me double-check this reasoning. The United States generally has states arranged

      West Coast: WA, OR, CA

      Mountain West: ID, MT, WY, NV, UT, CO, AZ, NM

      - North Dakota (ND) is in the upper Midwest


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Washington state is definitely west of North

      Since Asotin County is in Washington state, and Oliver County is in North Dakota,
      and Washington state is west of North Dakota, it follows that Asotin County,
      WA is west of Oliver County, ND.


      But let me double check by thinking about the specific counties. Asotin County
      is in the southeast corner of Washington state. Even though it''s in the eastern
      part of Washington, Washington as a whole is significantly west of North Dakota.
      Oliver County is somewhere in North Dakota, and all of North Dakota is east

      5) Even though Asotin County is in the eastern part of Washington state, and
      Oliver County could be anywhere in North Dakota, the entire state of Washington

      First, let me identify the states:

      - Pottawatomie County is in Oklahoma (OK)

      - Catawba County is in North Carolina (NC)


      In terms of general US geography:

      - Oklahoma is located in the central part of the United States

      - North Carolina is located on the east coast of the United States


      Since Oklahoma is in the central part of the country and North Carolina is on
      the east coast, Oklahoma is west of North Carolina.

      Step 1: Let me identify where each county is located within the United States.

      - Pottawatomie County is in Oklahoma (OK)

      - Catawba County is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - Oklahoma is located in the central part of the United States

      - North Carolina is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Oklahoma sits well to the west of North Carolina on a US map

      - All counties in Oklahoma would be west of all counties in North Carolina


      Therefore, Pottawatomie County, OK is indeed located west of Catawba County,

      - Catawba County is in North Carolina (NC)


      Now, I need to think about the general geographical positions of these states:

      - Oklahoma is located in the central/south-central part of the United States

      - North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, Oklahoma is clearly west of North Carolina.

      - North Carolina is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Oklahoma lies entirely west of North Carolina on a US map

      - All counties in Oklahoma must therefore be west of all counties in North Carolina


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on these states'' positions.

      Since Pottawatomie County is in Oklahoma, and Catawba County is in North Carolina,
      and Oklahoma is west of North Carolina, Pottawatomie County must be west of
      Catawba County.

      To solve this, I need to think about the geographic locations of these states
      first:

      - Kansas (KS) is located in the central part of the United States

      - West Virginia (WV) is located in the eastern part of the United States, specifically
      in the Appalachian region


      Since Kansas is in the central US and West Virginia is in the eastern US, Kansas
      is generally west of West Virginia.


      Given that Rooks County is in Kansas and Ritchie County is in West Virginia,
      it follows that Rooks County, KS is west of Ritchie County, WV. The specific
      counties'' locations within their states don''t change this conclusion, because
      the entire state of Kansas is west of the entire state of West Virginia.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step:


      Step 1: First, I need to consider the locations of the states where these counties
      are found.

      - Kansas (KS) is located in the central United States

      - West Virginia (WV) is located in the eastern United States, specifically in
      the Appalachian region


      Step 2: Looking at a map of the US, Kansas is significantly west of West Virginia.
      In fact, the entire state of Kansas lies west of West Virginia.


      Step 3: Since Rooks County is within Kansas and Ritchie County is within West
      Virginia, their relative positions follow their states'' positions.


      Step 4: Even if Rooks County were in the easternmost part of Kansas and Ritchie
      County were in the westernmost part of West Virginia, Rooks County would still
      be west of Ritchie County because of the states'' relative positions.

      in New England

      3. Generally, Iowa is west of Massachusetts


      To be more precise:

      - Iowa is approximately in the middle of the continental US, while Massachusetts
      is on the east coast

      - Longitude measures east-west position, with lower (more negative) numbers
      being further west in the US

      - Ida County would be somewhere in Iowa

      - Berkshire County would be somewhere in Massachusetts


      Since Iowa as a state is entirely west of Massachusetts as a state, it follows
      that any county in Iowa (including Ida County) would be west of any county in
      Massachusetts (including Berkshire County).


      Therefore, Ida County, IA is located west of Berkshire County, MA.</think>I''ll
      determine the relative positions of these two counties step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these counties are located.

      - Ida County is in Iowa (IA)

      - Berkshire County is in Massachusetts (MA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Massachusetts is located in the Northeast region (New England) on the East
      Coast


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Iowa is significantly west of Massachusetts

      - The entire state of Iowa lies west of the entire state of Massachusetts


      Step 4: Since the counties are within their respective states, their positions
      follow the same relationship.

      - Ida County, being in Iowa, must be west of Berkshire County, which is in Massachusetts


      YES, Ida County, IA is located west of Berkshire County, MA.'

      To be more specific:

      - Ida County is a county in Iowa

      - Berkshire County is a county in Massachusetts

      Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Massachusetts
      is in the Northeast region. On a U.S. map, Iowa is significantly west of Massachusetts.


      Step 3: Consider county positions within their states.

      Even if these counties were at the extreme edges of their states (Ida County
      at the easternmost part of Iowa and Berkshire County at the westernmost part
      of Massachusetts), the overall east-west positioning of the states would still
      place Ida County west of Berkshire County.

      I need to determine if Jackson County, MO is located west of Queen Anne''s County,
      MD.


      First, let me think about the general geographic locations of the states:

      - Missouri (MO) is located in the central United States

      - Maryland (MD) is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Since Missouri is in the central part of the country and Maryland is on the

      Now, more specifically about the counties:

      - Jackson County is in Missouri (which we established is west of Maryland)

      - Queen Anne''s County is in Maryland (which we established is east of Missouri)


      Therefore, Jackson County, MO would be located west of Queen Anne''s County,
      MD.</think>I''ll solve this step-by-step:

      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of these states.

      Step 4: Since counties are contained within their respective states, Jackson

      relative locations of two US counties:

      1. Jackson County, MO (Missouri)

      2. Queen Anne''s County, MD (Maryland)


      Specifically, it''s asking whether Jackson County, MO is located west of Queen
      Anne''s County, MD.


      To answer this, I need to think about the geographic locations of these states
      and counties.


      Missouri is located in the central United States, somewhat toward the west side
      of the country. Maryland is on the East Coast of the United States.


      Generally speaking, Missouri is west of Maryland. The entire state of Missouri
      lies west of the entire state of Maryland.


      So, if Jackson County is in Missouri and Queen Anne''s County is in Maryland,
      then Jackson County, MO must be west of Queen Anne''s County, MD.


      Let me confirm this reasoning by thinking about the general locations:

      - Missouri borders Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma,
      Kansas, and Nebraska

      - Maryland borders Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and the
      Atlantic Ocean


      There''s no overlap, and Missouri is definitely west of Maryland.</think># Step-by-Step
      Reasoning


      To determine if Jackson County, MO is located west of Queen Anne''s County,
      MD, I need to consider the geographic locations of these counties and their
      states.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Jackson County is in Missouri (MO)

      - Queen Anne''s County is in Maryland (MD)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      Missouri is located in the central United States, while Maryland is on the East
      Coast. On a map of the United States, Missouri is positioned significantly to
      the west of Maryland.


      ## Step 3: Consider county locations within their states

      While specific counties might be in different parts of their respective states,
      the entire state of Missouri lies west of the entire state of Maryland. There
      is no geographic overlap between these states.


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Since Missouri is entirely west of Maryland, any county in Missouri (including
      Jackson County) must be west of any county in Maryland (including Queen Anne''s
      County).

      Step 2: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      On a U.S. map, Arizona is significantly west of Arkansas. Arizona borders California
      on its western side and New Mexico on its eastern side, while Arkansas is much
      further east in the country.


      Step 3: Since counties are contained within their respective states, Navajo
      County must be within Arizona''s boundaries, and Arkansas County must be within
      Arkansas'' boundaries.


      Step 4: Because Arizona is entirely west of Arkansas, any county in Arizona
      (including Navajo County) must be west of any county in Arkansas (including
      Arkansas County).

      First, I need to consider the states:

      - South Dakota (SD) is in the northern part of the central United States

      - New York (NY) is in the northeastern United States


      Geographically, South Dakota is significantly west of New York state. South
      Dakota is in the Great Plains region, while New York is on the East Coast.


      Since Charles Mix County is in South Dakota, and Oneida County is in New York,
      it''s highly likely that Charles Mix County is west of Oneida County.


      To be completely certain, I should consider if there are any unusual geographic
      arrangements of these counties within their states, but generally counties in
      South Dakota would be west of counties in New York because the entire state
      of South Dakota is west of the entire state of New York.</think>I''ll solve
      this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the two counties and their states.

      - Charles Mix County is in South Dakota (SD)

      - Oneida County is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - South Dakota is located in the north-central United States

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - South Dakota is significantly west of New York on the U.S. map

      - The easternmost part of South Dakota is still west of the westernmost part
      of New York


      Step 4: Apply this to the counties.

      - Since Charles Mix County is within South Dakota and Oneida County is within
      New York, the same east-west relationship applies to these counties.


      YES, Charles Mix County, SD is located west of Oneida County, NY.'

      The United States generally has states arranged from west to east as follows:

      - Western states (like California, Oregon, Washington)

      - Mountain states (like Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado)

      - Plains states (like North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska)

      - Midwestern states (like Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri)

      - Southern and Eastern states (like New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia)


      South Dakota is located in the Great Plains region, roughly in the middle of
      the country but more toward the west than the east.


      New York is located on the East Coast of the United States.


      So generally speaking, South Dakota is west of New York.


      Now, for the specific counties:

      - Charles Mix County is in South Dakota

      - Oneida County is in New York


      Since South Dakota is west of New York, Charles Mix County, SD should be west

      Let me think about the geographic locations of these counties:


      1. Charles Mix County is in South Dakota (SD)

      2. Oneida County is in New York (NY)

      3. South Dakota is located in the Great Plains region of the United States

      4. New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      5. When looking at a map of the US, South Dakota is significantly west of New
      York state


      Since Charles Mix County is in South Dakota, and Oneida County is in New York,

      In the United States, South Dakota is in the Midwest/Great Plains region, while
      New York is in the Northeast. Generally speaking, South Dakota is west of New
      York state.


      Let me think about their specific locations:


      1. Charles Mix County is in South Dakota, which is in the central part of the
      United States.

      2. Oneida County is in New York state, which is in the northeastern part of
      the United States.


      The United States generally follows a layout where states further west have
      higher longitude values (in negative numbers, so actually lower numerical values
      since they''re negative). Since South Dakota is significantly west of New York,
      Charles Mix County (in SD) would be west of Oneida County (in NY).


      Therefore, Charles Mix County, SD is located west of Oneida County, NY.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the states these counties are located in.

      - Charles Mix County is in South Dakota (SD)

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic layout of the United States.

      - South Dakota is located in the Midwest/Great Plains region

      - New York is located in the Northeast region


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on a west-east axis.

      - States in the Midwest (like South Dakota) are positioned west of states in
      the Northeast (like New York)

      - Therefore, counties in South Dakota would be west of counties in New York


      Since Charles Mix County is in South Dakota, and Oneida County is in New York,
      Charles Mix County is located west of Oneida County.

      2. First, I need to know where these counties are located within their respective
      states.

      3. Then I need to compare their relative east-west positions.


      Texas (TX) is located in the southwestern United States, while South Carolina
      (SC) is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States.


      In general:

      - Texas is significantly west of South Carolina

      - All counties in Texas would be west of counties in South Carolina


      So Coleman County, TX would be west of Beaufort County, SC based on the general
      geographic positions of their respective states.


      Let me double-check my logic:

      - Texas borders New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana

      - South Carolina borders North Carolina and Georgia

      1. Yellow Medicine County is in Minnesota (MN)

      2. Windsor County is in Vermont (VT)


      Looking at the geographic layout of the United States:

      - Minnesota is located in the Upper Midwest region

      - Vermont is located in the Northeast region (New England)


      The United States generally extends from west to east with:

      - Western states (Pacific and Mountain regions)

      - Midwestern states (including Minnesota)

      - Eastern states (including Vermont in New England)


      Minnesota is significantly west of Vermont on the US map. All counties in Minnesota,

      Minnesota (MN) is a state in the Upper Midwest region of the United States.
      It borders Canada to the north, Lake Superior to the northeast, Wisconsin to
      the east, Iowa to the south, and North Dakota and South Dakota to the west.


      Vermont (VT) is a state in the northeastern United States, located in the New
      England region. It borders New Hampshire to the east, Massachusetts to the south,
      New York to the west, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north.

      Mississippi County is located in the northeastern part of Arkansas, bordering
      the Mississippi River. Perquimans County is located in the northeastern part
      of North Carolina.


      Even though Mississippi County is in the eastern part of Arkansas, and Perquimans
      County is in the eastern part of North Carolina, Arkansas as a whole is still
      considerably west of North Carolina.


      So, Mississippi County, AR should be located west of Perquimans County, NC.</think>To
      determine if Mississippi County, AR is located west of Perquimans County, NC,
      I''ll think about their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' locations. Arkansas is in the south-central United
      States, while North Carolina is on the east coast.


      Step 2: Arkansas as a whole state is significantly west of North Carolina. Even
      the easternmost part of Arkansas is generally west of the westernmost part of
      North Carolina.


      Step 3: Mississippi County is in the northeastern corner of Arkansas, along
      the Mississippi River. Even though it''s on the eastern edge of Arkansas, it''s
      still in a state that lies entirely west of North Carolina.


      Step 4: Perquimans County is in the northeastern part of North Carolina, near
      the Atlantic coast.


      Step 5: Since Arkansas is west of North Carolina, and Mississippi County is
      in Arkansas while Perquimans County is in North Carolina, Mississippi County
      must be west of Perquimans County.

      1. Identify where Mississippi County, Arkansas is located

      2. Identify where Perquimans County, North Carolina is located

      3. Compare their relative east-west positions


      First, Mississippi County is in Arkansas (AR). Arkansas is in the south-central
      United States.


      Perquimans County is in North Carolina (NC). North Carolina is on the east coast
      of the United States.


      Generally speaking, Arkansas is west of North Carolina in the United States.
      The entire state of Arkansas is west of North Carolina.


      Therefore, Mississippi County, AR would be located west of Perquimans County,
      NC.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Let me identify the states where these counties are located.

      - Mississippi County is in Arkansas (AR)

      - Perquimans County is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these states.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central region of the United States

      - North Carolina is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Arkansas is entirely west of North Carolina

      - All counties in Arkansas must therefore be west of all counties in North Carolina


      Step 4: Make the conclusion.

      Since Mississippi County is in Arkansas, and Perquimans County is in North Carolina,
      Mississippi County must be west of Perquimans County.

      County, MO is located west of Wicomico County, MD. Let me break this down:


      1. First, let me identify the states: MO is Missouri, and MD is Maryland.

      2. Generally speaking, Missouri is in the central part of the United States,
      while Maryland is on the East Coast.

      3. Since the United States spans east to west, with the East Coast being the
      easternmost part and the West Coast being the westernmost part, Missouri is
      west of Maryland.

      4. If Missouri is west of Maryland, then any county in Missouri would be west
      of any county in Maryland.

      5. Therefore, Reynolds County, MO would be west of Wicomico County, MD.


      Let me verify this by considering the general geographic layout of the US:

      - Maryland is on the East Coast, bordering the Atlantic Ocean

      - Missouri is in the Midwest, much further inland and west of Maryland

      - There are several states between Missouri and Maryland (like West Virginia,
      Ohio, Indiana, Illinois)


      Given this information, I can confidently say that Reynolds County, MO is indeed
      west of Wicomico County, MD.</think>To determine if Reynolds County, MO is located
      west of Wicomico County, MD, I need to consider the geographic positions of
      these counties and their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - Reynolds County is in Missouri (MO)

      - Wicomico County is in Maryland (MD)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Maryland is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Missouri is located in the Midwestern United States, significantly inland
      from the East Coast


      Step 3: Compare the relative east-west positions.

      - Maryland''s position on the East Coast places it very far east in the continental
      US

      - Missouri is several states west of Maryland (with states like Pennsylvania,
      Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois between them)


      Step 4: Conclude about the specific counties.

      Since Missouri is definitely west of Maryland, any county in Missouri (including
      Reynolds County) would be west of any county in Maryland (including Wicomico
      County).


      YES, Reynolds County, MO is located west of Wicomico County, MD.'

      County, Maryland (MD).


      To determine if Reynolds County, MO is west of Wicomico County, MD, I need to
      think about the relative positions of these states in the US.


      Missouri (MO) is located in the central United States, roughly in the middle
      of the country.


      Maryland (MD) is located on the East Coast of the United States.


      Generally speaking, Missouri is west of Maryland. The entire state of Missouri

      - Wicomico County is in Maryland (MD)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of these states.

      - Missouri is located in the central United States

      - Maryland is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Maryland is positioned on the Atlantic coast, very far east in the continental
      US

      - Missouri is positioned in the central part of the country, well to the west
      of Maryland


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the counties.

      First, let me think about the states:

      - Missouri (MO) is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Maryland (MD) is located on the East Coast of the United States

      First, let me think about where these states are:

      - Wisconsin (WI) is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York (NY) is in the Northeast region of the United States


      Generally speaking, Wisconsin is west of New York.


      Now, to be more precise about the specific counties:

      - Ozaukee County is in Wisconsin

      - Schoharie County is in New York


      Since Wisconsin is west of New York, and these counties are within their respective
      states, it''s very likely that Ozaukee County, WI is west of Schoharie County,
      NY.


      To confirm, I know that:

      - Wisconsin borders Lake Michigan to the east

      - New York extends from the Atlantic coast inland


      Even if Ozaukee County is on the eastern edge of Wisconsin and Schoharie County
      is on the western edge of New York, Wisconsin as a whole is still significantly
      west of New York.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: First, I need to identify which states these counties are in.

      - Ozaukee County is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - Schoharie County is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Now I need to determine the general geographic relationship between
      these states.

      - Wisconsin is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York is located in the Northeast region of the United States

      - Wisconsin is positioned west of New York on the US map


      Step 3: Even considering the specific locations of these counties within their
      states:

      - Ozaukee County is in eastern Wisconsin (it borders Lake Michigan)

      - Schoharie County is in east-central New York

      - The easternmost point of Wisconsin is still west of the westernmost point
      of New York


      Therefore, Ozaukee County, WI is indeed located west of Schoharie County, NY.

      First, let''s consider the states:

      - Wisconsin (WI) is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York (NY) is in the Northeast region of the United States


      Generally speaking, Wisconsin is west of New York. The United States has states
      arranged roughly from west to east as you go from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic
      Ocean. Wisconsin is closer to the middle of the country, while New York is on
      the eastern seaboard.


      Now, for the specific counties:

      - Ozaukee County is in Wisconsin

      - Schoharie County is in New York


      Since Wisconsin as a whole is west of New York as a whole, it''s very likely
      that Ozaukee County, WI is west of Schoharie County, NY. There might be some
      unusual geographic configurations where this wouldn''t be true, but that would
      be extremely unlikely given the significant distance between these states.


      So Ozaukee County, WI is almost certainly located west of Schoharie County,
      NY.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these two
      counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these counties are located.

      - Ozaukee County is in Wisconsin (WI)

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Wisconsin is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York is located in the Northeast region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Wisconsin is significantly west of New York on the U.S. map

      - The entire state of Wisconsin lies west of New York state


      Step 4: Apply this to the counties.

      - Since Ozaukee County is in Wisconsin, and Schoharie County is in New York,
      and Wisconsin is entirely west of New York, Ozaukee County must be west of Schoharie
      County.


      YES, Ozaukee County, WI is located west of Schoharie County, NY.'

      Since Wisconsin as a state is west of New York state, and we''re comparing counties

      First, let''s consider the states:

      - Texas (TX) is located in the south-central part of the United States

      - Tennessee (TN) is located in the southeastern United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, Texas is generally west of Tennessee. The

      - Ochiltree County is in the Texas Panhandle, in the northern part of Texas

      - Cocke County is in eastern Tennessee, near the North Carolina border


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Since Texas is entirely west of Tennessee on the map, and Ochiltree County is

      Carolina.


      Step 1: Let me think about the general locations of Texas (TX) and North Carolina
      (NC) within the United States.

      - Texas is in the southwestern part of the United States

      - North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States


      Step 2: Given their state locations, Texas is clearly west of North Carolina
      on a map of the United States.


      Step 3: Since Collingsworth County is in Texas, and Transylvania County is in
      North Carolina, and Texas is west of North Carolina, it follows that Collingsworth
      County, TX is west of Transylvania County, NC.


      So the answer is YES, Collingsworth County, TX is located west of Transylvania
      County, NC.</think>To determine whether Collingsworth County, TX is located
      west of Transylvania County, NC, I need to consider the geographic locations

      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Texas is located in the southwestern United States, while North Carolina is
      on the eastern seaboard.


      Step 2: Compare the states'' longitudes.

      Texas lies significantly west of North Carolina on the map of the United States.
      All of Texas is west of all of North Carolina.


      Step 3: Consider the counties'' positions within their respective states.

      Since Collingsworth County is in Texas and Transylvania County is in North Carolina,
      the specific positions of these counties within their states don''t change the
      fact that any county in Texas will be west of any county in North Carolina.

      First, let me consider their states:

      - Minnehaha County is in South Dakota (SD)

      - Saginaw County is in Michigan (MI)


      South Dakota is in the western part of the United States, while Michigan is
      in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, generally east of South Dakota.


      The United States generally has states arranged where western states have lower
      longitudes (more negative numbers) than eastern states. Since South Dakota is
      west of Michigan, it''s very likely that Minnehaha County, SD is west of Saginaw
      County, MI.


      To be even more certain, I can consider the approximate locations:

      - South Dakota borders North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, and
      Montana

      - Michigan is surrounded by the Great Lakes and borders Wisconsin, Indiana,
      and Ohio


      This confirms that South Dakota is indeed west of Michigan on the map, so Minnehaha

      - Minnehaha County is in South Dakota (SD)

      - Saginaw County is in Michigan (MI)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - South Dakota is located in the upper Great Plains region of the United States

      - Michigan is located in the Great Lakes region, significantly to the east of
      South Dakota


      ## Step 3: Compare relative positions

      The entire state of South Dakota lies west of Michigan on the US map. South
      Dakota is in the western half of the continental US, while Michigan is more
      in the eastern half.


      ## Step 4: Conclusion about the counties

      To determine if one is west of the other, I need to compare their relative positions
      on a west-east axis (essentially comparing their longitudes).


      The United States generally has states arranged with western states being further
      west (toward the Pacific Ocean) and eastern states being further east (toward

      South Dakota is in the upper Midwest of the United States, while Michigan is
      in the Great Lakes region further east.

      Step 1: Identify the states where these counties are located.

      - Winneshiek County is in Iowa (IA)

      - Steuben County is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Iowa and New York.

      - Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York is located in the Northeast region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Iowa is significantly west of New York on the US map

      - All counties in Iowa would be west of all counties in New York, regardless
      of their specific locations within their respective states


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Winneshiek County is in Iowa, and Steuben County is in New York, and Iowa
      is west of New York, Winneshiek County must be west of Steuben County.

      County, Iowa is located west of Steuben County, New York, I need to think about
      the relative positions of Iowa and New York within the United States, and then
      consider the specific counties.


      First, let''s consider the states:

      - Iowa (IA) is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York (NY) is in the Northeast region of the United States


      Generally speaking, Iowa is west of New York. The United States is oriented
      such that the East Coast (including New York) is on the eastern side of the
      country, while the Midwest (including Iowa) is more central but definitely west
      of New York.


      Now, for the specific counties:

      - Winneshiek County is in Iowa

      - Steuben County is in New York


      Since Iowa is west of New York, and these counties are within their respective
      states, it''s almost certain that Winneshiek County, IA is west of Steuben County,
      NY.


      To be even more precise, we could consider if these counties are positioned
      unusually within their states (e.g., if Winneshiek were on the far eastern edge
      of Iowa and Steuben were on the far western edge of New York), but even in that
      case, the overall east-west positioning of the states would likely still make
      Winneshiek County west of Steuben County.</think># Is Winneshiek County, IA
      located west of Steuben County, NY?


      I need to consider the geographic positions of these counties and their states.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Winneshiek County is in Iowa (IA)

      - Steuben County is in New York (NY)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship of these states

      Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while New York is
      located in the Northeast. On a map of the United States, Iowa is positioned
      significantly to the west of New York.


      ## Step 3: Consider county positions within their states

      Even if Winneshiek County were on the easternmost edge of Iowa and Steuben County
      were on the westernmost edge of New York, the overall east-west positioning
      of these states means that any county in Iowa would still be west of any county
      in New York.


      ## Conclusion

      YES, Winneshiek County, IA is located west of Steuben County, NY.'

      Kansas (KS) is located in the Midwest/Great Plains region of the United States.
      It''s roughly in the middle of the country, but definitely in the western half.


      Maryland (MD) is located on the East Coast of the United States, in the Mid-Atlantic
      region.


      Given the general geography of the United States, states in the Midwest like
      Kansas are located west of states on the East Coast like Maryland.


      Therefore, Leavenworth County, which is in Kansas, would be located west of
      Charles County, which is in Maryland.</think>I''ll determine this by thinking
      about the relative positions of Kansas and Maryland in the United States.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the two states.

      - Kansas (KS) is located in the Midwest/Great Plains region of the United States.

      - Maryland (MD) is located on the East Coast in the Mid-Atlantic region.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Kansas is situated roughly in the middle of the continental United States.

      - Maryland is on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      - All of Kansas is west of all of Maryland on a map of the United States.

      KS is located west of Charles County, MD, I need to consider the relative positions
      of Kansas and Maryland in the United States.


      First, let me recall the general locations of these states:

      - Kansas (KS) is located in the central part of the United States

      - Maryland (MD) is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Since the United States spans from east to west with the East Coast states being
      the easternmost and the West Coast states (like California, Oregon, Washington)
      being the westernmost, I can determine their relative positions.


      Maryland, being on the East Coast, is much further east than Kansas, which is
      in the central part of the country. Therefore, any county in Kansas, including
      Leavenworth County, would be located west of any county in Maryland, including
      Charles County.


      So Leavenworth County, KS is indeed west of Charles County, MD.</think>To determine
      if Leavenworth County, KS is located west of Charles County, MD, I need to consider
      the geographic locations of Kansas and Maryland within the United States.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the states.

      - Kansas (KS) is located in the central United States, in the Midwest region.

      - Maryland (MD) is located on the East Coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider their positions on the east-west axis.

      - States on the East Coast (like Maryland) are much further east than central
      states (like Kansas).

      - The United States generally spans from east (Atlantic Ocean) to west (Pacific
      Ocean).


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific counties.

      - Since Leavenworth County is in Kansas, it must be west of any location in
      Maryland.

      - Charles County, being in Maryland on the East Coast, is east of locations
      in Kansas.


      YES, Leavenworth County, KS is located west of Charles County, MD.'

      - Maryland is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - All of Kansas is significantly west of all of Maryland

      - The eastern edge of Kansas is hundreds of miles west of the western edge of
      Maryland


      Step 4: Since the counties are within their respective states, Leavenworth County
      must be west of Charles County.

      First, I need to recall the general geographic positions of Montana and Minnesota.
      Montana is in the western United States, bordering Canada to the north. Minnesota
      is in the upper Midwest, also bordering Canada to the north, but further east
      than Montana.


      In the United States, states further west have a higher longitude (more negative
      longitude value since we''re in the western hemisphere). So Montana is west
      of Minnesota.


      Now, Musselshell County is somewhere in Montana, and Todd County is somewhere
      in Minnesota. Without knowing the exact locations within each state, I can generally
      say that any county in Montana would be west of any county in Minnesota, simply
      because Montana as a state is entirely west of Minnesota as a state.

      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Montana is located in the western United States, while Minnesota is in the upper

      Step 3: Consider county positions within their states.

      Even without knowing the exact locations of these counties within their respective
      states, any county in Montana must be west of any county in Minnesota because
      the entire state of Montana is west of the entire state of Minnesota.

      First, let me identify which states these counties are in:

      - Pemiscot County is in Missouri (MO)

      - Hyde County is in North Carolina (NC)


      The United States has Missouri in the central part of the country, while North
      Carolina is on the east coast. Missouri is generally west of North Carolina.


      Since Pemiscot County is in Missouri, and Hyde County is in North Carolina,
      and Missouri is west of North Carolina, it follows that Pemiscot County, MO
      is west of Hyde County, NC.


      So the answer should be YES.</think>To determine if Pemiscot County, MO is located
      west of Hyde County, NC, I need to consider their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these counties are located.

      - Pemiscot County is in Missouri (MO)

      - Hyde County is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic position of these states.

      - Missouri is located in the central part of the United States

      - North Carolina is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Missouri is significantly west of North Carolina on the US map

      - Any county in Missouri would be west of any county in North Carolina


      Step 4: Draw conclusion based on the states'' positions.

      Since Pemiscot County is in Missouri, and Hyde County is in North Carolina,
      and Missouri is west of North Carolina, Pemiscot County must be west of Hyde
      County.

      - Kansas is in the central United States

      - Ohio is in the eastern part of the Midwest


      Generally speaking, Kansas is west of Ohio. But I need to confirm the specific
      locations of these counties.


      Kansas is entirely west of Ohio on the US map. Kansas is in the central plains

      - Bibb County is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Recall the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Texas is in the southern United States, bordering Mexico, and is west of states
      like Louisiana, Arkansas, etc.

      - Georgia is in the southeastern United States, on the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Texas is generally west of Georgia on the US map.

      - Since Collin County is in Texas and Bibb County is in Georgia, Collin County
      should be west of Bibb County.


      Let me double-check this logic. The question is asking about the specific counties,
      not just the states. However, since Texas is entirely west of Georgia, any county
      in Texas (including Collin) would be west of any county in Georgia (including
      Bibb).</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west

      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Texas is entirely west of Georgia on the US map

      - Georgia borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east

      - Texas is several states away from Georgia, with states like Louisiana, Mississippi,
      and Alabama in between


      Step 4: Since Collin County is in Texas and Bibb County is in Georgia, and Texas
      is west of Georgia, Collin County must be west of Bibb County.

      determine the relative positions of Eddy County, NM and Marengo County, AL on
      a map of the United States.


      First, let me identify the states:

      - NM stands for New Mexico, which is in the southwestern United States

      - AL stands for Alabama, which is in the southeastern United States


      Generally speaking, New Mexico is located west of Alabama on the map of the
      United States. New Mexico borders Arizona to its west, Texas to its east, Colorado
      to its north, and Mexico to its south. Alabama is located along the Gulf Coast,
      bordered by Florida to the southeast, Georgia to the east, Tennessee to the
      north, and Mississippi to the west.

      Step 2: Determine the general geographic relationship between these states.

      New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States, while Alabama is in
      the southeastern United States. On a map of the US, New Mexico is significantly
      west of Alabama.


      Step 3: Consider county-specific locations.

      While counties within states can have varying positions, no county in New Mexico
      could be east of any county in Alabama because the entire state of New Mexico
      lies west of Alabama. Several states (including Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi)
      separate these two states.


      Therefore, Eddy County, NM must be located west of Marengo County, AL.

      - South Dakota (SD) is in the north-central United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, Idaho is generally west of South Dakota.
      The entire state of Idaho is west of the entire state of South Dakota.


      Now, specifically for these counties:

      - Bingham County is in Idaho

      - Brookings County is in South Dakota


      Since Idaho is entirely west of South Dakota, any county in Idaho (including

      - Kentucky (KY) is in the Eastern/Southeastern US


      Step 2: In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), Kansas is generally west

      the United States:

      - Texas is located in the southwestern part of the United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern part of the United States


      Generally speaking, Texas is west of Georgia on the map of the United States.
      Since Hill County is in Texas and Lanier County is in Georgia, it follows that
      Hill County, TX would be west of Lanier County, GA.


      So my answer is YES, Hill County, TX is located west of Lanier County, GA.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions of
      these two counties.

      - Hill County is in Texas (TX)

      - Lanier County is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states within the US.

      - Texas is located in the southwestern/south-central United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - All of Texas is west of Georgia on the US map

      - Therefore, any county in Texas (including Hill County) would be west of any
      county in Georgia (including Lanier County)


      YES, Hill County, TX is located west of Lanier County, GA.'

      to determine the relative locations of St. Charles County, MO and Manassas Park
      City, VA. Specifically, I need to determine if St. Charles County is west of
      Manassas Park City.


      Let me think about where these places are:


      1. St. Charles County, MO - This is in Missouri (MO), which is in the Midwest
      region of the United States.

      2. Manassas Park City, VA - This is in Virginia (VA), which is on the East Coast
      of the United States.


      In terms of U.S. geography, Missouri is definitely west of Virginia. The entire
      state of Missouri is west of the entire state of Virginia. So any county in
      Missouri would be west of any city in Virginia.


      Therefore, St. Charles County, MO is indeed west of Manassas Park City, VA.</think>I''ll
      solve this by determining the geographic positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states these locations are in.

      - St. Charles County is in Missouri (MO)

      - Manassas Park City is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Missouri is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Virginia
      is on the East Coast.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      Missouri lies significantly west of Virginia on the U.S. map. The easternmost
      point of Missouri is still west of the westernmost point of Virginia.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific locations.

      Since St. Charles County is in Missouri and Manassas Park City is in Virginia,
      St. Charles County must be west of Manassas Park City.


      YES'

      - South Dakota (SD) is in the upper midwest of the United States

      - Michigan (MI) is also in the midwest, but further east


      Generally speaking, South Dakota is west of Michigan on the map of the United
      States. Michigan borders the Great Lakes on the east side of the midwest, while
      South Dakota is further west in the Great Plains region.


      Since Edmunds County is in South Dakota, and Missaukee County is in Michigan,
      it''s very likely that Edmunds County is west of Missaukee County. But let me
      be sure by thinking about the exact locations of these counties within their
      states.


      Even if Edmunds County were on the eastern edge of South Dakota and Missaukee
      County were on the western edge of Michigan, Edmunds County would still be west
      of Missaukee County because the entire state of South Dakota is west of Michigan.


      Therefore, Edmunds County, SD must be located west of Missaukee County, MI.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step:


      Step 1: First, I need to identify which states these counties are in.

      - Edmunds County is in South Dakota (SD)

      - Missaukee County is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states relative to each other.

      - South Dakota is located in the upper Midwest, bordering North Dakota, Minnesota,
      Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Montana

      - Michigan is also in the Midwest but is much further east, bordered by Wisconsin,
      Indiana, Ohio, and the Great Lakes


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions.

      - The entirety of South Dakota lies west of Michigan on a U.S. map

      - Even the easternmost point of South Dakota is west of the westernmost point
      of Michigan


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion about the counties.

      - Since Edmunds County is in South Dakota, and Missaukee County is in Michigan,
      Edmunds County must be west of Missaukee County


      YES, Edmunds County, SD is located west of Missaukee County, MI.'

      positions of two counties: Edmunds County, SD (South Dakota) and Missaukee County,
      MI (Michigan).


      To determine if one is west of the other, I need to think about the geographic
      positions of South Dakota and Michigan in the United States.


      South Dakota is in the upper Midwest, bordering North Dakota to the north, Minnesota
      to the east, Iowa to the southeast, Nebraska to the south, Wyoming to the west,
      and Montana to the northwest.


      Michigan is also in the Midwest, but further east than South Dakota. Michigan
      is east of Wisconsin, which itself is east of Minnesota, which is east of South
      Dakota.


      Based on the overall positions of the states, any county in South Dakota would
      be west of any county in Michigan, because South Dakota as a state is entirely
      west of Michigan.


      Therefore, Edmunds County, South Dakota would be west of Missaukee County, Michigan.</think>To

      South Dakota is located in the upper Midwest of the United States.

      Michigan is also in the Midwest, but positioned much further east.


      Step 2: Compare the states'' relative positions.

      South Dakota sits west of Minnesota.

      Michigan sits east of Wisconsin, which is east of Minnesota.

      This means South Dakota is entirely west of Michigan on the map.


      Step 3: Apply this to the counties.

      Since Edmunds County is in South Dakota, and Missaukee County is in Michigan,
      the relative positions of their states apply to the counties as well.


      Therefore, Edmunds County, SD is indeed located west of Missaukee County, MI.

      South Dakota (SD) is located west of Missaukee County, Michigan (MI).


      To solve this, I need to consider the relative positions of these states and
      counties:


      1. South Dakota (SD) is in the upper Midwest, bordering North Dakota, Minnesota,
      Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Montana.

      2. Michigan (MI) is in the Great Lakes region, consisting of two peninsulas
      (Upper and Lower).


      Generally speaking, South Dakota is west of Michigan. The entire state of South
      Dakota is west of Michigan on a map of the United States. Since Edmunds County
      is in South Dakota, and Missaukee County is in Michigan, it would follow that
      Edmunds County is west of Missaukee County.

      of Jasper County, MO and Bland County, VA and compare them.


      First, let''s identify the states:

      - MO stands for Missouri, which is a state in the Midwest of the United States

      - VA stands for Virginia, which is a state on the East Coast of the United States


      In terms of relative east-west positioning, Missouri is generally west of Virginia.
      The United States roughly has states arranged with the East Coast states (like
      Virginia) in the east, and as you move westward you encounter Midwestern states
      like Missouri, then Mountain states, and finally West Coast states.


      So geographically speaking, any county in Missouri would typically be west of
      any county in Virginia.


      Therefore, Jasper County, MO is located west of Bland County, VA.</think>To
      determine whether Jasper County, MO is located west of Bland County, VA, I need
      to analyze their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - MO is Missouri

      - VA is Virginia


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      Missouri is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Virginia
      is on the East Coast.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning

      Looking at a map of the United States, Missouri is significantly west of Virginia.
      The entire state of Missouri lies west of Virginia.


      Step 4: Since Jasper County is in Missouri and Bland County is in Virginia,
      their relative positions follow their states'' positions.


      YES, Jasper County, MO is located west of Bland County, VA.'

    900b30ea-c0c9-41ba-bbc6-5d10ded7b7b5: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative geographical positions of Jasper County, Missouri
      (MO) and Bland County, Virginia (VA).


      First, I''ll think about the general locations of the states:

      - Missouri (MO) is located in the Midwest/Central United States

      - Virginia (VA) is located on the East Coast of the United States


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), Missouri is significantly west
      of Virginia. Missouri is roughly in the middle of the country, while Virginia
      is on the eastern seaboard.


      Since Jasper County is in Missouri and Bland County is in Virginia, it follows
      that Jasper County, MO would be west of Bland County, VA - regardless of their
      specific locations within their respective states. This is because the entirety
      of Missouri is west of the entirety of Virginia.


      To be thorough, I should note that:

      - Jasper County is in southwestern Missouri

      - Bland County is in southwestern Virginia


      But even though both counties are in the southwestern portions of their respective
      states, the fact that Missouri as a whole is west of Virginia means that Jasper
      County, MO is definitely west of Bland County, VA.</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two counties.


      Step 1: Consider the states where these counties are located.

      - Jasper County is in Missouri (MO)

      - Bland County is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Missouri is located in the central/midwest region of the United States, while
      Virginia is on the East Coast. When looking at a U.S. map, Missouri is significantly
      west of Virginia.


      Step 3: Consider county positions within their states.

      Even if Jasper County were in eastern Missouri and Bland County were in western
      Virginia, Missouri as a whole is so much farther west than Virginia that any
      county in Missouri would be west of any county in Virginia.


      YES, Jasper County, MO is located west of Bland County, VA.'

      1. First, I''ll identify where Missouri and Virginia are located relative to
      each other:

      - Missouri is located in the Midwest/central United States

      - Virginia is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Generally, Missouri is west of Virginia


      2. Now, let''s check if Jasper County and Bland County follow this general pattern:

      - Jasper County is in Missouri, which we''ve established is west of Virginia

      - Bland County is in Virginia, which we''ve established is east of Missouri


      Since Missouri is west of Virginia, and the counties are in their respective
      states, Jasper County, MO would be located west of Bland County, VA.


      This is a clear-cut case because we''re comparing counties from states that
      are distinctly separated east-to-west with no overlap in longitude. Any county
      in Missouri will be west of any county in Virginia.</think>To determine if Jasper

      Missouri is located in the Midwest/central United States, while Virginia is
      on the East Coast. Geographically, Missouri lies significantly west of Virginia.


      Step 2: Consider county positions within their states.

      Jasper County is in Missouri (specifically in the southwestern part of the state).

      Bland County is in Virginia (in the western part of Virginia).


      Step 3: Compare their absolute positions.

      Even though Bland County is in western Virginia, Virginia as a whole is so far
      east of Missouri that any county in Missouri (including Jasper County) would
      be west of any county in Virginia (including Bland County).

      The United States is generally organized with states further west having higher
      longitude values. Nebraska (NE) is in the central part of the United States,
      while Ohio (OH) is in the eastern part of the Midwest/Great Lakes region.


      Nebraska is definitely west of Ohio on the map of the United States. Nebraska
      borders Colorado to its west and Iowa to its east, while Ohio borders Pennsylvania
      to its east and Indiana to its west.


      Since Sarpy County is in Nebraska, and Guernsey County is in Ohio, and Nebraska
      is west of Ohio, it follows that Sarpy County, NE is west of Guernsey County,
      OH.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two

      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of Nebraska and Ohio.

      - Nebraska is located in the central United States

      - Ohio is located in the eastern part of the Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Nebraska is significantly west of Ohio on the US map

      - All counties in Nebraska would be west of all counties in Ohio


      Since Sarpy County is in Nebraska, and Nebraska is west of Ohio (where Guernsey
      County is located), Sarpy County must be west of Guernsey County.

      First, I know that Michigan (MI) is in the Midwest region of the United States,
      while Maine (ME) is in the Northeast, specifically in New England, which is
      on the eastern seaboard.


      Looking at the overall geography of the US:

      - Maine is the easternmost state in the continental United States

      - Michigan is significantly further west than Maine


      Since Roscommon County is in Michigan and Sagadahoc County is in Maine, it follows

      - Sagadahoc County, ME: This is in Maine (ME)


      Now, I need to recall the relative positions of these states within the United

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Maine is in the Northeast region of the United States, specifically the easternmost

      locations of Roscommon County, Michigan and Sagadahoc County, Maine.


      First, let me orient myself with the overall geography of the United States.
      Michigan is in the Midwest, while Maine is in the Northeast (specifically, the
      northeasternmost state).


      Given the overall geography of the US, states in the Midwest are generally west
      of states in the Northeast. Michigan is west of Maine.


      More specifically:

      - Roscommon County is in Michigan

      - Sagadahoc County is in Maine

      parts of Michigan are roughly around 83-84 degrees west longitude, while Maine

      About County Locations


      To determine if Roscommon County, MI is located west of Sagadahoc County, ME,
      I need to consider the geographic positions of Michigan and Maine.


      ## Step 1: State Locations

      Michigan is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Maine
      is located in the far Northeast corner of the country.


      ## Step 2: Relative Positions

      Michigan as a whole state is significantly west of Maine. On a map of the United
      States, Michigan sits in the Great Lakes region, while Maine is on the Atlantic
      coast at the northeastern edge of the country.


      ## Step 3: County Specifics

      Roscommon County is in central Michigan, and Sagadahoc County is in southern
      Maine. Even the easternmost point of Michigan is still west of the westernmost
      point of Maine.


      ## Conclusion

      Since Roscommon County is in Michigan, and Michigan is entirely west of Maine
      (where Sagadahoc County is located), Roscommon County must be west of Sagadahoc
      County.

      - Even though Rockwall County is in the eastern part of Texas (near Dallas),
      and Saluda County is in western South Carolina, the entire state of Texas is
      west of South Carolina


      Step 4: Make the determination based on the states'' positions.

      Missouri (MO) is in the central part of the United States, while Virginia (VA)
      is on the eastern coast.


      States that are further west have higher longitude values (in the western hemisphere,
      these are negative numbers, but larger negative numbers are further east). So
      if Missouri is west of Virginia, then Chariton County, MO would be west of Falls
      Church City, VA.


      Missouri is definitely west of Virginia in the United States. Missouri is in
      the central part of the country, while Virginia is on the east coast. So any
      county in Missouri would be west of any city in Virginia.


      Therefore, Chariton County, MO is west of Falls Church City, VA.


      Actually, I made an error above. In the western hemisphere, locations further

      - Missouri is located in the central part of the United States

      - Virginia is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Missouri is significantly west of Virginia on a US map. Since Chariton County

      Missouri (MO) is a state in the Midwestern United States. Virginia (VA) is a
      state on the East Coast of the United States.


      Geographically speaking, the United States is laid out such that the East Coast
      (including Virginia) is in the eastern part of the country, while the Midwest
      (including Missouri) is more centrally located and west of the East Coast states.


      Therefore, Missouri as a state is located west of Virginia as a state.


      Now, more specifically:

      - Chariton County is a county in Missouri

      - Falls Church City is an independent city in Virginia


      Since Missouri is west of Virginia, any county in Missouri (including Chariton
      County) would be west of any location in Virginia (including Falls Church City).

      3) Missouri is in the Midwest region of the United States

      4) Virginia is on the East Coast of the United States

      5) When looking at a US map, Missouri is located west of Virginia

      6) Therefore, any county in Missouri would be west of any city in Virginia

      step:


      1. The question is asking about the relative locations of two places: Chariton

      2. MO refers to Missouri, which is a state in the central United States.


      3. VA refers to Virginia, which is a state on the eastern coast of the United
      States.


      4. In general, Missouri is located west of Virginia on a map of the United States.


      5. Since Chariton County is in Missouri and Falls Church City is in Virginia,
      it''s highly likely that Chariton County is west of Falls Church City.


      6. To be completely sure, I would need to check the specific locations within
      their states, but given the overall geography of the US, where Missouri is significantly
      west of Virginia, it''s almost certain that any county in Missouri would be
      west of any location in Virginia.


      So the answer should be YES.</think>To determine if Chariton County, MO is located
      west of Falls Church City, VA, I need to think about the relative geographical
      positions of these locations in the United States.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - MO is Missouri, which is located in the central United States.

      - VA is Virginia, which is located on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west relationship of these states.

      - Missouri is significantly west of Virginia on the US map.

      - Missouri is roughly in the middle of the country, while Virginia is on the
      eastern seaboard.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations.

      - Chariton County is a county in Missouri.

      - Falls Church City is an independent city in Virginia.

      - Since they''re both within their respective states, they maintain the same
      general east-west relationship as their states.


      Since Missouri is west of Virginia, and Chariton County is in Missouri while
      Falls Church City is in Virginia, Chariton County must be west of Falls Church
      City.

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is in the northeastern part of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      Nebraska is definitely west of Pennsylvania. In terms of the general geography
      of the US, the states progress roughly as follows from east to west: the East
      Coast states (including Pennsylvania), then the Midwest (including Ohio, Indiana,
      Illinois), then the Great Plains states (including Nebraska), then the Mountain
      states, and finally the West Coast states.


      Step 3: Since Nebraska is west of Pennsylvania, it''s very likely that Otoe
      County, NE is west of Indiana County, PA. The only way this wouldn''t be true
      is if these counties were positioned in unusual ways within their states (e.g.,
      if Otoe County were an eastern outlier of Nebraska and Indiana County were a

      Is Treasure County, MT located west of Alger County, MI?


      I''ll solve this by determining the relative east-west positions of these counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Treasure County is in Montana (MT)

      - Alger County is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Montana is located in the western United States

      - Michigan is located in the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Montana is significantly west of Michigan on the US map

      - All counties in Montana would be west of all counties in Michigan


      Since Montana is entirely west of Michigan on the map of the United States,
      Treasure County (MT) must be west of Alger County (MI).

      to determine the geographic locations of Box Butte County, NE (Nebraska) and
      Allen County, IN (Indiana), and then determine which one is further west.


      First, let me think about the general locations of these states:

      - Nebraska (NE) is in the Great Plains region, in the central part of the United
      States

      - Indiana (IN) is in the Midwest region, but further east than Nebraska


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - Nebraska is generally west of Indiana

      - States get more western as you move from east to west across the US


      Since Box Butte County is in Nebraska, and Allen County is in Indiana, and Nebraska
      is west of Indiana, it follows that Box Butte County, NE is likely west of Allen
      County, IN.

      Is Box Butte County, NE located west of Allen County, IN?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two counties.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Box Butte County is in Nebraska (NE)

      - Allen County is in Indiana (IN)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Nebraska is located in the Great Plains region of the central United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region, but significantly east of Nebraska


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions on the map

      - Nebraska is approximately in the middle of the country (longitudinally)

      - Indiana is much closer to the eastern part of the country

      - All counties in Nebraska would be west of all counties in Indiana


      Therefore, Box Butte County, NE is indeed located west of Allen County, IN.

      2. Allen County, Indiana (IN)


      Specifically, I need to determine if Box Butte County, NE is located west of
      Allen County, IN.


      To solve this, I need to know the relative locations of these counties or at
      least their states. Let me think about the geography of the United States:


      - Nebraska (NE) is a state in the Great Plains region, roughly in the central
      part of the US but definitely in the western half of the country.

      - Indiana (IN) is a state in the Midwest region, east of Nebraska.

      - Allen County is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - Nebraska is located in the Great Plains region of the central United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region, significantly east of Nebraska


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Nebraska sits roughly in the middle of the country but is considered part
      of the western half

      - Indiana is in the eastern half of the United States

      - All of Nebraska is west of all of Indiana on a map


      Step 4: Apply this state-level knowledge to the counties.

      - Since Box Butte County is in Nebraska, and Allen County is in Indiana, Box
      Butte County must be west of Allen County

      First, let me think about where these states are located relative to each other.
      Nebraska (NE) is in the Great Plains region of the Midwest, while Indiana (IN)
      is in the eastern part of the Midwest. Generally speaking, Nebraska is west
      of Indiana.


      Since Box Butte County is in Nebraska, and Allen County is in Indiana, and Nebraska
      is west of Indiana, Box Butte County should be west of Allen County.


      Let me double-check this reasoning:

      - Nebraska is clearly west of Indiana on a US map

      - Box Butte County is in Nebraska

      - Allen County is in Indiana

      - Therefore, Box Butte County must be west of Allen County


      So the answer is YES.</think># Is Box Butte County, NE located west of Allen
      County, IN?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative locations of these
      two counties.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Box Butte County is in Nebraska (NE)

      - Allen County is in Indiana (IN)


      ## Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states

      Nebraska is located in the Great Plains region of the central United States,
      while Indiana is located in the eastern part of the Midwest. On a US map, Nebraska
      is positioned significantly west of Indiana.


      ## Step 3: Apply this to the counties

      Since Box Butte County is in Nebraska, and Allen County is in Indiana, Box Butte
      County must be west of Allen County because their respective states maintain
      this west-east relationship.


      ## Answer: YES


      Box Butte County, NE is located west of Allen County, IN.'

      1. Nebraska is located in the central United States, in the Great Plains region.

      2. West Virginia is located in the eastern part of the United States, specifically
      in the Appalachian region.


      Since the United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific
      Ocean in the west, and Nebraska is significantly more central/western than West
      Virginia, any county in Nebraska would be west of any county in West Virginia.


      Therefore, Gage County, NE is indeed located west of Tucker County, WV.</think>To
      determine if Gage County, NE is located west of Tucker County, WV, I need to
      consider the geographic locations of these counties and their states.


      Step 1: Consider the locations of the states themselves.

      - Nebraska (NE) is located in the central United States, in the Great Plains
      region.

      - West Virginia (WV) is located in the eastern United States, in the Appalachian
      region.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions on the east-west axis.

      - Nebraska is significantly further west than West Virginia.

      - Nebraska is roughly in the middle of the country, while West Virginia is quite
      far east.


      Step 3: Consider county-specific locations.

      - Since Nebraska as a whole is west of West Virginia, any county in Nebraska
      (including Gage County) would be west of any county in West Virginia (including
      Tucker County).


      YES'

      is located west of Tucker County, West Virginia, I need to think about the relative
      positions of these states and counties.


      First, let''s establish the general locations:

      - Nebraska (NE) is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - West Virginia (WV) is located in the Appalachian region in the eastern part
      of the United States


      Looking at the general geography of the US, Nebraska is significantly west of
      West Virginia. Nebraska borders states like Colorado to its west and Iowa to
      its east, while West Virginia is near states like Virginia, Pennsylvania, and
      Ohio.


      Since Gage County is in Nebraska, and Tucker County is in West Virginia, and
      Nebraska is west of West Virginia, it follows that Gage County, NE would be
      located west of Tucker County, WV.


      So the answer should be YES.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these counties are located.

      - Gage County is in Nebraska (NE)

      - Tucker County is in West Virginia (WV)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Nebraska is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while West Virginia
      is in the Appalachian region in the eastern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      Nebraska is significantly west of West Virginia on the US map. Nebraska sits
      in the central plains region, while West Virginia is much closer to the Atlantic
      coast.


      Step 4: Apply this to the counties.

      Since Gage County is in Nebraska and Tucker County is in West Virginia, and
      Nebraska is west of West Virginia, it follows that Gage County must be west
      of Tucker County.

      to determine the relative geographic positions of Fall River County, SD (South
      Dakota) and Shiawassee County, MI (Michigan).


      Let me think about the general geographic positions of the states first:

      - South Dakota (SD) is in the upper Midwest, bordering North Dakota, Minnesota,
      Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Montana.

      - Michigan (MI) is in the Great Lakes region, consisting of two peninsulas surrounded
      by the Great Lakes.


      Looking at a mental map of the United States, South Dakota is generally west
      of Michigan. Michigan is in the eastern part of the Midwest, while South Dakota
      is in the western part of the Midwest, closer to the Mountain states.


      If we go by the general east-west positioning of these states:

      - South Dakota is farther west than Michigan

      - Therefore, counties in South Dakota would generally be west of counties in
      Michigan


      Fall River County is in South Dakota, so it would be west of Shiawassee County,
      which is in Michigan.


      To be even more specific:

      - Fall River County is actually in the southwestern part of South Dakota, on
      the border with Wyoming and Nebraska

      - Shiawassee County is in the central part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula


      This confirms that Fall River County, SD is indeed west of Shiawassee County,

      - Fall River County is in South Dakota (SD)

      - Shiawassee County is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - South Dakota is located in the upper Midwest region of the US

      - Michigan is located in the Great Lakes region, further east


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - South Dakota lies significantly west of Michigan on the US map

      - Michigan is part of the eastern Midwest, while South Dakota is in the western
      Midwest


      Step 4: Consider county locations within their states.

      - Fall River County is in the southwestern part of South Dakota

      - Shiawassee County is in the central part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula


      Since South Dakota is west of Michigan, and Fall River County is in South Dakota

      2. To determine this, I need to consider the geographic locations of these two
      counties and their states.


      3. The United States is organized such that states in the west have higher longitude
      (more negative numbers, since we''re in the western hemisphere) than states

      - Shiawassee County is in Michigan (MI)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States

      - South Dakota is located in the north-central United States

      - Michigan is located in the Great Lakes region of the Midwest


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positions

      - Looking at a US map, South Dakota is clearly west of Michigan

      - The entire state of South Dakota lies west of Michigan


      ## Step 4: Consider county locations

      - Fall River County is in the southwestern part of South Dakota

      \ to the north.\n- Michigan (MI) is in the Great Lakes region in the upper Midwest\
      \ of the United States.\n\nGeographically, Montana is definitely west of Michigan.\
      \ Montana is in the Mountain West region, while Michigan is much further east.\n\
      \nNow for the specific counties:\n- Yellowstone County is in Montana, so it\
      \ inherits Montana's western position.\n- Luce County is in Michigan, so it\
      \ inherits Michigan's eastern position.\n\nThe exact positions of these counties\
      \ within their states don't matter much for this question because the states\
      \ themselves are so far apart east-to-west. Any county in Montana would be west\
      \ of any county in Michigan.\n\nSo Yellowstone County, MT is indeed west of\
      \ Luce County, MI.</think># Is Yellowstone County, MT located west of Luce County,\

      \ of both counties and their states:\n   - Yellowstone County is in Montana\
      \ (MT)\n   - Luce County is in Michigan (MI)\n\n2) Looking at the geographical\
      \ positions of these states:\n   - Montana is located in the western United\
      \ States\n   - Michigan is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, much further\
      \ east\n\n3) Montana's eastern border is approximately at longitude 104\xB0\
      W, while Michigan's western parts are around longitude 90\xB0W at most (and\
      \ Luce County is in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, not even the westernmost part\
      \ of Michigan)\n\n4) Since Yellowstone County is within Montana, and Montana\
      \ is entirely west of Michigan, Yellowstone County must be west of any county\
      \ in Michigan, including Luce County.\n\nYES, Yellowstone County, MT is located\
      \ west of Luce County, MI."
