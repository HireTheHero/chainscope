      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Emmet County is in Michigan (MI), which is in the Midwest region of the United
      States.

      - Oxford County is in Maine (ME), which is in the Northeast region of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Michigan is located in the Great Lakes region, with parts of it bordering
      Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, and Lake Superior.

      - Maine is the easternmost state in the contiguous United States, located at
      the far northeastern corner of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - States in the Midwest (like Michigan) are generally west of states in the
      Northeast (like Maine).

      - Since Emmet County is in Michigan and Oxford County is in Maine, Emmet County
      would be west of Oxford County.

      - Since Michigan is west of Maine, any county in Michigan would be west of any
      county in Maine


      Step 4: Confirm the specific counties.

      - Emmet County is in Michigan, so it must be west of Oxford County, which is
      in Maine


      NO further analysis is needed since the states'' positions determine the answer
      clearly.

      - Lemhi County is in Idaho (ID)

      - Deuel County is in South Dakota (SD)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of Idaho and South Dakota.

      - Idaho is in the northwestern United States

      - South Dakota is in the north-central United States

      - Idaho is located west of South Dakota


      Step 3: Since these counties are within their respective states, Lemhi County
      (in Idaho) must be west of Deuel County (in South Dakota), because Idaho is
      west of South Dakota.


      NO WAIT - I made a mistake. Let me verify this more carefully.


      Idaho is indeed west of South Dakota. Idaho borders Washington and Oregon to
      the west, while South Dakota is several states to the east (with Montana and
      Wyoming in between). Since Lemhi County is in Idaho and Deuel County is in South
      Dakota, Lemhi County must be west of Deuel County.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern part of the United States

      - Generally, Texas is west of Georgia on a map of the United States


      Step 3: Since these counties are in their respective states, Hill County in
      Texas would be west of Lanier County in Georgia, regardless of their specific
      locations within their states. This is because the entirety of Texas is west
      of the entirety of Georgia.

      Step 3: Since Texas is entirely west of Georgia, and Hill County is in Texas
      while Lanier County is in Georgia, Hill County must be west of Lanier County.


      NO WAIT - I need to be more careful. Let me verify my reasoning:


      The United States is arranged with the West Coast on the left (west) and the
      East Coast on the right (east) when looking at a map. Texas is significantly
      west of Georgia. Any county in Texas would be west of any county in Georgia
      due to the states'' relative positions.


      Therefore, Hill County, TX is indeed west of Lanier County, GA.

      - Brazos County is in Texas (TX)

      - Dixie County is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Texas is located in the southwestern part of the United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Texas is west of Florida on a map of the United States

      - Therefore, counties in Texas are generally west of counties in Florida


      Step 4: Make the specific comparison between these two counties.

      - Since Brazos County is in Texas, and Dixie County is in Florida

      - And Texas is west of Florida

      - Brazos County must be west of Dixie County

      the relative positions of these counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - Yellowstone County is in Montana (MT)

      - Luce County is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Montana is in the western part of the United States

      - Michigan is in the Great Lakes region in the northern part of the eastern/midwestern
      United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Montana lies significantly west of Michigan in the United States

      - All counties in Montana would be west of all counties in Michigan


      Step 4: Confirm the specific counties.

      - Since Yellowstone County is in Montana, and Luce County is in Michigan, Yellowstone
      County must be west of Luce County


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      the relative east-west positions of Yellowstone County, Montana and Luce County,
      Michigan.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these counties.

      - Yellowstone County is in Montana (MT), which is in the western part of the
      United States.

      - Luce County is in Michigan (MI), specifically in the Upper Peninsula, which
      is in the north-central/northeastern part of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Montana is significantly west of Michigan on the US map.

      - All counties in Montana are west of all counties in Michigan.


      Step 3: Verify the specific counties.

      - Yellowstone County is in south-central Montana.

      - Luce County is in the eastern part of Michigan''s Upper Peninsula.

      - Even though Yellowstone isn''t the westernmost county in Montana, and Luce
      isn''t the easternmost county in Michigan, the entire state of Montana is still
      west of Michigan.


      Therefore, Yellowstone County, MT is indeed located west of Luce County, MI.

      Step 4: Confirm the specific counties'' positions.

      Even though these are specific counties within their states, the states themselves
      are so far apart on an east-west axis that any county in Montana would be west
      of any county in Michigan.


      NO, Yellowstone County, MT is located WEST of Luce County, MI (not east of it).
