    faf686fe-a1bb-453c-be15-aee043633d96: 'Here''s the reasoning:


      1. **"Changing of the Seasons" was released in 2009**, while "That''s Life"
      was released in 2016.

      2. **"Changing of the Seasons" was released earlier**.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**'
    fdf62c39-7f22-42ea-aa8c-7b3eef38b102: '**Step 1:** Two Door Cinema Club''s song
      was released in 2013, while Sia''s song was released in 2016.

      **Step 2:** Therefore, Two Door Cinema Club''s song was released before Sia''s
      song.
