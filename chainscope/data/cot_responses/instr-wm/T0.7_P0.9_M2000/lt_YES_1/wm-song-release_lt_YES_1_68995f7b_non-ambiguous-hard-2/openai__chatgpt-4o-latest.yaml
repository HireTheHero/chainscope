      **Step 1: Determine the release date of Enya''s "The Celts"**

      - Enya originally released an album called "Enya" in 1987.

      - This album was later re-released under the title "The Celts" in 1992 by Warner
      Music with remastered tracks.

      - So, the original version of the song and album was released in 1987.

      (The Sound of Illadelph)"**

      - This song is a remix version of "Geto Heaven Part Two," from Common''s album
      "Like Water for Chocolate."

      - The album "Like Water for Chocolate" was released in 2000.

      - The remix likely came out in the same year or shortly after, but certainly
      not before 2000.

    c7f09d89-a095-4174-b158-bdcab7faaae2: 'To determine whether Diplo''s "Elastic
      Heart" was released earlier than Charli XCX''s "Girls", we need to:


      1. Clarify the correct artist and song titles, as there may be some confusion.


      2. "Elastic Heart" is a well-known song by Sia, featuring The Weeknd and Diplo.
      It was originally released as part of the "Hunger Games: Catching Fire" soundtrack
      in 2013, and later as a single in 2015.


      3. Diplo is credited as a producer on "Elastic Heart", but it''s not his solo
      release. Nonetheless, since Diplo is a key contributor, we''ll accept "Diplo''s
      Elastic Heart" as referring to that song.


      4. Now, consider "Girls" by Charli XCX. There may be confusion here, as Charli
      XCX does not have a major single titled "Girls" herself.


      5. There is a song titled "Girls" by Rita Ora featuring Cardi B, Bebe Rexha,
      and Charli XCX, released in May 2018. Charli XCX is featured on that song.


      Now compare the dates:


      - "Elastic Heart" (original release): 2013

      - "Girls" (Rita Ora ft. Charli XCX): 2018


      Therefore, "Elastic Heart" was released earlier.


      Final answer: YES.'

      was released earlier than Charli XCX''s "Girls," we need to:


      1. Identify the release date of Diplo''s "Elastic Heart."

      2. Identify the release date of Charli XCX''s "Girls."

      3. Compare the two dates to determine which song came out first.


      Step 1: "Elastic Heart" is a song by Sia featuring The Weeknd and Diplo. It
      was originally released as part of the soundtrack for "The Hunger Games: Catching
      Fire" in November 2013. A solo version by Sia was later released as a single
      in January 2015, but Diplo was involved in the original 2013 version.


      Step 2: As of June 2024, there is no widely known or released song titled "Girls"
      by Charli XCX. She has collaborated on songs with similar themes (like "Girls"
      by Rita Ora featuring Charli XCX, Cardi B, and Bebe Rexha), which was released
      in May 2018.


      Step 3: Comparing the dates:

      - Diplo''s involvement in "Elastic Heart": November 2013.

      - "Girls" (Rita Ora featuring Charli XCX et al.): May 2018.
