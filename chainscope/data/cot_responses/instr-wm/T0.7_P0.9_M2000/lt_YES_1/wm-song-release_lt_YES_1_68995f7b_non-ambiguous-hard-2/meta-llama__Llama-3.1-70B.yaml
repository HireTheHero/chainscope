      these steps:


      1. **Identify the Release Dates**: We need to find the release dates of both
      "The Telephantasm" by Soundgarden and "Lot to Learn" by Luke Christopher.


      2. **Compare the Release Dates**: Once we have the release dates, we can compare
      them to determine which song was released earlier.


      Let''s find the release dates of the songs:


      - "The Telephantasm" by Soundgarden was released on September 28, 2010.

      - "Lot to Learn" by Luke Christopher was released on January 21, 2016.
