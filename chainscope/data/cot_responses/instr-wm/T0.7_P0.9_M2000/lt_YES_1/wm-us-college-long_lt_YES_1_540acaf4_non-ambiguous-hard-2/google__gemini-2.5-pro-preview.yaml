    125b6f13-08a8-499b-8cf1-1ccb24cb2a38: "Okay, here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\
      \n1.  **Locate Otterbein University, OH:** Otterbein University is located in\
      \ Westerville, Ohio.\n2.  **Locate Stratford University, VA:** Stratford University\
      \ had multiple campuses in Virginia, including locations like Falls Church,\
      \ Alexandria, and Woodbridge. (Note: Stratford University has ceased operations,\
      \ but we can still use its former locations for this geographical query).\n\
      3.  **Determine relative geographical positions:**\n    *   Ohio is a state\
      \ in the Midwestern United States.\n    *   Virginia is a state on the Atlantic\
      \ Coast, in the Southeastern/Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.\n4. \
      \ **Compare longitudes (general understanding):** States in the Midwest (like\
      \ Ohio) are generally west of states on the Atlantic Coast (like Virginia).\n\
      5.  **More specific longitude check (approximate):**\n    *   Westerville, Ohio,\
      \ is approximately 82.9\xB0 West longitude.\n    *   Falls Church, Virginia\
      \ (a former Stratford campus location), is approximately 77.1\xB0 West longitude.\n\
