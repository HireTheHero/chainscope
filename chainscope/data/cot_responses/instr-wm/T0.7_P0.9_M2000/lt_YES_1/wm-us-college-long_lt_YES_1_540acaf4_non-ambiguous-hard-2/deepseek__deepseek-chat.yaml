      ---


      ### Step 1: Identify the locations of the two institutions.

      1. **Air University, AL** is located in **Montgomery, Alabama**.

      2. **Community College of Vermont, VT** is located in **Montpelier, Vermont**.


      ---


      ### Step 2: Compare the longitude of the two locations.

      - **Montgomery, Alabama** has a longitude of approximately **-86.30**.

      - **Montpelier, Vermont** has a longitude of approximately **-72.58**.


      ---


      ### Step 3: Analyze the longitude values.

      - Longitude measures how far east or west a location is. A more negative value
      indicates a position farther west.

      - Since **-86.30** (Montgomery, AL) is more negative than **-72.58** (Montpelier,
      VT), Montgomery is farther west than Montpelier.


      ---


      ### Conclusion:

      **Yes**, Air University, AL is located west of Community College of Vermont,
      VT.'

      \ (OPSU) in Oklahoma is located west of Midland University in Nebraska. To answer\
      \ this, we'll need to understand the geographical locations of both universities\
      \ and compare their longitudinal positions.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\
      \ of Both Universities\n\n**Oklahoma Panhandle State University (OPSU):**\n\
      - Located in Goodwell, Oklahoma.\n- Goodwell is in the Oklahoma Panhandle, which\
      \ is the westernmost part of Oklahoma.\n\n**Midland University:**\n- Located\
      \ in Fremont, Nebraska.\n- Fremont is in eastern Nebraska, near the Missouri\
      \ River.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Geographical Context\n\nTo determine\
      \ which university is further west, we need to look at their longitudinal coordinates.\
      \ Longitude measures how far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian\
      \ (0\xB0 longitude). The higher the longitude (in degrees west), the further\
      \ west the location is.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Longitude of Each University\n\
      \n**Oklahoma Panhandle State University (OPSU):**\n- Latitude: 36.5953\xB0 N\n\
      - Longitude: 101.6296\xB0 W\n\n**Midland University:**\n- Latitude: 41.4336\xB0\
      \ N\n- Longitude: 96.4983\xB0 W\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Longitudes\n\n- OPSU's\
      \ longitude: 101.6296\xB0 W\n- Midland University's longitude: 96.4983\xB0 W\n\
      \nSince 101.6296\xB0 W is greater than 96.4983\xB0 W, OPSU is further west than\
      \ Midland University.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nBased on the longitudinal\
      \ comparison, Oklahoma Panhandle State University in Oklahoma is indeed located\
      \ west of Midland University in Nebraska.\n\n**Final Answer:** YES"

      \ Fredericksburg. So, for the purpose of this question, we'll consider Texas\
      \ Tech University's location in Fredericksburg, TX.\n\n#### Grand Valley State\
      \ University, MI\n\nGrand Valley State University is located in Allendale, Michigan,\
      \ with additional campuses in Grand Rapids and other areas. For this comparison,\
      \ we'll consider the main campus in Allendale, MI.\n\n### Step 2: Determine\
      \ the Longitude of Both Locations\n\nTo find out which university is located\
      \ further west, we need to compare their longitudes. Longitude measures how\
      \ far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0 longitude).\
      \ Locations with lower (more negative) longitude values are further west.\n\n\
      #### Longitude of Fredericksburg, TX\n\nFredericksburg, Texas, is located at\
      \ approximately **98.8711\xB0 W** longitude.\n\n#### Longitude of Allendale,\
      \ MI\n\nAllendale, Michigan, is located at approximately **85.9533\xB0 W** longitude.\n\
      \n### Step 3: Compare the Longitudes\n\nNow that we have the longitude values:\n\
      \n- Fredericksburg, TX: 98.8711\xB0 W\n- Allendale, MI: 85.9533\xB0 W\n\nA lower\
      \ (more negative) longitude value indicates a location further west. Comparing\
      \ the two:\n\n- 98.8711\xB0 W (Fredericksburg, TX) is more west than 85.9533\xB0\
      \ W (Allendale, MI).\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nSince Fredericksburg, TX,\
      \ has a more western longitude than Allendale, MI, Texas Tech University at\
      \ Fredericksburg, TX, is indeed located west of Grand Valley State University,\
      \ MI.\n\n**Final Answer: YES**"
