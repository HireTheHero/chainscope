      - Arlington, Virginia, is located in the northeastern part of Virginia, which
      is further north and east compared to Tallahassee.


      Since Florida is generally south and slightly west compared to Virginia, and
      considering the specific locations of Tallahassee and Arlington, Tallahassee
      (where Florida State University is located) is indeed west of Arlington (where
      Marymount University is located).

      2. **Bentley University, MA**: This university is located in Waltham, Massachusetts,
      which is in the northeastern United States.


      Now, let''s determine the relative longitudinal positions:


      - St. Petersburg, FL is located roughly around 82.6 degrees west longitude.

      - Waltham, MA is located roughly around 71.2 degrees west longitude.


      Since 82.6 is a greater value than 71.2, St. Petersburg, FL is indeed west of
      Waltham, MA.


      Thus, the answer is: **YES**.'

      3. **Geographical Comparison**: San Diego is located in Southern California
      near the coast, while Monterey Bay is located further north along the central
      coast. In terms of longitudinal coordinates, Monterey is generally further west
      compared to San Diego.
