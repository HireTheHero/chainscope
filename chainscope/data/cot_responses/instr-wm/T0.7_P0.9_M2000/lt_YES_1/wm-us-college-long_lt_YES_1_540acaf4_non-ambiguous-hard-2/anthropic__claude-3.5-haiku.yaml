      2. Next, I need to locate Eastern Washington University (EWU)

      - EWU is located in Cheney, Washington, which is in the eastern part of Washington
      state


      3. Now, I''ll compare their geographical positions

      - California is west of Washington state

      - Oakland, CA is further west than Cheney, WA


      4. Therefore, California College of the Arts is located west of Eastern Washington
      University
