      1. **Locate Clarkson University**: Clarkson University is situated in Potsdam,
      New York, which is in the northern part of the state.


      2. **Locate Cornerstone University**: Cornerstone University is located in Grand
      Rapids, Michigan, which is also in the northern part of the state, but further
      west compared to New York.


      3. **Compare the Longitudes**: New York is generally to the east of Michigan.
      Since Grand Rapids, MI (where Cornerstone University is located) is further
      west than Potsdam, NY (where Clarkson University is located), we can conclude
      that Cornerstone University is indeed west of Clarkson University.

      1. **Location of Lee College**: Lee College is located in Baytown, Texas. Texas
      is situated in the southern part of the United States and is generally west
      of the Mississippi River.


      2. **Location of University of North Georgia**: The University of North Georgia
      is located in Dahlonega, Georgia. Georgia is located on the eastern side of
      the United States.


      3. **Comparing the locations**: Texas is west of Georgia. Therefore, since Lee
      College is in Texas and the University of North Georgia is in Georgia, Lee College
      is to the west of the University of North Georgia.


      Given this reasoning, the answer to the question is:


      YES.'

      Georgia.

      2. **Location of University of New Hampshire at Manchester**: The University
      of New Hampshire at Manchester is located in Manchester, New Hampshire.


      Next, we can look at the relative positions of these two locations:


      - Georgia is situated to the south of New Hampshire on the map.

      - Specifically, Rome, Georgia, is located to the northwest of Atlanta, Georgia,
      and Manchester, New Hampshire, is in the northeastern part of the United States.


      Now, if we visualize the map:


      - Manchester, NH is significantly north and east compared to Rome, GA.

      - Therefore, Rome, GA (Shorter University) is not to the west of Manchester,
      NH; instead, it is to the south.


      After considering these points, the answer to the question is:


      **NO**.'

      1. **Location of Haverford College**: Haverford College is located in Haverford,
      Pennsylvania, which is in the northeastern part of the United States, just outside
      of Philadelphia.


      2. **Location of Samford University**: Samford University is located in Birmingham,
      Alabama, which is in the southeastern part of the United States.


      3. **Geographical Orientation**: To determine if one location is west of the
      other, we can look at their relative positions on a map. Alabama is generally
      south of Pennsylvania, but we need to check if it is also west.


      4. **Comparing Longitudes**: Haverford College is approximately at a longitude
      of -75.3 degrees, while Samford University is approximately at a longitude of
      -86.8 degrees. A higher negative number (more negative) indicates a position
      further west.


      Since -86.8 (Samford University) is more negative than -75.3 (Haverford College),
      this means Samford University is indeed located to the west of Haverford College.

    c2267571-8c81-43cb-8021-24845839ae52: 'To determine whether Eastern Michigan University
      (EMU) is located west of Lincoln University, Pennsylvania (LU), we need to consider
      their geographical positions:


      1. **Location of Eastern Michigan University**: EMU is located in Ypsilanti,
      Michigan, which is situated in the southeastern part of the state.


      2. **Location of Lincoln University**: Lincoln University, PA, is located in
      the southeastern part of Pennsylvania, near the border with Maryland.


      3. **Geographical Reference**: If we look at a map, Michigan is north of Ohio
      and west of Pennsylvania. EMU, being in Michigan, is positioned to the northwest
      of Lincoln University, PA.


      4. **Relative Positioning**: Since EMU is in Michigan and LU is in Pennsylvania,
      we can conclude that EMU is indeed to the west of Lincoln University.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      YES'
