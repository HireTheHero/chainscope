      the locations of these two universities:


      1. Lamar University is located in Texas (TX)

      2. Purdue University Northwest is located in Indiana (IN)


      Now I need to determine their relative positions east/west:


      Lamar University is in Beaumont, Texas, which is in the eastern part of Texas
      near the Louisiana border.


      Purdue University Northwest has campuses in Hammond and Westville, Indiana.
      Indiana is in the Midwest region, east of Texas.


      Looking at a US map mentally:

      - Texas is in the southern central part of the US

      - Indiana is in the Midwest, significantly east of Texas

      - Even though Lamar is in eastern Texas, all of Texas is west of Indiana


      So Lamar University in Texas would be west of Purdue University Northwest in
      Indiana.</think># Is Lamar University, TX located west of Purdue University
      Northwest, IN?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Lamar University is in Beaumont, Texas (TX)

      - Purdue University Northwest is in northwest Indiana (IN)


      ## Step 2: Consider the states'' positions

      Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States, while Indiana
      is in the Midwest region.


      ## Step 3: Compare longitude

      When looking at a map of the United States, Texas is positioned significantly
      west of Indiana. Even though Beaumont is in eastern Texas (near the Louisiana
      border), all of Texas is still west of Indiana.


      ## Conclusion

      YES, Lamar University in Texas is located west of Purdue University Northwest
      in Indiana.'

      1. University of Louisiana at Monroe is located in Monroe, Louisiana, which
      is in the southern part of the United States.

      2. Andrews University is located in Michigan, which is in the northern part
      of the United States.


      To determine which is more west (or more east), I need to consider their relative
      longitudes. States in the US generally follow this pattern from west to east:

      - Western states (like California, Oregon, Washington)

      - Mountain states (like Montana, Wyoming, Colorado)

      - Central/Plains states (like Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma)

      - Midwest states (like Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin)

      - Southern states (like Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia)

      - Eastern states (like New York, Pennsylvania, etc.)


      Michigan is in the Midwest, while Louisiana is in the South. However, Louisiana
      is actually further west than Michigan. Louisiana borders Texas (to its west)
      and Mississippi (to its east), while Michigan is bordered by Wisconsin to the
      west and Ohio to the south/southeast.


      So while both are in the eastern half of the United States, Louisiana is definitely

      - Louisiana is generally positioned in the south-central part of the country

      - Michigan is positioned much further east in the country

      And then determine if University of West Alabama is west of Shepherd University.


      Alabama is generally in the southeastern part of the US, while West Virginia
      is in the eastern US, specifically in the Appalachian region.


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - Alabama is generally west of West Virginia

      - The University of West Alabama is likely in western Alabama

      - Shepherd University is somewhere in West Virginia


      Given that Alabama as a state is west of West Virginia as a state, and University
      of West Alabama is in western Alabama, it''s highly likely that University of
      West Alabama is west of Shepherd University.


      Let me confirm this by thinking about the general geography. West Virginia is
      bordered by Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, and Ohio. Alabama is
      much further west and south, bordered by Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, and Mississippi.


      So yes, University of West Alabama in Alabama would be west of Shepherd University

      region.

      - Alabama (AL) is located in the southeastern United States, significantly west
      of West Virginia.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions.

      - West Virginia is bordered by Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, and
      Ohio.

      - Alabama is much further west, bordered by Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia,
      and Florida.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - University of West Alabama is in Alabama, likely in the western part of the
      state given its name.

      - Shepherd University is in West Virginia.


      Step 4: Compare longitudinal positions.

      - Even the easternmost parts of Alabama are generally west of the westernmost

      First, I need to identify the locations of both universities:

      1. University of West Alabama (UWA) is located in Livingston, Alabama

      2. Shepherd University is located in Shepherdstown, West Virginia


      Now I need to determine if UWA is west of Shepherd University. To do this, I
      need to compare their longitudes:


      Alabama is generally west of West Virginia in the United States. Alabama is
      in the southeastern United States, while West Virginia is in the eastern part
      of the country.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Alabama is significantly to the west of West Virginia

      - West Virginia borders states like Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
      and Kentucky

      - Alabama borders states like Mississippi (to its west), Tennessee (to its north),
      Georgia (to its east), and Florida (to its south)

      - Locations in the western United States have higher (negative) longitude values
      than eastern locations

      - Ohio is west of New York, so Baldwin Wallace University should be west of

      University.


      To determine this, I need to know the approximate locations of both universities
      within their states, and also the relative position of Virginia and Pennsylvania.


      In general:

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia is south of Pennsylvania

      - Radford University is located in Radford, VA, which is in the western part
      of Virginia, in the Blue Ridge Mountains region

      - Marywood University is in Scranton, PA, which is in the northeastern part
      of Pennsylvania

      - Radford University is located in Radford, Virginia, which is in the western
      part of Virginia near the Blue Ridge Mountains.

      - Marywood University is located in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which is in the
      northeastern part of Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Compare their longitudes (east-west positions).

      - Scranton, PA is located in the eastern portion of Pennsylvania, relatively
      close to the New Jersey border.

      - Radford, VA is positioned in the western part of Virginia, closer to the West
      Virginia and Kentucky borders than to the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - While Virginia is generally south of Pennsylvania, Radford''s location in
      western Virginia puts it significantly farther west than Scranton''s location
      in northeastern Pennsylvania.


      YES, Radford University in Virginia is located west of Marywood University in

      - Radford University is in Radford, Virginia (VA).

      - Marywood University is in Pennsylvania (PA).


      Step 2: Think about the general east-west positioning of Virginia and Pennsylvania.

      Virginia is south of Pennsylvania, but the question is about east-west positioning.
      In general, Virginia is to the southwest of Pennsylvania, which means at least
      part of Virginia is west of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: I need to identify the specific locations within these states.

      - Virginia is south of Pennsylvania

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia is in the mid-Atlantic region


      Now for the specific universities:

      - Radford University is located in Radford, Virginia, which is in the western
      part of Virginia, in the Blue Ridge Mountains region

      - Marywood University is located in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which is in the
      northeastern part of Pennsylvania


      Looking at their relative positions on an east-west axis:

      - Western Virginia is generally west of northeastern Pennsylvania

      - Radford, VA would be further west than Scranton, PA


      Therefore, Radford University (in western VA) should be west of Marywood University
      (in northeastern PA).</think># Is Radford University, VA located west of Marywood
      University, PA?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic positions of both
      universities.


      ## Step 1: Locate both universities

      - Radford University is located in Radford, Virginia

      - Marywood University is located in Scranton, Pennsylvania


      ## Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions

      - Virginia is south of Pennsylvania

      - However, the question is asking about east-west positioning, not north-south


      ## Step 3: Determine specific locations within their states

      - Radford, VA is in the western part of Virginia (in the Blue Ridge Mountains
      region)

      - Scranton, PA is in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania


      ## Step 4: Compare east-west positions

      - Western Virginia is generally west of northeastern Pennsylvania on a map

      - Radford is significantly further west than Scranton

      First, let me think about the locations of these states:

      - Ohio (OH) is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - South Carolina (SC) is on the East Coast in the Southeast region


      When comparing east-west positions in the US, we''re essentially comparing longitude.
      States further west have a higher longitude value.


      Generally speaking, Ohio is west of South Carolina in terms of US geography.
      The entire state of Ohio should be west of South Carolina.


      Since Central State University is in Ohio, and the College of Charleston is
      in South Carolina, Central State University should be west of the College of
      Charleston.


      Let me double-check this geographic understanding: Ohio borders Pennsylvania
      to its east and extends westward toward Indiana and Illinois. South Carolina
      is on the Atlantic coast, bordering North Carolina and Georgia. This confirms
      that Ohio is indeed west of South Carolina.</think>To determine if Central State
      University in Ohio is located west of the College of Charleston in South Carolina,
      I need to consider the geographic positions of these two states.

      - Ohio (OH) is located in the Midwest region of the United States.

      - South Carolina (SC) is located on the East Coast in the Southeast region.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - South Carolina sits along the Atlantic Ocean on the eastern seaboard.

      - Ohio is more inland and positioned significantly west of South Carolina.


      Step 3: Since the universities are in their respective states, their relative
      positions follow the same pattern.

      - Central State University is in Ohio

      - College of Charleston is in South Carolina


      Since Ohio is west of South Carolina on a map of the United States, Central
      State University is west of the College of Charleston.

      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Ohio is significantly west of South Carolina when looking at a map of the
      United States.

      - South Carolina borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east, while Ohio is inland
      and several states away from the East Coast.


      Step 3: Since the universities are located within these respective states, their
      relative positions follow the same pattern.

      - Central State University is in Ohio, therefore it is west of South Carolina.

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - South Carolina is on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions.

      - Ohio is positioned further west compared to South Carolina

      - All locations in Ohio are west of coastal South Carolina


      Since Central State University is in Ohio, and College of Charleston is in South
      Carolina, Central State University is indeed located west of College of Charleston.

      Step 1: Determine the location of Arkansas State University-Mountain Home, AR.

      Arkansas State University-Mountain Home is located in Mountain Home, Arkansas.
      Arkansas is a state in the south-central region of the United States.


      Step 2: Determine the location of Ball State University, IN.

      Ball State University is located in Muncie, Indiana. Indiana is a state in the
      Midwestern United States.


      Step 3: Compare the relative east-west positions of these locations.

      The continental United States is generally organized so that states in the west
      have lower longitude numbers than states in the east.


      Arkansas is west of Indiana on the map of the United States. Arkansas is in

      - Arkansas (AR) is a state in the south-central region of the United States

      - Indiana (IN) is a state in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their geographic positions.

      Looking at a US map, Arkansas is located to the west of Indiana. The Mississippi
      River generally forms part of the eastern border of Arkansas, while Indiana
      is several states east of that.

      (in North Carolina).


      To determine this, I need to consider the relative locations of Minnesota (MN)
      and North Carolina (NC) in the United States.


      Minnesota is located in the northern part of the Midwest region of the United
      States, bordering Canada.

      North Carolina is located on the East Coast of the United States.


      When considering east and west in the US:

      - States on the East Coast are the easternmost states

      - States in the Midwest are west of the East Coast states

      - Minnesota is in the Midwest, which is west of North Carolina on the East Coast


      Therefore, Saint Mary''s University of Minnesota in Minnesota would be located
      west of Wingate University in North Carolina.</think>To determine if Saint Mary''s
      University of Minnesota is west of Wingate University, I need to compare the
      geographic locations of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Saint Mary''s University of Minnesota is in Minnesota (MN)

      - Wingate University is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states within the United
      States.

      - Minnesota is located in the Upper Midwest region of the United States

      - North Carolina is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      - Minnesota sits much farther west in the continental United States compared
      to North Carolina

      - The entire state of Minnesota is west of North Carolina


      Step 4: Since the universities are in these respective states, Saint Mary''s
      University (in Minnesota) must be west of Wingate University (in North Carolina).

      Now I need to determine which one is more west (or east) than the other.


      Looking at the United States map:

      - Kentucky is located to the west of Virginia

      - Louisville, KY would be west of Hampton, VA


      Since we''re determining if Bellarmine University (in Louisville, KY) is west
      of Hampton University (in Hampton, VA), and Kentucky is indeed west of Virginia,
      the answer would be YES.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Bellarmine University is in Louisville, Kentucky (KY)

      - Hampton University is in Hampton, Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Kentucky is in the east-central United States

      - Virginia is on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - Kentucky is positioned to the west of Virginia

      - Louisville, KY is therefore west of Hampton, VA


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Bellarmine University (in Louisville, KY) is located west of Hampton University
      (in Hampton, VA), the answer is:


      YES'

      to compare the geographic locations of Bellarmine University in Kentucky and
      Hampton University in Virginia.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Bellarmine University is located.

      Bellarmine University is in Louisville, Kentucky. Kentucky is in the central-eastern
      part of the United States.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Hampton University is located.

      Hampton University is in Hampton, Virginia. Virginia is on the eastern coast
      of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      When comparing east-west positions in the United States, we need to look at
      their longitudes. States further west have higher longitude values (going westward
      from the Prime Meridian).


      Kentucky is generally west of Virginia. Kentucky is more inland, while Virginia
      is along the Atlantic coast. On a map of the US, Kentucky appears to the west
      of Virginia.


      Therefore, Bellarmine University in Kentucky would be west of Hampton University
      in Virginia.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of

      - Hampton University is located in Hampton, Virginia


      Step 2: Compare the geographic positions of Kentucky and Virginia.

      Kentucky is located in the central-eastern United States, while Virginia is
      on the eastern coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Kentucky is situated to the west of Virginia.
      Louisville, KY is further inland and westward compared to Hampton, VA which
      is near the Atlantic coast.


      Therefore, Bellarmine University (in Kentucky) is indeed located west of Hampton
      University (in Virginia).


      YES'

      2. Hampton University is located in Hampton, Virginia.


      Now I need to determine which one is further west:


      Kentucky is generally west of Virginia in the United States. Virginia is on
      the east coast, while Kentucky is more inland.


      Louisville, Kentucky is in the northern part of Kentucky, near the Indiana border.

      Hampton, Virginia is on the eastern coast of Virginia, near the Chesapeake Bay.


      Given that:

      - Virginia is on the east coast of the US

      - Kentucky is further inland and west of Virginia


      Therefore, Bellarmine University in Louisville, Kentucky would be west of Hampton
      University in Hampton, Virginia.</think># Is Bellarmine University, KY located
      west of Hampton University, VA?


      I need to determine the relative locations of these two universities.

      - Bellarmine University is located in Louisville, Kentucky

      - Hampton University is located in Hampton, Virginia


      Step 2: Compare the geographic positions of Kentucky and Virginia.

      - Kentucky is an inland state in the central part of the United States

      - Virginia is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Analyze their east-west positioning.

      - States further east have higher longitude values (in degrees east)

      - Virginia is significantly east of Kentucky on the US map

      - All of Kentucky is west of Virginia''s position


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Louisville, Kentucky is west of Hampton, Virginia, Bellarmine University
      is indeed west of Hampton University.


      YES'

      - Minnesota (MN) is in the upper Midwest region of the United States

      - Ohio (OH) is further east, in what''s sometimes called the Midwest but is
      really closer to the East Coast


      Looking at the US map in my mind, Minnesota is definitely west of Ohio. Any
      location in Minnesota would be west of any location in Ohio.


      Dunwoody College of Technology is in Minnesota (specifically in Minneapolis,
      I believe).

      Franciscan University of Steubenville is in Ohio (in Steubenville, which is
      in eastern Ohio).

      To determine if Dunwoody College of Technology in Minnesota is located west
      of Franciscan University of Steubenville in Ohio, I need to consider the geographic
      locations of these two states.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both states.

      - Minnesota (MN) is located in the Upper Midwest region of the United States

      - Ohio (OH) is located in the eastern part of the Midwest region


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Minnesota is considerably west of Ohio on the U.S. map

      - Ohio borders Pennsylvania to its east, while Minnesota borders North and South
      Dakota to its west


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      - Dunwoody College of Technology is in Minneapolis, Minnesota

      - Franciscan University is in Steubenville, Ohio (in eastern Ohio)


      Since any location in Minnesota is geographically west of any location in Ohio,
      Dunwoody College of Technology must be west of Franciscan University of Steubenville.

      The question is asking if BYU is located west of the University of Nebraska
      at Kearney.


      To answer this, I need to know the relative positions of Utah and Nebraska in
      the United States.


      Utah is in the western United States, part of the Mountain West region.

      Nebraska is in the Great Plains/Midwest region.


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Utah is definitely west of Nebraska. Utah
      borders Nevada to its west and Colorado to its east. Nebraska is east of Colorado.


      So BYU, which is in Utah, would be west of the University of Nebraska at Kearney,
      which is in Nebraska.


      Therefore, the answer is YES, BYU Honors Program in Utah is located west of
      the University of Nebraska at Kearney in Nebraska.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the geographic locations of both institutions and compare

      - University of Nebraska at Kearney is located in Nebraska (NE)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic position of these states within the US.

      - Utah is in the western United States, in the Mountain West region

      - Nebraska is in the Midwest/Great Plains region


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - On a US map, Utah is significantly west of Nebraska

      - Utah borders Nevada to its west and Colorado to its east

      - Nebraska is east of Colorado


      Therefore, BYU in Utah is indeed west of the University of Nebraska at Kearney

      (UT)

      2. University of Nebraska at Kearney, NE - This is in Nebraska (NE)


      Now I need to determine their relative east-west positions. In the US, states
      that are further west have lower longitude values (further from the Prime Meridian).


      Utah is in the western United States, and Nebraska is in the central United
      States. Geographically, Utah is west of Nebraska.


      More specifically:

      - Utah is bordered by Nevada to the west, Idaho to the north, Wyoming to the
      northeast, Colorado to the east, Arizona to the south, and New Mexico to the
      southeast.

      - Nebraska is bordered by South Dakota to the north, Iowa and Missouri to the
      east, Kansas to the south, Colorado to the southwest, and Wyoming to the west.


      Since Utah borders Nevada (which is on the west coast), while Nebraska is in

      the specific locations.


      Aurora, IL is in the northeastern part of Illinois, near Chicago.

      Findlay, OH is in the northwestern part of Ohio.


      Even though they''re both in the northern parts of their respective states,
      since Illinois is west of Ohio overall, and these cities aren''t at extreme
      edges that would change the relationship, Aurora University should still be
      west of University of Findlay.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Aurora University is located in Aurora, Illinois

      - University of Findlay is located in Findlay, Ohio


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Illinois and Ohio.

      - Illinois is located west of Ohio in the United States

      - Aurora is in northeastern Illinois (near Chicago)

      - Findlay is in northwestern Ohio


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Even though both cities are in the northern parts of their respective states,
      the state of Illinois lies entirely west of Ohio. There''s no part of Illinois
      that extends east of the westernmost part of Ohio.


      Therefore, Aurora University in Illinois is indeed located west of University
      of Findlay in Ohio.

      Aurora University is located in Aurora, Illinois (IL).

      University of Findlay is located in Findlay, Ohio (OH).


      Let me think about the geographic positions of these states:

      - Illinois is west of Ohio in the United States.

      - Specifically, Illinois borders Indiana on its eastern side, and Indiana borders
      Ohio on its eastern side.

      - So Illinois is definitely west of Ohio.


      Now, within these states:

      - Aurora is a city in northeastern Illinois, in the Chicago metropolitan area.

      - Findlay is a city in northwestern Ohio.


      Since Illinois is entirely west of Ohio, and Aurora is in Illinois while Findlay
      is in Ohio, it follows that Aurora University must be west of University of
      Findlay.</think>I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Illinois and Ohio.

      - Illinois is located west of Ohio in the United States

      - Illinois and Ohio are not adjacent states (Indiana lies between them)


      Step 3: More specifically, Aurora is in northeastern Illinois (in the Chicago
      metropolitan area), while Findlay is in northwestern Ohio.


      Step 4: Since Illinois is entirely west of Ohio geographically, any location
      in Illinois (including Aurora) must be west of any location in Ohio (including
      Findlay).

      I need to determine whether Air University in Alabama is located west of the
      Community College of Vermont in Vermont.


      First, let me think about the general geographical locations of these two states:

      - Alabama (AL) is in the southeastern United States

      - Vermont (VT) is in the northeastern United States


      In the United States, west-to-east generally moves from the Pacific coast toward
      the Atlantic coast. So states further to the west have a higher longitude (more
      negative longitude numbers, since the US is in the Western Hemisphere).


      Alabama is south of Vermont, but the question is asking about east-west positioning.


      Alabama is roughly in the middle-eastern part of the country, while Vermont
      is in the far northeastern part of the country. Generally speaking, Alabama
      would be west of Vermont.


      Therefore, Air University in Alabama would be west of the Community College
      of Vermont in Vermont.</think># Is Air University, AL located west of Community

      - Air University is in Alabama (AL), which is in the southeastern United States.

      - Community College of Vermont is in Vermont (VT), which is in the northeastern
      United States.


      Step 2: Compare their longitudes.

      - Vermont is positioned in the far northeastern corner of the country, bordering
      Canada and near the Atlantic coast.

      - Alabama is positioned in the southeastern region, but critically, it sits
      further west in the country than Vermont.


      Step 3: Determine relative east-west positioning.

      - On a map of the United States, Alabama is positioned to the west of Vermont,
      even though Alabama is also south of Vermont.


      YES, Air University in Alabama is located west of Community College of Vermont
      in Vermont.'

      Let me consider the general geographic positions:


      Louisiana is located to the west of Alabama in the United States. Looking at
      a mental map of the US:

      - Louisiana is on the Gulf Coast, west of Mississippi

      - Alabama is on the Gulf Coast, east of Mississippi

      Orleans (in Louisiana) would be west of Troy (in Alabama).


      So the answer should be YES, New Orleans University, LA is located west of Troy
      University, AL.


      However, I should note that I''m not completely sure if "New Orleans University"

      University in Alabama (AL).


      Step 1: First, I need to determine where these universities are located.

      - New Orleans University would be in New Orleans, Louisiana

      - Troy University would be in Troy, Alabama


      Step 2: I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these locations.

      - Louisiana is generally west of Alabama in the United States

      - New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana

      - Troy is in southeastern Alabama


      Step 3: Let me think about the specific locations more carefully.

      - New Orleans is located along the Gulf Coast in the southeastern part of Louisiana

      - Troy, Alabama is in the southeastern part of Alabama, but not on the coast


      Even though both are in the southeastern parts of their respective states, Louisiana
      as a whole is west of Alabama. New Orleans is in the eastern part of Louisiana,
      and Troy is not in the extreme western part of Alabama, but Louisiana is sufficiently
      west of Alabama that New Orleans should still be west of Troy.


      Let me be sure: Louisiana borders Texas to its west and Mississippi to its east.
      Alabama is east of Mississippi. So the ordering from west to east would be:
      Texas -> Louisiana -> Mississippi -> Alabama. This confirms that New Orleans
      (in Louisiana) is west of Troy (in Alabama).</think>To determine if New Orleans
      University, LA is located west of Troy University, AL, I need to analyze their
      geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      * New Orleans University would be in New Orleans, Louisiana

      * Troy University is in Troy, Alabama


      Step 2: Consider the states'' positions.

      Louisiana is west of Alabama in the United States. Looking at a map, Louisiana
      borders Texas to its west and Mississippi to its east, while Alabama is east
      of Mississippi.


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana near the Gulf Coast, while Troy is
      in southeastern Alabama. Even though both are in the southeastern portions of
      their respective states, the fact that Louisiana as a whole is west of Alabama
      means that New Orleans is west of Troy.


      YES, New Orleans University, LA is located west of Troy University, AL.'

      to determine the geographic locations of New Orleans University in Louisiana
      and Troy University in Alabama, and then compare their east-west positions.


      First, let me think about New Orleans, LA. New Orleans is located in southeastern
      Louisiana, near the Gulf of Mexico.


      Next, let''s consider Troy, AL. Troy is located in southeastern Alabama.


      Now I need to compare their east-west positions. In the US, states that are
      further west have higher longitude values (when using negative numbers, as is
      conventional for the Western Hemisphere, they have lower absolute values).


      Louisiana is west of Alabama on the US map. Louisiana borders Texas to its west
      and Mississippi to its east, while Alabama is east of Mississippi.


      Since New Orleans is in Louisiana and Troy is in Alabama, and Louisiana is west
      of Alabama, New Orleans University would be west of Troy University.


      Let me just double-check if there''s actually a "New Orleans University" specifically.
      There''s the University of New Orleans, Tulane University in New Orleans, and
      other institutions in New Orleans, but I don''t recall one specifically called
      "New Orleans University." However, regardless of the exact name, any university
      in New Orleans would be west of Troy University in Alabama because of the geographical
      positions of the two cities.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - New Orleans University would be in New Orleans, Louisiana

      Step 2: Consider the geographic locations of these states.

      - Louisiana is in the south-central United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico

      - Alabama is in the southeastern United States, also with Gulf coastline


      Step 3: Compare their positions on the east-west axis.

      - Louisiana is west of Alabama on the US map

      - Louisiana borders Mississippi to its east

      - Alabama is east of Mississippi


      Step 4: Since New Orleans is in Louisiana and Troy is in Alabama, and Louisiana
      is west of Alabama, New Orleans University would be west of Troy University.

      In terms of specific cities:

      - New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana

      - Troy, Alabama is in the southeastern part of Alabama

      - Louisiana and Alabama are not adjacent - Mississippi lies between them


      Step 3: More specifically, New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana, while Troy
      is in southeastern Alabama.


      Step 4: Since Louisiana as a whole state is west of Alabama, any city in Louisiana

      east-west positions of these two universities.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - Midwestern State University is in Texas (TX)

      - Lewis University is in Illinois (IL)


      To determine which is further west, I need to consider their approximate locations
      within their respective states:


      - Texas is generally west of Illinois in the United States

      - Midwestern State University has "Texas" in its name, suggesting it''s in Texas

      - Lewis University is in Illinois


      Since Texas is west of Illinois on a map of the United States, Midwestern State
      University (in Texas) would be west of Lewis University (in Illinois).


      But let me be more specific about their exact locations if I can recall them:

      - Midwestern State University of Texas is in Wichita Falls, TX, which is in
      the northern part of Texas

      - Lewis University is in Romeoville, IL, which is in the northeastern part of
      Illinois near Chicago

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Midwestern State University is located in Wichita Falls, Texas (TX)

      - Lewis University is located in Romeoville, Illinois (IL)


      ## Step 2: Compare the geographical positions

      - Texas is located significantly west of Illinois in the United States

      - Wichita Falls, TX is in the northern part of Texas

      - Romeoville, IL is in the northeastern part of Illinois (near Chicago)

      1. California College of the Arts (CCA) is located in California (CA). Specifically,
      it has campuses in San Francisco and Oakland, both of which are in the San Francisco
      Bay Area in California, on the west coast of the United States.


      2. Eastern Washington University (EWU) is located in Washington state (WA).
      More specifically, it''s in Cheney, Washington, which is in the eastern part
      of Washington state (hence the name "Eastern" Washington University).


      3. Now I need to determine which is further west. California is generally west
      of Washington state, since both are on the west coast but California is further
      south. However, since Eastern Washington University is in the eastern part of

      (San Francisco Bay Area), I need to be more precise.


      4. Washington state is north of California, and both states border the Pacific
      Ocean on their western edges. Eastern Washington (where EWU is located) is in
      the eastern part of Washington state, away from the coast. The San Francisco

      in San Francisco and Oakland in the Bay Area.


      2) Eastern Washington University (EWU) is located in Cheney, Washington, in
      the eastern part of Washington state (as its name suggests).


      3) Both California and Washington are west coast states, with Washington being
      north of California.


      4) Since EWU is in the eastern part of Washington, it''s further inland from
      the Pacific coast.


      5) CCA''s locations in San Francisco/Oakland are on the western side of California,
      very close to the Pacific Ocean.

      College of the Arts (CCA) in California is located west of Eastern Washington
      University (EWU) in Washington, I need to think about the geographic locations
      of these two institutions.


      First, let''s establish the locations:

      1. California College of the Arts (CCA) is in California (CA), which is on the
      west coast of the United States.

      2. Eastern Washington University (EWU) is in Washington state (WA), which is
      also on the west coast, but north of California.


      Given the names of these institutions, I can make educated inferences:

      - "Eastern" in Eastern Washington University suggests it''s in the eastern part
      of Washington state.

      - Washington state itself is on the west coast, but its eastern portion would
      be more inland.

      - California College of the Arts is likely in one of California''s major cities,
      which tend to be closer to the coast.


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - Western locations have lower longitude numbers (more negative in the Western
      Hemisphere)

      - Eastern locations have higher longitude numbers (less negative in the Western
      Hemisphere)


      So if Eastern Washington University is in the eastern part of Washington state,
      and California College of the Arts is likely in a coastal California city, then
      CCA is probably further west (lower/more negative longitude) than EWU.


      Therefore, California College of the Arts is likely west of Eastern Washington
      University.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these
      two colleges by considering their geographic locations.

      - California College of the Arts (CCA) is in California

      - Eastern Washington University (EWU) is in Washington state


      Step 2: Consider their specific positions within their states.

      part of Washington state (specifically in Cheney, near Spokane)

      - California College of the Arts has campuses in San Francisco and Oakland,
      which are coastal cities in California


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes (east-west positioning).

      - Eastern Washington is inland, in the eastern portion of Washington state

      - San Francisco/Oakland are on the Pacific coast

      - The Pacific coast of California is west of eastern Washington


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on continental geography.

      to determine the relative east-west positioning of California College of the
      Arts (in California) and Eastern Washington University (in Washington).


      First, let me identify where these colleges are located:


      1. California College of the Arts (CCA) is located in California (CA). Based
      on its name, it''s in California state, which is on the west coast of the United
      States.


      2. Eastern Washington University (EWU) is located in Washington (WA) state,
      which is also on the west coast of the United States, but north of California.


      The key is determining their relative east-west positions. Washington state
      is directly north of California, but the "Eastern" in Eastern Washington University
      suggests it''s in the eastern part of Washington state.


      California extends further west than Washington state does, as California''s
      coastline has a more westward bulge. However, Eastern Washington University,
      as its name suggests, is in the eastern part of Washington, which would be further
      east than most of California.


      California College of the Arts has campuses in San Francisco and Oakland, both
      of which are on the western side of California near the Pacific coast. These
      locations are very far west.


      Eastern Washington University is located in Cheney, Washington, which is in
      the eastern part of Washington state, near the Idaho border. This is significantly
      further east than San Francisco or Oakland.


      So, California College of the Arts (in western California) is located west of
      Eastern Washington University (in eastern Washington).</think>I need to determine
      the east-west positioning of these two colleges.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both colleges.

      - California College of the Arts (CCA) is located in California, specifically
      with campuses in San Francisco and Oakland, which are on the western coast of
      California near the Pacific Ocean.

      - Eastern Washington University (EWU) is located in Cheney, Washington, which
      is in the eastern part of Washington state (as its name suggests), near the
      Idaho border.


      Step 2: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - San Francisco and Oakland are very far west, sitting right on the Pacific
      coast of California.

      - Eastern Washington University, being in the eastern part of Washington state,
      is significantly inland from the Pacific coast.


      Step 3: Determine relative east-west positioning.

      - Even though Washington state is north of California, the "Eastern" in EWU
      is significant - it indicates this university is in the inland, eastern portion
      of the state.

      - California coastal cities like San Francisco and Oakland are further west
      than eastern Washington locations.


      YES, California College of the Arts is located west of Eastern Washington University.'

      - Washington is also on the west coast, but it''s north of California

      - In terms of east-west positioning, both states border the Pacific Ocean on
      their western edges


      Now, for the specific universities:

      - California College of the Arts is in California, which would be in the western
      part of the state since it has "California" in its name

      - Eastern Washington University has "Eastern" in its name, suggesting it''s
      in the eastern part of Washington state


      Washington state is north of California, but the question is about east-west
      positioning. Since Eastern Washington University is in the eastern part of Washington,
      and California College of the Arts is likely in the western part of California
      (and California itself is not east of Washington), California College of the
      Arts should be west of Eastern Washington University.


      Let me verify this with more specific locations:

      - California College of the Arts has campuses in San Francisco and Oakland,
      which are on the western coast of California

      - Eastern Washington University is in Cheney, Washington, which is in the eastern
      part of Washington state, near Spokane


      So California College of the Arts is on the western coast, while Eastern Washington

      University (WA), I need to identify the specific locations of these institutions
      and compare their east-west positioning.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both colleges.

      - California College of the Arts has campuses in San Francisco and Oakland,
      California, which are on the western coast of California.

      - Eastern Washington University is located in Cheney, Washington, which is in
      the eastern part of Washington state (near Spokane).


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions on an east-west axis.

      - While Washington state is north of California, we need to focus specifically
      on east-west positioning.

      - Eastern Washington University, as its name suggests, is in the eastern portion
      of Washington state, far from the Pacific coast.

      - California College of the Arts is on the western coast of California, directly
      on the Pacific Ocean.


      Step 3: Make the determination based on longitude.

      - Locations on the Pacific coast (like San Francisco/Oakland) are further west
      than locations in eastern Washington.

      - The west coast of California has a more westerly longitude than eastern Washington.


      YES, California College of the Arts is located west of Eastern Washington University.'

      College in Georgia.


      To answer this, I need to think about the relative geographic positions of Texas
      and Georgia in the United States.


      The United States is generally laid out with the west coast (California, Oregon,
      Washington) on the left side of the map, and the east coast (Maine, New York,
      Florida, etc.) on the right side of the map.


      Texas is in the southern part of the United States, bordering Mexico, and is
      generally considered to be in the Southwest.


      Georgia is on the east coast of the United States, in the Southeast region.


      On a west-to-east orientation, Texas is west of Georgia. This means that locations
      in Texas are generally west of locations in Georgia.


      Since Jarvis Christian College is in Texas, and Georgia Highlands College is
      in Georgia, Jarvis Christian College would be west of Georgia Highlands College.</think>To
      determine whether Jarvis Christian College in Texas is located west of Georgia
      Highlands College in Georgia, I need to consider the geographical positions
      of these two states.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the two states.

      - Texas is located in the southwestern United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - On a map of the United States, Texas is positioned to the west of Georgia

      - All of Texas is west of all of Georgia


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific colleges.

      - Since Jarvis Christian College is in Texas, and Georgia Highlands College
      is in Georgia, the same east-west relationship applies

      - The specific locations within their respective states don''t change this overall
      relationship


      YES, Jarvis Christian College in Texas is located west of Georgia Highlands
      College in Georgia.'

    a5e70226-febc-49fe-bb09-2bf7a9afe30e: '<think>I need to determine if University
      of Louisiana at Lafayette, LA is located west of Western College for Women,
      OH.


      First, let me identify where these institutions are located:


      1. University of Louisiana at Lafayette is in Lafayette, Louisiana

      2. Western College for Women is in Oxford, Ohio


      Now, I need to determine their relative east-west positioning. In the United
      States, states that are further west have a higher longitude (going from east
      to west).


      Louisiana is in the southern part of the US, along the Gulf of Mexico, and is
      generally in the south-central part of the country.


      Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, significantly more to the east than
      Louisiana.


      Specifically, Louisiana is west of Ohio. Lafayette, LA would be west of Oxford,
      OH. So the University of Louisiana at Lafayette would be west of Western College
      for Women.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the east-west
      relationship between these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - University of Louisiana at Lafayette is in Lafayette, Louisiana

      - Western College for Women is in Oxford, Ohio


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions on the US map.

      - Louisiana is located in the south-central part of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region in the eastern portion of
      the United States


      Step 3: Determine east-west positioning.

      - States further west have lower longitudes than states further east

      - Louisiana is significantly west of Ohio on the US map

      - Therefore, Lafayette, LA is west of Oxford, OH


      YES, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, LA is located west of Western
      College for Women, OH.'

      relative geographic positions of two U.S. colleges. Let me reason through this:


      1. University of Louisiana at Lafayette is located in Lafayette, Louisiana (indicated
      by "LA" in the question)

      2. Western College for Women is located in Ohio (indicated by "OH" in the question)


      To determine which is more westerly, I need to consider the geographical positions
      of Louisiana and Ohio within the United States:


      - Louisiana is in the southern part of the U.S., bordering the Gulf of Mexico

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the U.S.


      Looking at the map of the United States, Louisiana is clearly west of Ohio.
      Louisiana is roughly in the south-central part of the country, while Ohio is
      much further east, closer to the Atlantic coast.


      Since University of Louisiana at Lafayette is in Louisiana, and Western College
      for Women is in Ohio, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette would be west
      of Western College for Women.


      So despite the potentially confusing name "Western College for Women," geographical
      location is what matters, not the name.</think>I need to determine the relative
      east-west positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both colleges.

      - University of Louisiana at Lafayette is in Lafayette, Louisiana (LA)

      - Western College for Women is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Louisiana and Ohio.

      - Louisiana is located in the southern United States, along the Gulf of Mexico

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes.

      - Louisiana is situated in the south-central portion of the United States

      - Ohio is much further east, closer to the Atlantic coast

      - On a U.S. map, Louisiana is significantly west of Ohio


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      Despite the name "Western College for Women" suggesting a western location,
      its actual geographic position in Ohio is east of Louisiana''s position.


      YES, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, LA is located west of Western College
      for Women, OH.'

      Medicine in Pennsylvania (PA) and Westfield State University in Massachusetts
      (MA).


      2) University of Pittsburgh is located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which is
      in the western part of Pennsylvania.


      3) Westfield State University is located in Westfield, Massachusetts, which
      is in the western part of Massachusetts.


      4) To determine which is further west, I need to consider the relative positions
      of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts in
      the United States.


      5) Even though both schools might be in the western parts of their respective
      states, Pennsylvania as a whole is west of Massachusetts.


      6) Pittsburgh is in the western part of Pennsylvania, which puts it even further
      west compared to western Massachusetts.


      7) Therefore, University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine in PA is located
      west of Westfield State University in MA.</think>I need to determine the relative
      east-west positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

      - Westfield State University is in Westfield, Massachusetts


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.

      - Pennsylvania is located west of Massachusetts in the United States

      - Pittsburgh is in the western part of Pennsylvania

      - Westfield is in the western part of Massachusetts


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Even though Westfield is in western Massachusetts, Pennsylvania as a whole
      state is west of Massachusetts

      - Pittsburgh''s location in western Pennsylvania puts it even further west than
      western Massachusetts


      Therefore, University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine, PA is indeed
      located west of Westfield State University, MA.

      positions of Kentucky Christian University in Kentucky (KY) and Old Dominion

      First, let me think about the states themselves:

      - Kentucky (KY) is located in the east-central United States

      - Virginia (VA) is located on the east coast of the United States


      Generally speaking, Kentucky is west of Virginia. On a map of the US, Kentucky
      would be to the left (west) of Virginia.


      To be more precise, I should consider the specific locations of these universities:


      Kentucky Christian University is in Grayson, Kentucky, which is in the eastern
      part of Kentucky.

      Old Dominion University is in Norfolk, Virginia, which is in the southeastern
      part of Virginia.


      Even though Kentucky Christian is in eastern Kentucky, Kentucky as a whole is
      west of Virginia. So Kentucky Christian University should still be west of Old
      Dominion University.

      states'' positions, Kentucky Christian University is very likely west of Old
      Dominion University.</think>I need to determine if Kentucky Christian University

      the east coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare the general positions of these states.

      Kentucky is generally west of Virginia on the US map.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations of these universities.

      Kentucky Christian University is in Grayson, Kentucky, in the eastern part of
      the state.

      Old Dominion University is in Norfolk, Virginia, in the southeastern part of
      Virginia.


      Step 4: Make the final comparison.

      Even though Kentucky Christian is in eastern Kentucky, the eastern edge of Kentucky
      is still west of Norfolk, Virginia where Old Dominion is located.


      YES, Kentucky Christian University is located west of Old Dominion University.'

      I''ll need to:

      1. Identify the locations of both universities

      2. Compare their geographic positions (specifically east-west orientation)


      First, let''s break down the locations:

      - St. Andrews University in North Carolina (NC)

      - State University of New York at Oneonta in New York (NY)


      The United States generally has states arranged where:

      - Eastern states include the New England states and the Eastern Seaboard

      - Western states are toward the Pacific Ocean


      New York (NY) is located in the northeastern part of the United States.

      North Carolina (NC) is located on the southeastern coast of the United States.


      In terms of east-west orientation:

      - North Carolina is located south of New York, but the question is about east-west
      orientation

      - In the east-west direction, North Carolina is generally at a similar longitude
      or slightly west of New York, depending on the exact locations within each state

      - Oneonta, NY is in east-central New York state

      - St. Andrews University is in North Carolina, likely in the eastern or central
      part of the state


      I believe North Carolina is generally west of New York in some parts, but the

      - SUNY Oneonta is located in central-eastern New York state

      - St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, North Carolina, which is in the southern
      part of NC near the South Carolina border


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes (east-west positions).

      - New York is generally east of North Carolina on a map

      - SUNY Oneonta is positioned in the eastern portion of New York

      - While both states are on the eastern seaboard, North Carolina extends further
      west than the position of Oneonta in New York


      Step 4: Make the determination based on longitude.

      - North Carolina''s position, including Laurinburg where St. Andrews is located,
      is west of Oneonta''s position in New York


      NO, St. Andrews University in North Carolina is NOT located west of SUNY Oneonta

      Andrews University in North Carolina is located west of State University of
      New York at Oneonta, NY.


      Step 1: Let me recall the general geographical positions of North Carolina (NC)
      and New York (NY).

      - North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States, but is south of
      New York.

      - New York is also on the east coast, but is north of North Carolina.


      Step 2: To determine which is more west (further toward the west), I need to
      consider their relative longitudes.

      - In the United States, lower/smaller longitude numbers indicate more western
      locations.

      - Generally, locations along the same latitude on the East Coast tend to have
      similar longitudes, with slight variations.


      Step 3: Let me think specifically about these universities.

      - St. Andrews University is in North Carolina

      - SUNY Oneonta is in New York state


      Given that both states are on the East Coast, the longitude difference might
      not be huge, but typically:

      - North Carolina''s western border extends further west than New York''s western
      border

      - However, these specific universities could be anywhere within their respective
      states


      Step 4: In general, for East Coast states, the more southern states tend to
      have a coastline that curves more to the west compared to northern states. This
      would suggest that a location in North Carolina might be slightly more west
      than a location in New York, but this is not definitive for specific locations
      within these states.


      Without specific longitude data for these universities, my best estimate is
      that St. Andrews University in NC is likely slightly west of SUNY Oneonta, NY.

      1) First, I need to determine the relative positions of North Carolina and New
      York. Both are eastern states, but North Carolina is south of New York.


      2) On the East Coast of the US, the coastline curves inward as you move north,

      arrangement from west to east is: California -> Nevada -> Utah -> Colorado.


      Since Roseman University is in Nevada and Adams State University is in Colorado,
      and Nevada is west of Colorado, it follows that Roseman University is west of

      - Adams State University is in Colorado (CO)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between Nevada and Colorado.

      Nevada lies directly west of Utah, which borders Colorado on its western side.
      On a map of the United States, Nevada is positioned to the west of Colorado.


      Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the universities.

      Since Roseman University is in Nevada and Adams State University is in Colorado,
      and Nevada is west of Colorado, Roseman University must be west of Adams State
      University.

      University of Health Sciences in Nevada is west of Adams State University in
      Colorado.


      Let''s think about this geographically:


      1. Roseman University of Health Sciences is in Nevada (NV)

      2. Adams State University is in Colorado (CO)


      Looking at a map of the United States, Nevada is located west of Colorado. The
      entire state of Nevada is west of the entire state of Colorado. Colorado borders
      Utah on the west, and Nevada is west of Utah.


      So, without even knowing the specific cities within these states where these
      universities are located, I can determine that any location in Nevada would
      be west of any location in Colorado.


      Therefore, Roseman University in Nevada would be west of Adams State University
      in Colorado.</think>To determine if Roseman University of Health Sciences in
      Nevada is located west of Adams State University in Colorado, I need to consider

      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Roseman University of Health Sciences is in Nevada (NV)

      - Adams State University is in Colorado (CO)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - Looking at a map of the United States, Nevada is located entirely to the west
      of Colorado

      - Colorado and Nevada are not adjacent - Utah sits between them

      - Nevada borders the eastern side of California, while Colorado is two states
      east of Nevada


      Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the universities.

      - Since Roseman University is in Nevada, and Adams State University is in Colorado,
      the relative positions of the states determine the relative positions of the
      universities

      - Any location in Nevada would be west of any location in Colorado


      YES'

      if Roseman University of Health Sciences in Nevada is located west of Adams
      State University in Colorado.


      To answer this, I need to consider the geographical locations of these two states
      and universities.


      First, let''s consider the general geographical positions of Nevada and Colorado:

      - Nevada is located in the western United States, bordering California to the
      west and Utah to the east.

      - Colorado is located to the east of Nevada, with Utah in between them.


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - Nevada is generally west of Colorado on a map of the United States.


      Now for the specific universities:

      - Roseman University of Health Sciences is in Nevada (NV)

      - Adams State University is in Colorado (CO)


      Since Nevada is west of Colorado, and the universities are in their respective
      states, Roseman University (in Nevada) would be west of Adams State University
      (in Colorado).</think>I need to determine if Roseman University of Health Sciences
      in Nevada is located west of Adams State University in Colorado by looking at

      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Roseman University of Health Sciences is in Nevada (NV)

      - Adams State University is in Colorado (CO)


      Step 2: Determine the relative east-west positioning of these states.

      - Nevada is located in the western United States

      - Colorado is located east of Nevada (with Utah in between)


      Step 3: Consider longitude (east-west positioning).

      - States further west have lower longitude values

      - Nevada is entirely west of Colorado on a map of the United States


      Step 4: Apply this to the universities.

      - Since Roseman University is in Nevada, and Adams State University is in Colorado,
      Roseman University must be west of Adams State University.

      1. Roseman University of Health Sciences is in Nevada (NV)

      2. Adams State University is in Colorado (CO)


      In the United States, Nevada is located to the west of Colorado. Nevada borders
      the western edge of Utah, and Colorado is to the east of Utah. So generally

      coast since California is between Nevada and the Pacific Ocean, but Nevada is
      in the western part of the country)

      - Colorado is in the mountain region, east of Nevada and Utah

      1. Determine the location of Indiana University Northwest in Indiana (IN)

      2. Determine the location of Premier Flight Academy in Ohio (OH)

      3. Compare their east-west positions (longitude) to determine if Indiana University
      Northwest is west of Premier Flight Academy


      Indiana University Northwest (IUN) is located in Northwest Indiana, likely in
      the Gary area. Indiana is generally west of Ohio.


      Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio (OH). Ohio is east of Indiana.


      Based on the general geography of US states, Indiana is west of Ohio. Since
      Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana and Premier Flight Academy is in
      Ohio, it''s very likely that Indiana University Northwest is west of Premier
      Flight Academy.


      However, I should be careful because the question specifically mentions Indiana
      University Northwest being in northwest Indiana, which could be close to the
      Indiana-Ohio border. And I don''t know exactly where in Ohio Premier Flight
      Academy is located.</think># Determining if Indiana University Northwest, IN
      is west of Premier Flight Academy, OH


      I need to analyze the locations of these two institutions and their relative
      east-west positioning.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Indiana University Northwest is located in Indiana (IN), specifically in the
      city of Gary in the northwest corner of Indiana

      - Premier Flight Academy is located in Ohio (OH)


      ## Step 2: Compare states geographically

      - Indiana is entirely west of Ohio on the US map

      - Ohio borders Indiana''s eastern boundary

      - Even the easternmost parts of Indiana are west of the westernmost parts of
      Ohio


      ## Step 3: Make a conclusion

      Since Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana, and Premier Flight Academy
      is in Ohio, the Indiana institution must be west of the Ohio institution, regardless
      of their specific locations within their respective states.


      YES'

      Northwest in Indiana is located west of Premier Flight Academy in Ohio, I need
      to find the approximate locations of both institutions and compare their geographic
      positions, specifically their longitudes.


      Since U.S. states are generally arranged such that Indiana is west of Ohio (Indiana
      borders Ohio on Ohio''s western side), it''s likely that an institution in Indiana
      would be west of an institution in Ohio. However, I should confirm this by checking
      the specific locations.


      Indiana University Northwest (IUN) is located in Gary, Indiana, which is in
      the northwestern part of Indiana near Chicago.


      Premier Flight Academy appears to be in Ohio (OH). Without knowing the exact
      city, I would need to determine if any location in Ohio is east of Gary, Indiana.
      Since Ohio is entirely east of Indiana, any location in Ohio would be east of
      Gary, Indiana.


      Therefore, Indiana University Northwest in Indiana would be west of Premier
      Flight Academy in Ohio.</think># Is Indiana University Northwest, IN located
      west of Premier Flight Academy, OH?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two institutions
      by looking at their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Indiana University Northwest (IUN) is in Gary, Indiana (IN)

      - Premier Flight Academy is somewhere in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Indiana and Ohio.

      - Indiana is located directly west of Ohio on the U.S. map

      - The entire state of Indiana is west of the entire state of Ohio


      Step 3: Apply this state-level geography to the specific institutions.

      - Since IUN is in Indiana and Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio

      - Any location in Indiana would be west of any location in Ohio


      Therefore, Indiana University Northwest in Indiana is indeed located west of
      Premier Flight Academy in Ohio.


      NO


      Wait, I made an error in my conclusion. The answer should be:


      YES'

      geographical relationship between two locations:

      1. Indiana University Northwest, IN (in Indiana)

      2. Premier Flight Academy, OH (in Ohio)


      I need to determine whether Indiana University Northwest is located west of
      Premier Flight Academy.


      First, let me recall the general geographic arrangement of Indiana and Ohio:

      - Indiana is directly west of Ohio (Ohio borders Indiana to the east)

      - So generally speaking, locations in Indiana tend to be west of locations in
      Ohio


      However, I need to be more specific about these particular locations:


      Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana (indicated by "IN"). It''s likely
      in the northwest part of Indiana based on its name.


      Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio (indicated by "OH"). I''m not immediately
      certain where in Ohio it''s located.


      Given that Indiana is west of Ohio, and Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana
      while Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio, it''s very likely that Indiana University
      Northwest is west of Premier Flight Academy.


      However, there could be exceptions if:

      1. Indiana University Northwest is in the far eastern part of Indiana

      2. Premier Flight Academy is in the far western part of Ohio


      But the fact that Indiana University Northwest has "Northwest" in its name suggests
      it''s in the northwestern part of Indiana, which would be quite far from the
      Indiana-Ohio border.


      Based on this reasoning, Indiana University Northwest is almost certainly west
      of Premier Flight Academy.</think>To determine if Indiana University Northwest,
      IN is located west of Premier Flight Academy, OH, I need to analyze the geographic
      positions of these institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each institution is located.

      - Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana (IN)

      - Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic relationship between Indiana and Ohio.

      - Indiana is located directly west of Ohio (Ohio shares Indiana''s eastern border)


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Indiana University Northwest is likely in northwest Indiana based on its name

      - Premier Flight Academy is somewhere in Ohio


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on state positions.

      - Since Indiana is entirely west of Ohio, and these institutions are in their
      respective states, Indiana University Northwest must be west of Premier Flight
      Academy.

      - The easternmost point of Nebraska is still west of the westernmost point of
      Kentucky


      Step 3: Since Concordia University is in Nebraska and Gateway Community and
      Technical College is in Kentucky, they follow the same east-west relationship
      as their respective states.


      YES, Concordia University in Nebraska is located west of Gateway Community and

      and Technical College (KY).


      In the United States, states that are more west have a higher longitude (going
      from east to west). Nebraska is in the central part of the US, while Kentucky
      is in the eastern part.


      Nebraska is generally west of Kentucky. So a college in Nebraska would typically
      be west of a college in Kentucky.


      To confirm: Nebraska is in the Great Plains region, roughly in the middle of
      the country. Kentucky is in the Appalachian region, which is in the eastern
      part of the country. So Nebraska is indeed west of Kentucky.


      Therefore, Concordia University in Nebraska would be west of Gateway Community
      and Technical College in Kentucky.</think>To answer this question, I need to
      determine the relative locations of these two colleges based on their states.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Nebraska is located in the Great Plains region of the central United States,
      while Kentucky is in the eastern part of the country, in the Appalachian region.


      Step 3: Compare east-west positioning.

      On a map of the United States, Nebraska is significantly west of Kentucky. Nebraska
      sits roughly in the middle of the country, while Kentucky is in the eastern
      portion.


      Since the college in Nebraska is located in a state that is west of the state
      where the other college is located, Concordia University (NE) is indeed west
      of Gateway Community and Technical College (KY).

      First, let''s identify the locations:

      1. National American University is in South Dakota (SD)

      2. University of Central Arkansas is in Arkansas (AR)


      Now I need to determine their relative positions on a map. In the United States,
      states that are west have a lower longitude than states that are east.


      South Dakota is in the northern central part of the US, while Arkansas is in
      the south-central region.


      Looking at the geographical positions:

      - South Dakota is roughly in the middle of the country from east to west, but
      definitely west of the Mississippi River

      - Arkansas is also somewhat central, but more eastern and southern than South
      Dakota


      On a US map, South Dakota is generally positioned to the west of Arkansas. So
      National American University in SD would be west of University of Central Arkansas
      in AR.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two universities by examining which state is further west.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - National American University is in South Dakota (SD)

      - University of Central Arkansas is in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical positions of these states.

      - South Dakota is located in the north-central United States

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - South Dakota sits farther west than Arkansas on the map

      - South Dakota is positioned in the Great Plains region

      - Arkansas is positioned just west of the Mississippi River, but east of South
      Dakota


      Since South Dakota is west of Arkansas, and the universities are in their respective
      states, National American University in SD is located west of University of
      Central Arkansas in AR.

      Now I need to determine which one is further west. In the US, states that are
      more west have a higher longitude (more negative longitude numbers since we''re
      in western hemisphere).


      Missouri is in the central part of the United States, while Florida is in the
      southeastern part. Just based on state locations, Missouri is west of Florida.


      To be more precise:

      - Southwest Baptist University is in Bolivar, Missouri

      - Everglades University has campuses in Florida


      Missouri is definitely west of Florida on the US map. So Southwest Baptist University
      (in Missouri) would be west of Everglades University (in Florida).</think>I
      need to determine if Southwest Baptist University in Missouri is located west
      of Everglades University in Florida.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Southwest Baptist University is in Missouri (MO), which is in the central
      United States.

      - Everglades University is in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United
      States.


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions on an east-west axis.

      - Missouri is positioned significantly west of Florida on the US map.

      - Missouri is roughly in the middle of the continental US, while Florida is
      on the eastern seaboard.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Missouri is west of Florida, Southwest Baptist University (in Missouri)
      must be west of Everglades University (in Florida).


      YES'

      these two universities and compare them:


      1. Southwest Baptist University, MO - This is located in Missouri (MO)

      2. Everglades University, FL - This is located in Florida (FL)


      Now I need to figure out the geographic relationship between these two states:

      - Missouri is located in the central United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Missouri is positioned more to the west compared to Florida

      - Florida is positioned more to the east compared to Missouri


      Since the question is asking if Southwest Baptist University (in Missouri) is
      located west of Everglades University (in Florida), and Missouri is indeed west
      of Florida, the answer would be YES.</think>I need to determine the relative

      Let me think about the states first:

      - Urbana University is in Ohio (OH)

      - West Chester University is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Geographically, Ohio is west of Pennsylvania in the United States. Pennsylvania
      borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast, while Ohio is more inland.


      To be more precise:

      - Ohio is directly west of Pennsylvania

      - Therefore, most locations in Ohio would be west of locations in Pennsylvania


      Since Urbana University is in Ohio and West Chester University is in Pennsylvania,
      it''s very likely that Urbana University is west of West Chester University.
      However, to be absolutely certain, I should consider their specific locations
      within their states. But generally speaking, Ohio''s eastern border touches
      Pennsylvania''s western border, so virtually any location in Ohio would be west
      of any location in Pennsylvania.


      So, yes, Urbana University, OH is almost certainly located west of West Chester
      University of Pennsylvania, PA.</think>I need to determine the east-west relationship

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Ohio is located west of Pennsylvania in the United States

      - Pennsylvania is on the eastern side of the country, while Ohio is more inland


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations of these universities within their states.

      - Urbana, Ohio is located in the western half of Ohio

      - West Chester, Pennsylvania is in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia


      Step 4: Comparing these locations on an east-west axis.

      - Since Ohio is entirely west of Pennsylvania, and considering their specific

      2. West Chester University of Pennsylvania in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Specifically, I need to determine if Urbana University is located west of West
      Chester University.


      To solve this, I need to think about the geographic locations of Ohio and Pennsylvania,
      and then more specifically about these cities within those states.


      First, let me consider the states:

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is located in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region


      Generally speaking, Ohio is west of Pennsylvania in the United States.


      Now, let''s think more specifically about these cities:

      - Urbana is a city in Ohio

      - West Chester is a city in Pennsylvania


      Since Ohio is west of Pennsylvania, and these cities are in their respective
      states, it''s very likely that Urbana University in Ohio is west of West Chester
      University in Pennsylvania.


      To be even more precise:

      Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Pennsylvania
      is in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region. Generally, Ohio is west of Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Look at the specific locations within these states.

      Urbana, Ohio is located in west-central Ohio.

      West Chester, Pennsylvania is located in southeastern Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia
      (which is in the eastern part of Pennsylvania).


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      The question is specifically asking if Mount Hermon Female Seminary is located
      west of Brenau University.


      To answer this, I need to think about the geographic locations of Mississippi
      and Georgia in the United States.


      Mississippi (MS) is located in the southeastern United States, bordering the
      Gulf of Mexico to the south. It''s bordered by Alabama to the east, Tennessee
      to the north, Arkansas and Louisiana to the west.


      Georgia (GA) is also located in the southeastern United States, bordering the
      Atlantic Ocean to the east. It''s bordered by Florida to the south, Alabama
      to the west, Tennessee and North Carolina to the north, and South Carolina to
      the northeast.


      When comparing the locations of these two states, Mississippi is indeed west

      Mexico. Georgia is also in the southeastern US, but positioned to the east of
      Mississippi. Alabama sits between these two states.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-east axis.

      If you look at a US map, Mississippi is positioned to the west of Georgia. Moving
      from east to west across the southeastern states, you would encounter Georgia
      before Mississippi.

      Let''s think about the geography of the United States:

      - Mississippi is located west of Georgia. Mississippi borders Alabama on its
      eastern border, and Georgia is east of Alabama.

      - On a map of the US, if we look at the southeastern states, the order from
      west to east would be: Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, etc.

      to determine the geographical locations of both colleges and compare them.


      1. Reinhardt University is located in Georgia (GA).

      2. Keuka College is located in New York (NY).


      To determine which one is more west (or east), I need to consider their approximate
      longitudes. In the US, states on the east coast (like New York) are generally
      east of states that are more inland or southern (like Georgia).


      Georgia is a southeastern state, while New York is a northeastern state. On
      a US map, Georgia is positioned to the west of New York.


      Therefore, Reinhardt University in Georgia should be west of Keuka College in
      New York.


      Let me double-check this with my general knowledge of US geography:

      - New York is on the eastern seaboard of the US

      - Georgia is also on the eastern seaboard, but further south

      - Looking at a mental map of the US, Georgia is indeed west of New York, as
      the eastern coastline curves inward as you go south from New York to Georgia.


      So Reinhardt University in GA should be west of Keuka College in NY.</think>To
      determine if Reinhardt University in Georgia is located west of Keuka College
      in New York, I need to think about the relative geographic positions of these
      two states.


      Step 1: Consider the locations of the two states.

      - Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States.

      - New York (NY) is located in the northeastern United States.


      Step 2: Think about the east-west positioning of these states.

      - While both states are on the eastern side of the country, Georgia is positioned
      southwest of New York.

      - The eastern coastline of the United States curves inward as you move south
      from New York to Georgia.

      - This means that Georgia is actually positioned further west than New York.


      Step 3: Since Reinhardt University is in Georgia and Keuka College is in New
      York, Reinhardt University would be further west than Keuka College.


      YES, Reinhardt University in Georgia is located west of Keuka College in New
      York.'

      1. Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX

      2. Grand Valley State University, MI (Michigan)


      To determine which is more westerly, I need to compare their relative positions
      on a map, which essentially means comparing their longitudes. In the US, locations
      further west have more negative (or smaller) longitude values.


      Fredericksburg, TX is in central Texas. Texas is in the south-central part of
      the United States.

      Grand Valley State University is in Michigan, which is in the upper Midwest/Great
      Lakes region.


      Generally speaking, Texas is west of Michigan. On a map of the US, Texas is
      positioned more to the west than Michigan. Michigan is quite far east, bordering
      the Great Lakes, while Texas extends much further west.


      So Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX would be west of Grand Valley
      State University, MI.</think># Is Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX

      - Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg is in Texas (TX)

      - Grand Valley State University is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Michigan is located in the upper Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Texas is positioned significantly west of Michigan on the US map

      - Michigan borders the Great Lakes in the eastern portion of the US

      - Any location in Texas, including Fredericksburg, would be west of locations
      in Michigan


      Therefore, Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX is indeed located west
      of Grand Valley State University, MI.

    d2292982-9be7-42d4-bff3-b730b799de66: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the locations of Midland College in Texas and Oklahoma Baptist
      University in Oklahoma, and then compare their relative east-west positions.


      1. First, let me think about where Midland College is located. Midland is a
      city in west Texas. It''s located in the Permian Basin region, which is in the
      western part of Texas.


      2. Next, I need to think about where Oklahoma Baptist University is located.
      Based on my knowledge, Oklahoma Baptist University is in Shawnee, Oklahoma.
      Shawnee is located in central Oklahoma.


      3. Now I need to compare their east-west positions. Texas is generally west
      and south of Oklahoma. However, since Texas is a large state, parts of eastern
      Texas are east of parts of Oklahoma. But Midland is in west Texas, not east
      Texas.


      If we look at the map of the United States, Oklahoma is directly north of Texas.
      Midland, being in west Texas, would be southwest of Oklahoma. Shawnee, Oklahoma
      (where Oklahoma Baptist University is) is in central Oklahoma.


      When comparing east-west positions, we''re looking at longitude. Places further
      west have a higher longitude west (or lower longitude east). Midland, TX should
      be further west than Shawnee, OK.


      So Midland College, TX should be located west of Oklahoma Baptist University,
      OK.</think>I need to determine the east-west relationship between these two
      colleges by finding their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both colleges.

      - Midland College is located in Midland, Texas

      - Oklahoma Baptist University is located in Shawnee, Oklahoma


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these cities.

      - Midland is located in west Texas, in the Permian Basin region

      - Shawnee is located in central Oklahoma, east of Oklahoma City


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes.

      - Texas extends further west than Oklahoma

      - Midland is in the western portion of Texas

      - Shawnee, Oklahoma is in the central/eastern part of Oklahoma


      Step 4: Make the east-west determination.

      - Midland, TX is significantly further west than Shawnee, OK


      YES, Midland College, TX is located west of Oklahoma Baptist University, OK.'

      Step 1: Determine where Midland College is located in Texas.

      Midland College is located in Midland, Texas, which is in the western part of
      Texas.


      Step 2: Determine where Oklahoma Baptist University is located in Oklahoma.

      Oklahoma Baptist University is located in Shawnee, Oklahoma, which is in the
      central part of Oklahoma.


      Step 3: Compare the relative east-west positions.

      Texas is generally located west and south of Oklahoma. When comparing two locations
      where one is in Texas and one is in Oklahoma, we need to be careful about their
      exact positions.


      However, Midland is in western Texas, which is definitely west of Oklahoma.
      Shawnee, Oklahoma is in the central part of Oklahoma, so it''s not near the
      western border with Texas.


      Therefore, Midland College in Texas is located west of Oklahoma Baptist University
      in Oklahoma.</think>I''ll think through this step by step:


      Step 1: Determine the locations of both colleges.

      - Midland College is located in Midland, Texas

      - Oklahoma Baptist University is located in Shawnee, Oklahoma


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and Oklahoma.

      - Oklahoma is directly north of Texas

      - Oklahoma''s western border is with the Texas panhandle


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Midland is in west Texas, approximately in the middle of the state from east
      to west

      - Shawnee is in central Oklahoma, east of Oklahoma City


      Step 4: Compare longitudes.

      - Midland, TX is much further west than Shawnee, OK

      - West Texas is generally west of all of Oklahoma


      Based on this analysis, Midland College in Texas is indeed located west of Oklahoma
      Baptist University in Oklahoma.

      in Kentucky is located west of State University of New York at Canton, NY, I
      need to compare the longitudes of these two locations.


      Facts I know:

      1. St. Catharine College is in Kentucky (KY), which is generally in the eastern
      part of the United States, but west of New York

      2. State University of New York at Canton is in New York (NY), which is in the
      northeastern United States


      Since Kentucky is west of New York, St. Catharine College in Kentucky should
      be west of State University of New York at Canton. Let me verify this based
      on U.S. geography:


      New York is on the East Coast of the United States, while Kentucky is more centrally
      located but still in the eastern half of the country. In terms of longitude,
      all of Kentucky is west of all of New York.


      Therefore, St. Catharine College in Kentucky would be west of State University
      of New York at Canton in New York.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both colleges.

      - St. Catharine College is in Kentucky (KY)

      - State University of New York at Canton is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Kentucky and New York states.

      - New York is located in the northeastern part of the United States

      - Kentucky is located in the east-central part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions (longitudes).

      - New York is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Kentucky is west of New York state

      - All locations in Kentucky are west of all locations in New York


      Step 4: Draw conclusion based on state positions.

      Since St. Catharine College is in Kentucky and SUNY Canton is in New York, and
      Kentucky is entirely west of New York, St. Catharine College must be west of
      SUNY Canton.

      OH, I need to consider their geographical positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these institutions are located.

      - Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue is in Nebraska (NE)

      - Ohio State University Lima Campus is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Nebraska is located in the central United States, while Ohio is in the eastern
      part of the Midwest region.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Nebraska is entirely west of Ohio. All
      locations in Nebraska are west of all locations in Ohio.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific locations.

      Since Bellevue, NE is in Nebraska, and Lima, OH is in Ohio, Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue
      must be west of Ohio State University Lima Campus.

      its name, it''s a university in the town of Indiana in the state of Pennsylvania,
      not in the state of Indiana.


      3. Lyndon State College (now Northern Vermont University-Lyndon) is located

      First, let me think about the relative positions of Pennsylvania and Vermont
      in the US:

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is in the northeastern part of the US

      - Vermont (VT) is also in the northeastern part of the US


      More specifically:

      - Pennsylvania is generally south and west of Vermont

      - Vermont is on the eastern edge of the US, bordering New Hampshire and Canada

      - Pennsylvania is west of New York, which is west of Vermont


      So based on the general geography of US states, Pennsylvania is west of Vermont.


      Now, for the specific colleges:

      - Indiana University of Pennsylvania is in Indiana, PA (in western Pennsylvania)

      - Lyndon State College (now Northern Vermont University-Lyndon) is in Lyndon,
      VT (in northeastern Vermont)

      border of the country.

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is also in the northeastern United States, but positioned
      southwest of Vermont.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Indiana University of Pennsylvania is located in Indiana, PA, in the western
      part of Pennsylvania.

      - Lyndon State College (now part of Northern Vermont University) is in Lyndon,
      VT, in the northeastern part of Vermont.


      Step 3: Compare their longitude.

      - All of Pennsylvania is geographically west of Vermont.

      - Even the easternmost parts of Pennsylvania are generally west of the westernmost
      parts of Vermont.

      - Indiana, PA being in western Pennsylvania puts it even further west of any
      location in Vermont.

      - Minnesota (MN) is in the upper Midwest, bordering Canada

      - Tennessee (TN) is in the southeastern US


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Minnesota is significantly west of Tennessee.

      Step 3: Compare their longitudes.

      - Minnesota is positioned further west in the continental United States

      - Tennessee is positioned further east


      Since Minnesota is west of Tennessee on the US map, and these colleges are in

      1. Shorter University in Georgia (GA)

      2. University of New Hampshire at Manchester in New Hampshire (NH)


      The key is to compare their longitudes. In the US, locations further west have
      higher longitude values (when using negative numbers, they have values closer
      to -0; when using degrees west, they have smaller values).


      First, let me recall where these states are located:

      - Georgia (GA) is in the southeastern United States

      - New Hampshire (NH) is in the northeastern United States, specifically in New
      England


      Generally speaking, New Hampshire is much further east than Georgia. But I should
      confirm the specific locations of these universities.


      Shorter University is in Rome, Georgia, which is in the northwestern part of
      Georgia.

      University of New Hampshire at Manchester is in Manchester, NH, which is in
      the southern part of New Hampshire.


      Even though Shorter University is in the northwestern part of Georgia, all of
      Georgia is still considerably west of New Hampshire. The entire state of New

      Let me think through this geographically:

      (NH)

      3) Georgia is a southeastern state, while New Hampshire is a northeastern state

      5) Georgia, while eastern, is significantly further west than New Hampshire

      6) Even the easternmost part of Georgia would be west of the westernmost part

      1) Miami University Middletown, OH - This is in Middletown, Ohio

      Now I need to determine if Middletown, Ohio is west of Connecticut.


      The United States generally has states arranged where the east coast includes
      states like Connecticut, and as you move west you reach states like Ohio.


      Ohio is definitely west of Connecticut on a map of the United States. Connecticut
      is on the eastern seaboard, while Ohio is in the Midwest region.


      Since Middletown, OH is in Ohio, and any point in Ohio would be west of any
      point in Connecticut, Miami University Middletown would be west of Southern
      Connecticut State University.</think>To answer this question, I need to consider
      the geographic locations of both universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Miami University Middletown is located in Middletown, Ohio

      - Southern Connecticut State University is located in Connecticut


      Step 2: Consider the geographic arrangement of these states within the US.

      - Connecticut is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      - States in the Midwest (like Ohio) are positioned west of East Coast states
      (like Connecticut)

      - Any location in Ohio would be west of any location in Connecticut


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since Middletown, Ohio is west of any location in Connecticut, Miami University
      Middletown would be west of Southern Connecticut State University


      YES'

      Let me think about the geographical positions of Texas and Michigan within the
      United States:


      Texas is located in the southern central part of the United States. It borders
      Mexico to the south and the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast.


      Michigan is located in the Great Lakes region of the upper Midwest. It consists

      to determine the relative locations of Samford University in Alabama and Haverford
      College in Pennsylvania.


      First, let me identify the general locations:

      - Samford University is in Alabama (AL), which is in the southeastern United
      States.

      - Haverford College is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is in the northeastern United
      States.


      Generally speaking, Alabama is west of Pennsylvania on a US map. Let me confirm
      by thinking about their approximate positions:


      Alabama is bordered by:

      - Tennessee to the north

      - Georgia to the east

      - Florida to the south

      - Mississippi to the west


      Pennsylvania is bordered by:

      - New York to the north

      - New Jersey to the east

      - Maryland to the south

      - Ohio to the west


      Based on these state positions, Alabama is definitely west of Pennsylvania.
      Since Samford University is in Alabama and Haverford College is in Pennsylvania,
      Samford University must be west of Haverford College.</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positioning of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each college is located.

      - Samford University is in Alabama (AL)

      - Haverford College is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes (east-west positioning).

      - Alabama is significantly west of Pennsylvania on the US map

      - All of Alabama is west of Pennsylvania''s western border


      Step 4: Since the colleges are located within their respective states, Samford
      University (in Alabama) must be west of Haverford College (in Pennsylvania).

      To solve this, I need to know the rough locations of these universities:


      1. Texas Tech University is in Lubbock, Texas

      2. Mount Mercy University is in Cedar Rapids, Iowa


      Now I need to determine which is further west. In the US, states generally become

      The United States generally follows a pattern where states further west have
      lower longitudes than states further east.


      Texas (TX) is located in the south-central part of the United States, while
      Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Texas is definitely west of Georgia

      - Texas is roughly in the middle of the country (slightly to the south and west)

      - Georgia is on the Atlantic coast in the southeast


      Since The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More is in Texas, and the University
      of Georgia College of Public Health is in Georgia, and Texas is west of Georgia,
      the answer would be YES - the Texas college is located west of the Georgia college.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions of
      these two institutions based on their locations in different states.

      - University of Georgia College of Public Health is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between Texas and Georgia.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - Looking at a map of the US, Texas is clearly west of Georgia


      Step 3: Since the colleges are in their respective states, their east-west relationship
      will follow the same pattern as their states.

      - Since Texas is west of Georgia, a college in Texas would be west of a college
      in Georgia


      YES, The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More (TX) is located west of

      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is located in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region

      - On a map of the US, Illinois is clearly west of Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Since these universities are in their respective states, their relative
      positions follow the same pattern.

      - Robert Morris University Illinois is in Illinois, which is west of Pennsylvania

      I need to determine which one is further west.


      Let me think about the general geographic locations of these states:

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region of the United States


      Looking at a mental map of the United States, Illinois is generally west of
      Pennsylvania. Illinois borders the Mississippi River on its western border,
      while Pennsylvania is much further east, bordering New Jersey and close to the
      Atlantic Ocean.

      3) Looking at the geographic positions of these states, Illinois is significantly
      west of Pennsylvania. Illinois borders the Mississippi River on its western
      edge, while Pennsylvania is much further east, closer to the Atlantic coast.


      4) Since Robert Morris University Illinois is in Illinois, and East Stroudsburg
      University is in Pennsylvania, the relative positions of the states determine
      the relative positions of these universities.


      5) Therefore, Robert Morris University Illinois must be west of East Stroudsburg

      - Robert Morris University Illinois is located in Chicago, Illinois

      - East Stroudsburg University is located in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Illinois and Pennsylvania.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is located in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Illinois is significantly west of Pennsylvania on the US map

      - Even though Chicago is in the northeastern part of Illinois, the entire state

      - When looking at a US map, Ohio is positioned to the west of Virginia.

      - All of Ohio is west of Virginia''s longitude.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the states'' positions.

      Otterbein University is located in Westerville, Ohio.

      Generally speaking:

      - Ohio is west of Virginia in the United States

      - States in the US tend to be arranged with western states having lower longitude

      Let me verify this by thinking about the general geography of these states:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region

      - Virginia is on the East Coast

      - The East Coast is east of the Midwest

      - The Midwest (Ohio) is located west of the East Coast (Virginia)

      - All of Ohio is geographically west of Virginia


      Step 4: Make the final determination based on these states'' positions.

      Since Otterbein University is in Ohio, and Stratford University is in Virginia,
      and Ohio is entirely west of Virginia, Otterbein University must be west of
