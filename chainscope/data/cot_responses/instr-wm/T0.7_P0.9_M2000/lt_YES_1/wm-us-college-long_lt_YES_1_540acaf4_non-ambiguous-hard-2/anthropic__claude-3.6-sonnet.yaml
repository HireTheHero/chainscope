    6f1d6a80-585b-4fd9-aca4-9d6e85b3ae75: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let me identify the locations:

      - University of Texas at Tyler is in Tyler, Texas

      - Altamaha Technical College is in Georgia


      2) To determine if one is west of the other, I need to compare their relative
      positions on a map:

      - Tyler, TX is in east Texas

      - Altamaha Technical College is in eastern Georgia


      3) Generally speaking:

      - Texas is significantly west of Georgia

      - Even eastern Texas is still west of Georgia


      4) Therefore, since Tyler, TX is west of any point in Georgia, University of
      Texas at Tyler must be west of Altamaha Technical College.

      - Central State University is in Wilberforce, Ohio

      - College of Charleston is in Charleston, South Carolina


      2. Looking at US geography:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region

      - South Carolina is on the East Coast


      3. Comparing longitudes:

      - Charleston, SC is right on the Atlantic coast

      - Wilberforce, OH is much further inland, towards the middle of the country

      - Any location in Ohio will be west of any location in South Carolina


      4. Therefore, Central State University in Ohio must be west of College of Charleston
      in South Carolina.

      1. Let me identify the locations of both universities:

      - Slippery Rock University is in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania

      - College of the Holy Cross is in Worcester, Massachusetts


      2. Consider their positions on a map:

      - Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts

      - Specifically, Slippery Rock, PA is in western Pennsylvania

      - Worcester, MA is in central Massachusetts


      3. Since Slippery Rock is in western PA, and PA is already west of MA, then
      Slippery Rock University must be west of Holy Cross.

      2) Let me consider their relative positions:

      - Kentucky is west of Virginia

      - Both schools are relatively close to their state borders, but this doesn''t
      change the general east-west relationship


      3) Since Kentucky is west of Virginia, and these schools are in their respective
      states, Kentucky Christian University must be west of Old Dominion University.

      - Lincoln College is in Lincoln, Illinois

      - Thomas Jefferson University is in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania


      2. To determine which is further west, I need to compare their locations:

      - Lincoln, IL is in central Illinois

      - Philadelphia, PA is on the east coast


      3. Since Illinois is significantly west of Pennsylvania in the United States,
      and Lincoln is in central Illinois while Philadelphia is on the eastern edge
      of Pennsylvania, Lincoln College must be west of Thomas Jefferson University.

      1) First, let me recall the locations:

      - Lee College is in Baytown, Texas

      - University of North Georgia is in Dahlonega, Georgia


      2) Looking at a US map:

      - Texas is west of Georgia

      - Specifically, Baytown, TX is west of Dahlonega, GA


      3) Therefore, since Lee College is in Baytown, TX and University of North Georgia
      is in Dahlonega, GA, Lee College must be west of University of North Georgia.

    793cb6a2-21d9-4dd0-b7ef-e61078fabcf0: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll identify the locations:

      - Reinhardt University is in Waleska, Georgia

      - Keuka College is in Keuka Park, New York


      2. Consider their relative positions:

      - Georgia is in the southeastern United States

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - When comparing east/west positions, Georgia is located to the west of New
      York


      3. Since these colleges are in their respective states:

      - Reinhardt University must be west of Keuka College, as Georgia is west of
      New York

      - Robert Morris University is in Moon Township, Pennsylvania


      2. Let me consider their relative positions:

      - Georgia is in the southeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern United States


      3. When comparing their positions on a map:

      - Georgia is west of Pennsylvania

      - Therefore, Clayton State (GA) is west of Robert Morris (PA)


      NO - Clayton State University is not west of Robert Morris University. It is
      EAST of it.


      I apologize - I made a mistake in my initial reasoning. While Georgia is indeed
      south of Pennsylvania, it is actually EAST of Pennsylvania''s longitude, not
      west. Looking at a map more carefully, Robert Morris University in western PA
      is further west than Clayton State University in Georgia.'

      1. First, let me identify the locations:

      - Faulkner University is in Montgomery, Alabama

      - Winston-Salem State University is in Winston-Salem, North Carolina


      2. To determine which is more west, I need to compare their locations:

      - Montgomery, AL is in the Deep South, closer to the Gulf Coast

      - Winston-Salem, NC is on the East Coast


      3. Looking at their relative positions:

      - Alabama is clearly west of North Carolina

      - Montgomery, AL is west of Winston-Salem, NC

      - Therefore, Faulkner University is west of Winston-Salem State University

      - Faulkner University is in Montgomery, Alabama

      - Winston-Salem State University is in Winston-Salem, North Carolina


      2) Now, let me consider their relative positions:

      - Montgomery, AL is roughly in the middle of Alabama

      - Winston-Salem, NC is in the north-central part of North Carolina

      - Alabama is west of North Carolina on a US map

    b58e59a1-68c1-432d-949c-b9fc74dd93d1: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let''s identify the locations:

      - Dominican University is in River Forest, Illinois

      - University of Maryland, Baltimore County is in Baltimore, Maryland


      2) Let''s compare their approximate locations:

      - River Forest, IL is near Chicago, in the Midwest

      - Baltimore, MD is on the East Coast


      3) When comparing east-west positions:

      - Illinois is significantly west of Maryland

      - Therefore, River Forest, IL is west of Baltimore, MD


      4) Since Dominican University is in River Forest, IL and UMBC is in Baltimore,
      MD, Dominican University must be west of UMBC.
