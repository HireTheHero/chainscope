      the relative east-west positions of California College of the Arts (CCA) in
      California and Eastern Washington University (EWU) in Washington.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - California College of the Arts is located in California (specifically in San
      Francisco and Oakland).

      - Eastern Washington University is located in Washington state (specifically
      in Cheney, near Spokane).


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states and cities.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States.

      - Washington state is also on the west coast, but north of California.

      - Within these states, San Francisco/Oakland are on the western side of California.

      - Cheney/Spokane are on the eastern side of Washington state (hence the name
      "Eastern" Washington University).


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions.

      - Despite Washington being north of California, the eastern part of Washington
      state (where EWU is located) extends much further east than most of California.

      - San Francisco and Oakland are very close to the Pacific coast, making CCA
      quite far west.

      - Cheney is near the Idaho border in the eastern part of Washington state.


      Therefore, California College of the Arts is located west of Eastern Washington
      University.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both universities.

      - California South Bay University is in California, specifically in the South
      Bay area (likely near San Francisco or Silicon Valley).

      - Montana State University is in Montana, specifically in Bozeman, Montana.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of California and Montana within the
      United States.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States.

      - Montana is an inland state, east of California.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Any location in California will be west of any location in Montana when looking
      at a map of the United States.

      - The entire state of California is west of the entire state of Montana.


      Step 4: Therefore, California South Bay University (in California) must be west
      of Montana State University (in Montana).

      - California State University, East Bay (CSU East Bay) is located in Hayward,
      California, in the eastern part of the San Francisco Bay Area.

      - Rancho Santiago Community College District is located in Santa Ana, California,
      in Orange County (Southern California).


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a west-east axis.

      - CSU East Bay is in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is in Northern California.

      - Rancho Santiago Community College District is in Orange County, which is in
      Southern California.

      - On a California map, the San Francisco Bay Area is located to the northwest
      of Orange County.


      Step 3: Consider specifically the west-east positioning.

      - While the Bay Area is northwest of Orange County, I need to determine if CSU
      East Bay is specifically west of Rancho Santiago.

      - Hayward (where CSU East Bay is located) is near the Pacific coast in the Bay
      Area.

      - Santa Ana (where Rancho Santiago is located) is also relatively close to the
      Pacific coast in Southern California.

      - Looking at their longitudinal positions, Hayward is indeed west of Santa Ana.

      - Rancho Santiago Community College District is located in Santa Ana, California,
      in Orange County, which is in Southern California.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a west-east axis.

      - CSU East Bay is in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is in Northern California
      along the Pacific coast.

      - Rancho Santiago Community College District is in Orange County, which is also
      along the Pacific coast but in Southern California.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Locations in the San Francisco Bay Area are generally west of locations in
      Orange County when looking at a map of California.

      - This is because the California coastline curves, with Northern California
      extending further west than Southern California.

      - CSU East Bay is in Northern California (Bay Area).

      - Rancho Santiago Community College District is in Southern California (Orange
      County).


      Step 3: Compare east-west positioning.

      - On a California map, the Bay Area is located to the northwest of Orange County.

      - While "East Bay" is in the name of CSU East Bay (referring to it being on
      the eastern side of the San Francisco Bay), the entire Bay Area is still west
      of Orange County when looking at the overall California map.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - California runs northwest to southeast, so Northern California locations are
      generally west of Southern California locations.

      - CSU East Bay is approximately 400 miles northwest of Rancho Santiago Community
      College District.

      4) Geographically, the San Francisco Bay Area is in Northern California, while
      Orange County is in Southern California.


      5) When considering east-west positioning in California, locations in the Bay
      Area are generally west of locations in Orange County, since the California
      coastline curves eastward as it extends southward.


      6) Therefore, CSU East Bay (in Hayward) is located west of Rancho Santiago Community
      College District (in Santa Ana).


      YES, California State University, East Bay is located west of Rancho Santiago

      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - While CSU East Bay has "East" in its name (referring to the eastern part of
      the Bay Area), it is still located in a part of California that is geographically
      west of Orange County where Rancho Santiago Community College District is located.


      NO.

      3) To determine which is more westerly, I need to consider the relative geographical
      positions of Kentucky and Virginia.

      4) Kentucky is located to the west of Virginia in the United States.

      5) Kentucky borders Virginia''s western side (along with West Virginia in between
      parts of them).

      6) Since Kentucky is west of Virginia, any location in Kentucky would be west
      of any location in Virginia.

      - Stratford University is located in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative east-west positioning of Ohio and Virginia.

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Virginia is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Looking at a US map, Ohio is west of Virginia


      Step 3: Since Otterbein University is in Ohio, and Stratford University is in
      Virginia, and Ohio is west of Virginia, Otterbein University must be west of
      Stratford University.


      NO.


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me correct this:


      If Ohio is west of Virginia, and Otterbein is in Ohio while Stratford is in
      Virginia, then Otterbein University would be west of Stratford University, not
      east of it.


      YES.'
