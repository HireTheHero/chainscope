      geographical locations of Kentucky Christian University (KY) and Old Dominion
      University (VA).

      2. **Determine Longitude:**  Longitude is the key factor for determining East
      vs. West.  A location further West has a *higher* longitude value (in terms
      of degrees West).

      3. **Compare Longitudes:** Once we have the longitude for each university, we
      compare them.


      Kentucky Christian University is in Grayson, KY.  Old Dominion University is
      in Norfolk, VA.


      A quick search shows Grayson, KY is at approximately -82.9 degrees longitude,
      and Norfolk, VA is at approximately -76.3 degrees longitude.


      Since -82.9 is greater than -76.3 (remember we are dealing with negative numbers
      here), Kentucky Christian University is *west* of Old Dominion University.

      3. **West of?:**  The question asks if St. Andrews is *west* of Oneonta.


      4. **East Coast Geography:** Generally, moving west means moving inland from

      is south of New York, St. Andrews would be generally southwest of Oneonta, not
      directly west. However, the question simply asks "west", meaning is its longitude
      less than Oneonta''s.

      NC is at approximately -79.8 degrees longitude. Oneonta, NY is at approximately

      3. **Indiana vs. Ohio:** Indiana is generally west of Ohio.

      4. **Specific Locations:** While Indiana is generally west of Ohio, we need
      to consider the specific locations of the two institutions.  Indiana University
      Northwest is in the far northwest corner of Indiana, close to the Illinois border
      and Lake Michigan.  It''s possible that Premier Flight Academy is in eastern
      Ohio, making it further east.

      5. **West means further west in terms of longitude:**  We''re looking to see
      if Indiana University Northwest is at a longitude further west (a smaller longitude
      number) than Premier Flight Academy.


      Since Indiana is generally west of Ohio, and IU Northwest is in the *northwest*
      corner of Indiana, it is highly likely to be west of a flight academy in Ohio.  However,
      without the precise coordinates of the flight academy, complete certainty is
