      University, OK is located west of Midland University, NE, we need to consider
      the geographical locations of both institutions.


      1. First, we identify the locations: Oklahoma Panhandle State University is
      in Oklahoma (OK), and Midland University is in Nebraska (NE).

      2. Next, we consider the general geography of the United States. Oklahoma is
      located in the southern part of the central United States, while Nebraska is
      in the northern part of the central United States.

      3. Given this information, Oklahoma (where Oklahoma Panhandle State University
      is located) is south of Nebraska (where Midland University is located). However,
      we need to consider the specific locations of these institutions within their
      respective states.


      4. Oklahoma Panhandle State University is located in Goodwell, Oklahoma, which
      is in the western part of Oklahoma, close to the border with Texas. Midland
      University is located in Fremont, Nebraska, which is in the eastern part of
      Nebraska, close to the border with Iowa.

      5. Considering the specific locations within their states, Oklahoma Panhandle
      State University is further west than Midland University. Therefore, Oklahoma
      Panhandle State University, OK is located west of Midland University, NE.


      In summary, the answer to whether Oklahoma Panhandle State University, OK is
      located west of Midland University, NE is: **YES**'

      Wayne, IN is located west of Darul Uloom Al-Madania, NY, we need to consider
      the geographical locations of both institutions.


      1. First, let''s identify the locations: Indiana University Fort Wayne is located
      in Fort Wayne, Indiana (IN), and Darul Uloom Al-Madania is located in Buffalo,
      New York (NY).

      2. Next, we need to consider the general geography of the United States. Indiana
      is located in the Midwest, while New York is located in the Northeast.

      3. Given this information, Indiana (where Indiana University Fort Wayne is located)
      is west of New York (where Darul Uloom Al-Madania is located).


      Therefore, the answer is: YES
