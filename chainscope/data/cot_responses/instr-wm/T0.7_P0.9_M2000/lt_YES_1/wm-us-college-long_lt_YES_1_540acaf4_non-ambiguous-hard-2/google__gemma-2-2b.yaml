    659ed910-89f9-4bda-8da2-23a8ed282519: 'First, we need to understand the concept
      of "west" in this context. West is a direction that is opposite to the east.
      So, if we assume that the origin of the question is located in the west, we
      can proceed with the question.

      Let''s take the origin to be in Cornerstone University, MI. We need to find
      the distance from this origin to Clarkson University, NY.

      Distance = Speed * Time

      Time = Distance / Speed

      So, we need to find the distance between Cornerstone University and Clarkson
      University.

      From the given context, we can assume that the distance is 1,000 miles.

      Speed = Distance / Time

      Speed = 1,000 miles / Time

      Now, we need to find the time it takes to travel 1,000 miles at a speed of 50
      miles per hour.

      Time = Distance / Speed

      Time = 1,000 miles / 50 miles per hour

      Time = 20 hours

      So, the time it takes to travel 1,000 miles at a speed of 50 miles per hour
      is 20 hours.

      Now, we can calculate the distance between Cornerstone University and Clarkson
      University.

      Distance = Speed * Time

      Distance = 50 miles per hour * 20 hours

      Distance = 1,000 miles

      carefully to understand the question. The passage provides information about
      the location of Otterbein University, OH, which is west of the University of
      Virginia. However, there is no mention of Stratford University, VA in the context,
