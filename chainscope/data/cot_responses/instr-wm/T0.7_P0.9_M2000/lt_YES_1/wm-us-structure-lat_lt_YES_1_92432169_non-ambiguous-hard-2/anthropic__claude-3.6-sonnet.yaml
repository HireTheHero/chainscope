      1. First, let me identify the locations:

      - Lake Lawtonka is in Oklahoma (OK)

      - Patoka Lake is in Indiana (IN)


      2. Let me consider their states'' relative positions:

      - Oklahoma is in the south-central United States

      - Indiana is in the north-central United States


      3. Comparing their latitudes:

      - Oklahoma is significantly south of Indiana

      - Therefore, any lake in Oklahoma would generally be south of any lake in Indiana


      4. Since Lake Lawtonka is in Oklahoma, and Patoka Lake is in Indiana, Lake Lawtonka
      must be south of Patoka Lake.


      Answer: YES'

      1. First, let me locate Lake Lawtonka, OK

      - Lake Lawtonka is in Oklahoma

      - It''s located in Comanche County, in southwestern Oklahoma


      2. Next, let me locate Patoka Lake, IN

      - Patoka Lake is in Indiana

      - It''s located in southern Indiana


      3. Now, let me compare their latitudes

      - Oklahoma is generally south of Indiana

      - Lake Lawtonka, being in southwestern Oklahoma, is definitely south of any
      point in Indiana

      - Therefore, Lake Lawtonka must be south of Patoka Lake

      2) Let''s consider their relative positions:

      - Seattle, WA is in the northwest corner of the continental US

      - Southern Idaho is below (south of) Washington state


      3) Therefore, since Minidoka Dam is in a state that is south of Washington state,
      and Seattle is in northern Washington, Minidoka Dam must be south of St. Mark''s
      Cathedral.

      1) First, let''s identify the states:

      - Anderson Ranch Dam is in Idaho (ID)

      - Star Lite Motel is in Minnesota (MN)


      2) Let''s consider the geographic position of these states:

      - Idaho is in the northwestern United States

      - Minnesota is in the northern United States, but further east than Idaho


      3) When comparing north-south positions:

      - Idaho and Minnesota are actually at similar latitudes

      - Both states are in the northern part of the US

      - However, Minnesota is slightly further north than Idaho


      4) Therefore, since Anderson Ranch Dam is in Idaho (more south) and Star Lite
      Motel is in Minnesota (more north), Anderson Ranch Dam would be SOUTH of Star
      Lite Motel.

      - It''s one of the northernmost states in the eastern US


      4) When comparing north-south positions:

      - Missouri is significantly south of New York

      - Therefore, any location in Missouri will be south of any location in New York


      5) Since Smithville Lake is in Missouri and Rondout Reservoir is in New York,
      Smithville Lake must be south of Rondout Reservoir.
