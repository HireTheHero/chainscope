      1) I need to determine the locations of High Rock Lake, NC and St. Anne''s Church

      4) Given the general geography of US states, North Carolina is south of Maryland,
      so High Rock Lake in NC would be south of St. Anne''s Church in Annapolis, MD.


      This is a fairly straightforward geographic question. Since North Carolina is

      North Carolina (NC) is located on the East Coast of the United States, and Maryland
      (MD) is also on the East Coast but further north.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      High Rock Lake is in North Carolina, primarily in Davidson and Rowan counties.

      St. Anne''s Church is in Annapolis, which is the capital city of Maryland.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Maryland is entirely north of North Carolina on a map. Annapolis, MD is well
      north of the North Carolina state line, and High Rock Lake is not at the extreme
      northern edge of North Carolina.


      Since Maryland is geographically north of North Carolina, and these specific

      First, let me identify where these lakes are located:

      1. Council Grove Lake is in Kansas (KS)

      2. Saylorville Lake is in Iowa (IA)


      To determine if one is south of the other, I need to consider their geographical

      - Kansas is south of Iowa in the United States

      - Iowa is north of Kansas


      Since Council Grove Lake is in Kansas, and Saylorville Lake is in Iowa, and

      - Iowa borders the northern part of the United States (near Minnesota)

      Step 2: Now I need to determine the relative positions of these states.

      - Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Kansas is also in the Midwest, but is positioned south of Iowa

      - Iowa borders Minnesota to the north and Missouri to the south

      - Kansas is south of Nebraska, which is south of Iowa

      1. Lake Wappapello, MO - This is a lake in Missouri (MO)

      2. Nichols Hall, KS - This is a building in Kansas (KS)


      Let''s think about the geography of the United States:

      - Kansas is a state in the central part of the US

      - Missouri is a state that borders Kansas to the east


      Now, for the north-south relationship, I need to consider the relative positions:

      - Kansas is generally north of Missouri, though they share a border with Kansas
      to the north and west of Missouri

      - Within these states, I need to know the specific locations


      Lake Wappapello is in southeastern Missouri, near the border with Arkansas.

      Nichols Hall is likely on a university campus in Kansas, possibly Kansas State
      University.

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Lake Wappapello is a reservoir located in southeastern Missouri

      - Nichols Hall is likely on a campus in Kansas (possibly at Kansas State University)


      ## Step 2: Consider the states'' positions

      - Kansas is located directly west of Missouri

      - Generally, Kansas and Missouri are at similar latitudes, though Missouri extends
      further south than Kansas


      ## Step 3: Specific locations within states

      - Lake Wappapello is in the southeastern part of Missouri, close to the Missouri-Arkansas
      border

      - Nichols Hall in Kansas would be further north, as Kansas doesn''t extend as
      far south as southeastern Missouri


      ## Step 4: Compare latitudes

      - Southeastern Missouri (where Lake Wappapello is) is at a lower latitude than
      any point in Kansas

      - Therefore, Lake Wappapello would be south of any location in Kansas, including
      Nichols Hall

      1) The question is asking if Lensic Theater in New Mexico is located south of
      the Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon in North Jackson, Ohio.


      2) I need to think about the geographical locations of these two places.


      3) New Mexico is a state in the southwestern United States.


      4) Ohio is a state in the midwestern United States.


      5) When comparing north-south positions in the US, we can look at their latitudes.
      Places with lower latitudes are further south.


      6) Generally speaking, New Mexico is south of Ohio on a map of the United States.
      Ohio is in the northern part of the country, while New Mexico is much further
      south.


      7) While I don''t know the exact coordinates of these specific buildings, I

      - Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon is in North Jackson, Ohio
      (OH)


      Step 2: Compare the geographical positions of these states.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New Mexico is located in the Southwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Analyze their north-south positioning.

      - Ohio is significantly further north in the United States compared to New Mexico

      - New Mexico sits at a lower latitude than Ohio


      Step 4: Make a conclusion about the specific landmarks.

      While I don''t have the exact coordinates of these specific buildings, their
      state locations determine their general north-south relationship. Any location
      in New Mexico would be south of locations in Ohio.

      Thousand Islands region


      So yes, Allegheny Reservoir in Pennsylvania should be south of Boldt Castle
      in New York.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions of
      these two landmarks.


      Step 1: Locate Boldt Castle, NY

      Boldt Castle is located on Heart Island in the Thousand Islands region of the
      St. Lawrence River in northern New York state, very close to the US-Canada border.
      This puts it in the northernmost part of New York.


      Step 2: Locate Allegheny Reservoir, PA

      Allegheny Reservoir (also called Kinzua Reservoir) is located in northwestern
      Pennsylvania, near the Pennsylvania-New York border, within the Allegheny National
      Forest.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes

      Northern New York state (especially the Thousand Islands region where Boldt
      Castle is located) is significantly further north than northwestern Pennsylvania
      where the Allegheny Reservoir is situated. Pennsylvania in general lies south
      of New York state, and even though the Allegheny Reservoir is in the northern
      part of Pennsylvania, it''s still south of the St. Lawrence River region.


      YES'
    86a65877-1c8c-4dc2-bf42-28bef01d8cfd: '<think>I need to find the locations of
      Allegheny Reservoir, PA and Boldt Castle, NY and determine their relative positions
      (north/south).


      First, let me think about where Allegheny Reservoir is in Pennsylvania. The
      Allegheny Reservoir (also known as Kinzua Dam) is located in northwestern Pennsylvania,
      along the New York-Pennsylvania border.


      Next, Boldt Castle is in New York. Specifically, it''s located on Heart Island
      in the St. Lawrence River, which is in the Thousand Islands region of northern
      New York, near the US-Canada border.


      Looking at the geography:

      - Boldt Castle is in the very northern part of New York state, near the Canadian
      border and the St. Lawrence River

      - Allegheny Reservoir is in northwestern Pennsylvania, south of the NY-PA border


      Pennsylvania is generally south of New York state. Since Boldt Castle is in
      the northern part of New York (near Canada), and the Allegheny Reservoir is
      in Pennsylvania (which is south of New York), the Allegheny Reservoir must be
      south of Boldt Castle.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions
      of these two locations.


      Step 1: Locate Boldt Castle, NY

      Boldt Castle is located on Heart Island in the Thousand Islands region of the
      St. Lawrence River in northern New York state, very close to the US-Canada border.
      This puts it in the far northern part of New York state.


      Step 2: Locate Allegheny Reservoir, PA

      The Allegheny Reservoir (also called Kinzua Lake) is located in northwestern
      Pennsylvania, extending slightly into southwestern New York. It was created
      by the Kinzua Dam on the Allegheny River.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes

      Northern New York (where Boldt Castle is) is significantly north of northwestern
      Pennsylvania (where Allegheny Reservoir is). Pennsylvania is generally south
      of New York state, and the Allegheny Reservoir is well south of the northern
      NY border where Boldt Castle is situated.


      YES, Allegheny Reservoir, PA is located south of Boldt Castle, NY.'

      to determine the relative locations of Allegheny Reservoir, PA and Boldt Castle,
      NY.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Allegheny Reservoir is located.

      The Allegheny Reservoir (also known as Kinzua Dam) is located in northwestern
      Pennsylvania, on the border with New York State.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Boldt Castle is located.

      Boldt Castle is located on Heart Island in the Saint Lawrence River, in northern
      New York State, close to the Canadian border.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Northern New York State (where Boldt Castle is) is further north than northwestern
      Pennsylvania (where Allegheny Reservoir is).


      So Allegheny Reservoir is south of Boldt Castle.</think># Is Allegheny Reservoir,
      PA located south of Boldt Castle, NY?


      I''ll determine this by finding the locations of both and comparing their positions:


      1. **Boldt Castle location**: Boldt Castle is on Heart Island in the Thousand
      Islands region of the St. Lawrence River in northern New York, very close to
      the Canadian border.


      2. **Allegheny Reservoir location**: The Allegheny Reservoir (also called Kinzua
      Reservoir) is located in northwestern Pennsylvania, extending slightly into
      southwestern New York.


      3. **Directional comparison**: Northern New York (where Boldt Castle is) is
      significantly further north than northwestern Pennsylvania (where most of the
      Allegheny Reservoir is located).


      Therefore, YES, Allegheny Reservoir, PA is located south of Boldt Castle, NY.'

      Let me recall the geographic locations:


      Allegheny Reservoir (also called Kinzua Dam) is located in northwestern Pennsylvania,
      near the New York border.


      Boldt Castle is located on Heart Island in the Thousand Islands region of the
      St. Lawrence River in northern New York state, near the US-Canada border.


      Looking at the general geography of these states:

      - New York is north of Pennsylvania

      - The Thousand Islands region is in the far northern part of New York

      - The Allegheny Reservoir is in the northern part of Pennsylvania


      Since Boldt Castle is in northern New York, and the Allegheny Reservoir is in
      northern Pennsylvania, and New York is generally north of Pennsylvania, Boldt
      Castle would be north of the Allegheny Reservoir.


      Therefore, the Allegheny Reservoir would be south of Boldt Castle.</think>I
      need to determine the relative positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify where Boldt Castle is located.

      Boldt Castle is located on Heart Island in the Thousand Islands region of the
      St. Lawrence River in northern New York state, near the US-Canada border. This
      places it in the far northern part of New York.


      Step 2: Identify where Allegheny Reservoir is located.

      Allegheny Reservoir (also called Kinzua Reservoir) is located in northwestern
      Pennsylvania, straddling the PA-NY border but primarily in Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      New York state is generally north of Pennsylvania. The Thousand Islands region
      where Boldt Castle is located is in the northernmost part of New York, while
      the Allegheny Reservoir is in the northern part of Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Make the conclusion.

      Since Boldt Castle is in northern New York (near the Canadian border) and Allegheny
      Reservoir is in northern Pennsylvania, the reservoir must be south of the castle.


      YES, Allegheny Reservoir, PA is located south of Boldt Castle, NY.'
    91c6c7f0-e279-4a34-ad50-9fea53f028dc: '<think>To determine whether Allegheny Reservoir,

      1. Allegheny Reservoir: This is a reservoir located in Pennsylvania (PA), formed
      by the Kinzua Dam on the Allegheny River. It extends into New York state as
      well, but is primarily in northwestern Pennsylvania.


      2. Boldt Castle: This is a landmark located in the Thousand Islands region of
      New York (NY), specifically on Heart Island in the St. Lawrence River.


      Now I need to compare their north-south positions:


      - Boldt Castle is in the Thousand Islands region in northern New York state,
      near the US-Canada border along the St. Lawrence River.

      - Allegheny Reservoir is in northwestern Pennsylvania, which is generally south
      of northern New York.


      Since New York is north of Pennsylvania, and Boldt Castle is in northern NY
      while Allegheny Reservoir is in northwestern PA, Allegheny Reservoir would be
      south of Boldt Castle.</think># Is Allegheny Reservoir, PA located south of

      Looking at their positions on a map:

      - Boldt Castle is in far northern New York near the Canadian border

      - Allegheny Reservoir is primarily in northwestern Pennsylvania


      Since Pennsylvania is generally south of New York state, and especially since
      northern NY (where Boldt Castle is) is significantly north of the PA border
      where Allegheny Reservoir is located, the reservoir is definitely south of the
      castle.

      1. Allegheny Reservoir, PA (in Pennsylvania)

      2. Boldt Castle, NY (in New York)


      I need to determine if Allegheny Reservoir is located south of Boldt Castle.


      Let me think about the general geography of Pennsylvania and New York:

      - New York is north of Pennsylvania, as Pennsylvania borders New York along
      its northern border

      - However, the specific locations within these states matter


      Boldt Castle is located in the Thousand Islands region of New York, on Heart
      Island in the St. Lawrence River near Alexandria Bay. This is in the far northern
      part of New York, close to the border with Canada.


      The Allegheny Reservoir (also called Kinzua Dam) is in northwestern Pennsylvania,
      along the Allegheny River near the New York border.


      Given that Boldt Castle is in far northern NY near Canada, and the Allegheny
      Reservoir is in northwestern PA near the NY-PA border, the Allegheny Reservoir
      would definitely be south of Boldt Castle.</think># Is Allegheny Reservoir,
      PA located south of Boldt Castle, NY?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two landmarks.


      ## Step 1: Locate Boldt Castle, NY

      Boldt Castle is located in the Thousand Islands region of New York State, on
      Heart Island in the St. Lawrence River near Alexandria Bay. This is in the far
      northern part of New York, very close to the Canadian border.


      ## Step 2: Locate Allegheny Reservoir, PA

      The Allegheny Reservoir (also known as Kinzua Lake) straddles the border between
      northwestern Pennsylvania and southwestern New York. It was created by the Kinzua
      Dam on the Allegheny River.


      ## Step 3: Compare the locations

      New York is generally north of Pennsylvania. Even though both landmarks are
      relatively close to the NY-PA border, Boldt Castle is in the northernmost part
      of New York near Canada, while the Allegheny Reservoir is along the southern
      NY/northern PA border.


      Therefore, YES, the Allegheny Reservoir in Pennsylvania is located south of
      Boldt Castle in New York.'

      First, let me identify where Boldt Castle is in New York:

      - Boldt Castle is located on Heart Island in the Saint Lawrence River in the
      Thousand Islands region of northern New York State, near Alexandria Bay.

      - This places it in the very northern part of New York State, near the US-Canada
      border.


      Next, let me identify where Allegheny Reservoir is in Pennsylvania:

      - Allegheny Reservoir (also called Kinzua Dam) is located in northwestern Pennsylvania,
      along the Allegheny River.

      - It spans across the Pennsylvania-New York border, with parts in both states.


      Now to compare:

      - Northern New York (where Boldt Castle is) is definitely further north than
      northwestern Pennsylvania (where Allegheny Reservoir is).

      - The Thousand Islands region is right along the US-Canada border, making it
      one of the northernmost points in New York.

      - While Allegheny Reservoir is in northern Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania as a whole
      is south of New York.


      Since Allegheny Reservoir is in northwestern Pennsylvania (and partially in
      southwestern New York), and Boldt Castle is in far northern New York, I can
      conclude that Allegheny Reservoir is south of Boldt Castle.</think># Analysis

      - NC stands for North Carolina, which is a state on the eastern coast of the
      United States

      - NY stands for New York, and Manhattan is a borough of New York City in the
      state of New York


      Now, I need to think about their relative positions on a north-south axis:


      North Carolina is a state that is south of New York on the US east coast. The
      general ordering of these east coast states from north to south is:

      - New York

      - New Jersey

      - Delaware

      - Maryland

      - Virginia

      - North Carolina

      - South Carolina

      - etc.


      Since North Carolina is south of New York, any location in North Carolina (including
      Ovens Auditorium) would be south of any location in New York (including St.
      Teresa Church in Manhattan).</think>I need to determine the relative north-south
      positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Ovens Auditorium is in North Carolina (NC)

      - St. Teresa Church is in Manhattan, New York (NY)


      Step 2: Compare the geographical positions of the states.

      North Carolina is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, significantly
      south of New York State.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      Manhattan is in New York City, in the southern part of New York State. However,
      even the southernmost point of New York State is still north of the northernmost
      point of North Carolina.


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      Since North Carolina is entirely south of New York State, Ovens Auditorium in
      NC must be south of St. Teresa Church in Manhattan, NY.

      2. St. Teresa Church is in Manhattan, New York (NY)


      In the United States, geography generally works as follows:

      - New York is in the Northeast of the country

      - North Carolina is in the Southeast of the country


      When comparing north/south positions:

      - New York is further north than North Carolina

      - Manhattan is in the southern part of New York state, but still north of North
      Carolina


      Therefore, if Ovens Auditorium is in North Carolina, and St. Teresa Church is
      in Manhattan, New York, then Ovens Auditorium would be south of St. Teresa Church.</think>I

      First, let''s think about the general geography of the United States:

      - North Carolina (NC) is a state in the southeastern United States

      - New York (NY) is a state in the northeastern United States

      - Generally speaking, New York is north of North Carolina

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - Chicago Avenue Pumping Station is in Chicago, Illinois

      - Kewaunee Power Station is in Wisconsin


      Now I need to determine their north-south relationship. Looking at a mental

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Illinois and Wisconsin.

      - Wisconsin is directly north of Illinois

      - Both states border Lake Michigan, with Wisconsin above Illinois


      Step 3: Looking more specifically at these locations:

      - Chicago is located at the southern end of Lake Michigan in northeastern Illinois

      - Kewaunee is located on the western shore of Lake Michigan in eastern Wisconsin


      Step 4: Compare their positions on a north-south axis.

      - Any location in Chicago would be south of any location in Wisconsin in this

      is directly north of Illinois in the Midwest United States.


      For the specific locations:

      - Chicago Avenue Pumping Station is likely in Chicago, IL (given the name)

      - Kewaunee Power Station is in Kewaunee, WI


      Since Wisconsin is north of Illinois, and these structures are in their respective

      - Kewaunee Power Station is in Kewaunee, Wisconsin, located on the western shore
      of Lake Michigan in the eastern part of Wisconsin.


      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      Since Wisconsin is entirely north of Illinois, and Kewaunee is in Wisconsin
      while Chicago is in Illinois, the Chicago Avenue Pumping Station must be south
      of the Kewaunee Power Station.

      First, let me identify their approximate locations:


      1. Minidoka Dam, ID: This is a dam in Idaho, which is a state in the northwestern
      United States. Idaho is generally south of Washington state.


      2. St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral, Seattle, WA: This is in Seattle, which is
      in Washington state, in the northwestern United States, near the Canadian border.


      Generally speaking, Washington state is north of Idaho. Seattle is in the northern
      part of Washington. So it''s very likely that St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral
      in Seattle is north of Minidoka Dam in Idaho.


      If something is south of something else, it means it has a lower latitude. So
      I need to determine if Minidoka Dam has a lower latitude (is further south)
      than St. Mark''s Cathedral.


      Given the geographical positions of Washington state and Idaho, with Washington
      being north of Idaho, it''s highly likely that Minidoka Dam is south of St.
      Mark''s Cathedral. But let me confirm the general locations to be certain.


      Yes, Minidoka Dam in Idaho would be south of Seattle, Washington. So Minidoka
      Dam is located south of St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral.</think>To answer this
      question, I need to determine the relative geographical positions of these two
      locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' positions.

      Washington state is located in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada
      to the north. Idaho is located directly east of Washington state, but also extends
      further south.


      Step 2: Locate the specific sites.

      - St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral is in Seattle, which is in the northern part
      of Washington state.

      - Minidoka Dam is in Idaho, which is generally southeast of Washington state.


      Step 3: Compare latitudes.

      Seattle, WA is located much further north in the United States compared to most
      of Idaho. Minidoka Dam is situated in south-central Idaho, meaning it has a
      lower latitude than Seattle.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      Since Minidoka Dam is at a lower latitude than Seattle, it is positioned further
      south geographically.


      YES, Minidoka Dam, ID is located south of St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral, Seattle,
      WA.'

      - Washington state is in the Pacific Northwest, bordering Canada

      - Idaho is south of Washington state

      - Seattle is in the northern part of Washington state

      - Minidoka Dam would be somewhere in Idaho


      So geographically, Washington state is north of Idaho state. Since Seattle is

      AFI Silver appears to be the AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center, which is
      located in Silver Spring, Maryland (MD).


      2) Now I need to determine their relative positions on a north-south axis.


      Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States.

      Maryland is located in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States.


      Looking at a US map, Tennessee is positioned south of Maryland. Maryland is
      further north compared to Tennessee.

      Since Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee, and Tennessee
      is south of Maryland (where AFI Silver is located), the Arnold Engineering Development
      Complex is south of AFI Silver.

      FirstBank Southwest Tower is in TX (Texas), and St. Nicholas of Tolentine Church
      is in the Bronx, NY (New York).


      The question is asking if the FirstBank Southwest Tower is located south of
      the church.


      First, let''s think about the general geographic positions of Texas and New
      York:

      - Texas is in the southern part of the United States

      - New York is in the northeastern part of the United States

      - Texas is generally south of New York


      So if FirstBank Southwest Tower is in Texas, and St. Nicholas of Tolentine Church
      is in New York (specifically the Bronx), then the tower would be south of the
      church.


      Therefore, FirstBank Southwest Tower, TX is located south of St. Nicholas of
      Tolentine Church (Bronx), NY.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both structures.

      - FirstBank Southwest Tower is in Texas (TX)

      - St. Nicholas of Tolentine Church is in the Bronx, New York (NY)


      Step 2: I need to determine their relative north-south positions.

      - Texas is located in the southern United States

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Any location in Texas is geographically south of any location in New York


      Step 3: Since FirstBank Southwest Tower is in Texas, and St. Nicholas of Tolentine
      Church is in New York, the tower must be south of the church.


      YES - FirstBank Southwest Tower, TX is located south of St. Nicholas of Tolentine
      Church (Bronx), NY.'

      The FirstBank Southwest Tower is in Texas (TX). Texas is in the southern United
      States.


      St. Nicholas of Tolentine Church is in the Bronx, which is in New York (NY).
      New York is in the northern United States.


      In the United States, Texas is definitely south of New York. Any location in
      Texas would be south of any location in New York in terms of latitude.


      Therefore, FirstBank Southwest Tower in Texas is located south of St. Nicholas
      of Tolentine Church in the Bronx, New York.</think>I need to determine whether
      FirstBank Southwest Tower in Texas is south of St. Nicholas of Tolentine Church
      in the Bronx, New York.


      Let me analyze this step by step:


      1) FirstBank Southwest Tower is in Texas (TX), which is in the southern part
      of the United States.


      2) St. Nicholas of Tolentine Church is in the Bronx, which is in New York state
      (NY), located in the northeastern United States.


      3) Geographically, Texas is significantly south of New York. Even the northernmost
      parts of Texas are south of the southernmost parts of New York state.


      4) Therefore, any building in Texas (including FirstBank Southwest Tower) would
      be south of any building in New York (including St. Nicholas of Tolentine Church
      in the Bronx).


      YES, FirstBank Southwest Tower in Texas is located south of St. Nicholas of
      Tolentine Church in the Bronx, New York.'

      Step-by-Step Analysis


      To determine if Nashville Municipal Auditorium in Tennessee is located south
      of Lake Icaria in Iowa, I need to consider the geographic positions of these
      two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      - Iowa (IA) is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Tennessee (TN) is located in the Southeast region of the United States

      - Geographically, Iowa is positioned north of Tennessee


      Step 2: Locate the specific places within their states.

      - Nashville Municipal Auditorium is in Nashville, which is the capital city
      of Tennessee

      - Lake Icaria is a reservoir in southwestern Iowa

      - The specific locations within their states don''t change the fact that any
      point in Tennessee is south of any point in Iowa


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      Since Tennessee is entirely south of Iowa on the map of the United States, Nashville
      Municipal Auditorium (in TN) must be south of Lake Icaria (in IA).

      To solve this, I need to think about the relative locations of Pennsylvania
      and Montana in the United States:


      1. Pennsylvania (PA) is located in the northeastern United States, specifically
      in the Mid-Atlantic region.

      2. Montana (MT) is located in the northwestern United States, in the Mountain
      West region.


      When comparing north-south positions in the US:

      - Montana is much further north than Pennsylvania

      - Pennsylvania is south of Montana


      Since Washington Avenue Immigration Station is in Pennsylvania, and Hebgen Lake
      is in Montana, the immigration station would be located south of the lake.


      So the answer is YES, Washington Avenue Immigration Station, PA is located south
      of Hebgen Lake, MT.


      Wait, I should double-check this. Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Montana borders Canada, being one of the northernmost states

      - Pennsylvania is in the middle-eastern part of the country, significantly further
      south


      So this confirms my reasoning.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine

      - Hebgen Lake is in Montana (MT)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic position of these states relative to each other.

      - Montana is located in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States, much further south


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Montana is one of the northernmost states in the continental US

      - Pennsylvania is significantly further south than Montana


      Since any location in Pennsylvania would be south of most locations in Montana,
      Washington Avenue Immigration Station in PA would be south of Hebgen Lake in

      locations of these two structures.


      First, let''s consider the states:

      - Causey Reservoir is in Utah (UT)

      - Little Goose Dam is in Washington (WA)


      In the United States, Washington state is in the northwestern part of the country,
      bordering Canada to the north. Utah is located in the western United States,
      but further south than Washington.


      Generally speaking, Washington state is entirely north of Utah. On a map of

      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Washington state is in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada to the
      north.

      Utah is also in the western United States, but is significantly south of Washington.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the structures.

      Since Washington state is entirely north of Utah state, any structure in Washington
      (like Little Goose Dam) would be north of any structure in Utah (like Causey
      Reservoir).


      Therefore, Causey Reservoir, UT is located south of Little Goose Dam, WA.

      AZ is located south of Twitchell Reservoir, CA, I need to think about their
      relative positions in their respective states.


      First, I need to recall where these states are located:

      - Arizona (AZ) is located in the southwestern United States.

      - California (CA) is located on the west coast of the United States, bordering
      the Pacific Ocean.


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - California is generally north of Arizona, although they share a border where
      southeastern California meets western Arizona.


      Now, let''s think about these specific locations:

      - Parker Canyon Lake is in Arizona, likely in the southern part of the state
      given the "Canyon" in its name (many canyons are in southern Arizona).

      - Twitchell Reservoir is in California, but I need to think about where exactly
      in California.


      Twitchell Reservoir should be in central or southern California. California
      extends quite far north, so any location in Arizona would likely be south of
      a location in northern California.


      Given that Arizona is generally south of California, and Parker Canyon Lake
      is likely in southern Arizona (especially with "Canyon" in its name), it''s
      very likely that Parker Canyon Lake, AZ is south of Twitchell Reservoir, CA.


      To be more precise:

      - Parker Canyon Lake is in southern Arizona, near the Mexican border.

      - Twitchell Reservoir is in central California (Santa Maria Valley).


      In terms of latitude, central California is definitely north of southern Arizona.
      So Parker Canyon Lake would be south of Twitchell Reservoir.</think># Determining
      if Parker Canyon Lake, AZ is south of Twitchell Reservoir, CA


      I need to consider the geographical locations of these two bodies of water.


      ## Step 1: Identify the general locations

      - Parker Canyon Lake is located in Arizona, specifically in southern Arizona
      near the Mexican border in Cochise County.

      - Twitchell Reservoir is located in California, in the central part of the state
      in San Luis Obispo County.


      ## Step 2: Consider the north-south positioning of these states

      - California is located west of Arizona, but extends much further north than
      Arizona does.

      - Central California is at a higher latitude (more northern) than southern Arizona.


      ## Step 3: Compare the specific locations

      - Parker Canyon Lake, being near the Mexican border in southern Arizona, is
      at a lower latitude.

      - Twitchell Reservoir, being in central California, is at a higher latitude.


      ## Conclusion

      YES, Parker Canyon Lake, AZ is located south of Twitchell Reservoir, CA.'

      Canyon Lake, AZ is located south of Twitchell Reservoir, CA. To answer this,
      I need to think about the geographic locations of these two bodies of water.


      First, let me consider where these places are located:


      1. Parker Canyon Lake is in Arizona (AZ)

      2. Twitchell Reservoir is in California (CA)


      In terms of the general geography of the western United States:

      - Arizona is located to the east of California

      - Arizona is generally at similar latitudes to southern California

      - Northern California is further north than most of Arizona


      But the question is specifically about whether Parker Canyon Lake is south of
      Twitchell Reservoir. This requires thinking about where within their respective
      states these bodies of water are located.


      Parker Canyon Lake is likely in southern Arizona, particularly given the "Canyon"
      in its name suggesting it might be in the more mountainous southern part of
      Arizona.


      Twitchell Reservoir - I need to consider where in California this is located.
      California is a long state that stretches quite far north-south. If Twitchell
      Reservoir is in northern or central California, it would likely be north of
      most points in Arizona.


      Given that Parker Canyon Lake has "Canyon" in its name and is in Arizona, I
      believe it is very likely in southern Arizona, possibly near the Mexican border.
      Southern Arizona is definitely south of central or northern California.


      However, if Twitchell Reservoir is in the southernmost part of California, then
      the answer could be different.</think># Analyzing Locations of Parker Canyon
      Lake, AZ and Twitchell Reservoir, CA


      I need to determine the north-south relationship between these two bodies of

      ## Step 1: Locate Parker Canyon Lake, AZ

      Parker Canyon Lake is located in southern Arizona, very close to the US-Mexico
      border in Cochise County. Southern Arizona is positioned at a relatively low
      latitude within the United States.


      ## Step 2: Locate Twitchell Reservoir, CA

      Twitchell Reservoir is located in central California, specifically in San Luis
      Obispo County. This places it significantly north of the US-Mexico border and
      at a higher latitude than southern Arizona.


      ## Step 3: Compare Latitudes

      When comparing their positions on a north-south axis:

      - Central California (where Twitchell Reservoir is) is positioned at a higher
      latitude

      - Southern Arizona (where Parker Canyon Lake is) is positioned at a lower latitude

      - Lower latitude means further south


      Therefore, Parker Canyon Lake, AZ is indeed located south of Twitchell Reservoir,
      CA.

      Let me think about this geographically:


      1. Parker Canyon Lake is in Arizona (AZ).

      2. Twitchell Reservoir is in California (CA).


      First, I know that California is generally west of Arizona. But that doesn''t
      tell us about the north-south relationship.


      In terms of north-south orientation:

      - Arizona is located south of the northern part of California, but is at a similar
      latitude to southern California.

      - Parker Canyon Lake is likely in southern Arizona since it has "Canyon" in
      the name, suggesting it might be in the more mountainous southern part of the
      state.

      - Twitchell Reservoir - I need to recall where in California this is located.


      If I recall correctly, Twitchell Reservoir is in central/southern California,
      likely in the central coast region.


      Parker Canyon Lake is likely near the US-Mexico border in southern Arizona.


      Based on this geographic knowledge, Parker Canyon Lake in southern Arizona is
      likely south of Twitchell Reservoir in central/southern California.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative north-south positions
      of these two bodies of water.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both water bodies.

      - Parker Canyon Lake is in Arizona (AZ), specifically in southern Arizona near
      the US-Mexico border in Cochise County.

      - Twitchell Reservoir is in California (CA), located in central California in
      San Luis Obispo County.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      - Arizona is generally at a similar latitude to southern California, but Parker
      Canyon Lake is specifically in the southernmost part of Arizona.

      - Twitchell Reservoir is in central California, which is significantly north
      of the US-Mexico border area.


      Step 3: Make the north-south comparison.

      - Central California (where Twitchell Reservoir is) is farther north than the
      Arizona-Mexico border region (where Parker Canyon Lake is).


      YES, Parker Canyon Lake, AZ is located south of Twitchell Reservoir, CA.'

      relative geographic positions of two water bodies in the US: Parker Canyon Lake
      in Arizona (AZ) and Twitchell Reservoir in California (CA).


      To determine if Parker Canyon Lake is south of Twitchell Reservoir, I need to
      know where each is located in terms of latitude.


      Parker Canyon Lake is located in southern Arizona, near the US-Mexico border.
      Arizona is generally southeast of California.


      Twitchell Reservoir is in California. Since California is a long state stretching
      north-south along the Pacific coast, I need to know more specifically where
      in California this reservoir is located.


      Twitchell Reservoir is located in central/southern California, in San Luis Obispo
      County, which is near the coast and roughly in the middle of the state north-to-south.


      Southern Arizona is definitely south of central California. Parker Canyon Lake,
      being in southern Arizona near the Mexican border, would be south of Twitchell
      Reservoir in central/southern California.


      So the answer should be YES, Parker Canyon Lake in AZ is located south of Twitchell
      Reservoir in CA.</think># Reasoning Through Relative Geographic Positions


      I need to determine the north-south relationship between two water bodies in
      different states.


      ## Step 1: Locate Parker Canyon Lake, AZ

      Parker Canyon Lake is located in southern Arizona, very close to the US-Mexico
      border in the southeastern part of the state.


      ## Step 2: Locate Twitchell Reservoir, CA

      Twitchell Reservoir is located in central/southern California, specifically
      in San Luis Obispo County, which is roughly midway along California''s north-south
      span.


      ## Step 3: Compare Latitudes

      - Southern Arizona is significantly further south than central California

      - Parker Canyon Lake''s proximity to the Mexican border places it well south
      of Twitchell Reservoir''s position in central California

      - Arizona is generally southeast of California, and Parker Canyon Lake is in
      the southern portion of Arizona

      - California is west of Arizona

      - California extends further north than Arizona

      - California also extends further south than Arizona (around the Gulf of California)


      Step 2: Consider the possible locations of these water bodies within their states.

      Bunch-of-Grapes, MA would be in Massachusetts, which is in the northeastern
      United States.


      To determine if one is south of the other, I need to compare their latitudes:

      - New Mexico is generally much further south than Massachusetts

      - The southwestern states (including New Mexico) are among the more southern

      - Massachusetts is much further north in the United States

      - New Mexico is significantly south of Massachusetts


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since New Mexico is south of Massachusetts, any location in New Mexico (including

      Let me think about the locations:


      1. Big Hill Lake, KS - This is a lake in Kansas, which is a state in the central
      United States.

      2. Sterling Memorial Library, CT - This is a library in Connecticut, which is

      In terms of geographical positioning in the US:

      - Kansas is generally in the central part of the US

      - Connecticut is in the northeastern part of the US


      Generally speaking, states in the northeastern US (like Connecticut) are more

      of the US

      - Ohio (OH) is a state in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, north of North Carolina


      Since North Carolina is south of Ohio, and Fontana Lake is in North Carolina

      - Atwood Lake is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States

      - North Carolina is located on the east coast in the southeastern United States

      - North Carolina is positioned south of Ohio on the map


      Step 3: Make the conclusion about the lakes.

      Since North Carolina is south of Ohio, and the lakes are located within their

      To determine which one is more north or south, I need to think about the geographic
      positions of Massachusetts and Minnesota.


      Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States, on the Atlantic
      coast.

      Minnesota is located in the upper Midwest of the United States, bordering Canada.


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - Minnesota is generally further north than Massachusetts

      - Minneapolis is in the southern portion of Minnesota

      - Cambridge is in the eastern part of Massachusetts, near Boston


      Since Minnesota borders Canada and is one of the northernmost states in the
      contiguous US, while Massachusetts is further south along the eastern seaboard,
      Minneapolis (in Minnesota) would be north of Cambridge (in Massachusetts).


      Therefore, St. John the Evangelist Church in Cambridge, Massachusetts would

      - Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is in Minneapolis, Minnesota


      Step 2: Determine the relative north-south positions of these states.

      - Minnesota is in the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada

      - Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States, but significantly further
      south than Minnesota


      Step 3: Check the specific cities.

      - Minneapolis is located in the southern portion of Minnesota

      - Cambridge is in eastern Massachusetts (near Boston)

      - Even though Minneapolis is in the southern part of Minnesota, Minnesota as
      a whole is much further north than Massachusetts


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Minneapolis, Minnesota is definitely north of Cambridge, Massachusetts

      2. Lake Steilacoom in Washington state (WA)


      To determine if one is south of the other, I need to compare their latitudes.


      Royal Oak is a city in Michigan, which is in the Midwest region of the United
      States. Michigan is generally in the northern part of the contiguous United
      States.


      Lake Steilacoom is in Washington state, which is in the Pacific Northwest region
      of the United States. Washington state is one of the northernmost states in
      the contiguous US, bordering Canada.


      Generally speaking:

      - Washington state is located in the far northwest of the contiguous United
      States

      - Michigan is in the upper Midwest


      In terms of latitude:

      - Washington state is typically further north than Michigan

      - This means places in Michigan are generally south of places in Washington

      So Royal Oak Music Theatre in Michigan would very likely be south of Lake Steilacoom
      in Washington.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative
      positions of these two locations based on their latitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Royal Oak Music Theatre is in Royal Oak, Michigan (MI)

      - Lake Steilacoom is in Washington state (WA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Michigan and Washington states.

      - Washington state is in the Pacific Northwest, one of the northernmost states
      in the contiguous US

      - Michigan is in the upper Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Washington state (including Lake Steilacoom) is located in the far northwest
      corner of the United States

      - Michigan (including Royal Oak) is located significantly further south


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on latitudes.

      - Washington locations are generally at higher latitudes (more northern) than
      Michigan locations

      - Therefore, Royal Oak Music Theatre would be south of Lake Steilacoom

      Brooklyn is in New York City, in the southern portion of New York state.

      Guist Creek Lake is in Kentucky, regardless of its specific location within
      the state.


      Step 4: Compare north-south positioning.

      determine the relative positions of Black Canyon Lake in Arizona and Crystal
      Creek Reservoir in Colorado.


      First, I''ll establish where each is located:

      - Black Canyon Lake is in Arizona (AZ)

      - Crystal Creek Reservoir is in Colorado (CO)


      Arizona is generally south of Colorado in the United States. Arizona borders
      the southern part of Colorado, with Arizona being in the southwestern US and
      Colorado being directly north of it.


      Just knowing the states alone strongly suggests that a location in Arizona would
      be south of a location in Colorado. However, to be thorough, I should consider
      if there are any unusual geographical arrangements that might make this not
      true.


      Given that Arizona is entirely south of Colorado (their borders run east-west),
      any location in Arizona must be south of any location in Colorado. Their relative
      positions within their respective states doesn''t matter for determining north-south
      positioning between states.


      So Black Canyon Lake, being in Arizona, must be south of Crystal Creek Reservoir,
      which is in Colorado.</think># Is Black Canyon Lake (Arizona) located south

      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two bodies of

      First, let me identify the states:

      - Black Canyon Lake is in Arizona (AZ)

      - Crystal Creek Reservoir is in Colorado (CO)


      Looking at the geographic positions of these states:

      - Colorado is located in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States

      - Critically, Arizona lies entirely south of Colorado on the map


      Since Arizona is completely south of Colorado geographically (they don''t overlap
      in north-south positioning), any location in Arizona (including Black Canyon
      Lake) must be south of any location in Colorado (including Crystal Creek Reservoir).


      Therefore: YES, Black Canyon Lake in Arizona is located south of Crystal Creek
      Reservoir in Colorado.'

      First, let''s think about the states themselves. Pennsylvania (PA) is north
      of West Virginia (WV). PA borders WV to the north. So in general, locations
      in WV would tend to be south of locations in PA.


      R. D. Bailey Lake is in West Virginia (WV).

      Given the general geographic relationship between these states, it''s very likely

      However, I should be cautious since the shapes of states are irregular and there
      could be exceptions depending on the exact locations within each state. For
      instance, parts of WV extend northward between PA and Ohio.

      - Mountain Creek Lake is in Texas (TX)

      - Lake Monroe is in Indiana (IN)


      In terms of the U.S. geography:

      - Texas is in the southern part of the United States

      - Indiana is in the northern/midwestern part of the United States


      More specifically:

      - Texas is generally south of Indiana

      Texas is located in the southern United States, while Indiana is in the Midwest/northern
      part of the country.


      Step 2: Compare the states'' latitudes.

      Texas is significantly south of Indiana on a map of the United States. Even
      the northernmost part of Texas is south of Indiana.

      While the specific locations of the lakes within their states might vary, the

      First, I''ll establish where these states are in relation to each other. Maryland
      (MD) is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, and New York
      (NY) is a state in the northeastern United States. Generally speaking, New York
      is north of Maryland.


      Now let''s look at the specific lakes:

      - Lake Centennial is located in Maryland (specifically noted as being in Maryland)

      - Cranberry Lake is in New York


      Since Maryland is south of New York, and these lakes are in their respective
      states, it follows that Lake Centennial in Maryland would be south of Cranberry
      Lake in New York.


      So the answer should be YES, Lake Centennial (Maryland), MD is located south

      of Cranberry Lake, NY?


      To determine this, I need to consider the geographic locations of both lakes

      Step 1: Identify the states where each lake is located.

      - Lake Centennial is in Maryland (MD)

      - Cranberry Lake is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Maryland is located in the mid-Atlantic region, south of New York


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the lakes.

      - Since Maryland is entirely south of New York state

      - And Lake Centennial is in Maryland while Cranberry Lake is in New York

      - Therefore, Lake Centennial must be south of Cranberry Lake

      However, let me double-check this reasoning. The state boundaries in the United
      States are not perfectly horizontal, so theoretically there could be parts of
      a northern state that dip below parts of a southern state. But in the case of
      New York and Maryland, they don''t even share a border - Pennsylvania is between

      - Maryland is located in the mid-Atlantic region

      - Maryland is entirely south of New York state

      - These states don''t even share a border (Pennsylvania lies between them)


      Step 3: Apply this state relationship to the lakes.

      - Since Lake Centennial is in Maryland, and Maryland is completely south of
      New York

      - And Cranberry Lake is in New York

      - Therefore, Lake Centennial must be south of Cranberry Lake

      2) Cranberry Lake is located in New York (NY)

      3) Geographically, the state of Maryland is positioned south of the state of

      4) Since Maryland is entirely south of New York state, any location in Maryland
      (including Lake Centennial) must be south of any location in New York (including
      Cranberry Lake)


      YES, Lake Centennial (Maryland) is located south of Cranberry Lake, NY.'

      Berea College is located in Berea, Kentucky. Kentucky is a state in the southern
      United States.


      Tun Tavern was a historical tavern in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Philadelphia
      is in southeastern Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is in the northeastern United
      States.


      In the United States, states generally follow a north-south orientation where
      northern states like Pennsylvania are further north than southern states like
      Kentucky.

      2) First, I''ll consider the states they''re in. Alabama (AL) is in the southeastern
      United States, while Pennsylvania (PA) is in the northeastern United States.


      3) Geographically, Alabama is south of Pennsylvania. All of Alabama is south

      the geographic relationship between these two lakes.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each lake is located.

      - Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama (AL)

      - Youghiogheny River Lake is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Alabama is located in the southeastern United States, while Pennsylvania is
      in the northeastern United States. On a north-south axis, Alabama lies entirely
      south of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the lakes.

      Since Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama, and Youghiogheny River Lake is in Pennsylvania,
      and Alabama is south of Pennsylvania, it follows that Lewis Smith Lake must
      be south of Youghiogheny River Lake.

      United States geography:

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is a northeastern state, bordering New York, Ohio, West
      Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey.

      - Alabama (AL) is a southeastern state, bordering Tennessee, Georgia, Florida,

      Step 2: Determine the relative north-south positions of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern United States

      - Alabama is in the southeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is significantly north of Alabama on a map of the US


      Step 3: Since the lakes are in their respective states, their relative positions
      follow the same pattern.

      - Any location in Alabama would be south of any location in Pennsylvania

      - Therefore, Lewis Smith Lake (AL) is south of Youghiogheny River Lake (PA)

      First, let''s think about the states:

      - Alabama is entirely south of Pennsylvania

      - There''s no geographical overlap between these states

      - Even the northernmost point of Alabama would be south of the southernmost

      Step 2: Determine the relative geographical positions of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States

      - On a map, Alabama is clearly south of Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Consider whether the specific locations within these states could change
      this relationship.

      - Even the northernmost point of Alabama is south of the southernmost point
      of Pennsylvania

      - There is no geographical overlap between these states


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the states'' positions.

      First, let me think about the states:

      - TX refers to Texas

      - AZ refers to Arizona


      Geographically, Texas is east of Arizona. But the question is asking about north-south
      positioning, not east-west.


      Texas is generally in the south-central part of the United States, while Arizona
      is in the southwestern United States.


      Looking at their relative positions on a map:

      - Arizona is west of Texas

      - Arizona is generally north of Texas (though they don''t border each other
      directly)


      Lady Bird Lake is in Austin, Texas, which is in central Texas.

      Bartlett Lake is near Phoenix, Arizona, which is in central Arizona.

      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states. Arizona is in the
      southwestern United States, while Texas is in the south-central United States.


      Step 3: Looking at their north-south positioning, Arizona is generally north
      of Texas, though they don''t directly border each other (New Mexico is between
      them).

      to determine the relative locations of two places:

      1. Basilica of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary in Southampton, New York

      2. Lake Rescue in Vermont


      Let me reason through this geographically:


      Southampton, New York is located on Long Island, which is in the southeastern
      part of New York state. It''s near the Atlantic coast.


      Vermont is a state that''s north of New York state. Lake Rescue is in Vermont.


      In the United States, when comparing north-south positions:

      - Vermont is generally north of New York

      - Long Island (where Southampton is) is in the southern part of New York state


      So geographically speaking, a location in Vermont (like Lake Rescue) would be
      north of a location in Southampton, NY.


      Therefore, the Basilica of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary in Southampton,
      NY would be south of Lake Rescue in Vermont.</think>I need to determine the
      relative north-south positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations geographically.

      - The Basilica of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary is in Southampton, New
      York.

      - Southampton is located on Long Island, in the southeastern part of New York
      state.

      - Lake Rescue is in Vermont.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Vermont is a state that borders New York to the east, but is entirely north
      of Long Island.

      - Vermont is generally positioned in the northern part of the United States.

      - Long Island extends eastward from New York City along the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - All of Vermont is at a higher latitude (more northerly) than Southampton,
      NY.

      - Lake Rescue, being in Vermont, must be north of any point on Long Island.

      - Southampton, being on Long Island, is at a more southerly latitude.


      YES, the Basilica of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary in Southampton, NY

      to determine the relative locations of:

      1. Walking Horse Hotel in Tennessee (TN)

      2. Rosary Cathedral in Toledo, Ohio (OH)


      I need to determine if the first location is south of the second location.


      First, let''s think about the states:

      - Tennessee (TN) is a state in the southeastern United States

      - Ohio (OH) is a state in the midwestern United States


      Geographically, Tennessee is located south of Ohio. The northern border of Tennessee
      is at a lower latitude than the southern border of Ohio.


      Since Walking Horse Hotel is in Tennessee, and Rosary Cathedral is in Toledo,
      Ohio, then Walking Horse Hotel must be south of Rosary Cathedral, regardless
      of their specific locations within their respective states.


      So the answer is YES, Walking Horse Hotel in TN is located south of Rosary Cathedral
      in Toledo, Ohio.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions
      of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these places are located.

      - Walking Horse Hotel is in Tennessee (TN)

      - Rosary Cathedral is in Toledo, Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Ohio is a midwestern state located north of Tennessee

      - Tennessee is a southeastern state located south of Ohio


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      Since Tennessee is entirely south of Ohio on a map of the United States, any
      location in Tennessee (including Walking Horse Hotel) would be south of any
      location in Ohio (including Rosary Cathedral in Toledo).


      YES, Walking Horse Hotel in Tennessee is located south of Rosary Cathedral in
      Toledo, Ohio.'

      the latitudes of these two locations.


      Tennessee is a state in the southeastern United States, while Ohio is in the
      midwestern United States. Generally speaking, Tennessee is south of Ohio.


      Looking at specific locations:

      - Rosary Cathedral is in Toledo, Ohio, which is in the northern part of Ohio,
      close to the Michigan border

      - Walking Horse Hotel would be in Tennessee, which is entirely south of Ohio


      So geographically, Walking Horse Hotel in Tennessee would be south of Rosary
      Cathedral in Toledo, Ohio.


      Let me double-check this by thinking about the states'' positions:

      - Ohio is bordered by Michigan to the north, Pennsylvania to the east, West
      Virginia and Kentucky to the south, and Indiana to the west

      - Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky to the north, Virginia to the northeast,
      North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south,
      and Arkansas and Missouri to the west


      This confirms that Tennessee is south of Ohio, so any location in Tennessee
      would be south of any location in Ohio.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      First, I need to determine the geographic locations of both places:


      1) Rosary Cathedral is located in Toledo, Ohio

      2) Walking Horse Hotel is located in Tennessee


      Next, I need to compare the geographic positions of these states:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Tennessee is in the Southeast region of the United States

      - Tennessee is positioned entirely south of Ohio on a map


      Since Tennessee is geographically south of Ohio on the map of the United States,
      any location in Tennessee (including Walking Horse Hotel) would be south of
      any location in Ohio (including Rosary Cathedral in Toledo).

      1. Walking Horse Hotel in Tennessee

      2. Rosary Cathedral in Toledo, Ohio


      To determine if one is south of the other, I need to compare their latitudes.
      A location with a lower latitude is further south than a location with a higher
      latitude.


      Let me think about the states first:

      - Tennessee (TN) is a southern state

      - Ohio (OH) is a northern/midwestern state


      Generally speaking, Tennessee is south of Ohio. Toledo, Ohio is in the northern
      part of Ohio, near the Michigan border and Lake Erie.


      So based on the states alone, it''s very likely that Walking Horse Hotel in
      Tennessee is south of Rosary Cathedral in Toledo, Ohio. Tennessee is definitely
      south of Ohio on the map of the United States.


      To be completely certain, I would need the exact latitudes of both locations,
      but based on state geography, Tennessee is unquestionably south of northern
      Ohio where Toledo is located.</think># Determining if Walking Horse Hotel, TN
      is south of Rosary Cathedral in Toledo, OH


      To answer this question, I need to compare the geographic locations of these
      two places.


      Step 1: Consider the states involved.

      - Tennessee (TN) is located in the southeastern United States.

      - Ohio (OH) is located in the midwestern United States, significantly north
      of Tennessee.


      Step 2: Consider Toledo''s specific location.

      - Toledo, Ohio is in the northern part of Ohio, near the Michigan border and
      Lake Erie.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - All of Tennessee is geographically south of northern Ohio.

      - Any location in Tennessee (including Walking Horse Hotel) would be south of
      Toledo, Ohio (where Rosary Cathedral is located).

      Is Navajo Generating Station, AZ located south of Lost Creek Lake, OR?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two locations based on their states.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona (AZ)

      - Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Oregon is located in the northwestern United States

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States

      - On a north-south axis, Oregon is significantly north of Arizona


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific locations.

      - Since Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon, and Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona,
      the generating station must be south of the lake.


      YES, Navajo Generating Station, AZ is located south of Lost Creek Lake, OR.'

    4f408889-0f3f-40e2-882a-b8d5e4d67efd: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative positions of Navajo Generating Station in Arizona
      and Lost Creek Lake in Oregon.


      First, let me recall the general geography of the United States:

      - Oregon (OR) is in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, bordering
      Washington to the north, Idaho to the east, Nevada and California to the south.

      - Arizona (AZ) is in the southwestern United States, bordering Utah to the north,
      New Mexico to the east, Mexico to the south, and California and Nevada to the
      west.


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - Oregon is much further north than Arizona

      - Arizona is south of Oregon


      Since Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona (AZ) and Lost Creek Lake is in
      Oregon (OR), the generating station would be south of the lake simply based
      on the states'' relative positions.


      To be even more specific:

      - Navajo Generating Station was near Page, Arizona in the northern part of the
      state

      - Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon, but even if it''s in southern Oregon, Oregon
      as a whole is still significantly north of Arizona


      So Navajo Generating Station in Arizona is definitely south of Lost Creek Lake
      in Oregon.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions of
      these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      - Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona (AZ)

      - Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon (OR)

      - Oregon is located in the Pacific Northwest of the United States

      - Arizona is located in the Southwestern United States


      Step 2: Compare the general latitudes of these states.

      - Oregon is much further north in the United States compared to Arizona

      - Oregon borders Washington state to the north and California/Nevada to the
      south

      - Arizona is south of Utah and north of Mexico


      Step 3: Consider specific locations within these states.

      - Even though Navajo Generating Station is in northern Arizona (near Page, AZ),
      and Lost Creek Lake might be in southern Oregon, the significant north-south
      distance between these states means the lake would still be much further north
      than the power plant.


      Therefore, Navajo Generating Station in Arizona IS located south of Lost Creek
      Lake in Oregon.

      On a US map, Missouri is positioned significantly north of Alabama.


      Step 2: Consider the locations within their states.

      Lake Martin is located in eastern Alabama, while Truman Reservoir is in west-central
      Missouri. Even accounting for their specific locations within each state, the
      entire state of Alabama lies south of Missouri.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Since Lake Martin is in Alabama and Truman Reservoir is in Missouri, and Alabama
      is entirely south of Missouri, Lake Martin must be south of Truman Reservoir.

      - Corpus Christi Cathedral is located in Corpus Christi, Texas, which is on
      the Gulf Coast in the southern part of Texas.

      - Lake Alan Henry is a reservoir located in Garza and Kent counties in the northwestern
      part of Texas, near Lubbock in the Texas Panhandle region.


      ## Step 2: Compare their positions

      - Corpus Christi is near the southernmost part of Texas, along the Gulf of Mexico

      - Lake Alan Henry is in northwest Texas, which is significantly further north

      I need to determine if Corpus Christi Cathedral is located south of Lake Alan
      Henry.


      Let me recall the geography of Texas:

      - Corpus Christi is a city located on the Gulf Coast of Texas, in the southern
      part of the state.

      - Lake Alan Henry is a reservoir located in the northwestern part of Texas,
      near Lubbock (if I recall correctly).


      Based on Texas geography, Corpus Christi is in South Texas along the coast,
      while Lake Alan Henry is in Northwest Texas. This means that Corpus Christi
      (and thus Corpus Christi Cathedral) would be south of Lake Alan Henry.


      To confirm: Corpus Christi is near the southern tip of Texas on the Gulf Coast,
      while Lake Alan Henry is in the Texas Panhandle region, which is in the northern
      part of the state. Therefore, Corpus Christi Cathedral is indeed south of Lake
      Alan Henry.</think>To determine if Corpus Christi Cathedral is located south

      Gulf Coast in the southern part of Texas.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Alan Henry.

      Lake Alan Henry is a reservoir located in the northwestern part of Texas, near
      Lubbock in the Texas Panhandle region.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      The Texas Panhandle and Lubbock area are in the northern portion of Texas, while
      Corpus Christi is in the southern portion of the state along the Gulf Coast.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on Texas geography.

      Since Corpus Christi is in South Texas and Lake Alan Henry is in Northwest Texas,
      Corpus Christi Cathedral is indeed south of Lake Alan Henry.

      - Corpus Christi is on the Gulf Coast of Texas (southern Texas)

      - Lake Alan Henry is in the Texas Panhandle or West Texas (northern part of

      - Lake Alan Henry is in the northern portion of Texas

      - Corpus Christi is near the southern coast of Texas

      - The Texas Panhandle and West Texas regions are in the northern part of the
      state.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Corpus Christi Cathedral is in Corpus Christi, Texas, which is located on
      the Gulf Coast in the southern part of Texas.

      - Lake Alan Henry is a reservoir located in Garza and Kent counties in the northwestern
      part of Texas (near Lubbock).


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes (north-south positions).

      - Texas extends from north to south, with the Panhandle and northwestern regions
      being in the northern part of the state.

      - The Gulf Coast, where Corpus Christi is located, forms the southern edge of
      Texas.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      is in the northwestern part of Texas, Corpus Christi is located to the south
      of Lake Alan Henry.
