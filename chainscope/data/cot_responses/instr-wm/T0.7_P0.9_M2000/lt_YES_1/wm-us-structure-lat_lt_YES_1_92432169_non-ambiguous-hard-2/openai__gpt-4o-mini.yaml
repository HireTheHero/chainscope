      south of Allen Theatre. Given that California is west of Ohio, and Mariposa
      County is slightly south of the central line of California, we need to confirm
      whether it is indeed south of Cleveland.


      Since New Exchequer Dam is in California, which is west and slightly south of
      Ohio, it is not south of Allen Theatre in Cleveland, Ohio.

      1. **Identify the Locations**: FirstBank Southwest Tower is located in Texas,
      specifically in the city of El Paso. St. Nicholas of Tolentine Church is located
      in the Bronx, New York.


      2. **Geographical Orientation**: Next, we need to consider the geographical
      orientation of these two locations. El Paso, Texas is located in the far western
      part of Texas, while the Bronx is located in the northeastern part of the United
      States, specifically in New York City.


      3. **Determine Relative Position**: To see if FirstBank Southwest Tower is south
      of the church, we can visualize or use a map to see the relative positions of
      El Paso and the Bronx. El Paso is generally southwest relative to New York City.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since El Paso is to the southwest of the Bronx, it is not
      directly south but rather more to the southwest.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is NO; FirstBank Southwest Tower is not

      in Cochise County.


      2. **Locate Twitchell Reservoir, CA**: Twitchell Reservoir is located in central
      California, near the city of Santa Maria in San Luis Obispo County. It is situated
      to the northwest of Los Angeles.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Since Parker Canyon Lake is in southern
      Arizona and Twitchell Reservoir is in central California, we can see that Arizona
      is to the east of California. Therefore, Parker Canyon Lake is located to the
      southeast of Twitchell Reservoir.


      Now, answering the question directly:


      Is Parker Canyon Lake, AZ located south of Twitchell Reservoir, CA?


      NO.'

      2. **Locate Carson Mansion**: Carson Mansion is located in Eureka, California,

      steps:


      1. **Locate R. D. Bailey Lake**: R. D. Bailey Lake is situated in West Virginia.
      It is located in the southern part of the state.


      2. **Locate Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir**: The Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir

      3. **Compare the Locations**: To determine if R. D. Bailey Lake is south of
      Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir, we need to compare their latitudinal positions.
      Since R. D. Bailey Lake is in West Virginia (which is generally south of Pennsylvania),
      we can infer that it is likely to be south of the reservoir.


      4. **Confirm the Relationship**: The geographical layout shows that West Virginia
      is positioned to the south of Pennsylvania, and since R. D. Bailey Lake is in
      West Virginia, it is indeed south of the Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir.

      in California, which is on the western coast of the United States.


      3. **Geographical relation**: Arkansas is situated to the east of California.
      Therefore, if we visualize the map, any location in Arkansas (like Nimrod Lake)
      would be to the east of any location in California (like Lake Del Valle).


      4. **Determine the relative positions**: Since Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas (east
      of California) and Lake Del Valle is in California (west of Arkansas), Nimrod
      Lake cannot be south of Lake Del Valle because it is located to the east.


      Thus, the answer to the question is:


      NO.'

      Utah.

    f1eff568-a2e0-4ae6-adae-221f6b2d1f8f: "To determine if One St. Petersburg, FL\
      \ is located south of Lake Waco, TX, we need to analyze the geographical locations\
      \ of both places:\n\n1. **Identify the locations**:\n   - One St. Petersburg\
      \ is located in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n   - Lake Waco is located near Waco,\
      \ Texas.\n\n2. **Determine the latitude**:\n   - St. Petersburg, FL has a latitude\
      \ of approximately 27.77\xB0 N.\n   - Waco, TX has a latitude of approximately\
      \ 31.55\xB0 N.\n\n3. **Compare the latitudes**:\n   - Since 27.77\xB0 N is less\
      \ than 31.55\xB0 N, this means St. Petersburg, FL is further south than Waco,\
      \ TX.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, since St. Petersburg, FL is south\
      \ of Waco, TX, it follows that One St. Petersburg, FL is also south of Lake\
      \ Waco, TX.\n\nFinal answer: YES."
