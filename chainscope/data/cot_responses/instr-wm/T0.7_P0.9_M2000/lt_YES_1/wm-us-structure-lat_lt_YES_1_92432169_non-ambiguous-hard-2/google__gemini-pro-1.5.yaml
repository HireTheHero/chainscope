      of the *west* Coast.  Thinking in terms of latitude, any specific location in
      the East will be south of a location farther north in the West.  Therefore,

      2. **San Clemente Dam''s Location:** San Clemente Dam is in California (CA),
      a state on the west coast of the United States.


      3. **Relative Position of Arkansas and California:** California is significantly
      west of Arkansas.  Latitude-wise, Arkansas is generally south of *northern*
      California, but not necessarily southern California.


      4. **Specific Latitudes (if needed):** We could look up the precise latitudes,
      but it''s unlikely a dam in *southern* California would be north of something
      in Arkansas.

      of the significant longitudinal difference.  Thinking of a US map, Arkansas
      is generally southeast of California.


      4. **South Implies Primarily a Latitudinal Comparison:** While Arkansas is slightly
      southeast, the primary direction of difference is east.  "South" implies being
      primarily lower in latitude.

      4. Latitude determines north/south position.  While Texas is generally south
      of *most* of California, we need to specifically compare the latitudes of the
      two locations. However, the general west/east positions of the states make it
      highly unlikely that a Texas location would be south of a California location.

      5.  It''s very likely the answer is NO.  Checking a map confirms this.

      than the latitude of Our Lady of Sorrows Church.


      Since Texas is east, and not directly south, of California, we need to compare
