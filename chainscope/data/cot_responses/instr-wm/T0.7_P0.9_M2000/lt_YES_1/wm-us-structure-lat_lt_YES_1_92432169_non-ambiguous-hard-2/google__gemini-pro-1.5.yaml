      4. Latitude determines north/south position.  Therefore, simply being west of
      another location doesn''t automatically make it south.  Further investigation
      is required.

      5. Checking a map reveals that while Idaho *is* west of Minnesota, a significant
      portion of Idaho is also *north* of Minnesota.

      6.  Anderson Ranch Dam''s latitude is approximately 43.7 degrees North.

      7.  I need the latitude of Star Lite Motel in Minnesota to make a definitive
      comparison.  Assuming a generic location within Minnesota since the exact location
      of "Star Lite Motel" is not specified, Minnesota''s latitude ranges from roughly
      43.5 degrees North to 49 degrees North.

      8  Therefore, it''s plausible that Star Lite Motel could be either slightly
      south *or* significantly north of Anderson Ranch Dam.

      I don''t have the precise latitude of both locations. However, given that Idaho
      is considerably further west than Minnesota, it''s highly unlikely that a location
      in Idaho would be south of a location in Minnesota.  Almost all of Idaho is
      north of almost all of Minnesota.

      the overall directional relationship is east-west.

      4. **South implies a direct north-south relationship:** To be directly south,
      a location would need to be along the same line of longitude (or very close
      to it).  Given the significant east-west distance between Texas and California,
      San Antonio cannot be directly south of San Diego.
