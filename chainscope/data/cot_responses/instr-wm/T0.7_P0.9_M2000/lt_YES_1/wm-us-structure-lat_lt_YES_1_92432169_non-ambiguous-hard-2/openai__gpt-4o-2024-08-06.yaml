    96cdf258-fb3a-4e3d-9946-980f8104ebe5: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the location of Anderson Ranch Dam, ID:** Anderson Ranch Dam is
      located in Idaho, USA. Specifically, it is situated on the South Fork of the
      Boise River in Elmore County, Idaho.


      2. **Identify the location of Star Lite Motel, MN:** Star Lite Motel is located
      in Minnesota, USA. For the purposes of this question, let''s consider a generic
      location in Minnesota, since there might be multiple motels with similar names.


      3. **Determine the relative positions of Idaho and Minnesota:** Idaho is located
      in the northwestern region of the United States, while Minnesota is situated
      in the north-central region. Generally, Minnesota is positioned to the east
      and slightly north of Idaho.


      4. **Compare the latitude of the two locations:** Anderson Ranch Dam in Idaho
      is at a lower latitude compared to most locations in Minnesota, which means
      it is generally south of most places in Minnesota.


      Based on these steps, Anderson Ranch Dam, ID is located south of Star Lite Motel,
      MN.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      2. **Gavins Point Dam, Nebraska**: This dam is located on the Missouri River,
      near the border between Nebraska and South Dakota. It is situated in the northern
      part of Nebraska.


      3. **Comparison**: Illinois is generally east and slightly south of Nebraska.
      However, considering the specific locations, Iroquois County in Illinois is
      significantly south of the northern part of Nebraska where Gavins Point Dam
      is located.


      Therefore, Bayles Lake in Illinois is indeed located south of Gavins Point Dam
      in Nebraska.


      The answer is: **YES**.'
