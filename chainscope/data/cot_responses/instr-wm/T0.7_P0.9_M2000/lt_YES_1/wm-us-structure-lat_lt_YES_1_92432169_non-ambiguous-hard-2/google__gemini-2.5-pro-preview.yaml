      3.  **Determine the relative north-south position of Kansas and Iowa:** Iowa
      is located north of Kansas.

      4.  **Apply to the lakes:** Therefore, a lake in Iowa (Saylorville Lake) would

      5.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if Council Grove Lake, KS is
      *south of* Saylorville Lake, IA. Since Saylorville Lake is north of Council
      Grove Lake, this means Council Grove Lake is indeed south of Saylorville Lake.
