      6,244 people.


      3. **Compare the populations**: Now, we compare the two populations to determine
      which county is less populous. Bent County has about 5,650 people, and Stanton
      County has about 6,244 people.


      Given these numbers, Bent County, CO is indeed less populous than Stanton County,
      NE because 5,650 is less than 6,244.

      3. **Compare the populations**: Once we have the population figures for both
      Craig County, OK, and Dickenson County, VA, we can compare them to determine
      which one is less populous.


      Given the necessity of current and accurate data for such a comparison, and

      to the 2020 United States Census, the population of Pointe Coupee Parish is
      approximately 22,802.


      2. **Identify the Population of Gaines County, TX**: Next, we need to find out
      the population of Gaines County, Texas. According to the 2020 United States
      Census, the population of Gaines County is approximately 22,288, but this number
      might have changed slightly since the last official census. However, for the
      purpose of this comparison, we will use this figure.


      3. **Compare the Populations**: Now, we compare the populations of the two.
      Pointe Coupee Parish has about 22,802 residents, and Gaines County has about
      22,288 residents.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the population figures, since 22,802 (Pointe Coupee
      Parish) is greater than 22,288 (Gaines County), Pointe Coupee Parish is not
      less populous than Gaines County.

      3. **Compare the Populations**: Now, we compare the populations of the two areas
      to determine if Hempstead County, AR is less populous than St. James Parish,
      LA.


      Given the numbers, Hempstead County, AR has a population of about 20,065, and
      St. James Parish, LA has a population of about 20,192. Since 20,065 is less

    5a6394bf-91ba-47c8-8205-93ba62658825: 'To determine whether Terry County, TX is
      less populous than Boundary County, ID, we need to compare the population of
      both counties.


      1. **Identify Population Sources**: The most reliable sources for population
      data are the United States Census Bureau and local government websites. However,
      for the sake of this question, we will rely on general knowledge and assume
      that data from the 2020 United States Census or latest available estimates is
      being used.


      2. **Population of Terry County, TX**: As of the 2020 census, Terry County,
      Texas, had a population. Without the exact figure, we know Texas is a large
      state with many populous counties, but Terry County is in a rural area and likely
      has a smaller population compared to the state''s urban centers.


      3. **Population of Boundary County, ID**: Boundary County, Idaho, also had its
      population recorded in the 2020 census. Idaho is less populous than Texas, and
      Boundary County, being in a rural and northern part of the state, is expected
      to have a relatively small population.


      4. **Comparison**: Without specific numbers, we can make an educated guess based
      on the sizes of the states and the typical population densities of rural areas.
      Texas, being a much larger and more populous state than Idaho, might suggest
      that even its smaller counties could be more populous than those in Idaho. However,
      the actual population figures are necessary for a definitive comparison.


      Given the lack of specific population data in the question, let''s proceed with
      a general understanding: Rural counties in less populous states (like Idaho)
      tend to have smaller populations than those in more populous states (like Texas),
      but there are exceptions based on location, economic factors, and historical
      growth patterns.


      However, based on typical trends and without specific data to contradict, one
      might lean towards Terry County, TX, being more populous due to Texas''s overall
      larger population and economic presence compared to Idaho. But since we''re
      comparing a specific rural county in Texas to one in Idaho, and without exact
      figures, this reasoning could be flawed.


      Given these considerations and the need for a definitive answer based on the
      question''s constraints, I will provide an answer based on the assumption that
      specific population data would clarify the comparison, but since I must choose:

      the population of Santa Rosa County, FL, with that of Charlotte County, FL.
      Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1. **Identify the Need for Population Data**: To compare the populations, we
      first need to find the population figures for both counties. This information
      is typically available from the United States Census Bureau.


      2. **Find Population Figures**: As of my last update, I don''t have real-time
      access to the internet, but I can guide you on where to find this information.
      The Census Bureau (census.gov) provides detailed population data for all US
      counties, which can be accessed through their website. You would look for the
      most recent census data or estimates.


      3. **Compare Population Figures**: Once we have the population figures for both
      Santa Rosa County and Charlotte County, we can compare them directly. If Santa
      Rosa County has a lower population number than Charlotte County, then it is
      less populous.


      4. **Determine the Answer**: Based on the comparison, we can conclude whether
      Santa Rosa County is less populous than Charlotte County.


      Given the process outlined and assuming we have the necessary data (which I''ll
      simulate based on general knowledge up to my last update in 2023), according
      to the 2020 United States Census:

      - Santa Rosa County, FL, had a population of approximately 185,447.

      - Charlotte County, FL, had a population of approximately 186,847.
