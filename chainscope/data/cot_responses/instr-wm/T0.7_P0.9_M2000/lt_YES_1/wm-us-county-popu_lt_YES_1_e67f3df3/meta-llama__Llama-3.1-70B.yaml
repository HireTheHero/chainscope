      are the steps I''ll follow:


      1. **Find the population of Scotland County, NC**: According to the 2020 United
      States Census, the population of Scotland County, NC, is approximately 34,174.


      2. **Find the population of Ford County, KS**: According to the 2020 United

      these numbers may have changed slightly since the last official census, but
      they should give us a good basis for comparison).


      3. **Compare the populations**: Now, I will compare the populations of the two
      counties to determine if Scotland County, NC, is less populous than Ford County,
      KS.


      Based on the numbers, Scotland County, NC, has a population of about 34,174,
      and Ford County, KS, has a population of about 34,287. Since 34,174 is less
      than 34,287, Scotland County, NC, is indeed less populous than Ford County,
      KS.


      The answer is: YES
