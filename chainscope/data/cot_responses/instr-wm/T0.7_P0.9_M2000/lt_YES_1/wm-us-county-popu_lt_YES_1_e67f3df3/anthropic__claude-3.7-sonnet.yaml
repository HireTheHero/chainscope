      Santa Rosa County, FL has approximately 188,000 residents (as of recent estimates).


      Charlotte County, FL has approximately 186,000 residents (as of recent estimates).


      Step 2: Compare the two population figures.

      Santa Rosa County: ~188,000

      Charlotte County: ~186,000

      Since 188,000 > 186,000, Santa Rosa County has a larger population than Charlotte
      County.


      Step 4: Answer the specific question asked: "Is Santa Rosa County, FL less populous
      than Charlotte County, FL?"

      Since Santa Rosa County has more people than Charlotte County (not less), the
      answer is:


      NO'
