      2 Hydroelectric Power Station is located in Uganda, specifically in the northern
      part of the country, near the Achwa River.


      2. **Identify the Location of Lake Dukan**: Lake Dukan is located in the Kurdistan
      region of Iraq.


      3. **Compare the Relative Locations**: Uganda is located in East Africa, which
      is geographically south of Iraq, where Lake Dukan is located in the Middle East.


      By analyzing these points, we find that the Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station,
      being in Uganda, is indeed south of Lake Dukan, which is in Iraq.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
