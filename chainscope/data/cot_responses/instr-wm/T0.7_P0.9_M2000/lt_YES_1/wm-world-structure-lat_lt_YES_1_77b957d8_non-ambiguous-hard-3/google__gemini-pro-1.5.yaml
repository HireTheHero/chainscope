      2. **Locate Gate Lodge:** Gate Lodge is a common feature of larger estates and

      Lodge is being referred to.  Since the question links it to Calatagan Solar
      Farm, it''s reasonable to assume it refers to a Gate Lodge within or near the
      solar farm itself, or in the wider Calatagan area.

      2. **Locate Gate Lodge:** This requires more context. There are likely multiple

      results for a specific Gate Lodge also in Calatagan, seemingly associated with
      the solar farm itself or nearby developments.


      3. **Determine relative positions:**  Since the Gate Lodge seems to be associated
      with the solar farm, it''s unlikely to be significantly far from it.  More precise
      location information would be needed to be absolutely certain. However, articles
      and project proposals often mention the Gate Lodge as an entry point to the
      solar farm, implying it is at or near the perimeter.

      is south of its own entrance gate.  It likely extends in multiple directions
      from the Gate Lodge.

      refers to a Gate Lodge also in Calatagan (likely associated with a resort or

      2. **Relative Position:** We need to find the relative positions of these two
      locations within Calatagan. More specific location information is needed for
      a precise answer.  A map search might be helpful.  However, several searches
      point to a Gate Lodge within a resort/residential area very close to the Calatagan
      Solar Farm.

      Military Circle (Latvian: Latvijas armijas virsnieku nams) is also located in
      Riga, Latvia.

      3. **Determine relative positions:** Consulting a map of Riga reveals that the
      Palace of the National Military Circle is southeast of Riga Castle.  Southeast
      implies it *is* south, in addition to being east.


      NO.  While it''s southeast, the question asks specifically if it''s *south*.  Since
      southeast also includes east, it''s not strictly south.
