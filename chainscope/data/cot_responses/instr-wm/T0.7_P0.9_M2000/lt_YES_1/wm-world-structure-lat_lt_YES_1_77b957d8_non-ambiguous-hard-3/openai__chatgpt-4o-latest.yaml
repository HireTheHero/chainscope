    8662f63d-2dbe-4c92-9c18-57e8133efd24: 'To determine whether the Calatagan Solar
      Farm is located south of Gate Lodge, we need to first identify the locations
      of both:


      1. **Calatagan Solar Farm**: This is a known solar power facility located in
      Calatagan, Batangas province, on the island of Luzon in the Philippines. It
      lies in the southern part of Luzon, near the coast of the West Philippine Sea.


      2. **Gate Lodge**: This term is ambiguous without additional context, as "Gate
      Lodge" could refer to various buildings or lodges near the entrances of estates,
      parks, or institutions around the world. However, one potentially relevant "Gate
      Lodge" is within the context of places in the Philippines. But unless specified,
      it is difficult to determine the exact location.


      To proceed with reasoning, we need to assume a specific "Gate Lodge" that might
      reasonably be in the same region.


      - If "Gate Lodge" refers to a structure within a known estate or facility near
      Calatagan, then we could compare coordinates.

      - Alternatively, if Gate Lodge is in a completely different area (such as one
      in Europe or North America), then Calatagan Solar Farm would almost certainly
      be south of it.


      Given that Calatagan is located in the southern part of Luzon, Philippines,
      and unless Gate Lodge is even further south (which is unlikely unless it''s
      in Mindanao or another southern region), the Calatagan Solar Farm would not
      be south of most places called "Gate Lodge".


      However, without a precise definition or location for "Gate Lodge", we cannot
      be entirely certain.


      But assuming a typical or known "Gate Lodge" is north of Calatagan (which is
      a reasonable assumption given the Philippines'' geography), we can conclude:


      **NO**, the Calatagan Solar Farm is not located south of Gate Lodge.'
