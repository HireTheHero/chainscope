      is significantly south of Chestermere, Alberta (where Chestermere Lake is located).


      Therefore, the Denver Federal Center is not located south of Chestermere Lake;

      in New York City, which is situated in the northeastern United States.


      2. **Location of President''s House**: President''s House is located in Port
      of Spain, the capital of Trinidad and Tobago, which is in the Caribbean, to
      the south of the mainland United States.


      3. **Geographical Orientation**: Trinidad and Tobago is located southeast of
      New York City. Therefore, in terms of latitude, Port of Spain is significantly
      further south than New York City.
