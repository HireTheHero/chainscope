      1. First, Sai Ying Pun Community Complex is located in Hong Kong, which is in
      southeastern China.


      2. Bratsk Reservoir is located in Siberia, Russia, which is in northern Asia.


      3. These two locations are very far apart geographically - thousands of miles

    2a85c819-5b94-4499-895c-fe7829fb029e: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Sai Ying Pun Community Complex:

      - This is located in Hong Kong, specifically on Hong Kong Island

      - It is in the Western District of Hong Kong


      2. Next, I''ll locate Bratsk Reservoir:

      - This is located in Siberia, Russia

      - It is situated in the Irkutsk Oblast region


      3. Comparing their geographical locations:

      - Hong Kong is in East Asia, in the southern part of China

      - Bratsk Reservoir is in central/northern Russia

      - These locations are thousands of kilometers apart


      4. Determining their relative north/south positioning:

      - Bratsk Reservoir is much further north compared to Hong Kong

      - Hong Kong is significantly south of the Bratsk Reservoir


      5. Conclusion:

      Since Bratsk Reservoir is located much further north, and Sai Ying Pun Community
      Complex is located in southern China, Sai Ying Pun Community Complex is indeed
      south of Bratsk Reservoir.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      - This is an ancient Roman temple located in the historic center of Split

      - It is situated within Diocletian''s Palace in the old town of Split


      2. Next, let''s locate Elephant & Castle railway station

      - This is a railway station located in London, United Kingdom

      - It is in the southern part of central London


      3. Comparing their geographical locations

      - The Temple of Jupiter is in Croatia (southeastern Europe)

      - Elephant & Castle railway station is in the United Kingdom (northwestern Europe)

      - These locations are in completely different countries, on different continents


      4. Determining relative position

      - Since these locations are thousands of miles apart, the concept of "south
      of" doesn''t meaningfully apply

      - However, if we were to plot them on a map, the Temple of Jupiter would actually
      be NORTH of Elephant & Castle, not south
