      Sri Lanka is an island nation in South Asia, located south of India in the Indian
      Ocean.

      Pakistan is located in South Asia, north of India.


      Step 4: Determine relative position.

      Since Sri Lanka is south of Pakistan, and Sembuwatta Lake is in Sri Lanka while

      to determine the relative locations of the Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim and the
      Ryanggang Hotel.


      Saint Andrew Kim Taegon is a Korean Catholic saint. Let me see if I can determine
      where his shrine is located. The shrine should be in Korea since he was a Korean
      saint.


      The Ryanggang Hotel sounds like it might be in North Korea, as "Ryanggang" (also
      spelled "Ryanggang") is a province in North Korea. But I should confirm this.


      Let me think about the locations:

      1. Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim: Likely in South Korea, as Saint Andrew Kim Taegon
      is particularly venerated in South Korea and North Korea is not known for having
      Catholic shrines.

      2. Ryanggang Hotel: Likely in North Korea, possibly in Pyongyang or in Ryanggang
      Province.


      If these initial assumptions are correct, then the Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim
      would be located in South Korea, which is south of North Korea where the Ryanggang
      Hotel would be located.


      However, I should be careful with my reasoning. The question is about the relative
      locations of specific buildings, not just about which country they''re in. It''s
      possible that both are in the same country but in different cities.</think>I
      need to identify the locations of both the Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim and the
      Ryanggang Hotel to determine their relative positions.


      Step 1: The Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim (Taegon) is located in South Korea. Saint
      Andrew Kim was the first Korean Catholic priest and is an important religious
      figure in South Korea.


      Step 2: The Ryanggang Hotel is located in Pyongyang, North Korea. It''s a well-known
      hotel in North Korea''s capital city.


      Step 3: Geographically, South Korea is located south of North Korea on the Korean
      Peninsula.


      Step 4: Since the shrine is in South Korea and the hotel is in North Korea,
      the shrine must be south of the hotel.


      YES, the Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim is located south of Ryanggang Hotel.'

      To answer this, I need to determine where these two places are located.


      Saint Andrew Kim Taegon is a Korean Catholic saint. There might be shrines dedicated
      to him in various places, particularly in South Korea.


      Ryanggang Hotel sounds like it might be in North Korea, as "Ryanggang" is the
      name of a province in North Korea. However, I should be cautious about making
      assumptions.


      Given that Saint Andrew Kim is a Korean Catholic saint, it''s likely that a
      shrine dedicated to him would be in South Korea, while a hotel named after a
      North Korean province would likely be in North Korea.


      If that''s the case, then South Korea is entirely south of North Korea. So a
      shrine in South Korea would be south of a hotel in North Korea.


      However, I need to be careful here, as there could be multiple shrines to Saint
      Andrew Kim, and the Ryanggang Hotel might not necessarily be in North Korea.


      Without specific information about the locations of these two places, I cannot
      give a definitive answer.</think>I need to determine the geographical relationship
      between the Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim and the Ryanggang Hotel.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - The Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim is likely in South Korea, as he is a Korean
      Catholic saint.

      - Ryanggang Hotel appears to be named after Ryanggang Province in North Korea,
      suggesting it''s located in North Korea.


      Step 2: Compare their geographical positions.

      - South Korea is entirely south of North Korea on the Korean Peninsula.

      - If the shrine is in South Korea and the hotel is in North Korea, then the
      shrine would be south of the hotel.


      Step 3: Check if my assumptions are correct.

      - The Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim Taegon is indeed in South Korea.

      - Ryanggang Hotel is located in Pyongyang, North Korea.


      Based on this analysis, since South Korea is south of North Korea, and these
      locations are in their respective countries:


      YES'

      Andrew Kim is located south of Ryanggang Hotel, I need to know the locations
      of both places.


      Saint Andrew Kim (Kim Taegon) was the first Korean-born Catholic priest who
      was martyred and later canonized as a saint. There could be shrines dedicated
      to him in various locations, particularly in Korea.


      Ryanggang Hotel appears to be a hotel in North Korea, in the city of Pyongyang
      or possibly in Samjiyon in Ryanggang Province.


      Without knowing the exact locations of both the shrine and the hotel, I cannot
      determine their relative positions. I don''t have access to precise geographic
      coordinates or maps showing these locations.


      If these are both in Korea (either North or South), I would need to know their
      specific locations to determine if one is south of the other. However, I don''t
      have this specific information in my knowledge base.</think>I need to determine

      dedicated to him primarily in South Korea.


      Step 2: Identify Ryanggang Hotel. Ryanggang Hotel is located in Pyongyang, North
      Korea. It''s a well-known hotel in the capital city.


      Step 3: Compare the locations. South Korea is located south of North Korea on
      the Korean Peninsula. Since the Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim would be in South
      Korea, and the Ryanggang Hotel is in North Korea (Pyongyang), the shrine would
      be south of the hotel.


      YES, the Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim is located south of Ryanggang Hotel.'

      Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine if Sun-Ray Cinema is located south of Barker''s Farm, I need to
      know the geographic locations of both places.


      1) First, I need to identify Sun-Ray Cinema''s location. While there might be
      multiple cinemas with this name, I don''t have specific information about its
      geographic coordinates or address in my knowledge base.


      2) Similarly for Barker''s Farm, I don''t have information about its specific
      location.


      3) Without knowing the precise locations of these two places, I cannot determine
      their relative positions to each other on a north-south axis.


      4) I don''t have access to maps or geographic databases that would allow me
      to verify this spatial relationship.

      2. Where is Gate Lodge located?

      3. Is one south of the other?


      However, I don''t have specific geographic information about these locations

      To answer whether Calatagan Solar Farm is located south of Gate Lodge, I need
      to identify the locations of both places and determine their geographical relationship.


      1) Calatagan Solar Farm is a solar power facility located in Calatagan, Batangas
      province in the Philippines.


      2) "Gate Lodge" is not a universally known landmark with a single definitive
      location. There are many buildings or structures called "Gate Lodge" around
      the world, typically referring to small buildings at the entrance of estates
      or parks.


      3) Without knowing which specific Gate Lodge is being referenced, I cannot determine
      the relative geographic positions of these two locations.


      4) I don''t have access to comprehensive geographic data that would allow me
      to identify all possible Gate Lodges and their positions relative to Calatagan
      Solar Farm.

      First, let me identify what and where Calatagan Solar Farm is. Calatagan Solar
      Farm is likely a solar power installation in Calatagan, which is in Batangas
      province in the Philippines. It''s one of the larger solar farms in the Philippines.


      Next, I need to identify what and where Gate Lodge is. This is more ambiguous
      because "Gate Lodge" is a fairly generic name that could refer to many different
      places. It could be:

      1. A specific building or facility near the Calatagan Solar Farm

      2. A landmark in the Calatagan area

      3. A completely different location unrelated to Calatagan


      Without more specific information about which Gate Lodge is being referred to,
      I cannot determine the relative positions of these two locations. There are
      many "Gate Lodges" around the world, as it''s a common name for entrance buildings
      to estates or parks.

      Calatagan Solar Farm is a solar power facility located in Calatagan, Batangas,
      Philippines.


      Step 2: Identify Gate Lodge''s location.

      This is where I encounter a challenge. "Gate Lodge" is a generic name that could
      refer to many different locations worldwide. It could be:

      - A building near the solar farm

      - A location elsewhere in the Philippines

      - A completely different place in another country


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      Without specific information about which Gate Lodge is being referenced, I cannot
      determine its geographic coordinates or position relative to the Calatagan Solar
      Farm.


      NO, I cannot definitively state whether Calatagan Solar Farm is south of Gate

      First, let me think about Calatagan Solar Farm. Calatagan is a municipality
      in Batangas province, Philippines. The Calatagan Solar Farm is a large solar
      power facility located there.


      Now, let me think about Gate Lodge. The term "Gate Lodge" is quite generic and
      could refer to many different buildings or structures around the world. It typically
      refers to a small building at the entrance to the grounds of a large property,
      like a mansion or estate. Without more specific information, I can''t pinpoint
      which Gate Lodge is being referred to.

      to determine the locations of Jimenez Church and Laoag Cathedral, and then determine
      their relative positions (whether one is south of the other).


      Let me think about these locations:


      1. Laoag Cathedral (also known as St. William''s Cathedral) is located in Laoag
      City, which is in the northern part of the Philippines, specifically in Ilocos
      Norte province.


      2. Jimenez Church (also known as San Juan Bautista Parish Church) is located
      in Jimenez, Misamis Occidental, which is in Mindanao, the southernmost major
      island of the Philippines.


      Given the geography of the Philippines:

      - Laoag is in the northern part of Luzon (the northernmost major island)

      - Jimenez is in Mindanao (the southernmost major island)


      Therefore, Jimenez is located south of Laoag. This means Jimenez Church is south
      of Laoag Cathedral.</think>I need to determine the locations of these two churches
      and their geographic relationship.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Laoag Cathedral.

      Laoag Cathedral (St. William''s Cathedral) is located in Laoag City in Ilocos
      Norte province, which is in the northern part of Luzon island in the Philippines.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Jimenez Church.

      Jimenez Church (San Juan Bautista Parish Church) is located in Jimenez, Misamis
      Occidental province, which is in Mindanao island in the southern Philippines.


      Step 3: Compare their geographic positions.

      The Philippines consists of islands arranged roughly north to south, with Luzon
      in the north and Mindanao in the south. Since Laoag is in northern Luzon and
      Jimenez is in Mindanao, Jimenez is clearly south of Laoag.

      Laoag City, which is in the northern part of the Philippines, specifically in
      Ilocos Norte province.


      3. I need to identify what "Jimenez Church" refers to. There is a Jimenez Church
      (also called St. John the Baptist Parish Church) located in Jimenez, Misamis
      Occidental, which is in Mindanao, the southernmost major island of the Philippines.


      4. Geographically, Mindanao is located south of Luzon (where Laoag City is).


      5. Therefore, Jimenez Church in Misamis Occidental is located south of Laoag

      Laoag Cathedral, officially known as St. William''s Cathedral, is located in
      Laoag City in the province of Ilocos Norte, which is in the northern part of
      Luzon island in the Philippines.


      Step 2: Identify Jimenez Church.

      Jimenez Church, officially called St. John the Baptist Parish Church, is located
      in the municipality of Jimenez in Misamis Occidental province on Mindanao island
      in the Philippines.


      Step 3: Compare their locations.

      Laoag City is located in northern Luzon (the northernmost major island of the
      Philippines), while Jimenez is located in Mindanao (the southernmost major island
      of the Philippines).


      Step 4: Determine relative position.

      Since Mindanao is south of Luzon in the Philippine archipelago, Jimenez Church

      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      The Philippines consists of islands arranged roughly north to south. Luzon is
      the northernmost major island, while Mindanao is the southernmost major island.
      Since Laoag is in northern Luzon and Jimenez is in Mindanao, Jimenez must be

      First, let me think about these places:


      1. Laoag Cathedral is likely in Laoag City, Philippines. It''s probably the
      main cathedral in Laoag.


      2. Jimenez Church - I need to determine where this is located. Jimenez sounds
      like it could be a town in the Philippines.


      Let me think about the geography of the Philippines. The Philippines is an archipelago
      that generally runs north to south. Laoag City is in the northern part of Luzon
      (the main northern island of the Philippines).


      If Jimenez is a town in the Philippines, and it''s south of Laoag, then Jimenez

      Laoag Cathedral, also known as St. William''s Cathedral, is located in Laoag
      City, which is in the northern part of the Philippines, specifically in Ilocos

      I''m not certain about a church specifically named "Jimenez Church." There is
      a municipality called Jimenez in Misamis Occidental province in the Philippines,

      If "Jimenez Church" refers to a church in Jimenez, Misamis Occidental, then
      I need to determine the relative positions of Misamis Occidental and Ilocos
      Norte.


      Ilocos Norte (where Laoag is) is at the northwestern tip of Luzon island in
      the northern Philippines.

      Misamis Occidental (where Jimenez is) is in Mindanao island in the southern
      Philippines.


      So if "Jimenez Church" refers to a church in Jimenez, Misamis Occidental, then
      it would be south of Laoag Cathedral, since Mindanao is south of Luzon in the

      1. Majestic Theatre in San Antonio

      2. Buckhorn Lake in Kentucky


      I need to determine their relative positions, specifically whether the Majestic
      Theatre is south of Buckhorn Lake.


      First, I''ll think about where these places are located in the United States:

      - San Antonio is a city in Texas, which is in the southern part of the United
      States.

      - Kentucky is a state in the eastern part of the United States, north of Texas.


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - Texas is significantly south of Kentucky

      - San Antonio is in southern Texas

      - Buckhorn Lake would be somewhere in Kentucky


      Since San Antonio, Texas is south of the entire state of Kentucky, any landmark
      in San Antonio (including the Majestic Theatre) would be south of any landmark
      in Kentucky (including Buckhorn Lake).


      Therefore, Majestic Theatre in San Antonio is indeed south of Buckhorn Lake
      in Kentucky.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic
      locations of both places and compare their positions on a north-south axis.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Buckhorn Lake is in Kentucky


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions within the United States.

      - San Antonio is located in southern Texas

      - Kentucky is positioned significantly north of Texas


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes (north-south positioning).

      - Texas is entirely south of Kentucky on a map of the United States

      - Therefore, San Antonio (being in Texas) is south of any location in Kentucky


      Step 4: Make the final comparison.

      - Since the Majestic Theatre is in San Antonio, and Buckhorn Lake is in Kentucky,
      the theatre must be south of the lake


      YES, the Majestic Theatre (San Antonio) is located south of Buckhorn Lake (Kentucky).'

      Step 3: Compare their geographic positions.

      Sri Lanka is an island nation located entirely south of India. Andhra Pradesh

      Step 3: Compare their geographical positions.

      Sri Lanka is an island nation that lies south of India. The Andhra Pradesh state
      is in southeastern India, and its secretariat would be located within this state.


      Step 4: Determine relative position.

      Since Sri Lanka is south of India, and Polgolla Barrage is in Sri Lanka while

      Step 1: Let me recall where Barker Meadow Reservoir is located.

      Barker Meadow Reservoir is located in Colorado, USA, near the town of Nederland.


      Step 2: Let me recall where Capilano Lake is located.

      Capilano Lake (also called Capilano Reservoir) is located in North Vancouver,
      British Columbia, Canada.


      Step 3: Now I need to determine their north-south relationship.

      Colorado is a state in the United States, which is south of Canada.

      British Columbia is a province in Canada, which is north of the United States.


      Therefore, Barker Meadow Reservoir in Colorado would be south of Capilano Lake
      in British Columbia.</think>To determine if Barker Meadow Reservoir is located

      States.


      Step 2: Capilano Lake (also known as Capilano Reservoir) is located in North
      Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.


      Step 3: Geographically, Canada is north of the United States. British Columbia
      is a Canadian province that borders the northern United States, while Colorado
      is a state well within the United States.


      Step 4: Since Barker Meadow Reservoir is in Colorado (USA) and Capilano Lake
      is in British Columbia (Canada), and the USA is south of Canada, Barker Meadow
      Reservoir must be south of Capilano Lake.

      Lewis Smith Lake is likely in Alabama. It''s a major reservoir in Alabama created
      by damming the Sipsey Fork of the Black Warrior River.


      St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Cathedral is in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as specified

      Now I need to determine their relative positions:

      - Wisconsin is in the northern United States

      - Alabama is in the southern United States

      St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Cathedral is in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Lewis Smith
      Lake would be south of the cathedral.</think>I need to determine the relative
      locations of these two places.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Lewis Smith Lake.

      Lewis Smith Lake (also called Smith Lake) is a reservoir located in north Alabama,
      created by damming the Sipsey Fork of the Black Warrior River.


      Step 2: Identify the location of St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Cathedral in Milwaukee.

      This cathedral is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the northern United States.

      Alabama is located significantly south of Wisconsin in the United States. Alabama
      is in the southeastern region of the country, while Wisconsin is in the upper
      Midwest/Great Lakes region.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama, and St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Cathedral
      is in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the lake is indeed south of the cathedral.

      Milwaukee is a city in Wisconsin, which is in the northern United States, bordering
      Lake Michigan. The cathedral would be located within Milwaukee.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Wisconsin is significantly north of Alabama on a map of the United States. Wisconsin
      is in the northern part of the country, while Alabama is in the southern part.

      The Church of St. Joseph is located in Bronxville, New York, USA. Bronxville
      is in Westchester County, which is in the southeastern part of New York state.


      Step 3: Determining if Halse Hall is south of the Church of St. Joseph

      Jamaica is located in the Caribbean, which is south of the United States. New
      York is in the northeastern part of the United States.


      So, Jamaica (where Halse Hall is) is south of New York (where the Church of

      Westchester County in southeastern New York state, in the northeastern United
      States.

      - Halse Hall is a historic great house located in Clarendon, Jamaica. Jamaica
      is an island nation in the Caribbean.


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      Jamaica is located in the Caribbean Sea, which is significantly south of the
      United States. New York is in the northeastern part of the United States.


      Step 3: Make the determination.

      Since Jamaica (where Halse Hall is located) is south of New York state (where
      the Church of St. Joseph in Bronxville is located), Halse Hall is indeed south
      of the Church of St. Joseph.

      1. Basilica of Saints Justus and Pastor

      2. Hampton Court railway station


      And then determine if the basilica is south of the station.


      Let me recall what I know about these locations:


      The Basilica of Saints Justus and Pastor (also known as Barcelona Cathedral
      or Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Saint Eulalia) is located in Barcelona, Spain.


      Hampton Court railway station is located in East Molesey, in the London Borough

      Spain, but even the northernmost part of Spain is still south of the southernmost
      part of the UK.

      Step 2: Identify the location of Hampton Court railway station.

      Hampton Court railway station is located in the London area, in the United Kingdom.

      Barcelona, Spain is located in southern Europe, while London, UK is in northern
      Europe.

      Spain is south of the United Kingdom on any map of Europe.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Barcelona (where the basilica is located) is south of London (where the
      railway station is located), the basilica is indeed south of the railway station.

      Let me think about these locations:


      1. Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station is likely located on the Achwa River.
      Based on my knowledge, the Achwa River is in northern Uganda, in East Africa.


      2. Lake Dukan (also spelled Dokan) is a reservoir in Iraq, specifically in the

      this question. The question is asking about the relative locations of two places:
      Madonna della Ceriola and Kalmar Cathedral.


      First, I need to identify where each of these places is located:


      1. Madonna della Ceriola: This is a sanctuary/church located on Monte Isola,
      an island in Lake Iseo in northern Italy (Lombardy region).


      2. Kalmar Cathedral: This is a cathedral located in Kalmar, which is a city

      Now that I know their locations, I need to determine their relative positions.
      Italy is south of Sweden in Europe. Sweden is in Northern Europe, while Italy
      is in Southern Europe.


      Since Madonna della Ceriola is in Italy, and Kalmar Cathedral is in Sweden,
      Madonna della Ceriola is south of Kalmar Cathedral.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the geographic locations of both places.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Madonna della Ceriola.

      Madonna della Ceriola is a sanctuary located on Monte Isola (an island in Lake
      Iseo) in northern Italy, specifically in the Lombardy region.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Kalmar Cathedral.

      Kalmar Cathedral is located in the city of Kalmar in southeastern Sweden.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Sweden is located in Northern Europe, while Italy is in Southern Europe. On
      a map, Sweden is positioned significantly further north than Italy.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Madonna della Ceriola is in northern Italy and Kalmar Cathedral is in
      Sweden, and Italy is south of Sweden, Madonna della Ceriola must be south of
      Kalmar Cathedral.

      Madonna della Ceriola is a sanctuary located on Monte Isola (or Monte Isola),
      which is an island in Lake Iseo in northern Italy. Italy is in southern Europe.


      Kalmar Cathedral is located in Kalmar, which is a city in southeastern Sweden.
      Sweden is in northern Europe.


      Given that Italy is south of Sweden in Europe, and Madonna della Ceriola is
      in northern Italy while Kalmar Cathedral is in southeastern Sweden, Madonna
      della Ceriola would be south of Kalmar Cathedral.


      To confirm, let me think about the approximate latitudes:

      - Northern Italy is roughly around 45-46 degrees north latitude

      - Southern Sweden is roughly around 56-57 degrees north latitude


      So yes, Madonna della Ceriola (in northern Italy) is located south of Kalmar
      Cathedral (in southeastern Sweden).</think>I''ll solve this step by step.


      First, I need to identify the locations of both sites:


      1. Madonna della Ceriola is a sanctuary located on Monte Isola (an island in
      Lake Iseo) in northern Italy.


      2. Kalmar Cathedral is located in Kalmar, a city in southeastern Sweden.


      Next, I need to compare their geographic positions:

      - Italy is in southern Europe

      - Sweden is in northern Europe

      - Geographically, Italy lies south of Sweden


      In terms of latitude:

      - Northern Italy is approximately at 45-46 degrees north latitude

      - Southeastern Sweden is approximately at 56-57 degrees north latitude


      Since Madonna della Ceriola is in northern Italy, and Kalmar Cathedral is in

      indeed south of Kalmar Cathedral.

      Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg.


      Step 1: Determine where Osijek Co-cathedral is located.

      Osijek is a city in Croatia, located in the eastern part of the country. Croatia
      is in southeastern Europe. The co-cathedral would be in this city.


      Step 2: Determine where Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg is located.

      Kalundborg is a city in Denmark, which is in northern Europe. Denmark is located
      north of Germany, which is north of Croatia.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      Denmark is much further north in Europe compared to Croatia. Since Kalundborg
      is in Denmark and Osijek is in Croatia, Osijek would be south of Kalundborg.


      Therefore, Osijek Co-cathedral would be south of Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg.</think>I''ll
      think about the locations of these two churches step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the location of Osijek Co-cathedral.

      Osijek is a city in eastern Croatia, in southeastern Europe. The Co-cathedral
      would be located in this city.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg.

      Kalundborg is a city in Denmark, which is in northern Europe, specifically in
      Scandinavia.


      Step 3: Compare their geographical positions.

      Denmark is located much further north in Europe compared to Croatia. Denmark
      is even north of Germany, while Croatia is south of both Denmark and Germany.


      Step 4: Determine relative position.

      Since Osijek is in Croatia (southeastern Europe) and Kalundborg is in Denmark
      (northern Europe), Osijek is definitely south of Kalundborg.


      YES, Osijek Co-cathedral is located south of Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg.'

      1. I need to determine the location of Osijek Co-cathedral.

      2. I need to determine the location of Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg.

      3. Then I need to compare their latitudes to determine if one is south of the
      other.


      Osijek Co-cathedral is in Osijek, Croatia. Croatia is in southeastern Europe.


      Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg is in Kalundborg, Denmark. Denmark is in northern
      Europe.


      Geographically, Denmark (where Kalundborg is) is much further north in Europe
      compared to Croatia (where Osijek is). Countries in northern Europe like Denmark
      are at higher latitudes than countries in southeastern Europe like Croatia.


      Since Croatia is south of Denmark, Osijek (in Croatia) would be south of Kalundborg
      (in Denmark).


      Therefore, Osijek Co-cathedral is located south of Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the geographical locations of both
      churches and compare them.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both churches.

      - Osijek Co-cathedral is located in Osijek, Croatia

      - Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg is located in Kalundborg, Denmark


      Step 2: Compare their geographical positions.

      - Croatia is in southeastern Europe

      - Denmark is in northern Europe

      - Denmark is located much further north in Europe than Croatia


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      - Since Denmark is significantly further north than Croatia, any location in
      Croatia (including Osijek) would be south of any location in Denmark (including
      Kalundborg)


      YES, Osijek Co-cathedral is located south of Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg.'

      - Denmark is in northern Europe


      Croatia is definitely south of Denmark in terms of latitude. Croatia is roughly

      The Church of Our Lady (also known as Vor Frue Kirke) is located in Kalundborg,
      Denmark, which is in northern Europe.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Croatia is located much further south in Europe (roughly between 42-46 degrees
      North latitude) compared to Denmark (roughly between 54-58 degrees North latitude).


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Osijek is in Croatia (southern Europe) and Kalundborg is in Denmark (northern
      Europe), Osijek Co-cathedral is located south of the Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg.

      and then compare their relative positions.


      First, Sarasota Opera House is in Sarasota, Florida. Sarasota is a city on the
      southwestern coast of Florida, along the Gulf of Mexico.


      Now, let me think about Lake Lemon. Lake Lemon is a reservoir located in south-central
      Indiana, near Bloomington.


      Florida is a state in the southeastern United States, while Indiana is in the
      midwestern United States. Geographically, Florida is south of Indiana.


      Since Sarasota Opera House is in Florida (south) and Lake Lemon is in Indiana
      (north), the Sarasota Opera House is located south of Lake Lemon.</think>I need
      to determine the relative locations of these two places.


      Step 1: Identify where the Sarasota Opera House is located.

      The Sarasota Opera House is located in Sarasota, Florida, which is on the southwestern
      coast of Florida along the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 2: Identify where Lake Lemon is located.

      Lake Lemon is a reservoir located in south-central Indiana, near Bloomington.

      Florida is in the southeastern United States, while Indiana is in the midwestern
      United States. On a map of the United States, Florida is significantly south
      of Indiana.


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion.

      Since Sarasota (in Florida) is south of Indiana, and Lake Lemon is in Indiana,
      the Sarasota Opera House is located south of Lake Lemon.

      Sarasota Opera House is in Sarasota, Florida, which is on the Gulf Coast of

      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Lemon.

      Lake Lemon is located in southern Indiana, near Bloomington, Indiana.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Indiana is significantly north of Florida in the United States. Indiana is in
      the Midwest region, while Florida is one of the southernmost states in the continental
      US.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Sarasota, Florida is much further south than any location in Indiana,
      the Sarasota Opera House is indeed south of Lake Lemon.
