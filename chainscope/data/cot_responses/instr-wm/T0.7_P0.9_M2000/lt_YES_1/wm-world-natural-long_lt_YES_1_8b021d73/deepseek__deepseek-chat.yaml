      \ step to determine whether Lake Morat is located west of Lac de Champex.\n\n\
      ### 1. Identify the Locations\nFirst, I need to identify where Lake Morat and\
      \ Lac de Champex are located.\n\n- **Lake Morat**: I recall that Lake Morat\
      \ is one of the three main lakes in the region of the Three Lakes in Switzerland.\
      \ It's situated in the canton of Fribourg.\n  \n- **Lac de Champex**: I believe\
      \ Lac de Champex is a smaller lake located in the Swiss Alps, specifically in\
      \ the canton of Valais.\n\n### 2. Understanding the Geography\nNext, I need\
      \ to understand the relative positions of these two lakes in Switzerland.\n\n\
      - **Canton of Fribourg**: This is in the western part of Switzerland, not too\
      \ far from the French border.\n  \n- **Canton of Valais**: This is in the southwestern\
      \ part of Switzerland, bordering France and Italy, and is known for its alpine\
      \ landscapes.\n\n### 3. Determining the Directions\nNow, to figure out if Lake\
      \ Morat is west of Lac de Champex, I need to consider the general east-west\
      \ orientation of these two locations.\n\n- **Lake Morat** is in the western\
      \ part of Switzerland.\n  \n- **Lac de Champex** is further south but also in\
      \ the western part, though it's more towards the Swiss-French border in the\
      \ Alps.\n\n### 4. Visualizing the Map\nTo better understand, I'll try to visualize\
      \ a map of Switzerland.\n\n- **Zurich** is in the northeast, **Bern** is in\
      \ the central-west, and **Geneva** is in the southwest.\n  \n- **Lake Morat**\
      \ is near **Bern**, which is west of **Zurich** but east of **Geneva**.\n  \n\
      - **Lac de Champex** is near **Martigny** in the canton of Valais, which is\
      \ southwest of **Bern**.\n\n### 5. Comparing the Positions\nFrom this visualization:\n\
      \n- **Lake Morat** is east of **Lac de Champex** because **Lac de Champex**\
      \ is further to the west towards the French border.\n\n### 6. Conclusion\nBased\
      \ on this reasoning, Lake Morat is **not** located west of Lac de Champex. Instead,\
      \ it is situated to the east of Lac de Champex.\n\n**Final Answer:** NO"

      New South Wales, Australia. This requires knowledge of the geographical locations
      of both Glenrock Lagoon and Port Stephens.


      **Step 1: Locate Port Stephens on a Map**

      Port Stephens is a large natural harbor located in the Hunter Region of New
      South Wales, Australia. It is situated about 230 kilometers (140 miles) north
      of Sydney. Port Stephens is known for its beautiful beaches, marine life, and
      tourist attractions.


      **Step 2: Locate Glenrock Lagoon on a Map**

      Glenrock Lagoon is a coastal lagoon located in the suburb of Dudley, near Newcastle,
      New South Wales. It is part of the Glenrock State Conservation Area, which is
      popular for its walking tracks, beaches, and natural beauty.


      **Step 3: Determine the Relative Positions**

      To determine if Glenrock Lagoon is west of Port Stephens, we need to compare
      their geographical coordinates or positions on a map. Port Stephens is located
      to the north of Newcastle, while Glenrock Lagoon is situated south of Newcastle,
      near the coastline.

      \ Is Atlin Lake located west of Teslin Lake?\n\nTo answer this, I need to:\n\
      \n1. **Identify the locations of Atlin Lake and Teslin Lake.**\n2. **Determine\
      \ their relative positions concerning each other, specifically if Atlin Lake\
      \ is west of Teslin Lake.**\n3. **Conclude with a clear YES or NO based on the\
      \ findings.**\n\n### Step 1: Identifying the Locations of Atlin Lake and Teslin\
      \ Lake\n\n**Atlin Lake:**\n- Atlin Lake is the largest natural lake in the Canadian\
      \ province of British Columbia.\n- It is located in the northwestern part of\
      \ British Columbia, near the border with the Yukon Territory.\n- The town of\
      \ Atlin is situated at the southern end of the lake.\n\n**Teslin Lake:**\n-\
      \ Teslin Lake is a large lake that spans the border between British Columbia\
      \ and the Yukon Territory.\n- It is located further north and slightly east\
      \ compared to Atlin Lake.\n- The village of Teslin is located on the northern\
      \ shore of the lake in the Yukon.\n\n### Step 2: Determining Their Relative\
      \ Positions\n\nTo determine if Atlin Lake is west of Teslin Lake, I need to\
      \ compare their longitudinal positions.\n\n**Longitude Basics:**\n- Longitude\
      \ lines run north-south and measure distance east or west of the Prime Meridian\
      \ (0\xB0 longitude).\n- Locations with higher longitude values (east) are further\
      \ east, and those with lower values (west) are further west.\n\n**Locating Atlin\
      \ Lake:**\n- Atlin Lake is approximately at a longitude of around 133\xB030'\
      \ W.\n  \n**Locating Teslin Lake:**\n- Teslin Lake is approximately at a longitude\
      \ of around 132\xB030' W.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- Atlin Lake: 133\xB030' W\n-\
      \ Teslin Lake: 132\xB030' W\n\nSince 133\xB030' W is further west than 132\xB0\
      30' W, Atlin Lake is west of Teslin Lake.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nBased\
      \ on the longitudinal comparison:\n\n- **Atlin Lake is located at approximately\
      \ 133\xB030' W.**\n- **Teslin Lake is located at approximately 132\xB030' W.**\n\

      1. **Locate the Caspian Sea**: The Caspian Sea is the largest inland body of
      water in the world, bordered by countries such as Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan,
      Iran, and Azerbaijan. It is situated in the western part of Asia, near the border

      \ by step to determine whether M\xE4laren is located west of Blue Lake in Croatia.\n\
      \n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\n**M\xE4laren:**\n- M\xE4laren is a large\
      \ lake in Sweden. It is situated in the eastern part of the country, near the\
      \ capital city, Stockholm.\n\n**Blue Lake (Croatia):**\n- Blue Lake, also known\
      \ as Modro Jezero, is a lake located in the town of Imotski in Croatia. It is\
      \ in the southern part of Croatia, near the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\
      \n### Step 2: Determine the Geographic Coordinates\n\nTo accurately determine\
      \ the relative positions, we'll look at the approximate geographic coordinates\
      \ of both locations.\n\n**M\xE4laren:**\n- Latitude: Approximately 59.5\xB0\
      \ N\n- Longitude: Approximately 17.5\xB0 E\n\n**Blue Lake (Croatia):**\n- Latitude:\
      \ Approximately 43.4\xB0 N\n- Longitude: Approximately 17.2\xB0 E\n\n### Step\
      \ 3: Compare the Longitudes\n\nLongitude measures how far east or west a location\
      \ is from the prime meridian (0\xB0 longitude). A higher longitude value indicates\
      \ a position further east, while a lower value indicates a position further\
      \ west.\n\n- M\xE4laren: 17.5\xB0 E\n- Blue Lake: 17.2\xB0 E\n\n### Step 4:\
      \ Analyze the Results\n\nComparing the longitudes:\n- M\xE4laren has a longitude\
      \ of 17.5\xB0 E.\n- Blue Lake has a longitude of 17.2\xB0 E.\n\nSince 17.5\xB0\
      \ E is greater than 17.2\xB0 E, M\xE4laren is further east than Blue Lake.\n\
      \n### Step 5: Determine Relative Position\n\nIf M\xE4laren is further east,\
      \ then it cannot be west of Blue Lake. Therefore, M\xE4laren is located to the\
      \ east of Blue Lake in Croatia.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the geographic\
      \ coordinates and the comparison of longitudes, M\xE4laren is not located west\
      \ of Blue Lake in Croatia.\n\n**Final Answer:** NO"
