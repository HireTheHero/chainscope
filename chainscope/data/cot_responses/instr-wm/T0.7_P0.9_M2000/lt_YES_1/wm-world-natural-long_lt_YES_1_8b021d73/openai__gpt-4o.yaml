      west of Barbee Lake, we''ll need to analyze the geographical locations of both
      places.


      1. **Locate Mount Shinn:** Mount Shinn is a peak in Antarctica, specifically
      in the Ellsworth Mountains. It is one of the notable peaks in the continent''s
      central range.


      2. **Locate Barbee Lake:** Barbee Lake refers to a lake located in the United
      States, specifically in Indiana. It is part of a chain of small lakes in the
      northern part of the state.


      3. **Determine relative positions:** Given that Mount Shinn is in Antarctica
      and Barbee Lake is in Indiana, USA, we must assess their longitudinal positions.
      Antarctica is located at the southern pole of the Earth, and its peaks like
      Mount Shinn are significantly south of any location in the United States. However,
      when considering the longitudinal (east-west) position, Indiana is located in
      the northern hemisphere in the western part of the globe.


      4. **Conclusion:** The Ellsworth Mountains, where Mount Shinn is located, are
      positioned at a longitude that is generally considered east of the United States''
      central longitudinal line.


      Therefore, Mount Shinn is not located west of Barbee Lake.

      - Lake Titicaca is located in the southern part of Peru and extends into Bolivia.
      It is positioned in the high Andes in the southeastern part of Peru.

      - Lake Sandoval is located in the southeastern jungle region of Peru, which
      is east of the Andes Mountain range.


      Given these locations, Lake Titicaca is situated to the west of Lake Sandoval.

      and coral reefs and is part of the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, which is along
      the coast of the Indian Ocean.


      2. **Location of Lake Sibhayi:** Lake Sibhayi, also known as Sibaya, is the
      largest freshwater lake in South Africa and is also located in the KwaZulu-Natal
      province. It is situated inland, near the coast, but not directly on it.


      3. **Relative Positioning:** Sodwana Bay is directly on the coast, while Lake
      Sibhayi is inland from the coast. When comparing their relative positions, Lake
      Sibhayi is located to the southwest of Sodwana Bay.

      4. Considering the longitudinal positioning: In terms of longitude, any location

      3. **Determine the relative positions of the two locations:** Saskatchewan is
      north of the United States, and the La Plata Mountains are in the southwestern
      part of Colorado. Jackfish Lake, being in central Saskatchewan, would be to
      the north and somewhat east of the La Plata Mountains, which are in the southwestern

      - Jinan (where Daming Lake is located) is situated in the eastern part of China.

      - Inner Mongolia (where Hulun Lake is located) is generally to the north and
      slightly west of Shandong Province.


      Given this information, Daming Lake, being in Jinan, Shandong, is located to
      the east of Hulun Lake in Inner Mongolia.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Daming Lake is not located west of Hulun Lake.'

      1. **Location of Daming Lake:** Daming Lake is located in Jinan, which is the
      capital city of Shandong Province in eastern China.


      2. **Location of Hulun Lake:** Hulun Lake, also known as Dalai Lake, is located
      in the northeastern part of Inner Mongolia, China.


      3. **Comparison of Longitudes:** Generally, Shandong Province is situated to
      the east of Inner Mongolia. Therefore, Jinan (where Daming Lake is located)
      is east of the region where Hulun Lake is located.
