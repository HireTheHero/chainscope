      Jeff Daniels. A quick search reveals it was released in **2002**.

      2.  **"Bob Clampett''s Porky & Friends: Hilarious Ham"**: This sounds like a
      compilation of classic animated shorts. Bob Clampett was a famous animator and
      director for Warner Bros. Looney Tunes, particularly active with characters
      like Porky Pig in the late **1930s and 1940s**. For example, "Porky in Wackyland"

      "Hilarious Ham" might have a later specific *compilation* release date (e.g.,
      on VHS or DVD), the *content* it refers to (Bob Clampett''s Porky shorts) is
      from that earlier era. The question implies the original material''s era.
