      1. First, I''ll locate Mount Auburn, IL on a map

      2. Then I''ll locate Wausau, WI on the same map

      3. I''ll determine their relative north-south positions


      Checking geographical locations:

      - Mount Auburn is in Illinois

      - Wausau is in Wisconsin

      - Illinois is generally south of Wisconsin


      So by comparing their state locations, Mount Auburn, IL is indeed south of Wausau,
