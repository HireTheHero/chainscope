      1) First, I''ll identify the locations:

      - Tavares is in Florida

      - Mauricetown is in New Jersey


      2) Florida and New Jersey are both on the East Coast of the US

      - Mauricetown, NJ is located on the eastern side of New Jersey

      - Tavares, FL is located in central Florida

      - Mauricetown, NJ is very close to the Atlantic coast

      - Tavares, FL is more inland in central Florida

      - Florida as a whole is actually slightly west of New Jersey


      6) Therefore, Tavares, being in central Florida, is indeed west of Mauricetown,

      2) To determine which is further west, I need to compare their relative positions:

      - Boyes Hot Springs, being near San Francisco, is on the Pacific coast

      - Murray, being near Salt Lake City, is in the interior of the country


      3) California''s Pacific coast is always west of Utah

      - California is the westernmost continental state

      - Utah is several states inland from the Pacific


      4) Therefore, since Boyes Hot Springs is in California near the coast, and Murray
      is in Utah, Boyes Hot Springs must be further west.
