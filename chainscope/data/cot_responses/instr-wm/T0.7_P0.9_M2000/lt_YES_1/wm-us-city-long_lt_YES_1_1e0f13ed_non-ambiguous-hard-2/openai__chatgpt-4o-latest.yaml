      of both cities. Longitude determines how far east or west a place is, with more
      negative values (in the Western Hemisphere) indicating a location further west.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Rio Rancho, NM.

      - Rio Rancho is in central New Mexico, near Albuquerque.

      - The approximate longitude of Rio Rancho is about -106.7 degrees.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Escobares, TX.

      - The approximate longitude of Escobares is about -98.7 degrees.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes.

      - Rio Rancho: ~ -106.7

      - Escobares: ~ -98.7


      Since -106.7 is more negative than -98.7, Rio Rancho is further west than Escobares.

      Arkansas.

      the United States.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions

      Missouri is west of Ohio in terms of general geography. Cassville, being in
      southwestern Missouri, is even further west than, say, central Missouri.


      Crystal Lakes, even though it''s in western Ohio, is still east of the entire
