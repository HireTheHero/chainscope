      is north of Clarksville City, which is situated in Texas.


      5. **Assess the westward position**: For one place to be west of another, it
      must be at a lesser longitude. Since Morrill is in Nebraska (which is generally
      further north but also has western longitudes compared to eastern Texas), we
