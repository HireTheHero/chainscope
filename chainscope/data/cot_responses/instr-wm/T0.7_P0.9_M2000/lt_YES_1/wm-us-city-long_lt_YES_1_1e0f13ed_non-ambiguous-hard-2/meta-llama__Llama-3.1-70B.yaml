      1. **Identify the locations**: Talco, TX, is a city located in Texas, while
      White Pigeon, MI, is a city located in Michigan.


      2. **Determine the relative positions**: Texas is generally located in the southern
      and western part of the United States, while Michigan is in the northern and
      eastern part. This means that Texas is generally west of Michigan.


      3. **Consider the specific locations**: While Talco, TX, is in Texas, it is
      not necessarily the westernmost city in Texas. Similarly, White Pigeon, MI,
      is in Michigan, but it may not be the easternmost city in Michigan.


      4. **Evaluate the question**: The question asks whether Talco, TX, is located
      west of White Pigeon, MI. Since Texas is generally west of Michigan, and Talco
      is in Texas, it is likely that Talco is located west of White Pigeon, which
      is in Michigan.

      2. **Understand the geographic relationship**: Wisconsin is generally considered

      2. **Understand the geography**: Arkansas is generally west of Florida in the
      United States.

      3. **Compare the locations**: Since Mayflower is in Arkansas and Fruitland Park
      is in Florida, and Arkansas is west of Florida, we can infer that Mayflower

      1. **Identify the locations**: Crystal Lake, IL, is a city in Illinois, and
      Adelphi, MD, is a town in Maryland.

      2. **Understand the relative east-west positions**: Illinois is generally west
      of Maryland. This means that locations in Illinois, including Crystal Lake,
      are typically west of locations in Maryland, including Adelphi.

      3. **Confirm with specific locations**: Crystal Lake, IL, has a longitude of
      approximately -88.32 degrees west. Adelphi, MD, has a longitude of approximately
      -76.98 degrees west.

      4. **Compare longitudes**: Since -88.32 degrees west is further west than -76.98
      degrees west, we can confirm that Crystal Lake, IL, is indeed west of Adelphi,
      MD.

      5. **Determine the answer**: Based on the relative positions of the states and
      the specific longitudes, we can conclude that Crystal Lake, IL, is located west
      of Adelphi, MD.
