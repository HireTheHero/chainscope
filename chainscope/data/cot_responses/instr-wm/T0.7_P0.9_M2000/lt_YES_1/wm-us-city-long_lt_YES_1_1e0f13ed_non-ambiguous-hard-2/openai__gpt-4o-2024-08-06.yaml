      2. **Identify the location of Noank, CT**: Noank is a village in the town of
      Groton in New London County, Connecticut. Connecticut is located in the northeastern
      region of the United States.


      3. **Compare the longitudes**: Generally, locations in the southeastern United
      States (like North Carolina) are west of locations in the northeastern United
      States (like Connecticut) because the eastern seaboard of the U.S. runs roughly
      north-south.


      Since North Carolina is typically west of Connecticut, Vander, NC is indeed
      located west of Noank, CT.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
