      Washington State is on the Pacific coast. Idaho is an inland state, located
      directly east of Washington.

      2.  **Consider the general location of Anacortes, WA.** Anacortes is in northwestern
      Washington, on Fidalgo Island, near the Puget Sound and the Salish Sea. This
      places it quite far west within Washington.

      3.  **Consider the general location of Council, ID.** Council is in west-central
      Idaho, not far from the Oregon border (which is west of Idaho).

      4.  **Compare the longitudes.** Since Washington State is entirely west of Idaho,
      and Anacortes is in the western part of Washington, it will be west of any location
