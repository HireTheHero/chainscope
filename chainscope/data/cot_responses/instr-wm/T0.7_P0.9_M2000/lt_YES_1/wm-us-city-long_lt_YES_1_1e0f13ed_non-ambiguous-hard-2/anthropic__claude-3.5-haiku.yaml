    db755a67-1906-41fc-ba3e-d4e19858c190: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Pickensville, Alabama on a map

      - Pickensville is in Pickens County, in western Alabama

      - It is near the Mississippi border


      2. Next, I''ll locate Ellenboro, North Carolina on a map

      - Ellenboro is in Rutherford County, in western North Carolina


      3. Compare their geographical positions

      - Alabama is west of North Carolina

      - So a city in Alabama will generally be west of a city in North Carolina


      4. Therefore, Pickensville, AL is west of Ellenboro, NC.


      Answer: YES'

      1. First, I need to know the locations of Tavares, FL and Mauricetown, NJ.


      2. Tavares is located in Lake County, Florida, which is in the central part
      of the state.


      3. Mauricetown is located in Cumberland County, New Jersey, which is in the
      southern part of the state, near the Atlantic coast.


      4. Florida is located west of New Jersey.


      5. Since Tavares, FL is in Florida and Mauricetown, NJ is in New Jersey, Tavares
      is indeed west of Mauricetown.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
