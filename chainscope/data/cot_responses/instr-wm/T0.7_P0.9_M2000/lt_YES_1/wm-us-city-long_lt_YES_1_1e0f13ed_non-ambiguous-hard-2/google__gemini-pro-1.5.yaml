      States.

      3. Generally, locations further west have higher longitudinal coordinates.  Since
      both locations are on the East Coast, the question is whether Folly Beach is
      further inland/west than Lake Hiawatha.

      4. South Carolina is south of New Jersey.  Folly Beach being further south does
      not necessarily mean it''s further west.

      5. Looking at a map clarifies this.  The East Coast runs roughly north-south.
      Folly Beach, while further south, is still on the coast and therefore east of
      any inland location in New Jersey like Lake Hiawatha.
