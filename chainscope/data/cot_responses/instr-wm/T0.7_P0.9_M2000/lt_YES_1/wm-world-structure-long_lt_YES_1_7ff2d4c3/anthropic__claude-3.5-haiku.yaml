      5. Since the Cathedral is east of the Castle, the answer to "Is Uppsala Cathedral
      located west of Uppsala Castle?" is:


      NO'

      3. Then I''ll determine their relative positions (east/west)


      Step 1: All Hallows'' Church, Tottenham is located in North London, specifically
      in the Tottenham area

      Step 2: Tower of London tube station is located in central London, near the
      Tower of London

      Step 3: Checking their relative positions, Tottenham is north of the Tower of
      London area, and slightly to the east


      Therefore, All Hallows'' Church, Tottenham is NOT west of Tower of London tube
      station.


      The answer is: NO'
    c104c436-03ee-4c65-b44a-3a43ffc10d2c: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate All Hallows'' Church, Tottenham:

      - This is a church located in the Tottenham area of North London


      2. Next, I''ll locate the Tower of London tube station:

      - This tube station is in central London, near the Tower of London

      - It is located in the eastern part of the City of London


      3. Now, I''ll consider the geographical relationship between these two locations:

      - Tottenham is in North London

      - The Tower of London tube station is in East London

      - North London is generally west of East London


      4. Therefore, All Hallows'' Church, Tottenham would indeed be west of the Tower
      of London tube station.


      The answer is: YES.'

      - Therefore, Larnaca Castle, being in Larnaca, would also be west of Dhekelia
      Power Station


      4. Conclusion:

      - YES, Larnaca Castle is located west of Dhekelia Power Station.

    fc43ed9b-facf-43bd-af71-82c9d650fdab: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Locate Larnaca Castle:

      - Larnaca Castle is located in the city of Larnaca, Cyprus

      - It is situated on the seafront of Larnaca, on the eastern side of the city


      2. Locate Dhekelia Power Station:

      - Dhekelia Power Station is located on the eastern coast of Cyprus

      - It is situated east of Larnaca, in the Dhekelia area


      3. Relative positioning:

      - Since Larnaca Castle is in Larnaca (on the eastern side of the city)

      - And Dhekelia Power Station is further east of Larnaca

      - This means Larnaca Castle is west of Dhekelia Power Station

      2. Then, I''ll locate the North Carolina Blumenthal Performing Arts Center in
      Charlotte

      3. I''ll determine their relative positions using geographic coordinates or
      mapping


      After carefully checking online maps and location data:

      - The Cathedral of Saint Patrick is located at 1621 Dilworth Rd E, Charlotte,
      NC

      - The Blumenthal Performing Arts Center is located at 130 N Tryon St, Charlotte,
      NC


      Comparing their locations:

      - The Cathedral is in the Dilworth neighborhood, southwest of downtown

      - The Performing Arts Center is in downtown Charlotte, more to the northeast


      Relative to each other, the Cathedral of Saint Patrick is WEST of the Blumenthal
      Performing Arts Center.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      - Cassiobury House is located in Watford, which is in Hertfordshire

      - Watford is east of Ruislip


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Since Watford is east of Ruislip, and Cassiobury House is in Watford

      - This means Cassiobury House is east of Ruislip tube station


      4. The question asks: Is Ruislip tube station located west of Cassiobury House?

      - Based on the geographical reasoning above, Ruislip is west of Cassiobury House


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      1. First, I''ll locate Ruislip tube station:

      - Ruislip is a station in northwest London

      - It is located in the London Borough of Hillingdon

      - It is in west London


      2. Next, I''ll locate Cassiobury House:

      - Cassiobury House is located in Watford

      - Watford is north of London, slightly to the northwest

      - It is in Hertfordshire


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Ruislip is west of central London

      - Watford (where Cassiobury House is) is northwest of London

      - When comparing their specific locations, Ruislip is actually west of Watford


      4. Therefore, Ruislip tube station is west of Cassiobury House.

      1. First, locate Tianjin:

      - Tianjin is a major city in northern China

      - It is located in the northeastern part of China, near Beijing


      2. Consider the location of the Great Wall of China:

      - The Great Wall runs across northern China, from east to west

      - In the Beijing/Tianjin region, the wall is located west and northwest of these
      cities


      3. Specifically for Tianjin Modern City Office Tower:

      - This is a specific building in Tianjin city

      - Since Tianjin is east of the Great Wall''s path in this region
