      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Belvedere railway station and Barnehurst railway station. Belvedere railway
      station is located in the London Borough of Bexley, in southeast London, England.
      Barnehurst railway station is also in the London Borough of Bexley, but it''s
      located in Barnehurst, which is a suburb of London.


      2. **Determine Directions**: Next, we need to understand the directional layout
      of London. Generally, London''s areas can be divided into North, South, East,
      and West, with the River Thames running through the city roughly from west to
      east. Southeast London, where Belvedere and Barnehurst are located, is south
      of the River Thames.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Belvedere railway station is in the London Borough
      of Bexley, which is in southeast London. Barnehurst railway station is also
      in the London Borough of Bexley, but it''s located in Barnehurst, a suburb of
      London in the same borough. Both stations are in the same general area, southeast
      London.


      4. **East-West Orientation**: To determine if Belvedere railway station is west
      of Barnehurst railway station, we need to consider their east-west orientation
      relative to each other. Since both stations are in the same general area (southeast
      London) and within the same borough (Bexley), their east-west orientation would
      be very close.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Belvedere railway station and Barnehurst railway

      and considering the general layout of London, it''s likely that Belvedere railway
      station is not significantly west of Barnehurst railway station. They are likely
      in a similar east-west position, being in the same general area of southeast
      London.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Thames Ditton railway station is located in the
      town of Thames Ditton, in the Elmbridge borough of Surrey, England. Harrow-on-the-Hill
      station is in Harrow, in the London Borough of Harrow, England.


      2. **Consider the general layout of London and its suburbs**: London is a vast
      city with many suburbs and surrounding towns. Generally, the western part of
      London and its surrounding areas are considered to be west of the central parts
      of London.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Thames Ditton is located southwest
      of central London, while Harrow-on-the-Hill is in the northwest part of Greater
      London.


      4. **Consider the east-west orientation**: Given that Thames Ditton is southwest
      and Harrow-on-the-Hill is northwest, when looking from central London, Thames
      Ditton would be more to the southwest, while Harrow-on-the-Hill would be more
      to the northwest.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the relative positions and considering the general
      layout of London and its suburbs, Thames Ditton railway station would be southwest
      or south of Harrow-on-the-Hill station. Therefore, Thames Ditton railway station
      is not located west of Harrow-on-the-Hill station.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      is located in the Elmbridge district of Surrey, England. Harrow-on-the-Hill
      station is in the London Borough of Harrow, Greater London.

      boroughs, and the city''s areas can be broadly divided into North, South, East,
      and West.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Harrow-on-the-Hill station is in the London Borough
      of Harrow, which is in the northwest part of Greater London. Thames Ditton,
      being in Surrey, is south of London.


      4. **East-West Orientation**: To determine if Thames Ditton railway station
      is west of Harrow-on-the-Hill station, we need to consider their east-west orientation

      is generally understood in terms of the cardinal directions (north, south, east,
      and west). For this question, we''re interested in the east-west relationship.


      4. **Determine east and west**: Japan (where Inunaki Dam is) is generally east
      of Australia (where Darwin is). However, specific locations within these countries
      can vary significantly in terms of east-west orientation.


      5. **Consider the specific locations**: Inunaki Dam is in Kagoshima Prefecture,
      which is in southern Japan. Darwin is in the Northern Territory of Australia,
      which is in the northern part of the country.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given that Japan (where Inunaki Dam is) is east of Australia
      (where Darwin is), and considering the general layout of the Earth, Inunaki
      Dam would not be west of St Mary''s Star of the Sea Cathedral, Darwin, but rather
      east or northeast.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      Church, Tottenham, is located in Tottenham, which is in the north of London,
      England. The Tower of London tube station is located in the City of London,
      which is in central London.


      2. **Determine the relative positions**: To determine if All Hallows'' Church,

    6ed3f55e-8496-45bb-aaf6-8f8a162d5ceb: 'To determine whether Leicester Square tube
      station is located west of Southgate tube station, we need to consider their
      locations within the London Underground system. Here are the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Leicester Square tube station is located in the
      West End of London, near the intersection of Charing Cross Road and Cranbourn
      Street. Southgate tube station is in the London Borough of Enfield, in the northern
      part of London.


      2. **Consider the London Underground map**: The London Underground, or the Tube,
      is a vast network of underground and overground rail lines. Each line has a
      specific color, and stations are connected by these lines.


      3. **Find the lines connecting the stations**: Leicester Square tube station
      is on the Northern line (black) and the Piccadilly line (dark blue). Southgate
      tube station is also on the Piccadilly line (dark blue).


      4. **Trace the Piccadilly line**: The Piccadilly line runs from the west of
      London (Heathrow Airport) to the east (Cockfosters). Leicester Square is towards
      the western part of the line, while Southgate is towards the eastern part.


      5. **Determine the direction**: Since Leicester Square is towards the western
      part of the Piccadilly line and Southgate is towards the eastern part, Leicester
      Square tube station is west of Southgate tube station.


      Based on the above analysis, the answer to the question "Is Leicester Square
      tube station located west of Southgate tube station?" is: $\boxed{YES}$

      the locations of both Down Street tube station and Clapham South tube station.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      stations. Down Street tube station is located in the Mayfair area of London,
      and Clapham South tube station is in the Clapham area of London.


      2. **Determine Directions**: Next, we need to understand the directional layout
      of London. Generally, London''s areas can be divided into North, South, East,
      and West, with the River Thames running through the city roughly from west to
      east. Mayfair is in central London, and Clapham is in South London.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Down Street tube station is in central London, specifically
      in the Mayfair area. Clapham South tube station is in South London, specifically
      in the Clapham area.


      4. **East-West Orientation**: To determine if Down Street tube station is located
      west of Clapham South tube station, we need to consider their east-west orientation
      relative to each other. Mayfair (where Down Street tube station is located)
      is generally in the central-west part of London, while Clapham is in the south-central

      is an area of Belfast known for its arts, culture, and historic architecture.


      4. **Determine Tribeca Belfast''s Location**: Tribeca Belfast''s exact location
      within Belfast would be necessary to determine its position relative to St Anne''s
      Cathedral. Without more specific information, it''s challenging to determine

      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the available information, it''s not possible to
      definitively say if Tribeca Belfast is located west of St Anne''s Cathedral,
      Belfast. It would require more specific details about Tribeca Belfast''s location
      within Belfast to make a determination.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Saint
      Gregory the Great Parish Church (Indang) and Santiago Apostol Church (Plaridel).
      Saint Gregory the Great Parish Church is located in Indang, Cavite, Philippines.
      Santiago Apostol Church is in Plaridel, Bulacan, Philippines.


      2. **Determine Relative Positions**: To determine if Saint Gregory the Great
      Parish Church (Indang) is located west of Santiago Apostol Church (Plaridel),
      we need to consider their positions relative to each other and to notable landmarks
      or the geographical layout of the region.


      3. **Geographical Context**: Both Indang and Plaridel are located in the Philippines.
      The Philippines is an archipelago consisting of thousands of islands in Southeast
      Asia. The country is generally oriented from north to south, with the western
      coast facing the South China Sea and the eastern coast facing the Pacific Ocean.


      4. **Consider Cardinal Directions**: In the Philippines, cardinal directions
      are generally used to describe locations. "West" typically refers to the direction
      towards the western coast of the Philippines, which faces the South China Sea.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical context and the relative positions
      of Indang and Plaridel within the Philippines, it''s likely that Saint Gregory
      the Great Parish Church (Indang) is located west of Santiago Apostol Church
      (Plaridel). This is because Indang is situated more towards the western part
      of the Philippines, while Plaridel is in the central region, making it less
      likely to be west of Indang.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Saint Gregory the Great Parish Church
      (Indang) is located west of Santiago Apostol Church (Plaridel) is: $\boxed{YES}$

      4. **East-West Orientation**: To determine if Ruislip tube station is located
      west of Cassiobury House, we need to consider their east-west orientation relative
      to each other. Ruislip is northwest of central London, while Watford (where
      Cassiobury House was) is north of central London but more to the east.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Ruislip (where the tube station is) is northwest
      and Watford (where Cassiobury House was) is north but east of central London,
      Ruislip tube station would not be west of Cassiobury House but rather southwest
      or south of it.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Ruislip tube station is located
      west of Cassiobury House is: $\boxed{NO}$

    92a65c0c-1f11-48a5-b1af-90e0d4ff2345: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of St Dunstan-in-the-West
      and Palmers Green railway station. St Dunstan-in-the-West is a church located
      in the City of London, while Palmers Green railway station is in the London
      Borough of Enfield, which is in North London.


      2. **Determine Directions**: Next, we need to understand the directional layout
      of London. London is generally divided into North, South, East, and West, with
      the River Thames running through the city roughly from west to east. The City
      of London, where St Dunstan-in-the-West is located, is in the central part of
      the city, and the London Borough of Enfield, where Palmers Green railway station
      is, is in the northern part of the city.


      3. **Compare Locations**: St Dunstan-in-the-West is located in the City of London,
      which is more towards the central part of the city. Palmers Green railway station
      is in North London, which is north of the River Thames and north of the City
      of London.


      4. **East-West Orientation**: To determine if St Dunstan-in-the-West is located
      west of Palmers Green railway station, we need to consider their east-west orientation
      relative to each other. The City of London, where St Dunstan-in-the-West is
      located, is generally more towards the east-central part of London. Palmers
      Green is in the northern part of the city.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that the City of London (where St Dunstan-in-the-West
      is) is east-central and Palmers Green (where the railway station is) is in the
      northern part of the city, St Dunstan-in-the-West would not be west of Palmers
      Green railway station but rather southeast or east of it.

      the borough of Bromley.


      5. **Relative Positions**: Based on their locations, Kings Arms, Woolwich, is
      located to the east of Chislehurst railway station. This is because Chislehurst
      is more to the west in the southeastern part of London.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical layout of London and the positions
      of Kings Arms, Woolwich, and Chislehurst railway station, Kings Arms, Woolwich,
      is not located west of Chislehurst railway station but rather to the east.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Kings Arms, Woolwich, is located
      west of Chislehurst railway station is: **NO**'
    8b7eca40-c8e1-4f52-8b42-e1bffe5ccf5c: 'To answer this question, let''s follow
      these steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the Kings Arms, Woolwich, and Chislehurst railway station. The Kings Arms, Woolwich,
      is located in Woolwich, London, UK. Chislehurst railway station is also located
      in London, UK.


      2. **Determine Directions**: Next, we need to understand the directional layout
      of London. Generally, London''s areas can be divided into North, South, East,
      and West, with the River Thames running through the city roughly from west to
      east. North London is, as the name suggests, north of the River Thames, and
      South London is south of it.


      3. **Compare Locations**: The Kings Arms, Woolwich, is located in South London,
      placing it south of the River Thames. Chislehurst railway station is also in
      South London, which places it south of the River Thames as well.


      4. **East-West Orientation**: To determine if the Kings Arms, Woolwich, is west
      of Chislehurst railway station, we need to consider their east-west orientation
      relative to each other. Woolwich is generally southeast of central London, while
      Chislehurst is more southeast as well.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Woolwich (where the Kings Arms is located) is
      southeast and Chislehurst railway station is also southeast, the Kings Arms,
      Woolwich, would not be west of Chislehurst railway station but rather south
      or southeast of it.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether the Kings Arms, Woolwich, is located
      west of Chislehurst railway station is: **NO**'

    c5f36d87-3a6d-421f-9b4b-f7d9ce4ba72a: 'To answer this question, I''ll need to
      consider the locations of both the Garissa Solar Power Station and the Rostov
      State Musical Theater.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Garissa Solar Power Station is located in Garissa,
      Kenya, in East Africa. Rostov State Musical Theater is located in Rostov-on-Don,
      Russia, in Eastern Europe.


      2. **Relative positions**: To determine if Garissa Solar Power Station is located
      west of Rostov State Musical Theater, we need to consider their positions relative
      to each other and to notable landmarks or the Earth''s surface.


      3. **East-West orientation**: Since these locations are in different continents,
      we need to consider their positions relative to the Earth''s east-west orientation.


      4. **Africa and Europe**: Africa, where Garissa is located, is generally south
      of Europe, where Rostov-on-Don is located. However, within these continents,
      there can be variations in east-west positions.


      5. **Africa''s east-west position**: Within Africa, Kenya, where Garissa is
      located, is in the eastern part of the continent.


      6. **Europe''s east-west position**: Within Europe, Rostov-on-Don, where the
      Rostov State Musical Theater is located, is in the southern part of Russia,
      which is in the eastern part of Europe.


      7. **Conclusion**: Given that Garissa, Kenya, is in the eastern part of Africa
      and Rostov-on-Don, Russia, is in the eastern part of Europe, it is challenging
      to determine a clear east-west relationship without more specific coordinates.
      However, considering the general layout of the continents, Garissa Solar Power
      Station is likely east of Rostov State Musical Theater, although they are not
      directly east-west of each other due to the curvature of the Earth and the distances
      involved.


      YES'

      2. **Determine the geographical positions**: Kenya is in eastern Africa, and
      Russia is in northern Eurasia. Garissa is in eastern Kenya, and Rostov-on-Don
      is in southern Russia.


      3. **Compare the east-west positions**: Considering the overall geography, eastern
      Kenya (where Garissa is located) is generally east of southern Russia (where
      Rostov-on-Don is located). However, the question specifically asks if Garissa
      Solar Power Station is west of Rostov State Musical Theater.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the general geography and the locations of Garissa

      \ east-west alignment rather than the north-south.\n\nConsidering these geographical\
      \ relationships, Kozienice Power Station, being in Poland, which is generally\
      \ to the north of Macedonia and considering its position relative to southwestern\
      \ Macedonia (Bitola), would indeed be more to the northwest of Bitola, Macedonia.\
      \ Thus, when considering a direct westward comparison, Kozienice Power Station\
      \ could be considered west or more accurately northwest of REK Bitola, depending\
      \ on the specific longitudinal alignment. However, given the simplified nature\
      \ of the question (YES or NO regarding being west), the intention seems to be\
      \ about a general directional relationship rather than precise geographical\
      \ coordinates.\n\nTherefore, considering the simplified directional context\

    f9665270-019b-46d0-926c-b757d706c7a7: 'To answer this question, we need to follow
      these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Kozienice Power Station and REK Bitola. Kozienice Power Station is located in
      Kozienice, Poland, while REK Bitola is located in Bitola, North Macedonia.


      2. **Determine the geographic positions**: Poland and North Macedonia are located
      in different regions of Europe. Poland is situated in Central Europe, while
      North Macedonia is located in the Balkans, which is in the southeast of Europe.


      3. **Compare the east-west positions**: Given the geographic positions of Poland
      and North Macedonia, we can determine their relative positions in terms of east
      and west. Poland is located further west compared to North Macedonia, which
      is situated more towards the southeast of Europe.


      4. **Conclusion**: Considering the locations and their geographic positions,
      Kozienice Power Station in Poland is located west of REK Bitola in North Macedonia.


      The answer is: $\boxed{YES}$

      Maryland, USA.


      2. **Relative positions**: To determine if White House (plantation) is west
      of AFI Silver, we need to consider their positions relative to each other and
      to notable landmarks or the city''s layout.


      3. **Geographic layout**: Maryland and Virginia are neighboring states in the
      United States. Maryland is to the north of Virginia, with the Potomac River
      forming part of the boundary between them.


      4. **Determining west**: Given that White House (plantation) is in Virginia
      and AFI Silver is in Maryland, and considering the geographic layout, we can
      determine their relative positions.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general layout of the states, Maryland is generally
      north of Virginia. However, the question asks if White House (plantation) is
      west of AFI Silver. To be west of something, it must be to the left when facing

      located in the United States, specifically in the southern states, while the
      AFI Silver is located in Silver Spring, Maryland, which is in the northeastern

      3. **Compare the east-west positions**: To determine if the White House plantation

      The southern states, where the White House plantation was located, are generally
      west of the northeastern states, including Maryland. However, the White House
      plantation could be in various southern states, and Maryland is relatively eastward
      in the northeastern region. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say that the White

    60b60039-0bc4-44ae-a750-2295bc5b1df7: 'To answer this question, I''ll need to
      consider the locations of Lake Winnibigoshish and Wright Patman Lake.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Lake Winnibigoshish is located in Minnesota,
      United States. Wright Patman Lake is also in the United States, specifically
      in Texas.


      2. **Relative positions**: To determine if Lake Winnibigoshish is west of Wright
      Patman Lake, we need to consider their positions relative to each other and
      to notable landmarks or the country''s layout.


      3. **United States layout and cardinal directions**: The United States is a
      large country with diverse geography. Generally, the country is divided into
      the West, Midwest, South, and East, with the Mississippi River serving as a
      rough divider between the eastern and western parts.


      4. **Determining west**: Given that Lake Winnibigoshish is in Minnesota and
      Wright Patman Lake is in Texas, both are relatively central but on different
      sides of the country. Minnesota is in the Midwest, and Texas is in the South.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general layout of the United States, Lake Winnibigoshish
      in Minnesota is likely west of Wright Patman Lake in Texas. However, this is
      a generalization, and the precise positions of these lakes would require a more
      detailed map or GPS coordinates.

      Church (Batangas) is located west of Ibaan Church, let''s follow these steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      churches. Saint Joseph the Patriarch Church is located in Batangas, Philippines.
      Ibaan Church, also known as St. James the Greater Parish Church, is in Ibaan,
      Batangas, Philippines.


      2. **Determine Relative Positions**: Both churches are in Batangas, which is
      a province in the Philippines. To determine if one is west of the other, we
      need to consider their positions within the province.


      3. **Consider the Geography of Batangas**: Batangas is a province on the island
      of Luzon in the Philippines. It''s located on the southwestern part of the island.
      The orientation of the province is such that the western part faces the South
      China Sea, while the eastern part faces the Verde Island Passage.


      4. **Specific Locations within Batangas**: Saint Joseph the Patriarch Church
      in Batangas is located in the town of Batangas City, which is in the central
      part of the province. Ibaan Church is in the town of Ibaan, which is also in
      the central part of the province, but slightly more towards the eastern side.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the relative positions of these two churches within
      the central part of Batangas, Saint Joseph the Patriarch Church in Batangas
      City is likely to be more towards the western part of the province when compared
      to Ibaan Church. This means that Saint Joseph the Patriarch Church is likely
      west of Ibaan Church.

      Hydroelectric Power Station is located in Uganda.


      2. **Consider the Geography**: Ukraine and Uganda are two different countries
      on different continents. Ukraine is in Eastern Europe, while Uganda is in East
      Africa.


      3. **Determine the Relative Positions**: Given that Ukraine and Uganda are on
      different continents, we need to consider their positions relative to each other
      and to the rest of the world.


      4. **Geographic Orientation**: Generally, when comparing locations, we use cardinal
      directions (north, south, east, west). However, in this case, the locations
      are on different continents, so a simple east-west comparison might not be straightforward.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of La Monnaie
      and the Church of Our Lady of Laeken. La Monnaie is an opera house located in
      Brussels, Belgium. The Church of Our Lady of Laeken is also in Brussels, specifically
      in the Laeken neighborhood.


      2. **Determine Directions**: Brussels is laid out with its city center roughly
      in the middle and various neighborhoods and districts surrounding it. The city
      is divided into 19 municipalities, including the City of Brussels and Laeken.


      3. **Compare Locations**: La Monnaie is in the City of Brussels, which is the
      central municipality. The Church of Our Lady of Laeken is in the Laeken neighborhood,
      which is in the northwest part of the city.


      4. **East-West Orientation**: To determine if La Monnaie is west of the Church
      of Our Lady of Laeken, we need to consider their east-west orientation relative
      to each other. The City of Brussels, where La Monnaie is located, is generally
      more towards the center and southeast of Laeken.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that La Monnaie is in the City of Brussels (more towards
      the southeast of Laeken) and the Church of Our Lady of Laeken is in Laeken (northwest),
      La Monnaie would not be west of the Church of Our Lady of Laeken but rather
      southeast.

      of Sri Lanka, facing the Indian Ocean. The city is generally laid out with the
      coastline running north-south.


      4. **Consider the cardinal directions**: To determine west, we need to consider
      the direction of the Indian Ocean from Colombo. The ocean is to the west of
      the city.


      5. **Determine the positions of the buildings**: Altitude (building) is located
      in Colombo''s central business district, which is closer to the coast. The Sri
      Lankan Parliament Building is located in Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, which is
      inland from Colombo''s central business district.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the general layout of Colombo and the relative positions
      of Altitude (building) and the Sri Lankan Parliament Building, Altitude (building)
      is closer to the coast and thus west of the Sri Lankan Parliament Building.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{YES}$

      located west of Strand Hotel, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      54 University Avenue and Strand Hotel. 54 University Avenue is an address, and
      Strand Hotel is a hotel. The question does not specify the city or country,
      so we need to make some assumptions.


      2. **Assumptions**: Since we don''t have specific locations, we''ll assume that
      these are in the same city. Let''s consider a generic city layout.


      3. **Determine Cardinal Directions**: In a typical city layout, avenues (like
      University Avenue) are often oriented north-south, while streets (like Strand
      Street) are oriented east-west. However, this is not always the case, and street
      names can vary.


      4. **Consider City Layout**: If we assume a typical city layout where avenues
      run north-south and streets run east-west, then 54 University Avenue would be
      more to the north or south of Strand Hotel, not west.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the information provided and making reasonable assumptions,
      54 University Avenue is likely not located west of Strand Hotel. It''s more
      likely to be north or south, depending on the city''s layout.
