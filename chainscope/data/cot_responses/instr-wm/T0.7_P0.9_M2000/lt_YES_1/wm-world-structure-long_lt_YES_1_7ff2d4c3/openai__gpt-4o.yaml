      1. Identify the railway line: Both Belvedere and Barnehurst stations are located
      on the North Kent Line in Southeast London.


      2. Determine the order of the stations on the line: The North Kent Line runs
      through a series of stations. Generally, the line runs from central London eastwards
      towards the Kent area.


      3. Check the relative positions: Starting from London, the order of stations
      is typically Woolwich Arsenal, Plumstead, Abbey Wood, Belvedere, Erith, Slade
      Green, and then Barnehurst.


      Based on this order, Belvedere railway station is located to the east of Barnehurst
      railway station.


      Therefore, the answer is NO. Belvedere railway station is not located west of
      Barnehurst railway station.'

      Sahuarita, Arizona, which is a town south of Tucson.


      3. **Determine the relative direction**: Since Tucson is north of Sahuarita,
      and the cathedral is in Tucson, this means the Cathedral of Saint Augustine
      is north of Sahuarita Lake.


      4. **Determine if the cathedral is west or east of Sahuarita Lake**: By looking
      at a map, Tucson (and thus the cathedral) is slightly to the east relative to
      Sahuarita Lake, as Sahuarita is closer to the western side of Tucson.


      Based on these steps, the Cathedral of Saint Augustine is actually located east
      of Sahuarita Lake.

      1. **Identify the location of the Azad Pattan Hydropower Project**: The Azad
      Pattan Hydropower Project is located on the Jhelum River near the village of
      Azad Pattan, which is in the territory of Azad Jammu and Kashmir in Pakistan.


      2. **Identify the location of the Ukai Dam**: The Ukai Dam is located on the
      Tapti River near Ukai village in the state of Gujarat, India.


      3. **Determine the relative geographical positions**: Azad Jammu and Kashmir,
      where the Azad Pattan Hydropower Project is located, is situated to the north
      of India. Gujarat, where the Ukai Dam is located, is to the southwest of Azad
      Jammu and Kashmir.


      4. **Comparison**: Given the general north-to-southwest direction from Azad
      Jammu and Kashmir to Gujarat, the Azad Pattan Hydropower Project is indeed situated
      to the north and slightly east of the Ukai Dam.

      Great Parish Church in Indang is located west of Santiago Apostol Church in
      Plaridel, we need to consider the geographical locations of both places.


      1. Identify the location of Indang: Indang is a municipality in the province
      of Cavite, which is located in the southern part of Luzon, Philippines.


      2. Identify the location of Plaridel: Plaridel is a municipality in the province
      of Bulacan, which is located in the central part of Luzon, Philippines.


      3. Compare their relative positions: Cavite is generally situated to the south
      and slightly to the west of Bulacan. However, since the question asks specifically
      about the western direction, we need to focus on the longitudinal (east-west)
      aspect.


      4. Analyze longitude: By looking at a map or using specific longitude coordinates,
      we can determine the relative east-west position of the two locations. Cavite,
      where Indang is located, is generally to the west of Bulacan, where Plaridel
      is located.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is YES, Saint Gregory the Great Parish Church

      factory, also known as the Newport Wafer Fab, is located in Newport, Wales.
      It is part of the larger Newport area which is to the south-east of Pontypool.


      3. **Determine the relative positions:** Since Newport is generally to the southeast
      of Pontypool and given that Folly Tower is to the east of Pontypool town center,
      the Inmos factory in Newport would be east or southeast relative to Folly Tower.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is NO, the Inmos microprocessor factory
      is not located west of Folly Tower, Pontypool.'
