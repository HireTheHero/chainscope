      - Kew Bridge is in west London

      - Brockley Hill (planned location) would have been in north London

      - When comparing west vs north London locations, Kew Bridge is indeed west of

    bd59d0fa-1b6d-475f-9f29-148b4ce63973: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let me note that Kew Bridge railway station is in west London, located
      in the London Borough of Hounslow.


      2) Brockley Hill tube station was a proposed but never built London Underground
      station that would have been located in north London, in the Edgware area.


      3) When looking at a London map:

      - Kew Bridge is in the western part of London

      - The Edgware area (where Brockley Hill would have been) is in the northern
      part of London

      - Kew Bridge is significantly further west than the Edgware area


      4) Therefore, Kew Bridge station is indeed west of where Brockley Hill tube
      station was planned to be.


      Answer: YES'
    c3654522-5c3e-4052-a25d-836bcf3f5e19: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) Kew Bridge railway station is located in west London, near the River Thames

      2) Brockley Hill tube station was a proposed but never built London Underground
      station that would have been located in north London, in the Edgware area.


      3) On a map of London:

      - Kew Bridge is in the southwest part of London

      - The Edgware area (where Brockley Hill would have been) is in the northwest
      part of London

      - Kew Bridge is further west than the Edgware area


      Therefore:


      NO - Kew Bridge railway station is not located west of Brockley Hill tube station.

      1. First, let me note that Kew Bridge railway station is in west London, located
      in the London Borough of Hounslow.


      2. However, I need to point out that there is an error in the question - Brockley
      Hill tube station was never actually built. It was a proposed station that was
      planned but never constructed as part of the unfinished Northern Heights plan
      in the 1930s.


      3. Since Brockley Hill tube station doesn''t exist, it''s not possible to make
      a valid geographical comparison about their relative positions.


      NO - The question cannot be definitively answered since Brockley Hill tube station
      was never built and therefore doesn''t have a physical location to compare with
      Kew Bridge station.'

      of Bath.


      3) Bathwick is on the eastern side of the River Avon, while Bath Abbey is on
      the western side of the river.


      4) Since Bath Abbey is on the western side of the River Avon and St John''s
      Church is on the eastern side, Bath Abbey must be west of St John''s Church.


      Therefore: YES, Bath Abbey is located west of St John''s Church, Bath.'

      - New Barnet is in north London


      3) When comparing their east-west positions:

      - South Kensington is in the western part of central London

      - New Barnet is more towards the eastern side of north London


      4) Looking at a mental map of London:

      - South Kensington sits roughly on the same longitude as Hyde Park

      - New Barnet sits further east, roughly in line with Finsbury Park


      Therefore: NO - South Kensington tube station is not west of New Barnet railway
      station. It is actually east of it.


      CORRECTION: I made a mistake in my final conclusion. South Kensington is actually
      WEST of New Barnet.


      Final Answer: YES'

    bf6dfd52-59bf-470e-8d91-496fdb183107: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. Folly Tower is located in Pontypool, Wales, on a hill overlooking the town.


      2. The Inmos microprocessor factory was built in Newport, Wales.

      - Newport is located on the south coast

      - Pontypool is located inland, north of Newport


      4. When comparing their positions:

      - Newport (with Inmos factory) is southwest of Pontypool

    52de84ee-fe0c-4ff3-83a7-a15fc3cd3129: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me identify the locations:

      - Little Goose Dam is located on the Snake River in Washington state

      - Sarang Community Church of Southern California would be in Southern California


      2. For geographical reference:

      - Washington state is in the Pacific Northwest

      - Southern California is in the southwestern United States

      - Washington state is north of California


      3. For east-west positioning:

      - Both locations are in the western United States

      - Washington state and California are roughly aligned on a north-south axis

      - They are at similar longitudes (east-west positions)

      - If anything, Washington state is slightly east of California


      Therefore: NO, Little Goose Dam is not west of Sarang Community Church of Southern
      California. It is actually slightly east and significantly north of it.

    8e14ade8-7a6f-4a8f-bda4-f376ff595ed2: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let me identify the locations:

      - Rockbourne Roman Villa is in Hampshire, southern England

      - Sutton Coldfield Town Hall is in Sutton Coldfield, near Birmingham in the
      West Midlands


      2) Now let me determine their relative positions:

      - Sutton Coldfield is in central England

      - Rockbourne is in southern England

      - On a map of England, Rockbourne is significantly south and also slightly to
      the west of Sutton Coldfield


      3) When asking if something is "west of" something else, we look at the longitudinal
      position (east-west position)

      - While Rockbourne is indeed slightly to the west of Sutton Coldfield, this
      is the key factor for answering
