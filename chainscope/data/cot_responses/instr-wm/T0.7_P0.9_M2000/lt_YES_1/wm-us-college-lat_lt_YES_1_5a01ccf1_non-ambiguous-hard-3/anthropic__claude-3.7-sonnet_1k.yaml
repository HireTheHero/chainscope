      I need to determine if UNC Pembroke is located south of Mountain State University.


      First, let''s consider the states:

      - North Carolina (NC) is a southeastern state

      - West Virginia (WV) is an Appalachian state that''s north of North Carolina


      In terms of general geography, West Virginia is north of North Carolina. So

      Mountain State University was in West Virginia. (I should note that Mountain
      State University actually lost its accreditation in 2012 and closed, but for

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between North Carolina and West
      Virginia.

      - West Virginia is a mid-Atlantic/Appalachian state

      - North Carolina is a southeastern state

      - On a map of the United States, West Virginia is positioned north of North
      Carolina


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Since UNC Pembroke is in North Carolina, and Mountain State University was

      - Shenandoah University is located in Winchester, Virginia, in the northern\
      \ part of the state\n- PennWest Edinboro is located in Edinboro, Pennsylvania,\
      \ in the northwestern part of that state\n\n## Step 2: Consider the geographic\
      \ relationship between the states\n- Pennsylvania is directly north of Virginia\
      \ in the eastern United States\n- All of Virginia lies south of Pennsylvania's\
      \ southern border\n\n## Step 3: Verify specific locations within their states\n\
      - Even though Winchester is in northern Virginia, it still lies south of the\

      First, I need to think about the geographical locations of these two states:

      - Tennessee (TN) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Michigan (MI) is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, in the northern
      part of the United States


      Generally speaking, Tennessee is south of Michigan on a map of the United States.
      Tennessee borders states like Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi to its south,
      while Michigan borders Canada to its north.


      Since Bethel University is in Tennessee, and Andrews University is in Michigan,
      and Tennessee is south of Michigan, it would follow that Bethel University in
      Tennessee is located south of Andrews University in Michigan.


      So the answer should be YES.</think>To answer whether Bethel University, TN
      is located south of Andrews University, MI, I need to consider the geographic
      locations of these universities based on their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Michigan (MI) is located in the northern United States in the Great Lakes region.

      Tennessee (TN) is located in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Compare their north-south positions.

      On a map of the United States, Tennessee is clearly positioned south of Michigan.
      Michigan borders Canada to its north, while Tennessee is much further south.


      Step 3: Consider the universities'' locations within their states.

      While specific campus locations might vary within each state, the north-south
      distance between Michigan and Tennessee is significant enough that any location
      in Tennessee would be south of any location in Michigan.


      YES, Bethel University in Tennessee is located south of Andrews University in
      Michigan.'

      in the Midwest as well.


      Since Wisconsin is north of Indiana, and the colleges are in their respective

      First, I need to understand their locations within their respective states.


      Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus is located in Savannah, Georgia.
      Savannah is on the Atlantic coast in the eastern part of Georgia, near the Georgia-South
      Carolina border.


      Furman University is located in Greenville, South Carolina. Greenville is in

      3. Looking at their relative positions: Greenville, SC is in the northern part
      of South Carolina, while Savannah, GA is on the southern coast of Georgia.


      4. Georgia is generally south of South Carolina, and Savannah is particularly
      far south in Georgia, while Greenville is particularly far north in South Carolina.


      Therefore, YES, Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus is located south

      - Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States

      - South Carolina (SC) is also in the southeastern US, and is generally located
      north of Georgia


      Now let me think about the specific locations of these universities:


      Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus is in Georgia. Based on its name,
      it''s likely in or near Savannah, GA, which is in the eastern part of Georgia
      near the Atlantic coast.


      Furman University is in South Carolina. I believe it''s located in Greenville,
      SC, which is in the northwestern part of South Carolina.


      Geographically speaking, South Carolina is north of Georgia. So generally, locations
      in Georgia would be south of locations in South Carolina.


      Specifically, Greenville, SC (where Furman is located) is in the northern part
      of South Carolina, while Savannah, GA (where Georgia Southern University-Armstrong

      Carolina.

      - Georgia is positioned south of South Carolina on the US map

      - South Carolina borders Georgia to the north


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations within their states.

      - Savannah is in coastal Georgia, in the southeastern part of the state

      - Greenville is in the northwestern part of South Carolina


      Step 4: Determine their relative positions.

      - Savannah, GA is significantly south of Greenville, SC

      - Oklahoma State University-Tulsa is located in Tulsa, Oklahoma (OK)

      - Calvary University is located in Missouri (MO)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between Oklahoma and Missouri.

      - Oklahoma is in the south-central United States

      - Missouri is directly north of Oklahoma in the Midwestern United States

      - The two states share a border, with Missouri being north of Oklahoma


      Step 3: Since Tulsa is in northeastern Oklahoma and Calvary University is in
      Missouri, and Oklahoma is south of Missouri, it follows that Oklahoma State
      University-Tulsa would be south of Calvary University.


      YES, Oklahoma State University-Tulsa, OK is located south of Calvary University,
      MO.'

      University College of Arts, GA is located south of Capital University, OH, I
      need to know the geographical locations of both universities.


      Kennesaw State University is in Kennesaw, Georgia (GA). Georgia is a state in
      the southeastern United States.


      Capital University is in Columbus, Ohio (OH). Ohio is a state in the Midwestern
      United States.


      Geographically, Georgia is located south of Ohio in the United States. Georgia

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Georgia and Ohio.

      - Georgia is in the southeastern United States

      - Ohio is in the midwestern United States

      - On a map of the US, Georgia is positioned significantly south of Ohio


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Ohio is approximately between 38-42 degrees north latitude

      - Georgia is approximately between 30-35 degrees north latitude

      - This confirms Georgia is south of Ohio on the map


      Since Kennesaw State University is in Georgia and Capital University is in Ohio,
      and Georgia is south of Ohio, Kennesaw State University is located south of
      Capital University.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt (Cal Poly Humboldt) is located
      in Arcata, California.

      - Saint Martin''s University is located in Lacey, Washington.


      Step 2: Determine the north-south relationship between these states.

      - Washington state is positioned north of California on the west coast of the
      United States.

      - Washington borders Canada to the north and Oregon to the south.

      - California is south of Oregon.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - Since Washington state is entirely north of California, any institution in
      Washington would be north of any institution in California.

      - Therefore, Cal Poly Humboldt in California must be south of Saint Martin''s
      University in Washington.


      YES, California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt is located south of Saint

      Let me break this down:

      1. First, I need to identify the locations of both universities.

      2. Then, I need to determine their relative north-south positions.


      California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt (formerly known as Humboldt
      State University) is located in Arcata, California, which is in the northern
      part of California.


      Saint Martin''s University is located in Lacey, Washington, which is in Washington
      state.


      Geographically, Washington state is north of California on the west coast of
      the United States. Washington borders Canada to the north and Oregon to the
      south. California is south of Oregon.


      So if Saint Martin''s is in Washington, and Cal Poly Humboldt is in California,
      then Cal Poly Humboldt must be south of Saint Martin''s University.</think>I
      need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt (formerly Humboldt State)
      is located in Arcata, California, in the northern part of California.

      - Saint Martin''s University is located in Lacey, Washington state.


      Step 2: Compare the geographical positions of these states.

      - Washington state is positioned along the northwest coast of the United States,
      bordering Canada to the north.

      - California is located along the west coast, south of Oregon, which is south
      of Washington.


      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      - Since California is entirely south of Washington state, any location in California
      (including Cal Poly Humboldt) must be south of any location in Washington (including
      Saint Martin''s University).

      2. Saint Martin''s University is located in Lacey, Washington (WA).


      3. Now I need to determine if Cal Poly Humboldt is south of Saint Martin''s
      University.


      4. Generally, California (CA) is south of Washington (WA) state, since Washington
      is in the Pacific Northwest and borders Canada, while California is further
      down the west coast.


      5. However, I need to be careful because some parts of California might be at
      similar latitudes to parts of Washington.


      6. Humboldt County is in the northern part of California, close to the Oregon
      border.


      7. Lacey, Washington is near Olympia, in the western part of Washington state.


      8. Even though Humboldt is in northern California, California is still south
      of Washington state. Any point in California would be south of any point in
      Washington.


      So Cal Poly Humboldt in California is south of Saint Martin''s University in
      Washington.</think>I''ll determine whether California State Polytechnic University,
      Humboldt is south of Saint Martin''s University by examining their locations:

      - California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt (formerly Humboldt State)
      is located in Arcata, California, in Humboldt County in the northern part of
      California.

      - Saint Martin''s University is located in Lacey, Washington, near Olympia in
      the western part of Washington state.


      Step 2: Compare their geographical positions.

      - Washington state is located entirely north of California on the west coast
      of the United States.

      - Even though Humboldt is in the northernmost part of California, it is still
      south of the Washington state border.

      - Any location in California, including Arcata, would be south of any location
      in Washington state, including Lacey.


      Step 3: Reach a conclusion based on north-south positioning.

      - Since Humboldt is in California and Saint Martin''s is in Washington, Humboldt
      must be south of Saint Martin''s.

      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Arkansas is located directly north of Louisiana

      - Louisiana borders the Gulf of Mexico to the south


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      - New Orleans is located in southern Louisiana, near the Gulf Coast

      - Newport, Arkansas is in the northeastern part of Arkansas


      Step 4: Compare the latitudes.

      - Any location in Louisiana, especially southern Louisiana where New Orleans

      University of New Orleans (UNO) is located in New Orleans, Louisiana.

      Arkansas State University-Newport (ASU-Newport) is located in Newport, Arkansas.


      Now I need to determine if UNO is south of ASU-Newport.


      Let''s think about the general geography:

      - Louisiana is a state that borders the Gulf of Mexico and is generally south
      of Arkansas

      - Arkansas is a state that is north of Louisiana


      To be more specific:

      - New Orleans is in southern Louisiana, near the Gulf of Mexico

      - Newport, Arkansas is in northeastern Arkansas


      Given that Louisiana is south of Arkansas, and New Orleans is in southern Louisiana
      while Newport is in northeastern Arkansas, it follows that University of New
      Orleans is south of Arkansas State University-Newport.

      4) New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana, near the Gulf of Mexico

      5) Newport, Arkansas is in the northeastern part of Arkansas


      Since Louisiana is south of Arkansas, and specifically New Orleans is in southern
      Louisiana while Newport is in northeastern Arkansas, the University of New Orleans
      is indeed south of Arkansas State University-Newport.


      YES, University of New Orleans is located south of Arkansas State University-Newport.'

      geographical locations of two universities in the US:

      1. Alcorn State University in Mississippi (MS)

      2. Harding University in Arkansas (AR)


      I need to determine if Alcorn State University is located south of Harding University.


      Let me think about the geography of these states:

      - Mississippi (MS) is generally south of Arkansas (AR)

      - Arkansas is north of Mississippi


      But I should be more precise about the specific locations of these universities
      within their states.


      Alcorn State University is located in Lorman, Mississippi, which is in the southwestern
      part of Mississippi.


      Harding University is located in Searcy, Arkansas, which is in the central part
      of Arkansas.


      Given that Mississippi is south of Arkansas, and these universities are not
      positioned in a way that would contradict this general north-south relationship
      between the states, I can conclude that Alcorn State University in Mississippi
      is indeed south of Harding University in Arkansas.</think>To determine if Alcorn
      State University, MS is located south of Harding University, AR, I need to consider

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Alcorn State University is located in Lorman, Mississippi (MS)

      - Harding University is located in Searcy, Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Arkansas is positioned north of Mississippi on the US map

      - Mississippi borders Arkansas to the south


      Step 3: Verify the specific locations within their states.

      - Lorman, MS (where Alcorn State is located) is in southwestern Mississippi

      - Searcy, AR (where Harding is located) is in central Arkansas

      - This positioning maintains the north-south relationship between the states


      Since Mississippi is south of Arkansas, and the specific locations of these
      universities follow this same geographic relationship, Alcorn State University
      is indeed located south of Harding University.

      First, I need to know the locations of both universities:


      1. Alcorn State University is in Mississippi (MS)

      2. Harding University is in Arkansas (AR)


      Now I need to think about the geographic relationship between these states.
      Mississippi is located east of Arkansas, but I need to determine whether Mississippi
      is also south of Arkansas, or at least whether the specific location of Alcorn
      State is south of Harding.


      Mississippi generally borders Arkansas to the east, with Mississippi being somewhat
      south of Arkansas. Arkansas is more north than Mississippi on average.


      To be more precise:

      - Alcorn State University is located in Lorman, Mississippi, which is in the
      southwestern part of Mississippi.

      - Harding University is located in Searcy, Arkansas, which is in the central
      part of Arkansas.


      Looking at the relative positions, Lorman, MS is definitely south of Searcy,
      AR. Mississippi as a whole is south of Arkansas, and Alcorn State''s location
      in the southwestern part of Mississippi would place it south of Harding University''s
      location in central Arkansas.</think>To determine if Alcorn State University

      - Arkansas is generally north of Mississippi on a map

      - Arkansas is positioned above Mississippi in terms of latitude


      Step 3: Look at the specific locations within these states.

      - Searcy, AR (where Harding is located) is in the central part of Arkansas

      - Lorman, MS (where Alcorn State is located) is in the southwestern part of
      Mississippi


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      - Alcorn State University has a more southern latitude than Harding University


      YES, Alcorn State University in Mississippi is located south of Harding University

      ## Step 1: State Locations

      Mississippi (MS) is located directly south of Arkansas (AR). These states share
      a border, with Arkansas positioned above Mississippi on the map.


      ## Step 2: University Locations

      - Harding University is in Searcy, Arkansas, which is in the central part of
      Arkansas

      - Alcorn State University is in Lorman, Mississippi, located in the southwestern
      part of Mississippi


      ## Step 3: Directional Analysis

      Since Mississippi is south of Arkansas, and the specific locations of these
      universities don''t change this north-south relationship, Alcorn State University
      is indeed south of Harding University.

      Let me think about the geography of US states:

      - Arkansas (AR) is located in the southern central part of the US

      - Missouri (MO) is located in the central US, north of Arkansas


      Since Arkansas is south of Missouri, and Paragould, AR is in Arkansas, while

      - Central Methodist University is in Fayette, Missouri, which is in the central
      part of Missouri

      - Even though Paragould is in the northern part of Arkansas, it''s still south

      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Missouri is located directly north of Arkansas in the United States

      - Arkansas borders the southern edge of Missouri


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities within these states.

      - Paragould is in northeastern Arkansas

      - Central Methodist University is in Fayette, Missouri, in the central part
      of the state

      - Even though Paragould is in the northern part of Arkansas, it''s still south

      this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these
      two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Claflin University is located in Orangeburg, South Carolina

      - Winston-Salem State University is located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between North Carolina and South
      Carolina.

      - North Carolina is positioned north of South Carolina

      - The states share a border, with South Carolina being directly below North
      Carolina


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities within these states.

      - Orangeburg is in the central part of South Carolina

      - Winston-Salem is in the north-central part of North Carolina


      Since South Carolina is south of North Carolina, and Orangeburg (where Claflin
      University is located) is well within South Carolina, Claflin University is
      indeed south of Winston-Salem State University.

      region. It borders Massachusetts to the south.


      New Jersey (NJ) is in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, located
      south of New York state.


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - New Hampshire is further north than New Jersey

      - Therefore, any location in New Jersey would generally be south of any location
      in New Hampshire


      Since Stevens Institute of Technology is in New Jersey and Granite State College
      is in New Hampshire, Stevens Institute of Technology would be located south
      of Granite State College.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south

      - Stevens Institute of Technology is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - Granite State College is in New Hampshire (NH)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      - New Hampshire is in the northeastern United States, specifically in the New
      England region

      - New Jersey is in the Mid-Atlantic region, significantly south of New England


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - New Hampshire is positioned much further north than New Jersey

      - Any location in New Jersey would generally be south of any location in New
      Hampshire


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion about the specific colleges.

      - Since Stevens Institute of Technology is in New Jersey and Granite State College
      is in New Hampshire, Stevens Institute of Technology must be south of Granite
      State College

      locations of Bryant University in Rhode Island (RI) and Husson University in
      Maine (ME) to answer whether Bryant is south of Husson.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - Bryant University is in Rhode Island (RI)

      - Husson University is in Maine (ME)


      Now I need to consider the geographic locations of these states within the United
      States:

      - Maine (ME) is in the northeasternmost part of the United States

      - Rhode Island (RI) is also in the Northeast, but is located south of Maine


      Looking at a mental map of the United States, Maine is at the very top of the
      Northeast, bordering Canada. Rhode Island is significantly further south, positioned
      below Massachusetts, which itself is south of Maine.


      Since Bryant University is in Rhode Island, and Rhode Island is south of Maine,
      and Husson University is in Maine, it follows that Bryant University is south
      of Husson University.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the
      relative geographic positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Bryant University is in Rhode Island (RI)

      - Husson University is in Maine (ME)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Maine is the northeasternmost state in the US, located at the top of New England

      - Rhode Island is also in New England, but is positioned significantly further
      south


      Step 3: Since universities are located within their respective states, their
      relative positions generally follow the geographic relationship of their states.

      - Husson University in Maine would be further north

      - Bryant University in Rhode Island would be further south


      YES, Bryant University in Rhode Island is located south of Husson University
      in Maine.'

      of two universities and compare them geographically.


      1. First, let''s identify where Bryant University is located. Bryant University
      is in Rhode Island (RI). Rhode Island is a state in the northeastern United
      States.


      2. Next, let''s identify where Husson University is located. Husson University
      is in Maine (ME). Maine is also in the northeastern United States, but it''s
      the northernmost state in New England.


      3. Now I need to determine their relative north-south positions. When looking
      at a map of the United States, Maine is positioned north of Rhode Island. Maine
      borders Canada to the north, while Rhode Island is further south, between Connecticut
      and Massachusetts.


      4. Therefore, if Husson University is in Maine and Bryant University is in Rhode
      Island, then Bryant University would be south of Husson University.


      Let me double-check this reasoning: Maine is definitely north of Rhode Island
      in the US. So a university in Rhode Island would be south of a university in
      Maine.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic
      positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Bryant University is located in Rhode Island (RI)

      - Husson University is located in Maine (ME)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these two states.

      - Maine (ME) is located in the northernmost part of New England in the northeastern
      United States

      - Rhode Island (RI) is also in New England but is positioned much further south


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - On a north-south axis, Maine is significantly north of Rhode Island

      - Therefore, a university in Rhode Island would be south of a university in
      Maine


      YES, Bryant University in Rhode Island is located south of Husson University
      in Maine.'
    fc24db9c-54d6-4072-abb0-11660c716284: '<think>This question is asking me to compare
      the geographical locations of two universities in the US:


      1. Bryant University in Rhode Island (RI)

      2. Husson University in Maine (ME)


      Specifically, I need to determine if Bryant University is located south of Husson
      University.


      Let me think about the geographic locations of these states:

      - Maine (ME) is the northernmost state in New England, located in the northeastern
      corner of the United States

      - Rhode Island (RI) is also in New England, but is located much further south
      than Maine


      Since Bryant University is in Rhode Island, and Husson University is in Maine,
      and Rhode Island is south of Maine, Bryant University must be south of Husson
      University.


      Let''s verify this with more specific reasoning about geography:

      - Maine borders Canada to the north

      - Going south from Maine, you would pass through New Hampshire, then Massachusetts,
      and then reach Rhode Island

      - So Rhode Island is definitely south of Maine</think>I need to determine if
      Bryant University in Rhode Island is located south of Husson University in Maine.


      Step 1: Let me identify the states where these universities are located.

      - Bryant University is in Rhode Island (RI)

      - Husson University is in Maine (ME)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these two states.

      - Maine is the northernmost state in New England, located in the northeastern
      corner of the United States

      - Rhode Island is also in New England, but is positioned much further south


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Maine borders Canada to the north

      - If you travel south from Maine, you would pass through New Hampshire, then
      Massachusetts, before reaching Rhode Island

      - Therefore, Rhode Island is definitively south of Maine


      Step 4: Since Bryant University is in Rhode Island and Husson University is
      in Maine, Bryant University must be located south of Husson University.
