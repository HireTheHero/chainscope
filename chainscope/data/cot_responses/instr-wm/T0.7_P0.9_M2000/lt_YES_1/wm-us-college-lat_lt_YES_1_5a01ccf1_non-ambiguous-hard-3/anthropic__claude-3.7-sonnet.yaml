      universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Bethel University is in McKenzie, Tennessee (TN)

      - Andrews University is in Berrien Springs, Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of Tennessee and Michigan.

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States

      - Michigan is located in the northern Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on a north-south axis.

      - Michigan is significantly further north than Tennessee

      - Tennessee borders states like Mississippi and Alabama to the south, while
      Michigan borders Canada to the north


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since Tennessee is south of Michigan, and Bethel University is in Tennessee
      while Andrews University is in Michigan, Bethel University must be south of
      Andrews University.


      YES, Bethel University in Tennessee is located south of Andrews University in
      Michigan.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Bethel University is located in McKenzie, Tennessee (TN)

      - Andrews University is located in Berrien Springs, Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Tennessee is a southern state, located in the southeastern United States

      - Michigan is a northern state, located in the upper Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Michigan borders Canada to the north and states like Indiana and Ohio to the
      south

      - Tennessee is significantly further south, bordering states like Kentucky to
      the north and Mississippi and Alabama to the south

      - On a map of the United States, Tennessee is positioned well south of Michigan

      Let me think about this step by step:


      1) I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two CSU campuses.


      2) California State University, San Bernardino is located in San Bernardino,
      California, which is in Southern California, in the Inland Empire region.


      3) California State University, Fresno (also known as Fresno State) is located
      in Fresno, California, which is in the San Joaquin Valley in Central California.


      4) In California, locations in Southern California are generally south of locations
      in Central California.


      5) Specifically, San Bernardino is located much further south than Fresno. San
      Bernardino is east of Los Angeles, while Fresno is roughly between San Francisco
      and Los Angeles, but much closer to the northern half of the state.


      Therefore, YES, California State University, San Bernardino is located south
      of California State University, Fresno.'

      the Upper Peninsula (north of Wisconsin).

      - Houghton is in Michigan''s Upper Peninsula, in the northern part of the state.

      - Oklahoma is located directly south of Kansas

      - Missouri is located east of Kansas

      - This means Missouri is northeast of Oklahoma


      Step 3: Compare the specific cities.

      - Tulsa is in northeastern Oklahoma

      - Calvary University is in Kansas City, Missouri, which is in western Missouri


      Step 4: Analyze the north-south relationship.

      - Missouri is generally north of Oklahoma on a map

      - Even comparing the specific cities (Tulsa vs. Kansas City, MO), Tulsa is still
      south of Kansas City


      Therefore, Oklahoma State University-Tulsa is located south of Calvary University

      - Our Lady of the Lake University is in Texas (TX)

      - Oklahoma City University is in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Consider their geographic positions.

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Washburn University is in Kansas (KS)

      - Grand View University is in Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Kansas and Iowa.

      - Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Kansas is also in the Midwest, but positioned south of Iowa

      - Generally, Iowa borders Minnesota to the north, Missouri to the south, and
      is west of Illinois and Wisconsin


      Step 3: Be more specific about the universities'' locations.

      - Washburn University is in Topeka, Kansas

      - Grand View University is in Des Moines, Iowa

      - Des Moines, Iowa is farther north than Topeka, Kansas


      Since Kansas is south of Iowa, and specifically Topeka, KS (where Washburn University

      - The University of Virginia Center for Politics is in Charlottesville, Virginia
      (VA)

      - The State University of New York at Cortland is in Cortland, New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Virginia and New York.

      - Virginia is a southern state compared to New York

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia is located south of New York on a map


      Step 3: Verify the specific locations within their states.

      - Charlottesville, VA is in central Virginia

      - Cortland, NY is in central New York

      - Even accounting for their specific locations within their states, Charlottesville
      is still considerably south of Cortland


      Since Virginia is south of New York, and the relative positions of Charlottesville
      and Cortland within their respective states don''t change this north-south relationship,
      the University of Virginia Center for Politics is indeed south of SUNY Cortland.

      Step 2: Consider the geographical orientation of these states.

      - Virginia is located south of New York on the U.S. East Coast

      - New York is a northern state, while Virginia is a mid-Atlantic state


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations within their states.

      - While the specific locations within their states could vary slightly, the
      north-south difference between New York and Virginia is significant enough that
      any location in Virginia would be south of any location in New York.

      - Claflin University is located in Orangeburg, South Carolina (SC)

      - Winston-Salem State University is located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina
      (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - North Carolina is north of South Carolina

      - So cities in SC are generally south of cities in NC


      Step 3: Check the specific locations within their states.

      - Orangeburg, SC is in the central part of South Carolina

      - Winston-Salem, NC is in the north-central part of North Carolina


      Step 4: Compare their positions on a north-south axis.

      - Since Claflin University is in South Carolina, which is entirely south of
      North Carolina, and Winston-Salem State University is in North Carolina, Claflin
      University must be south of Winston-Salem State University.

      1) Bryant University is located in Rhode Island (RI)

      2) Husson University is located in Maine (ME)

      3) To determine which is further south, I need to consider the geographic positions
      of these states

      4) Maine (ME) is the northernmost state in New England, located in the northeastern
      United States

      5) Rhode Island (RI) is also in New England, but is located in the southern
      part of New England

      6) On a north-south axis, Rhode Island is significantly south of Maine

      7) Therefore, Bryant University in Rhode Island would be south of Husson University
      in Maine


      YES, Bryant University, RI is located south of Husson University, ME.'
