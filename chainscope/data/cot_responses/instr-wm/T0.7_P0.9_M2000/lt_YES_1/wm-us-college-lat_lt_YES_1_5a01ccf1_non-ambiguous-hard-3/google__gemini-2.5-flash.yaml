      in the northern part of Georgia, but still significantly south of the Mason-Dixon
      line.

      3.  **Locate Capital University:** Capital University is located in Bexley,
      Ohio (a suburb of Columbus).

      4.  **Determine Capital University''s latitude:** Ohio is a Midwestern state,
      generally north of the Mason-Dixon line. Columbus is in the central part of
      Ohio.

      5.  **Compare latitudes:** Georgia is geographically south of Ohio. Therefore,
      Kennesaw State University is located south of Capital University.


      The question asks if KSU is located south of Capital University.


      **YES**'
