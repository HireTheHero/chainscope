      1. **Locate Bethel University, TN**: Bethel University is situated in McKenzie,
      Tennessee, which is in the western part of the state.


      2. **Locate Andrews University, MI**: Andrews University is located in Berrien
      Springs, Michigan, which is in the southwestern part of Michigan.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Michigan is north of Tennessee on the
      map. Since Andrews University is in Michigan and Bethel University is in Tennessee,
      Bethel University is geographically below Andrews University.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:


      YES.'
