      - Montana is a northern state, bordering Canada

      - Arkansas is in the southern part of the United States


      3) Any location in Arkansas will be south of any location in Montana, because:

      1. First, let me consider the states:

      - Kern Lake is in California

      - Woman Lake is in Minnesota


      2. Looking at their general locations:

      - California is on the west coast

      - Minnesota is in the upper Midwest


      3. Considering latitude (north-south position):

      - Minnesota borders Canada and is one of the northernmost US states

      - California extends north-south along the west coast

      - Even Northern California is generally south of Minnesota

      - Kern County is in the southern half of California


      4. Therefore:

      - Since Kern Lake is in southern California, and Woman Lake is in Minnesota
      near the Canadian border, Kern Lake must be significantly south of Woman Lake.

    e3a3be76-f698-4247-8b9d-13b542ae9d05: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let''s consider the locations:

      - Harris Lake is in New Hill, North Carolina

      - Ten Mile Lake is in Cass County, Minnesota


      2) Let''s compare their states:

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern United States

      - Minnesota is in the northern United States


      3) When comparing latitude:

      - Minnesota shares a border with Canada and is one of the northernmost US states

      - North Carolina is much further south, located in the mid-Atlantic/southeastern
      region


      4) Therefore, since Harris Lake is in North Carolina (a southern state) and
      Ten Mile Lake is in Minnesota (a northern state), Harris Lake must be located
      south of Ten Mile Lake.

      4. Since Lake Overholser is in Oklahoma, and Pine Lake is in Washington state,
      Lake Overholser must be south of Pine Lake.

      - Montana borders Canada

      - California borders Mexico


      3) Therefore, since:

      - Montana is one of the northernmost states in the continental US

      - California is a west coast state that extends much further south

      - Any location in California would be south of any location in Montana


      YES - Diaz Lake, CA is located south of Echo Lake, MT'
    edf2594e-df17-433a-b270-484cc30ca644: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let''s consider the states:

      - Diaz Lake is in California (CA)

      - Echo Lake is in Montana (MT)


      2) California and Montana are in very different latitudes:

      - Montana is a northern state, bordering Canada

      - California extends along the west coast, much further south


      3) Even the northernmost point of California is significantly south of the southernmost
      point of Montana


      4) Therefore, any lake in California (including Diaz Lake) must be south of
      any lake in Montana (including Echo Lake)


      Answer: YES'
