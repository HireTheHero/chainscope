      - Red Lake is in Minnesota, which is in the northern part of the central United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider their north-south positioning.

      - California is generally west of Minnesota, but I need to determine their north-south
      relationship.

      - Minnesota is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US, bordering
      Canada.

      - California extends quite far north and south along the west coast.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Red Lake in Minnesota is very far north, near the Canadian border.

      - Henninger Flats is in Southern California, near Los Angeles.

      - Southern California is significantly further south than northern Minnesota.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Henninger Flats is in Southern California, and Red Lake is in far northern
      Minnesota, Henninger Flats is indeed south of Red Lake.


      YES, Henninger Flats, CA is located south of Red Lake, Minnesota.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both lakes.

      - Lake Washington is in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United States.

      - Owasco Lake is in New York (NY), which is in the northeastern United States.

      southeastern part of the country, while New Hampshire is in the northeastern
      part.


      Step 2: In terms of north-south positioning, Florida is generally south of New
      Hampshire. All of Florida is south of all of New Hampshire on the north-south
      axis.


      Step 3: Since Kingsley Lake is in Florida, and Mount Lincoln is in New Hampshire,
      Kingsley Lake must be south of Mount Lincoln.


      YES, Kingsley Lake, FL is located south of Mount Lincoln, NH.'

      Step 4: Since the Jemez Mountains are in New Mexico, and Saganaga Lake is in
      Minnesota, the mountains must be south of the lake.


      NO


      Wait, I made a mistake in my answer. The question asks if Jemez Mountains are
      south of Saganaga Lake, and my reasoning shows they are indeed south. The correct
      answer is:


      YES'

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both places.

      - Jemez Mountains are located in New Mexico (NM), in the southwestern United
      States.

      - Saganaga Lake is located in Minnesota (MN), in the northern part of the Midwest
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south positioning of these states.

      - New Mexico is in the southern part of the United States.

      - Minnesota is in the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Minnesota is one of the northernmost states in the continental US.

      - New Mexico is much further south, closer to the US-Mexico border.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since New Mexico is south of Minnesota, the Jemez Mountains (in NM) must be
      south of Saganaga Lake (in MN).

      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Since New Mexico is south of Minnesota, any location in New Mexico (including
      the Jemez Mountains) would be south of any location in Minnesota (including
      Saganaga Lake).


      NO, that''s incorrect. Let me reconsider.

      - Since New Mexico is south of Minnesota, any location in New Mexico (including
      the Jemez Mountains) would be south of any location in Minnesota (including

      - New Hampshire is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US, located
      in New England.

      - Texas is much farther south, bordering Mexico.


      Step 3: Consider north-south positioning.

      - Any location in Texas will be south of any location in New Hampshire, as Texas
      is entirely south of New Hampshire on the map of the United States.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since Coleto Creek Reservoir is in Texas, and Sandwich Range is in New Hampshire,
      the reservoir must be south of the mountain range.


      YES, Coleto Creek Reservoir, TX is located south of Sandwich Range, NH.'

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative north-south positions
      of these two locations.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1. Coleto Creek Reservoir is located in Texas (TX), which is in the southern
      part of the United States.

      2. The Sandwich Range is located in New Hampshire (NH), which is in the northeastern
      part of the United States.

      3. In terms of latitude, New Hampshire is much further north than Texas.

      4. Any location in Texas would be south of any location in New Hampshire.

      5. Therefore, Coleto Creek Reservoir in Texas must be south of the Sandwich
      Range in New Hampshire.

      Since Florida is significantly south of both Idaho and Utah, any lake in Florida
      (including Mountain Lodge Lake) would be south of any lake in Idaho/Utah (including
      Bear Lake).


      NO

      States.

      - Pine Lake is in Washington state (WA), which is in the northwestern United
      States.

      - Vermont is located near the Canadian border in the northeast.

      - Arizona is located along the Mexican border in the southwest.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Vermont is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US.

      - Arizona is one of the southernmost states in the contiguous US.

      - Therefore, locations in Arizona are generally south of locations in Vermont.


      Step 4: Specifically for these locations:

      - Vulture Mountains in Arizona is in the southern half of the United States.

      of the Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas and the Tatoosh Range in Washington state.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these mountain ranges are located.

      - Ouachita Mountains are in Arkansas (AR), which is in the southern part of
      the United States.

      - Tatoosh Range is in Washington state (WA), which is in the northwestern part
      of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south positioning of these states.

      - Washington state is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US, bordering
      Canada.

      - Arkansas is in the south-central part of the US, much further south than Washington.


      Step 3: Since the mountain ranges are within these states, they follow the same
      general north-south relationship.

      - The Tatoosh Range in Washington is much further north than the Ouachita Mountains
      in Arkansas.

      - Therefore, the Ouachita Mountains must be south of the Tatoosh Range.


      NO.


      Wait, I made an error in my conclusion. The question asks if the Ouachita Mountains
      are south of the Tatoosh Range. Since Arkansas is south of Washington state,
      the Ouachita Mountains are indeed south of the Tatoosh Range.


      YES.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations mentioned.

      - Ouachita Mountains are in Arkansas (AR)

      - Tatoosh Range is in Washington state (WA)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions in the United States.

      - Washington state is in the northwestern part of the United States

      - Arkansas is in the south-central part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Washington state is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US, bordering
      Canada

      - Arkansas is much further south, located above Louisiana and Texas


      Step 4: Make the specific comparison.

      - The Tatoosh Range in Washington would be in the northern part of the country

      - The Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas would be much further south


      Therefore, YES, the Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas are located south of the
      Tatoosh Range in Washington.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both mountain ranges.

      - The Ouachita Mountains are located in Arkansas (AR), in the south-central
      United States.

      - The Tatoosh Range is located in Washington state (WA), in the northwestern
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Washington state is in the far northwest of the contiguous United States,
      bordering Canada.

      - Arkansas is in the south-central region of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Washington state is one of the northernmost states in the US.

      - Arkansas is considerably further south.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since the Ouachita Mountains are in Arkansas (a southern state) and the Tatoosh
      Range is in Washington (a northern state), the Ouachita Mountains must be south
      of the Tatoosh Range.


      YES, the Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas are located south of the Tatoosh Range
