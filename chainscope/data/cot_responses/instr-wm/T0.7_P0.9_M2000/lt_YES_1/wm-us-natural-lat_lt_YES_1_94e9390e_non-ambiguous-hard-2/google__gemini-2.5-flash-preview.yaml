      on the west coast, spanning a significant north-south distance, but its major
      population centers and the southern part (where Kern County is) are at relatively
      low latitudes. Minnesota is a state in the upper Midwest, known for its northern
      location and proximity to Canada. It is at a significantly higher latitude (further
      north) than most of California.

      4.  **Consider the specific locations within the states:** Kern Lake is in Kern
      County, which is in Southern California. Woman Lake is in Cass County, Minnesota,
      in the central-northern part of the state.

      5.  **Compare the latitudes more specifically:** Southern California is at a
      lower latitude than central-northern Minnesota. Therefore, Kern Lake, CA is
      significantly *south* of Woman Lake, MN.

      2.  **Determine the states:** Quartz Mountains are in Oklahoma (OK). Lake Quinault
      is in Washington (WA).

      3.  **Consider the general geographical relationship between Oklahoma and Washington:**
      Washington is in the northwestern corner of the contiguous United States. Oklahoma
      is more in the south-central part of the United States.

      4.  **Determine the relative latitude of the states:** Washington is significantly
      further north than Oklahoma.

      5.  **Apply this to the specific locations:** Since Oklahoma is generally south
      of Washington, any location within Oklahoma will be south of any location within
      Washington, barring extreme edge cases which are not relevant here (e.g., points
      on the very southern border of Washington vs. very northern border of Oklahoma,
      but even then, Oklahoma is primarily south). Quartz Mountains, OK is well within
      Oklahoma, and Lake Quinault, WA is well within Washington.

      asks about the relative location of Clermont chain of lakes, FL, and Lake Agnes,
      CO.

      2.  **Determine the general location of Clermont chain of lakes, FL:** Clermont
      is in Central Florida. Florida is in the southeastern United States.

      3.  **Determine the general location of Lake Agnes, CO:** Lake Agnes is near
      Cameron Pass in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Colorado is in the western/mountain
      region of the United States.

      4.  **Compare the general locations:** Florida is generally southeast of Colorado.

      5.  **Determine the relative latitude:** Florida is much further south than
      Colorado. The state of Florida is entirely south of the state of Colorado.

      6.  **Apply to specific locations:** Since Florida is entirely south of Colorado,
      any location within Florida (like the Clermont chain of lakes) will be south
      of any location within Colorado (like Lake Agnes).


      Therefore, Clermont chain of lakes, FL is located south of Lake Agnes, CO.
