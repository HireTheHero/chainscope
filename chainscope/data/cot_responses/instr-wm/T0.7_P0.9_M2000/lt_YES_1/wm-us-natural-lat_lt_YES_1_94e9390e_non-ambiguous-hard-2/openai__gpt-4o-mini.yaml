      1. **Locate Searles Lake, CA**: Searles Lake is situated in the Mojave Desert
      in California. It is located in the eastern part of the state, near the town
      of Trona.


      2. **Locate Priest Lake, ID**: Priest Lake is located in northern Idaho, close
      to the border with Canada. It is situated to the north of many significant landmarks
      in Idaho.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: To compare the latitudinal positions,
      we can see that Idaho is generally north of California. Since Priest Lake is
      in northern Idaho, it is significantly north of Searles Lake, which is in southern
      California.


      Given these locations, Searles Lake is indeed located to the south of Priest
      Lake.

      3. **Determine the relative positions**: To establish whether Sans Bois Mountains
      are south of Big Sandy Lake, we need to consider the geographical positioning
      of Oklahoma relative to Minnesota. Oklahoma is located in the southern part
      of the United States, while Minnesota is in the northern part.


      Since Oklahoma is generally south of Minnesota, it follows that the Sans Bois
      Mountains, which are in Oklahoma, are also south of Big Sandy Lake in Minnesota.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      YES.'

    45af5ef7-b6ab-4196-ad35-df2a9f2aa5f8: 'To determine if Trinity Bay (Texas) is
      located south of the Oregon Coast Range, we need to consider the geographical
      locations of both places.


      1. **Location of Trinity Bay (Texas)**: Trinity Bay is situated on the Gulf
      Coast of Texas, near the city of Houston. It is positioned at approximately
      29.5 degrees North latitude.


      2. **Location of the Oregon Coast Range**: The Oregon Coast Range is a mountain
      range located along the coast of Oregon, which is positioned at a latitude that
      generally ranges from about 42 to 45 degrees North.


      3. **Comparing Latitudes**: Since Trinity Bay is at approximately 29.5 degrees
      North and the Oregon Coast Range is at a higher latitude (42 to 45 degrees North),
      this means Trinity Bay is located significantly further south than the Oregon
      Coast Range.

      specifically in the southeastern part of the state, near the city of Baytown.


      2. **Identify the Location of the Oregon Coast Range**: The Oregon Coast Range
      is a mountain range located along the coast of Oregon, extending from the northern

      in Montana.


      1. **Location of Lake Altus-Lugert**: Lake Altus-Lugert is located in southwestern
      Oklahoma, near the town of Altus.


      2. **Location of Swan Lake**: Swan Lake is located in northwestern Montana,
      near the town of the same name.


      3. **Geographic Relationship**: To find out if Lake Altus-Lugert is south of
      Swan Lake, we need to compare their latitudinal coordinates. Generally, Oklahoma
      is situated further south than Montana on the U.S. map.


      Based on this reasoning, since Oklahoma is south of Montana, Lake Altus-Lugert
      is indeed south of Swan Lake.
