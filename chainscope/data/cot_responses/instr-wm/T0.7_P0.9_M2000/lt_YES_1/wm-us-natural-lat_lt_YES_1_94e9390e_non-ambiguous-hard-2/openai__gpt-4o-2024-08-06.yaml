      Given these points, Lake of the Arbuckles in Oklahoma is indeed located south
      of Lake Traverse in South Dakota.

      of Iowa. Specifically, Florida is one of the southernmost states in the U.S.,
      while Iowa is situated in the central part of the country.


      Given this information, Lake Tohopekaliga in Florida is indeed located south
      of the Iowa River in Iowa.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'

      1. **Location of Ortiz Mountains, NM**: The Ortiz Mountains are located in New
      Mexico, which is in the southwestern region of the United States.


      2. **Location of Strait of Georgia, WA**: The Strait of Georgia is actually
      located between Vancouver Island and the mainland of British Columbia, Canada.
      However, if we consider the geographic context in relation to the US state of
      Washington, the strait is generally north of the state of Washington.


      3. **Comparison of Latitude**: New Mexico is much further south than the state
      of Washington. Therefore, anything in New Mexico, including the Ortiz Mountains,
      is located south of anything in or north of Washington, including the Strait
      of Georgia.


      Given these points, Ortiz Mountains, NM is indeed located south of the Strait
