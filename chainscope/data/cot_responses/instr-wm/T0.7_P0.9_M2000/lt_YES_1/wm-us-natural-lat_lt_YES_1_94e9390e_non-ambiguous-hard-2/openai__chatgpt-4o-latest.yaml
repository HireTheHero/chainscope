    dd8b3569-9b27-40dc-bd96-a54dd0d31d5b: 'To answer the question "Is Topock Gorge,
      AZ located south of Lake Pend Oreille, ID?" we need to consider the geographical
      locations of both places.


      Step 1: Identify where Lake Pend Oreille is located.

      - Lake Pend Oreille is in the northern part of Idaho, near the border with Canada.
      It is one of the northernmost large lakes in the continental United States.


      Step 2: Identify where Topock Gorge is located.

      - Topock Gorge is located in northwestern Arizona, along the Colorado River,
      near the border with California and Nevada.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes of both locations.

      - Lake Pend Oreille is significantly farther north than Topock Gorge.

      - Arizona is generally south of Idaho, and Topock Gorge is in the northern part
      of Arizona, but still well south of Idaho.


      Conclusion: Since Topock Gorge is in Arizona and Lake Pend Oreille is in northern
      Idaho, Topock Gorge is indeed located south of Lake Pend Oreille.


      Answer: YES'
