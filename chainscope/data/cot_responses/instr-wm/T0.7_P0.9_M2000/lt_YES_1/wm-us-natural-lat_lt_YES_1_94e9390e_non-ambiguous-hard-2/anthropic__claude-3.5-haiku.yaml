      - Henninger Flats is located in the San Gabriel Mountains, in California

      - It is near Pasadena, in Southern California


      2. Next, locate Red Lake, MN:

      - Red Lake is located in northwestern Minnesota

      - California is west of Minnesota

      - Southern California (where Henninger Flats is) is significantly south of northwestern
      Minnesota (where Red Lake is)


      4. Reasoning about "south of":

      - Since Henninger Flats is in Southern California and Red Lake is in northern
      Minnesota, Henninger Flats is actually NORTH of Red Lake, not south of it
