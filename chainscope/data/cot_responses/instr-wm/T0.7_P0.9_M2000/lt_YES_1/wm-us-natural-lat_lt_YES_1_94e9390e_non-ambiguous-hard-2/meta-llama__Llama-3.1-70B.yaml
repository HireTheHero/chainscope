      the south-central part of the United States, while South Dakota is located in
      the north-central part of the country.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Generally, the farther south you go in the United
      States, the lower the latitude. Oklahoma has a lower latitude compared to South
      Dakota, which means Oklahoma is south of South Dakota.


      4. **Apply the comparison to the lakes**: Since Lake of the Arbuckles is in

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Sangre de Cristo Range is located in Colorado
      (CO), and Rainy Lake is located in Minnesota (MN).


      2. **Understand the geography of the United States**: Colorado is located in
      the western part of the United States, known for its Rocky Mountains. Minnesota
      is located in the northern United States, in the Midwest region.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Generally, the farther south you go in the United
      States, the lower the latitude. Colorado has a lower latitude compared to Minnesota,
      which means Colorado is south of Minnesota.


      4. **Apply the comparison to the locations**: Since Sangre de Cristo Range is
      in Colorado and Rainy Lake is in Minnesota, and Colorado is south of Minnesota,
      it follows that Sangre de Cristo Range is south of Rainy Lake.
