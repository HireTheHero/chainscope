      2. **General locations:** California is west of Nevada.  Zip codes increasing
      generally means going further East or South. Nevada is North of most of California.

      3. **Therefore, a lower Nevada zip code will likely be north of a California
      zip code.**

      4. **Specific locations are not needed for this comparison:**  Since the question
      is only about relative North/South and not East/West, the fact that one is in
      CA and the other is in NV is enough to suggest the CA zip code is South of the
      NV zip code

      generally true, it''s possible for a northern part of Florida to be at a similar
      latitude to a southern part of Georgia.  One would need to look up the specific
      latitudes of these zip codes to be absolutely certain. However, given the significant
      distance between most of Florida and Georgia, it''s highly likely 33187, FL
      is south of 31632, GA.


      4. **Conclusion:**  Based on the general location of the states, it''s highly
      probable that 33187, FL is south of 31632, GA.
