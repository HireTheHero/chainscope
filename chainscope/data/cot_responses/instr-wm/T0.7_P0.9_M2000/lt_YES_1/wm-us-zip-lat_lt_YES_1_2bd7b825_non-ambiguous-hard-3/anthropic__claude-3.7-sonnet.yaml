      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between states.

      - Pennsylvania is located south of New York State

      - New York is north of Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Consider the numbering system of zip codes.

      - While zip codes follow some geographical patterns, they don''t perfectly align
      with north-south positioning

      - The specific locations within each state matter more than the zip code numbers
      themselves


      Step 4: Verify the specific locations.

      - 15137 is in Pennsylvania, which is definitively south of New York

      - 14204 is in New York, which is definitively north of Pennsylvania

      - Any location in Pennsylvania will be south of any location in New York along
      the shared border area


      Since 15137 is in Pennsylvania and 14204 is in New York, and Pennsylvania is
      south of New York, the location represented by zip code 15137 must be south
      of the location represented by zip code 14204.

      - New York is generally north of Pennsylvania, as Pennsylvania borders New York
      on NY''s southern border.


      Step 3: Consider the specific ZIP codes.

      - ZIP codes beginning with 151xx are in the western part of Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh
      area)

      - ZIP codes beginning with 142xx are in the western part of New York (Buffalo
      area)


      Step 4: Compare the relative positions.

      - Western Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh area) is indeed south of western New York
      (Buffalo area)

      - The general pattern of ZIP codes also confirms this, as lower numbers in the

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - Kentucky is located in the east-central United States, north of Georgia


      Step 3: More specifically, Georgia shares its northern border with Tennessee,
      which in turn shares its northern border with Kentucky. This means Georgia is
      entirely south of Kentucky.


      Step 4: Since 31206 is in Georgia and 40422 is in Kentucky, and Georgia is south
      of Kentucky, it follows that 31206, GA must be south of 40422, KY.


      YES, 31206, GA is located south of 40422, KY.'

      to be in the western and northern parts.

      - The first digit of 4 in both ZIP codes places them in the same general region.

      - But the second digit differs: 2 for Kentucky vs 6 for Indiana.

      - Within the same first digit region, lower second digits typically indicate
      more southern locations.

      - 42141 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 46565 is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Indiana is located north of Kentucky. Kentucky borders Indiana along Indiana''s
      southern border.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code patterns.

      - In the US zip code system, generally lower numbers tend to be in the eastern
      and southern parts of the country, while higher numbers tend to be in the western
      and northern parts.

      Step 1: Identify the general geographic relationship between Ohio (OH) and West
      Virginia (WV).

      - West Virginia is generally located south and east of Ohio.


      Step 2: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      - US zip codes generally follow patterns where lower numbers tend to be in the
      eastern and northeastern parts of the country, while higher numbers tend to
      be in the western and southwestern parts.

      - However, within states, this pattern doesn''t necessarily indicate north-south

      Step 3: Analyze the specific zip codes.

      - 25601 is in West Virginia, which as a state is south of Ohio.

      - 44094 is in Ohio, specifically in the northeastern part of Ohio (based on
      the "440" prefix which corresponds to the Cleveland area).

      - 25601 is in the southern part of West Virginia (based on the "256" prefix).


      Step 4: Consider the relative positions.

      - Since 44094 is in northeastern Ohio and 25601 is in southern West Virginia,
      and Ohio is generally north of West Virginia, it''s very likely that 25601,

      - West Virginia is located south of Ohio in the United States.

      - Ohio borders West Virginia along West Virginia''s northern border.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - Zip code 25601 is in West Virginia, which places it somewhere in that state.

      - 32601 is a zip code in Gainesville, Florida (FL)

      - 29205 is a zip code in Columbia, South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of Florida and South Carolina.

      - Florida is located south of South Carolina in the United States

      - South Carolina is on the eastern seaboard, north of Florida


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Gainesville, FL (32601) is in north-central Florida

      - Columbia, SC (29205) is in central South Carolina

      - Even though Gainesville is in northern Florida, Florida as a state is still
      south of South Carolina


      Step 4: Make the determination based on latitude.

      - Locations with lower latitude numbers are further south

      - Gainesville, FL is at a lower latitude than Columbia, SC

      - 98229 is in Washington (WA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Oregon and Washington.

      - Washington is located directly north of Oregon along the Pacific coast.

      - Oregon is south of Washington.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      - In the US, zip codes generally increase from east to west and from south to
      north.

      - The 972xx series is for northern Oregon.

      - The 982xx series is for western Washington.

      Step 4: Let''s verify by considering the first digits of the zip codes. The
      first digit of a zip code in the US indicates a general geographic region, with

      - 40475 is a zip code in Kentucky (KY)

      - 46013 is a zip code in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Kentucky and Indiana.

      Indiana is located directly north of Kentucky. The entire state of Kentucky
      lies south of Indiana, as they share a border with Indiana being the northern
      neighbor.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level knowledge to the zip codes.

      Since 40475 is in Kentucky and 46013 is in Indiana, and Kentucky is south of

      46013, IN


      I need to determine the geographical locations of these zip codes and compare
      their north-south positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 40475 is a zip code in Kentucky (KY)

      - 46013 is a zip code in Indiana (IN)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography

      Kentucky is located south of Indiana. The entire state of Kentucky is below
      Indiana on a map of the United States.


      ## Step 3: Verify with zip code geography

      ZIP codes in the US generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to be
      in the eastern and southern parts of the country, while higher numbers tend
      to be in the western and northern parts.


      The fact that the Kentucky zip code (40475) has a lower number than the Indiana
      zip code (46013) aligns with the general north-south relationship between these
      states.


      ## Step 4: Make the determination

      Since Kentucky is south of Indiana, and 40475 is in Kentucky while 46013 is
      in Indiana, the zip code 40475 must be south of 46013.

      - 40475 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 46013 is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Indiana is located directly north of Kentucky

      - Kentucky''s northern border connects with Indiana''s southern border


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      - Generally, zip codes start with lower numbers in the northeast and increase
      as you move south and west

      - The first digit indicates a broad geographic region (4 covers several midwestern/southern
      states)

      - Within the same first digit, lower numbers typically indicate more northern
      locations


      Step 4: Compare the specific zip codes.

      - 40475 (KY) starts with 404, which is a lower number than 460

      - 46013 (IN) starts with 460, which is a higher number


      Step 5: Despite the zip code numbering, what matters is the actual geographic
      location.

      - Kentucky is geographically south of Indiana

      - 10457 is a zip code in the Bronx, New York.

      - 03784 is a zip code in New Hampshire (likely in the West Lebanon area).


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the northeastern United States.

      - New Hampshire is located in northern New England.

      - New York state extends from the Canadian border down to New York City.

      - The Bronx is one of the five boroughs of New York City, located in the southern
      part of New York state.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      - New Hampshire is generally north of New York City.

      - The Bronx (10457) is in the southern portion of New York state.

      - New Hampshire (03784) is in northern New England.

      - 32818 is a ZIP code in Florida (FL)

      - 30566 is a ZIP code in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography.

      Florida is located south of Georgia, as Georgia borders Florida on its northern
      border.


      Step 3: Think about the specific ZIP codes.

      While the general rule is that Florida is south of Georgia, I need to verify
      that these specific ZIP codes follow this pattern.


      Step 4: Consider ZIP code patterns.

      In the US ZIP code system, codes generally increase from east to west, but the
      first digit broadly divides the country into regions. ZIP codes beginning with
      3 are in the southeastern United States.

      - 30xxx ZIP codes are in Georgia

      - 32xxx ZIP codes are in Florida


      Step 5: Make the determination.

      Since 32818 is in Florida and 30566 is in Georgia, and Florida is located south
      of Georgia, ZIP code 32818, FL must be located south of 30566, GA.

      in Florida is located south of zip code 30566 in Georgia.


      Step 1: Florida is generally south of Georgia, since Georgia borders Florida
      to the north. This gives us an initial indication that a Florida zip code is
      likely south of a Georgia zip code.


      Step 2: Looking at the zip code numbers themselves, I can observe that:

      - 32818 is in Florida

      - 30566 is in Georgia


      Step 3: In the US zip code system, the first digit generally indicates a broad
      geographic region. Zip codes beginning with 3 cover the southeastern United
      States, including both Georgia and Florida.


      Step 4: Within this region, the second digit further divides the area. Georgia
      zip codes typically start with 30, 31, and 39, while Florida zip codes typically
      start with 32, 33, and 34. The lower numbers in Georgia (30-31) compared to
      Florida (32-34) reflect Georgia''s more northern position.


      Step 5: Since 32818 (FL) starts with 32 and 30566 (GA) starts with 30, and Florida
      is south of Georgia, we can conclude that 32818, FL is indeed south of 30566,

      Lower zip codes tend to be in the eastern and northern parts of the country,
      while higher zip codes tend to be in the western and southern parts.


      Step 2: The zip codes in question are 32818 (FL) and 30566 (GA).

      locations tend to have higher zip codes.


      Step 5: Since Florida is south of Georgia, and these specific zip codes follow
      the expected pattern (the Florida zip code is higher than the Georgia one),
      the Florida location is indeed south of the Georgia location.

      - Georgia zip codes (30xxx) are numerically lower than Florida zip codes (32xxx)


      Step 4: Make the geographical determination.

      - Since 32818 is in Florida, and 30566 is in Georgia

      - And Florida is south of Georgia

      - Therefore, 32818, FL must be south of 30566, GA


      YES'

      in Florida is located south of the zip code 30566 in Georgia.


      Step 1: Recall that U.S. zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers
      tend to be in the eastern and northeastern parts of the country, while higher
      numbers tend to be in the western and southern parts.


      Step 2: However, within the southeast region, we need to consider the states''
      relative positions. Georgia is located directly north of Florida.


      Step 3: Looking at the first digits of the zip codes:

      - 32818 starts with "3" (Florida)

      - 30566 starts with "3" (Georgia)


      Step 4: Since both start with "3", I need to look at the second digit:

      - 32818 has "2" as the second digit

      - 30566 has "0" as the second digit


      Step 5: In the southeast region, as zip codes increase in the second digit (from
      0 to higher numbers), they generally move further south.


      Step 6: Since 32 (Florida) is a higher number than 30 (Georgia), and Florida
      is south of Georgia geographically, zip code 32818 in Florida would be south
      of zip code 30566 in Georgia.


      YES, 32818, FL is located south of 30566, GA.'

      Step 1: Identify what we''re comparing.

      - 32818, FL (a zip code in Florida)

      - 30566, GA (a zip code in Georgia)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Florida and Georgia.

      - Florida is located south of Georgia (Florida is the southernmost state in
      the continental US, with Georgia directly above it)


      Step 3: Look at the zip code patterns.

      - In the US postal system, zip codes generally follow geographic patterns

      - Lower zip code numbers in the same region typically indicate more northern
      locations

      - 32818 (Florida) starts with 32, while 30566 (Georgia) starts with 30

      - The Florida zip code actually has a higher number than the Georgia zip code


      Step 4: Verify the specific locations.

      - Despite the zip code numbering, what matters is the actual geographic location

      - Since 32818 is in Florida and 30566 is in Georgia, and Florida is south of
      Georgia, the Florida zip code must be south of the Georgia zip code


      YES, 32818, FL is located south of 30566, GA.'

      (OR).


      2) Oregon is located directly north of California along the west coast of the
      United States.


      3) Since Oregon is north of California, any location in California would be
      south of any location in Oregon.


      4) Therefore, 95425, CA must be located south of 97236, OR, regardless of their
      specific locations within their respective states.


      YES'

      of 87301, NM. Let me reason through this step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 85614 is a ZIP code in Arizona (AZ)

      - 87301 is a ZIP code in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Consider the ZIP code numbering system.

      In the US ZIP code system, generally codes increase as you move from east to
      west and from south to north. However, this pattern isn''t perfectly consistent,
      especially across state boundaries.


      Step 3: Consider the geographical relationship between Arizona and New Mexico.

      New Mexico is directly east of Arizona. Both states share a border that runs
      north-south.


      Step 4: Consider the specific locations.

      - 85614 appears to be in southern Arizona (lower ZIP codes in AZ tend to be
      in the southern part)

      - 87301 appears to be in northwestern New Mexico (higher ZIP codes in NM tend
      to be in the northern part)


      Step 5: Based on both the state positions and the ZIP code patterns, 85614 in
      southern Arizona would likely be south of 87301 in northwestern New Mexico.


      NO


      Wait, I need to double-check my reasoning. Looking more carefully at the geography:

      - Arizona is west of New Mexico

      - 85614 is in southern Arizona (Green Valley area)

      - 87301 is in northwestern New Mexico (Gallup area)


      When comparing their latitudes, Green Valley, AZ is indeed south of Gallup,
      NM.


      YES'

      - 87301 is a ZIP code in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Consider the ZIP code system in the US.

      - ZIP codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to be in the
      eastern and northern parts of the country, while higher numbers tend to be in
      the western and southern parts.

      - However, within neighboring states, this pattern may not hold precisely for
      north-south positioning.


      Step 3: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      - Arizona is located west of New Mexico.

      - Both states share a border, with Arizona to the west of New Mexico.

      - The northern parts of both states align approximately at the same latitude.


      Step 4: Analyze the specific ZIP codes.

      - 85614 is in southern Arizona (likely in the Tucson area).

      - 87301 is in northwestern New Mexico (likely in the Gallup area).

      - Geographically, southern Arizona is indeed south of northwestern New Mexico.

      Step 1: Let me consider the general geographic relationship between Arizona
      and New Mexico. Arizona is located west of New Mexico, but that doesn''t tell
      us about the north-south relationship between these specific zip codes.


      Step 2: In the US zip code system, codes generally increase as you move from
      east to west and from south to north. This means lower zip codes tend to be
      in the eastern and southern parts of the country.


      Step 3: The zip code 85614 (in Arizona) has a lower number than 87301 (in New
      Mexico). Based on the zip code numbering pattern, this suggests that 85614 is
      likely to be south of 87301.


      Step 4: More specifically, Arizona zip codes beginning with 856 are typically
      in the southern part of Arizona (around Green Valley and Tucson area), while
      New Mexico zip codes beginning with 873 are typically in the northwestern part

      NM?


      To determine this, I''ll identify the locations of these zip codes and compare
      their geographical positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 85614 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ)

      - 87301 is a zip code in New Mexico (NM)


      ## Step 2: Consider the zip code numbering system

      In the US zip code system, generally:

      - Lower numbers in the first three digits tend to be in the eastern and northeastern
      parts of the country

      - Higher numbers tend to be in the western and southwestern parts


      ## Step 3: Analyze Arizona vs. New Mexico geography

      - Arizona is located west of New Mexico

      - The zip code 85xxx series covers Arizona

      - The zip code 87xxx series covers New Mexico


      ## Step 4: Determine north-south relationship

      - 85614 is in southern Arizona (likely in the Tucson area)

      - 87301 is in northwestern New Mexico (likely in the Gallup area)

      - Geographically, southern Arizona is indeed south of northwestern New Mexico


      Therefore, based on the geographical locations of these zip codes:


      YES, 85614, AZ is located south of 87301, NM.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 85614 is in Arizona (AZ)

      - 87301 is in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Consider the general US zip code numbering system.

      In the US postal system, zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers
      are in the eastern and northern parts of the country, while higher numbers are
      in the western and southern parts.


      Step 3: Compare these specific zip codes.

      - Arizona (85xxx) is generally west of New Mexico (87xxx)

      - The first digit "8" indicates both are in the same general region (Mountain/Southwest)

      - The second digit is lower for Arizona (5) than New Mexico (7), which in this
      region typically means Arizona is further south


      Step 4: Verify with geographical knowledge.

      New Mexico is directly east of Arizona, and while they share a border, New Mexico
      is generally positioned slightly more northward than Arizona. Most of Arizona
      lies south of most of New Mexico.
