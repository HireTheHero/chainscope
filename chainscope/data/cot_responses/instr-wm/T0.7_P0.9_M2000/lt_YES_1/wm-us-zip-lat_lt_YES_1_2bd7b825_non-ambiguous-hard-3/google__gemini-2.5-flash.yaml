      it''s for the town of McKees Rocks, which is just west of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh
      is in western Pennsylvania.

      for downtown Buffalo, New York. Buffalo is in western New York, near the Great
      Lakes.


      **Step 2: Determine the latitude of each location.**


      While we don''t need exact degrees, we need to know their general north-south
      position.


      *   **Pittsburgh, PA (near 15137):** Pittsburgh is generally considered to be

      higher (more northerly) latitude than Pittsburgh.


      **Step 3: Compare the latitudes.**

      answer.


      **Step 1: Understand the nature of zip codes and their relation to geography.**

      US zip codes are generally assigned in a way that the first digit represents
      a group of US states. As the numbers increase, they generally move westward
      across the country, and then within those groups, they move north to south (or
      south to north, depending on the region). However, this is a *general* trend,
      not a strict rule, and exceptions exist, especially at state boundaries.


      **Step 2: Locate the states involved.**

      *   KY is Kentucky.

      *   IN is Indiana.


      **Step 3: Consider the geographical relationship between Kentucky and Indiana.**

      Kentucky is located *south* of Indiana. They share a border, with Indiana to
      the north of Kentucky.


      **Step 4: Analyze the specific zip codes.**

      *   42141, KY: This zip code is in Bowling Green, Kentucky.

      *   46565, IN: This zip code is in South Bend, Indiana.


      **Step 5: Determine the relative north/south position of the specific towns.**

      *   Bowling Green, KY is in the southern part of Kentucky.

      *   South Bend, IN is in the very northern part of Indiana.


      **Step 6: Combine the information.**

      Since Kentucky is generally south of Indiana, and specifically, Bowling Green
      (KY) is in southern Kentucky while South Bend (IN) is in northern Indiana, Bowling
      Green, KY (42141) is indeed located south of South Bend, IN (46565).


      **YES**'

      answer.


      **Step 1: Understand what the question is asking.**

      It''s asking if a specific location in Kentucky (represented by its zip code)
      is geographically south of a specific location in Indiana (represented by its
      zip code).


      **Step 2: How do zip codes relate to geography?**

      While zip codes define geographical areas, they are not direct representations
      of latitude and longitude. However, the first digit of a zip code often corresponds
      to a group of US states.


      *   **Kentucky (KY):** Generally falls into the 4xxxx range.

      *   **Indiana (IN):** Generally falls into the 4xxxx range.


      This means both states are in the same general "region" as defined by the first
      digit of the zip code.


      **Step 3: How to compare the relative north/south positions of states?**

      We need to know the general geographical relationship between Kentucky and Indiana.


      *   Indiana is located directly to the north of Kentucky. The Ohio River forms
      much of the border between the two states.


      **Step 4: Apply this knowledge to the specific zip codes.**

      *   42141, KY is a location within Kentucky.

      *   46565, IN is a location within Indiana.


      Since all of Kentucky is south of all of Indiana, any location within Kentucky
      will be south of any location within Indiana.


      **Step 5: Formulate the YES/NO answer.**

      **Step 1: Identify the locations of the zip codes.**

      * 27896 is in North Carolina (NC).

      * 24482 is in Virginia (VA).


      **Step 2: Understand the general geographical relationship between North Carolina
      and Virginia.**

      * North Carolina is located directly to the south of Virginia. They share a
      border.


      **Step 3: Consider if there are exceptions within these states that would make
      a zip code further north in the southern state than a zip code further south
      in the northern state.**

      * While zip codes can be oddly shaped and cross county lines, the overall north-south
      relationship between entire states is generally consistent. It would be extremely
      rare, if not impossible, for a zip code entirely within North Carolina to be
      geographically *north* of a zip code entirely within Virginia, given their direct
      north-south alignment. The northernmost point of NC is still south of the southernmost
      point of VA.


      **Step 4: Conclude based on the state-level relationship.**

      Since North Carolina is generally south of Virginia, any location within North
      Carolina will be south of any location within Virginia.


      Therefore, 27896, NC is located south of 24482, VA.

      The question asks to compare the *latitudinal* position of two zip codes: 10457,
      NY and 03784, NH. "South of" implies a lower latitude.


      **Step 2: Locate 10457, NY**

      *   This zip code is for the Bronx, New York City.

      *   New York City is generally at a latitude of approximately 40.7 degrees North.


      **Step 3: Locate 03784, NH**

      *   This zip code is for West Lebanon, New Hampshire.

      *   West Lebanon is generally at a latitude of approximately 43.6 degrees North.


      **Step 4: Compare Latitudes**

      *   40.7 degrees North (Bronx, NY) is a *lower* latitude than 43.6 degrees North
      (West Lebanon, NH).

      *   A lower latitude means it is further south.

      PA, DE.

      *   **2xxxx-xxxx:** Southern Atlantic (MD, DC, VA, WV, NC, SC)


      **Step 2: Locate 22134, VA**

      *   The zip code 22134 is in Virginia.

      *   Virginia is a mid-Atlantic state, located south of New Jersey.


      **Step 3: Locate 07852, NJ**

      *   The zip code 07852 is in New Jersey.

      *   New Jersey is a mid-Atlantic state, located north of Virginia.


      **Step 4: Compare Relative Locations**

      Since Virginia is geographically south of New Jersey, any location within Virginia
      will be south of any location within New Jersey (barring extremely unusual and
      specific geographic anomalies that wouldn''t apply to entire states).


      **Step 5: Formulate the YES/NO Answer**

      Based on the general geographic location of the states themselves, and the typical
      progression of zip codes, a location in Virginia will be south of a location

      answer.


      **Step 1: Understand the Question**

      The question asks if a specific zip code in California is located south of a
      specific zip code in Oregon. This is a geographical comparison.


      **Step 2: Identify the Locations by State**

      *   95425 is in CA (California).

      *   97236 is in OR (Oregon).


      **Step 3: General Geographic Relationship of California and Oregon**

      On a map of the United States, California is directly south of Oregon. Oregon
      is directly north of California.


      **Step 4: Apply General Relationship to Specific Zip Codes**

      Since all of California is south of all of Oregon, any point in California will
      be south of any point in Oregon. Therefore, 95425, CA will be south of 97236,
      OR.

      1.  **Identify the states:** We have North Carolina (NC) and Ohio (OH).

      2.  **Understand the geography:** North Carolina is located south of Ohio in
      the United States.

      3.  **Consider the zip codes:** While zip codes are numerical, they are assigned
      geographically. Lower zip codes generally correspond to more eastern/northern
      areas within a state or region, but this is not a strict rule across states.
      The crucial information here is the *state* associated with each zip code.

      4.  **Relate states to the question:** The question asks if a location in North
      Carolina (28216, NC) is south of a location in Ohio (43950, OH).


      Since North Carolina is geographically south of Ohio, any location within North
      Carolina will be south of any location within Ohio.


      Therefore, 28216, NC is located south of 43950, OH.
