      \ in the eastern part of the country and higher numbers in the west. However,\
      \ ZIP codes starting with \"7\" are generally located in the south-central part\
      \ of the United States, including parts of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Arkansas.\n\
      \   - The ZIP code 70711 is not a valid ZIP code. However, ZIP codes in the\
      \ 707xx range are located in Louisiana.\n\n2. **Identify the Location of 72364,\
      \ AR:**\n   - The ZIP code 72364 is a valid ZIP code and is located in Marion,\
      \ Arkansas.\n\n3. **Determine the Relative Latitude:**\n   - Louisiana is located\
      \ to the south of Arkansas on the United States map. Therefore, any valid ZIP\
      \ code in Louisiana will generally be south of any location in Arkansas.\n\n\
      4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since ZIP code 70711 would be in Louisiana (if it were\
      \ valid), it would be located south of ZIP code 72364, which is in Arkansas.\n\
      \nTherefore, the answer is YES."
