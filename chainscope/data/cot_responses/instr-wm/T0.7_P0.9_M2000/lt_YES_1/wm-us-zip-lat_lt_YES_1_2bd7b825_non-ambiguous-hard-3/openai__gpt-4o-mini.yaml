      1. **Locate 35951, AL**: This zip code is for the area around the city of Hokes
      Bluff in Alabama. Geographically, Alabama is situated to the south of Kentucky.


      2. **Locate 40108, KY**: This zip code corresponds to the area around the city
      of Brandenburg in Kentucky. Kentucky is positioned north of Alabama.


      3. **Comparing the latitudes**: Since 35951, AL is in Alabama and 40108, KY
      is in Kentucky, we can infer that Alabama, being south of Kentucky, suggests
      that the zip code for Hokes Bluff (35951) is indeed located south of Brandenburg

      the geographical locations of these two ZIP codes.


      1. **ZIP Code 08022**: This ZIP code is assigned to the area of Medford, New
      Jersey. Geographically, Medford is located in the southern part of New Jersey.


      2. **ZIP Code 12192**: This ZIP code is associated with the area of West Sand
      Lake, New York. West Sand Lake is situated in the eastern part of New York,
      near Albany.


      3. **Comparative Positioning**: To compare the two locations, we consider the
      latitude of both places. Generally, New Jersey is located south of New York

      \ corresponds to the area of Olive Branch, Mississippi.\n   - Zip code **61610**\
      \ corresponds to the area of Peoria, Illinois.\n\n2. **Assess the geographic\
      \ positions:**\n   - Olive Branch, MS is located in the northern part of Mississippi,\
      \ near the border with Tennessee, and is generally considered to be south of\
      \ the central and northern parts of Illinois.\n   - Peoria, IL is located in\
      \ central Illinois.\n\n3. **Compare their latitudes:**\n   - Mississippi is\
      \ generally south of Illinois. Specifically, Olive Branch (38655) has a latitude\
      \ of approximately 34.95\xB0 N.\n   - Peoria (61610) has a latitude of approximately\
      \ 40.69\xB0 N.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since 34.95\xB0 N (MS) is significantly\
      \ south of 40.69\xB0 N (IL), it confirms that Olive Branch, MS is indeed south\
      \ of Peoria, IL.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **YES**."
