    028f3093-ee84-41fd-94e7-49936fa97e94: 'Sure! Let''s reason through this step by
      step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the ZIP codes.


      - ZIP code 19031 is in Pennsylvania (PA), specifically in the area of Flourtown,
      which is a suburb northwest of Philadelphia.

      - ZIP code 13224 is in New York (NY), specifically in the city of Syracuse,
      which is in central New York State.


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions.


      - Flourtown (19031, PA) is near Philadelphia, which is in the southeastern part
      of Pennsylvania.

      - Syracuse (13224, NY) is in central New York, which is north of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Determine if 19031 is south of 13224.


      - Since Pennsylvania is south of New York, and Philadelphia is in the southeastern
      corner of Pennsylvania, while Syracuse is in central New York, Flourtown (19031)
      is indeed geographically south of Syracuse (13224).


      Answer: YES.'
