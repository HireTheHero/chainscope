      \ central part of the United States\n\u2022 New York is located in the northeastern\
      \ part of the United States\n\n3. To determine if 72601 is south of 11767, I'll\
      \ compare their latitudes:\n\u2022 Arkansas is geographically south of New York\n\
      \u2022 This means zip codes in Arkansas will generally be located further south\
      \ than zip codes in New York\n\n4. Therefore, 72601 (AR) is indeed located south\
