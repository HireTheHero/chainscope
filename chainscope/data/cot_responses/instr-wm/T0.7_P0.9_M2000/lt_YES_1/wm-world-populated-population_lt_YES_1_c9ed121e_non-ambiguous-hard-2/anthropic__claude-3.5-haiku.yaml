    65a3966c-6cd1-496d-931b-32454f4a3342: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Tkibuli is a town in Georgia (the country), located in the Imereti region.


      2. Shivpuri district is located in Madhya Pradesh, India.


      3. To compare their populations, I''ll need to find population data for both
      places.


      4. Tkibuli is a small town with an estimated population of around 10,000-15,000
      people.


      5. Shivpuri district, being an entire district in India, typically has a much
      larger population.

      or town.
