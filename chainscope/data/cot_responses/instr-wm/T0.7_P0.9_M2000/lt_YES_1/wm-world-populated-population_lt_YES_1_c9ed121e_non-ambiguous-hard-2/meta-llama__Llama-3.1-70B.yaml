      \ a region in Somalia, located in the south-central part of the country. It's\
      \ a larger area compared to a small village like Clayton.\n\n3. **Population\
      \ Comparison**:\n   - **Clayton, Illinois**: As of the last available census\
      \ data, Clayton has a very small population. It's typically under 1,000 residents,\
      \ making it a small village by most standards.\n   - **Bay, Somalia**: Bay,\

      \ figures might be difficult to obtain, but regions in Somalia often have populations\
      \ in the tens or hundreds of thousands.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the vast\

      2. **Find population data for Mulapadu**: As of my last update, the population
