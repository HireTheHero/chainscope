      1.  **Maidenhead:** This is a town in Berkshire, England, UK. Its population
      is approximately 70,000-75,000. If we consider the wider Royal Borough of Windsor
      and Maidenhead, the population is around 150,000.

      2.  **Kyzylorda Region:** This is one of the regions (oblasts) of Kazakhstan.
      Its population is approximately 830,000 - 840,000 people.


      Comparing these:

      *   Maidenhead (town): ~70,000

      *   Kyzylorda Region: ~835,000


      70,000 is indeed less than 835,000. Even if we take the entire Royal Borough
      of Windsor and Maidenhead (~150,000), it is still less than Kyzylorda Region.

    1656587f-e057-4d3d-9382-fea1074d8eba: 'Okay, here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify Bekoji:** Bekoji is a town in the Arsi Zone of the Oromia Region
      of Ethiopia.

      2.  **Find the population of Bekoji:** According to the 2005 Ethiopian census,
      Bekoji had a population of 16,730. While this is an older figure, it''s a town,
      so even with growth, it''s unlikely to be in the hundreds of thousands. Let''s
      assume it might have grown to, say, 25,000-35,000.

      3.  **Identify Marion County, Indiana:** Marion County is a county in the U.S.
      state of Indiana. It is the most populous county in Indiana and contains the
      city of Indianapolis.

      4.  **Find the population of Marion County, Indiana:** According to the U.S.
      Census Bureau, the estimated population of Marion County, Indiana, as of 2023,
      was approximately 970,000 (the 2020 census figure was 977,203).

      at 35,000) is significantly smaller than Marion County, Indiana''s population
      (around 970,000).


      Therefore, Bekoji is less populous than Marion County, Indiana.
