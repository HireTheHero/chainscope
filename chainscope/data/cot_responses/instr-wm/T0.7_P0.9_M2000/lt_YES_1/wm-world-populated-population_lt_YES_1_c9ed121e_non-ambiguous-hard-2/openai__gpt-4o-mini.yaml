      of both places.


      1. **Maidenhead**: Maidenhead is a town in the United Kingdom, located in the
      Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead. According to recent estimates, the
      population of Maidenhead is approximately 65,000.

      1. **Clayton, Illinois**: As of the latest data, Clayton has a population of
      approximately 1,200 people. This number can fluctuate slightly with new census
      data, but it generally remains around that figure.


      2. **Bay, Somalia**: Bay is a region in Somalia, which includes several districts
      and towns. The population of the entire Bay region is estimated to be several
      hundred thousand people, with some estimates suggesting it could be around 500,000
      or more, depending on the specific area considered.


      Now, comparing the two:


      - Clayton, Illinois: ~1,200 people

      - Bay, Somalia: ~500,000+ people


      Since 1,200 is significantly less than 500,000, we can conclude that Clayton,
      Illinois is indeed less populous than Bay, Somalia.
