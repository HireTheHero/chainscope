      is less populous than Bay, Somalia, let''s break down the information we need:


      1. **Population of Clayton, Illinois**: Clayton is a small village in Adams
      County, Illinois. According to recent estimates, Clayton has a population of
      approximately 700 people.


      2. **Population of Bay, Somalia**: Bay is not a city or town but a region in
      Somalia. The population of a region cannot be directly compared to a village
      as it includes multiple towns and rural areas. However, for context, Baidoa,
      the capital of the Bay region, has a population in the tens of thousands. The
      entire region would have a significantly larger population.


      Given that Bay is a region with several towns and a larger overall population
      compared to the small village of Clayton, Illinois, the answer is:


      NO, Clayton, Illinois is not more populous than Bay, Somalia.'

      1. **Population of Clayton, Illinois**: Clayton is a small village in Adams
      County, Illinois. According to the most recent census data, Clayton, Illinois,
      has a population of less than 1,000 residents.


      2. **Population of Bay, Somalia**: Bay is not a single city or town but rather
      a region in Somalia. The Bay region includes several towns and cities, with
      Baidoa being the largest city. The population of the Bay region is significantly
      larger than 1,000, with Baidoa alone having tens of thousands of residents.


      Based on this information:


      - Clayton, Illinois, has a population of less than 1,000.

      1. **Identify Mulapadu**: Mulapadu is a village located in the Krishna district
      of Andhra Pradesh, India. As a village, it is relatively small in terms of population.


      2. **Identify Department of Ayacucho**: The Department of Ayacucho is a region
      in Peru. It is a larger administrative division that includes multiple provinces

      3. **Population Comparison**: Typically, a village like Mulapadu would have
      a much smaller population compared to an entire department or region such as
      Ayacucho, which encompasses many towns, cities, and rural areas.


      Given these considerations, it is reasonable to conclude that Mulapadu is indeed
