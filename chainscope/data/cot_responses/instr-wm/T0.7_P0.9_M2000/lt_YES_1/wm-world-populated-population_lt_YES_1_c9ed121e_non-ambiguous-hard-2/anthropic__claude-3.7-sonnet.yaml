      Step 1: Analyze what Perth, Tasmania refers to.

      There''s a Perth in Australia, but it''s in Western Australia, not Tasmania.
      There is no major city called Perth in Tasmania. There might be a small locality
      with this name, but it''s not a significant population center in Tasmania.

      Agar Malwa is a district in Madhya Pradesh, India. According to census data,
      Agar Malwa district has a population of approximately 500,000-600,000 people.


      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      Since Perth, Tasmania is either non-existent as a recognized locality or an
      extremely small settlement (if it exists at all), its population would be negligible
      compared to Agar Malwa district''s population of hundreds of thousands.

      There''s a potential issue here - Perth is a city in Western Australia, not
      in Tasmania. There is no major city or settlement called Perth in Tasmania.
      Tasmania is an island state of Australia with its capital being Hobart.

      people.


      Step 3: Compare populations.

      Since Perth is not in Tasmania, I cannot make a direct comparison. If we''re
      referring to a hypothetical or very small settlement called Perth in Tasmania
      that I''m not aware of, it would almost certainly have a population much smaller
      than an entire Indian district.


      Based on this reasoning, if we''re assuming there is some small locality called

      Actually, Perth is a city in Western Australia, not in Tasmania. There is no

      error in the question.


      Step 2: Identify Agar Malwa district.

      Agar Malwa is a district in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India.


      Step 3: Since Perth is not in Tasmania, I need to clarify what we''re comparing.

      If we''re comparing a non-existent place (Perth, Tasmania) to Agar Malwa district,
      the comparison becomes problematic.


      Step 4: Check the population of Agar Malwa district.

      Agar Malwa district has a population of approximately 500,000-600,000 people.


      Step 5: Since Perth, Tasmania doesn''t exist as a recognized place, it effectively
      has zero population.

      have fewer people than Agar Malwa district.

      This appears to be a confusion in the question.

      far smaller than a district in India with hundreds of thousands of people.


      NO - The question contains a geographical error, as Perth is not in Tasmania.

      indeed be less populous than Agar Malwa district, which has hundreds of thousands

      Perth is more commonly known as a major city in Western Australia, not Tasmania.
      The Perth in Tasmania is a small town.


      Step 2: Identify Agar Malwa district.

      Agar Malwa is a district in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India.

      is less populous than Agar Malwa district. Let me think through this step by
      step.


      Step 1: Identify Perth, Tasmania.

      There''s a potential issue here - Perth is a major city in Western Australia,
      but not in Tasmania. Tasmania is a separate Australian state. There is no significant
      place called "Perth" in Tasmania. Perth is located in Western Australia.


      Step 2: Consider Agar Malwa district.

      Agar Malwa is a district in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India. According to
      census data, Agar Malwa district has a population of approximately 500,000-600,000
      people.


      Step 3: Compare populations.

      Since "Perth, Tasmania" is not actually a real place (Perth is in Western Australia,
      not Tasmania), I cannot make a valid population comparison. The question contains
      a false premise.


      However, if we were to compare Perth, Western Australia (which has over 2 million
      people) with Agar Malwa district (with around 500,000-600,000 people), then
      Perth would be MORE populous, not less.


      NO - The premise of the question is incorrect as Perth is not in Tasmania, but
      if comparing the actual city of Perth (in Western Australia) with Agar Malwa
      district, Perth is not less populous than Agar Malwa district.'

      in Tasmania is a small town.


      Step 2: Find the population of Perth, Tasmania.

      Perth, Tasmania is a small town with a population of approximately 2,000-3,000

      Step 4: Find the population of Bishnupur subdivision.

      Bishnupur subdivision, being part of a district in India (likely Bankura district),
      would have a population of tens or hundreds of thousands of people.


      Step 5: Compare the populations.

      Middle Bass Island has fewer than 100 permanent residents, while Bishnupur subdivision
      would have many thousands of residents.

      Middle Bass Island has around 50-100 permanent residents.

      Bishnupur subdivision has hundreds of thousands of residents.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Middle Bass Island''s population is measured in dozens or hundreds, while
      Bishnupur subdivision''s population is measured in hundreds of thousands, Middle
      Bass Island is clearly less populous.


      YES, Middle Bass Island is less populous than Bishnupur subdivision.'

      There is no incorporated place called "Clayton, Illinois" that is a major city
      or town in Illinois. There is a Clayton County in some states, but not in Illinois.
      There is a small village called Clayton in Illinois, which typically has a very
      small population (likely under a few thousand residents).

      Bay is not a city but rather a region/province in Somalia. The Bay region is

      Step 2: Let me consider Bay, Somalia.

      I need to check if "Bay" refers to a specific city in Somalia or the Bay region
      of Somalia. The Bay region is one of the administrative regions of Somalia.
      If referring to the Bay region, it would have a population of several hundred

      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      If "Bay, Somalia" refers to the Bay region, then it has a population of hundreds
      of thousands, which is much larger than Clayton, Illinois with its population
      of less than 1,000.


      If "Bay, Somalia" refers to a specific small town named Bay (which I''m not

      Given that the most likely interpretation is that Bay refers to the administrative

      There is no prominent place called Clayton, Illinois. There is a Clayton, Missouri
      (near St. Louis), but in Illinois, there might be a small unincorporated community
      called Clayton, but it''s not a major population center. Small unincorporated
      communities typically have populations in the hundreds or low thousands.


      Step 2: Let me consider Bay, Somalia.

      I''m not aware of a specific place called "Bay" in Somalia. There is a Bay region

      NO - Clayton, Illinois is not less populous than Bay, Somalia. This is because

      Step 3: Compare the likely population sizes.

      A village in India (Mulakuzha) would typically have a population in the thousands
      or tens of thousands. A regency in Indonesia (Buleleng) would typically have
      a population in the hundreds of thousands or even millions. Buleleng Regency
      specifically has a population of over 600,000 people.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on the comparison.

      Given that Mulakuzha is a small village and Buleleng is an entire regency containing
      multiple settlements, Mulakuzha would have a significantly smaller population
      than Buleleng Regency.


      YES, Mulakuzha is less populous than Buleleng Regency.'

      and Buleleng Regency.


      Step 1: Identify what Mulakuzha is.

      Mulakuzha is a village in Kerala, India. As a village, it likely has a relatively
      small population, probably in the thousands or tens of thousands.


      Step 2: Identify what Buleleng Regency is.

      Buleleng Regency is a regency (administrative division) in the northern part

      Buleleng Regency, as a regency in Indonesia, would have a population in the

      and villages. Specific data indicates Buleleng Regency has a population of over
      600,000 people.

      Mulakuzha appears to be a small locality in Kerala, India. Without specific

      in the thousands or tens of thousands.


      Step 2: I need to determine the population of Buleleng Regency.

      Buleleng Regency is a regency (administrative division) in Bali, Indonesia.
      Indonesian regencies typically have populations in the hundreds of thousands

      We''re comparing a village (Mulakuzha) to an entire regency (Buleleng). A regency
      is a much larger administrative unit that would contain many villages.


      Step 4: Estimate the population difference.

      Buleleng Regency would have a population of several hundred thousand to over
      a million people, while Mulakuzha as a village would have a much smaller population,
