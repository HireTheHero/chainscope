      village, it would have a relatively small population, likely in the thousands.

      - Buleleng Regency has a population of over 600,000 people


      3. Comparing:

      - A village (Mulakuzha) typically has thousands of residents

      - A regency (Buleleng) has hundreds of thousands of residents

      - The difference in administrative level makes it clear that Buleleng Regency
      is much more populous


      YES - Mulakuzha is less populous than Buleleng Regency'
    baa77dd5-32da-4cc5-8773-ca92539f7ddc: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me identify these places:

      - Mulakuzha is a village in Kerala, India

      - Buleleng Regency is a regency (administrative division) in Bali, Indonesia


      2. Let me find population data:

      - Mulakuzha, being a village in Kerala, likely has a population of a few thousand
      people

      - Buleleng Regency has a population of over 600,000 people


      3. Compare:

      - A village (Mulakuzha) will naturally be much smaller than an entire regency
      (Buleleng)

      - The difference in scale is very large - village vs. administrative region


      Based on this reasoning, I can confidently say:


      YES - Mulakuzha is less populous than Buleleng Regency'

      1. First, I need to identify these places:

      - Mulakuzha is a village in Kerala, India

      - Buleleng Regency is a regency (administrative division) in Bali, Indonesia


      2. Let me check their populations:

      - Mulakuzha, being a village in Kerala, likely has a population of a few thousand
      people

      - Buleleng Regency has a population of over 600,000 people


      3. Compare:
