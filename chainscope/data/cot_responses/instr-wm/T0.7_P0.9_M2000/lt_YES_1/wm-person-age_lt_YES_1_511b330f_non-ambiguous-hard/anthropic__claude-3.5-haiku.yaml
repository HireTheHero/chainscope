      1. First, I''ll need to find out the birth and death dates for both Nicolas
      Neufchatel and Bernhard Karl von Koehne.


      2. Nicolas Neufchatel (also known as Nicolas Beauchamp) was a Renaissance painter
      who lived from around 1527 to 1590. This means he died at approximately 63 years
      old.


      3. Bernhard Karl von Koehne was a German historian and heraldic scholar who
      lived from 1808 to 1879. This means he died at approximately 71 years old.


      4. The question is asking: Was Nicolas Neufchatel younger at his time of death
      than Bernhard Karl von Koehne at his time of death?


      5. Since Neufchatel died at about 63 and von Koehne died at about 71, Neufchatel
      was indeed younger at his time of death.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      - He died in 1515 at approximately 50 years old


      3. Comparing their ages at death:

      - Gabriela Silang died at 32

      - Alonso de Ojeda died at around 50


      4. The question is: Was Gabriela Silang younger at her time of death than Alonso
      de Ojeda at his time of death?

      - 32 is less than 50

      - So the answer is YES


      YES'
