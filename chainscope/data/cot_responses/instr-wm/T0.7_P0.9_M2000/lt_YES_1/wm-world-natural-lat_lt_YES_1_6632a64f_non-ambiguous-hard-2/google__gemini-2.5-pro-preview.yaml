      1.  **Locate Pashan Lake:** Pashan Lake is an artificial lake near the suburb
      of Pashan, in Pune, Maharashtra, India.

      2.  **Locate Oregon Coast Range:** The Oregon Coast Range is a mountain range
      that runs north-south along the Pacific Ocean coast of the U.S. state of Oregon.

      3.  **Compare their locations:** India is in Asia. Oregon is in North America.

      4.  **Determine the "south of" relationship:** India is not south of Oregon
      (USA). In fact, from Oregon''s perspective, India is far to the west/southwest
      across the Pacific Ocean and much of Asia.


      Therefore, Pashan Lake is not located south of the Oregon Coast Range.

      range located in the central part of the island of Cyprus.

      2.  **Locate Lough Eske:** Lough Eske is a lake located in County Donegal, in
      the northwest of Ireland.

      3.  **Compare their latitudes/general locations:** Cyprus is an island in the
      eastern Mediterranean Sea, significantly south of most of Europe. Ireland is
      an island in the North Atlantic, to the west of Great Britain.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Cyprus (and therefore the Troodos Mountains) is much further
      south than Ireland (and therefore Lough Eske).


      So, the Troodos Mountains are indeed located south of Lough Eske.
