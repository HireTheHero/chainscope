      given the typical locations of well-known Bolivian volcanic regions being west
      and south of La Paz, it is more likely that the Cordillera Real is north or
      east of the Paco volcano.


      In conclusion, without exact coordinates, it is reasonable to say:


      NO, the Cordillera Real is not located south of the Paco volcano.'

      positions of both locations.


      1. **Location of Cordillera Real**: The Cordillera Real is a mountain range
      located in the eastern part of the Andes in Bolivia. It stretches in a north-south
      direction to the east of the city of La Paz.


      2. **Location of Paco Volcano**: The Paco volcano, also known as Nevado de Payachata,
      is part of the Andes mountain range located on the border between Bolivia and
      Chile. It is situated in the western part of Bolivia.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Since the Cordillera Real is located to the east
      and stretches north-south, while the Paco volcano is situated more towards the
      west, it is important to compare their latitudinal positions.


      4. **Conclusion**: The Cordillera Real, in general, extends further north compared
      to the location of the Paco volcano, which is more towards the southwestern
      part of Bolivia.

      range in the Andes of Bolivia. It runs roughly northwest to southeast and is
      located near the eastern edge of the Altiplano.


      2. **Location of Paco Volcano**: Paco, also known as Nevado del Pacollo, is

      extends across various latitudes, but it is generally positioned slightly south
      of the central Andean region where Paco is located.


      Given these points, Cordillera Real is generally positioned to the southeast

      city of La Paz in the north to the area near the city of Oruro in the south.


      2. **Identify the location of Paco (volcano)**: The specific identification
      of Paco as a volcano is not widely recognized in major geographic databases.
      However, assuming Paco refers to a known volcano in Bolivia, it is necessary

      2. **Quake Lake**: This lake, also known as Earthquake Lake, is located in southwestern
      Montana, USA.


      Now, let''s consider their relative positions:


      - Chennai, where Chetput Lake is located, is in the Northern Hemisphere, but
      quite close to the equator, specifically at a latitude of approximately 13 degrees
      North.

      - Quake Lake in Montana is located at a latitude of approximately 44.8 degrees
      North.


      Given that 13 degrees North (Chetput Lake) is south of 44.8 degrees North (Quake
      Lake), we can conclude that Chetput Lake is indeed located south of Quake Lake.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      2. **Identify the location of Lough Tay:** Lough Tay is located in County Wicklow,
      Ireland.


      3. **Determine the relative positions:** India is geographically located to
      the southeast of Ireland. Specifically, Ajmer in Rajasthan is much further south
      compared to County Wicklow in Ireland.


      Therefore, Ana Sagar Lake is indeed south of Lough Tay.


      The answer is: YES.'

      located south of Lough Tay, we need to first establish the locations of both
      places:


      1. **Ana Sagar Lake**: This is a lake located in Ajmer, Rajasthan, India. Geographically,
      it is situated in the northern part of India.


      2. **Lough Tay**: This is a small but scenic lake located in County Wicklow,
      Ireland. It is situated in the eastern part of Ireland.


      Next, we consider the relative positions of India and Ireland:


      - India is located in South Asia, which is generally positioned to the east
      and south relative to Europe.

      - Ireland is located in Western Europe, north of the equator.


      Given these geographical locations, Ana Sagar Lake in India is significantly
      south of Lough Tay in Ireland.
