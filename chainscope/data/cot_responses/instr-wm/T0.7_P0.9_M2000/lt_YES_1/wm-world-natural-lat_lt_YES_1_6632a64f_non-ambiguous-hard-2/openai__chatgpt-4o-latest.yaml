      of both places.


      1. **Salar de Arizaro**: This is a large salt flat located in the Puna de Atacama
      region, in the northwestern part of Argentina, specifically in Salta Province.
      It is one of the largest salt flats in the world.


      2. **Ajay River**: There is no widely known river named "Ajay River" in the
      same region of South America. However, there is an Ajay River in India, which
      flows through the states of Bihar, Jharkhand, and West Bengal.


      3. **Comparison**: If the question is referring to the Ajay River in India,
      then Salar de Arizaro in Argentina is located in South America, which is geographically
      south of India.


      Therefore, based on this reasoning:


      - Salar de Arizaro is located in Argentina, South America.

      - The Ajay River is located in India, Asia.

      the relative geographic positions of Lake Ngozi and the Vulture Mountains.


      1. **Identify Lake Ngozi**: Lake Ngozi is a crater lake located in the Mbeya
      Region of southwestern Tanzania. It lies within the Poroto Mountains, which
      are part of the larger Southern Highlands of Tanzania.


      2. **Identify the Vulture Mountains**: The Vulture Mountains are a less commonly
      referenced range, but in the context of Tanzania and the surrounding region,
      "Vulture Mountains" is often another name used for a volcanic range or a local
      translation. However, there is a Vulture Mountains range in the United States
      (Arizona), but that would be irrelevant when comparing with Lake Ngozi in Tanzania.


      3. **Clarification**: Assuming the question refers to the Vulture Mountains
      in Tanzania (likely a local or alternate name for a nearby range), we must determine
      their position relative to Lake Ngozi. However, if it refers to the Vulture
      Mountains in Arizona, it would not make sense to compare it directly in terms
      of north/south with a Tanzanian lake without further context.


      4. **Assuming both features are in Tanzania**: If the Vulture Mountains are
      in northern Tanzania or even in the general direction north of Mbeya, and Lake
      Ngozi is in the southern highlands, then Lake Ngozi would be south of them.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Lake Ngozi is in the southern highlands of Tanzania
      and assuming the Vulture Mountains are north of it within Tanzania, then Lake
      Ngozi is indeed located south of the Vulture Mountains.

      3. **Possible Interpretation**: If "Lake Mountains" refers to a set of mountains

      2. **Clarify "Lake Mountains"**: The term "Lake Mountains" is ambiguous. It

      need to examine a map.
