      the Lahaul and Spiti valley of Himachal Pradesh, India.  Therefore, it''s located
      in Asia.


      2. **Loch of Stenness:** This is a loch (lake) in Orkney, Scotland.  Therefore,
      it''s located in Europe.


      3. **Relative Locations:** Asia is generally east and slightly north of Europe.  India
      is significantly south of Scotland, but the eastern/western difference is much
      greater.


      4. **South:** The question specifically asks if Chandra Taal is *south* of Loch
      of Stenness. While India is south of *some* parts of Europe, it is not south
      of Scotland.

      Europe (though not universally true).  Given the specific locations, India is
      definitely south of Scotland.
