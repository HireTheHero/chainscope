      Himalayas. It is situated to the north of the Kathmandu Valley.


      2. **Buffalo Pound Lake**: This lake is located in Saskatchewan, Canada. It
      is situated to the southeast of the city of Moose Jaw.


      Now, considering the geographical positions:


      - Ganesh Himal is in Nepal, which is in South Asia.

      - Buffalo Pound Lake is in Canada, which is in North America.


      Since Nepal is significantly north of Canada, we can deduce that Ganesh Himal
      is much farther north than Buffalo Pound Lake.


      Now, we need to determine if Ganesh Himal is located south of Buffalo Pound
      Lake. Given that Ganesh Himal is in Nepal and Buffalo Pound Lake is in Canada,
      Ganesh Himal cannot be located south of Buffalo Pound Lake.


      Thus, the answer is:


      **NO**.'

      2. **Location of the Gulf of Thailand**: The Gulf of Thailand is situated in

      4. **Determine the relative location**: Since the Pocdol Mountains are in the

      state that one is located south of the other, as they are separated by a significant
      distance and different geographical contexts.

      3. **Compare Locations**: To determine if Chetput Lake is south of Quake Lake,
      we need to understand the relative positions of Chennai (India) and West Yellowstone
      (Montana, USA). Chennai is significantly south of West Yellowstone, given that
      it is located in the southern part of India, while West Yellowstone is in North
      America.


      Since Chetput Lake is located in Chennai, which is far south of Quake Lake in
      Montana, we can conclude that Chetput Lake is indeed south of Quake Lake.

      to each other:


      - **Ana Sagar Lake** is situated in the northern part of India.

      - **Lough Tay** is located in the eastern part of Ireland.


      Now, to determine if Ana Sagar Lake is south of Lough Tay, we consider their
      latitudinal positions:


      - India (where Ana Sagar Lake is located) is significantly further south than
      Ireland.

      - Therefore, Ana Sagar Lake is not south of Lough Tay.

      2. **Lough Tay** (also known as Guinness Lake) is located in County Wicklow,
      Ireland. It is situated in the Wicklow Mountains.


      Now, we can analyze their relative positions:


      - Ana Sagar Lake is in India, while Lough Tay is in Ireland, which are on different
      continents (Asia and Europe).

      - To compare their latitudes, we can note that India is generally located to
      the north of the equator, while Ireland is also north of the equator, but much
      further west.


      Given that they are on different continents, we can conclude that it doesn''t
      make sense to compare their positions in terms of "south" or "north" relative
