      1. Lake Ashi (also known as Ashinoko) is located in Japan, specifically in the
      Hakone area of Kanagawa Prefecture, near Mount Fuji.


      2. Lysefjord is located in Norway, specifically in Rogaland county in southwestern
      Norway.


      3. These two locations are on different continents (Asia and Europe) and are
      very far apart.


      4. Since they are in completely different parts of the world, we need to determine
      their relative geographic positions.


      5. Japan is located east of Norway, so Lake Ashi would be east of Lysefjord,
      not south.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'
