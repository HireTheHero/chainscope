      \ San Marzano di San Giuseppe is a *comune* (municipality) in Italy. The Department\
      \ of Loreto is a *department* (a major administrative division, similar to a\
      \ state or province) in Peru.\n3.  **Estimate or find the typical scale of these\
      \ types of places:** Municipalities in Italy are typically small areas. Departments\
      \ in Peru are typically very large administrative regions, often encompassing\
      \ vast territories, especially in the Amazon basin like Loreto.\n4.  **Compare\
      \ the likely scales:** A small municipality in Italy is almost certainly much,\
