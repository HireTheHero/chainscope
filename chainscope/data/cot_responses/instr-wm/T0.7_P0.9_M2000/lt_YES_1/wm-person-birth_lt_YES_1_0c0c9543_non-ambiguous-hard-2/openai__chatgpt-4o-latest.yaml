      Step 1: Identify Yusuf al-Mustansir.

      Yusuf al-Mustansir was a ruler of the Hafsid dynasty in North Africa. He ruled
      from 1435 to 1488. Based on this, he must have been born before 1435. Historical

      **Step 1: Identify Richard de Umfraville**


      Richard de Umfraville was a medieval English noble. One Richard de Umfraville
      is known to have died in 1325. If this is the individual in question, then he
      must have been born before 1325, most likely in the late 13th century.


      **Step 2: Identify Jeanne d''Avaugour**


      Jeanne d''Avaugour was a noblewoman from Brittany. According to historical records,
      Jeanne d''Avaugour was born around 1300 and died in 1327.


      **Step 3: Compare Dates**


      - Richard de Umfraville: Born likely before 1300 (since he died in 1325 and
      was an active noble before that).

      - Jeanne d''Avaugour: Born around 1300.


      Given that Richard de Umfraville was active and died in 1325, he must have been
      born at least a couple of decades earlier, likely in the 1270s or 1280s.


      **Conclusion:**


      Since Richard de Umfraville was likely born before 1300, and Jeanne d''Avaugour
      was born around 1300, Richard was born earlier.

      to determine who was born earlier: Stephen Hagiochristophorites or Adam Friedrich
      Glafey.


      Step 1: Identify who these historical figures were and when they lived.


      - Stephen Hagiochristophorites was a Byzantine official during the reign of
      Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos. He died in 1185. Therefore, he must have been
      born sometime before 1185, likely in the 12th century or possibly late 11th
      century.


      - Adam Friedrich Glafey was a German historian and writer. He was born in 1692
      and died in 1753.


      Step 2: Compare their birth dates.


      - Stephen Hagiochristophorites was born well before 1185.

      - Adam Friedrich Glafey was born in 1692.


      Step 3: Determine who was born first.


      - Since 1185 is much earlier than 1692, Stephen Hagiochristophorites was born
      earlier than Adam Friedrich Glafey.

      was born earlier than Adam Friedrich Glafey, we need to identify the time periods
      in which these two historical figures lived.


      Step 1: Identify when Stephen Hagiochristophorites lived.

      - Stephen Hagiochristophorites was a Byzantine official who was active during
      the reign of Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos.

      - Andronikos I Komnenos ruled the Byzantine Empire from 1183 to 1185 AD.

      - Therefore, Stephen Hagiochristophorites must have lived in the 12th century,
      around the mid to late 1100s.


      Step 2: Identify when Adam Friedrich Glafey lived.

      - Adam Friedrich Glafey was a German writer and historian.

      - He was born in 1692 and died in 1753.

      - Therefore, he lived in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.


      Step 3: Compare their birth years.

      - Stephen Hagiochristophorites: born in the 12th century (before 1185).

      - Adam Friedrich Glafey: born in 1692.

      was born earlier than Jesko Albert Eugen von Puttkamer, we need to look at the
      birth dates of both individuals.


      1. Filippo Napoletano was an Italian painter active during the early 17th century.
      He was born around 1587.


      2. Jesko Albert Eugen von Puttkamer was a German colonial administrator. He
      was born in 1855.


      Now, compare the two birth years:


      - Filippo Napoletano: circa 1587

      - Jesko Albert Eugen von Puttkamer: 1855


      Since 1587 is earlier than 1855, the answer is:


      YES.'
