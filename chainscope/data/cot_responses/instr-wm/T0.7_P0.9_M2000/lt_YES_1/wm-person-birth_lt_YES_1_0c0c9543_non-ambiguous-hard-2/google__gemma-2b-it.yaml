      **Step 1:**


      We need to check the birthdates of Bermudo II and Bernardin Frankopan.


      * Bermudo II''s birthdate is not mentioned in the context, so we cannot determine
      his exact birthdate.

      so we cannot determine his exact birthdate.


      **Step 2:**


      Since we cannot determine the birthdates of Bermudo II and Bernardin Frankopan,
      we cannot say whether Bermudo II was born earlier than Bernardin Frankopan.
