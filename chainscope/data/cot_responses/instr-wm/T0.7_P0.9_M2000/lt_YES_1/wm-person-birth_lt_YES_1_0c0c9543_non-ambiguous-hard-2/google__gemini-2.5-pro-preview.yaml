      \ III who ruled very briefly in 1552, son of Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu.\
      \ Born c. 1546. This is sometimes referred to as Petru V or VI by others. The\
      \ numbering of Moldavian princes can be confusing.\n\n    Let's go with the\
      \ most common understanding or a clear candidate.\n    Gervais de Ch\xE2teau-du-Loir:\
      \ born c. 1007.\n    Petru III Aron (if considered Petru III): born c. early\
      \ 15th century (e.g., 1420s).\n    Petru \u0218chiopul (sometimes referred to\
      \ as Petru V or VI, but a \"Petru\" who ruled later): born c. 1534.\n\n    Another\
      \ \"Petru III\" could be Petru Rare\u0219's son who was briefly prince in 1552\
      \ for a few months and was very young. This Petru (son of Rare\u0219) was born\
      \ **c. 1527** and died in 1552. This seems like a plausible candidate for \"\
      Petru III\" if we're looking for a distinct one after Petru II.\n\n    So, the\
      \ candidates for Petru III's birth year are:\n    *   Petru Aron: c. 1420s\n\
      \    *   Petru, son of Petru Rare\u0219 (briefly ruled 1552): c. 1527\n\n  \
      \  Comparing Gervais (c. 1007) with either of these:\n    *   1007 is earlier\
      \ than c. 1420s.\n    *   1007 is earlier than c. 1527.\n\nConclusion: Gervais\
      \ de Ch\xE2teau-du-Loir (born c. 1007) was born significantly earlier than any\
      \ figure who could reasonably be identified as Petru III of Moldavia (who would\
      \ have been born in the 15th or 16th century).\n\nYes"
