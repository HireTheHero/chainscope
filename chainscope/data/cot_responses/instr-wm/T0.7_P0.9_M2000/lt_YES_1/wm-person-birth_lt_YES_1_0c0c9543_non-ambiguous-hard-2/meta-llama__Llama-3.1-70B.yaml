      1. **Johann Spies**: Johann Spies was a German editor and publisher who lived
      in the 16th century. He is known for publishing the first edition of the German
      Faustbuch in 1587. However, his exact birth year is not widely documented.


      2. **Hermann Bonitz**: Hermann Bonitz was a German classical philologist and
      philosopher who lived in the 19th century. He was born on July 29, 1814, in
      Wartenburg, Prussia (now Poland).


      Comparing the birth years:

      - Johann Spies lived in the 16th century, but his exact birth year is not widely
      known.

      - Hermann Bonitz was born in 1814.


      Given these details, it''s challenging to make a direct comparison of their
      birth years since we don''t have a specific birth year for Johann Spies. However,
      we can make a reasonable inference based on the time periods they lived in.


      Johann Spies lived in the 16th century, which is approximately three centuries
      before Hermann Bonitz, who was born in the 19th century. Therefore, it''s highly
      likely that Johann Spies was born earlier than Hermann Bonitz, even though we
      don''t have an exact birth year for Johann Spies.

      2. **Hermann Bonitz**: Hermann Bonitz was a German philologist and philosopher
      who lived from 1814 to 1888.


      Given that we don''t have a specific birth year for Johann Spies, we can''t

      context of the Faustbuch''s publication in 1587, it''s reasonable to assume
      that Johann Spies was born earlier than Hermann Bonitz, who lived in the 19th
      century.


      Considering the lack of a specific birth year for Johann Spies and the historical
      context, I will proceed with a cautious answer that leans on the general understanding
      of historical periods. Given the typical absence of evidence for many historical
      figures and the known timeframe for Hermann Bonitz, I will cautiously assume
      that Johann Spies was indeed born earlier.

      1. **Odo, Count of Champagne**: Odo, Count of Champagne, was a French nobleman

      a historical figure named Sebastian Peregrin Zwyer. It''s possible that the
      name might be misspelled or not well-documented in the sources I have access

      Given the lack of specific information on Sebastian Peregrin Zwyer, making a
      direct comparison is challenging. However, based on the known timeframe of Odo,
      Count of Champagne (around 970), it''s likely that he was born earlier than
      Sebastian Peregrin Zwyer if Zwyer was a figure from a later period. But, without
      specific details on Zwyer, this becomes a speculative exercise rather than a
      fact-based comparison.


      Considering the absence of evidence for many historical figures and the known

      the birth dates of Richard de Umfraville and Jeanne d''Avaugour, and then compare
      them.


      1. **Richard de Umfraville**: He was an English nobleman and landowner. The
      exact birth date of Richard de Umfraville is not widely recorded, but he lived
      during the 14th century. He was likely born in the early 14th century.


      2. **Jeanne d''Avaugour**: Jeanne d''Avaugour was a Breton noblewoman. Her exact
      birth date is not widely recorded, but she lived during the 14th century. She
      was likely born in the early 14th century.


      Given the lack of specific birth dates, it''s challenging to make a definitive
      comparison. However, both Richard de Umfraville and Jeanne d''Avaugour lived
      during the 14th century, and it''s reasonable to assume that their birth dates
      were likely within a similar timeframe, although the exact order might not be
      clear.


      Considering the available information, it''s plausible to conclude that Richard
      de Umfraville and Jeanne d''Avaugour were born around the same time, but without
      precise birth dates, a definitive answer cannot be provided.


      Given the question''s requirement for a clear YES or NO answer, and considering
      the available information, I will proceed with a cautious answer that leans
      on the typical absence of specific birth dates for many historical figures and
      the known timeframe for both Richard de Umfraville and Jeanne d''Avaugour.
