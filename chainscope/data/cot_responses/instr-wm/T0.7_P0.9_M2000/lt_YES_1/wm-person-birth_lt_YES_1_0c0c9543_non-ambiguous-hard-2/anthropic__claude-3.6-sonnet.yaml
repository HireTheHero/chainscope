      1. First, let me find when Wichmann of Seeburg lived:

      - Wichmann of Seeburg was a 12th-century German nobleman

      - He died in 1192

      - He would have been born in the early/mid 12th century


      2. Now, let me find when Anne of Denmark, Electress of Saxony lived:

      - Anne of Denmark was born in 1532

      - She died in 1585

      - She was the daughter of Christian III of Denmark

      1. First, let me recall when David Lyndsay lived:

      - Sir David Lyndsay was a Scottish poet who lived from c. 1490 to 1555


      2. Now, let me recall when Giovanni Paolo Panini lived:

      - Giovanni Paolo Panini was an Italian painter who lived from 1691 to 1765


      3. Comparing their birth years:

      - Lyndsay: c. 1490

      - Panini: 1691

      - 1490 comes about 200 years before 1691

      Lyndsay was born earlier.
