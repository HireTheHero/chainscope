      14th century. Historical records suggest he was born around 1275.


      3. Jeanne d''Avaugour was a Breton noblewoman who lived in the late 13th/early
      14th century as well. Her birth date is less precisely known.


      4. Without an exact birth date for Jeanne d''Avaugour, I cannot definitively
      state which of them was born earlier.


      5. However, the available historical information suggests Richard de Umfraville
      was likely born around 1275.


      Given the limited information and uncertainty, I cannot confidently answer YES
      or NO.


      But if pressed to make a determination based on the available evidence, I would
      lean towards:


      NO


      (With the caveat that this is not certain and more research would be needed
      to confirm definitively.)'

      Elisabeth Menthe.


      4. Without knowing her birth date, I cannot definitively compare her birth year
      to Henry Percy''s.


      5. However, since Henry Percy lived in the 15th century (1449-1489), and I have
      no evidence of Rosine Elisabeth Menthe living before that time, the most reasonable
      conclusion is that Henry Percy was likely born earlier.


      Therefore, my answer is: YES.'
