      Step 2: Compare the birth dates.

      Gabriele de'' Gabrielli was born much later than Benjamin of Tudela.

      Therefore, the answer is NO. Benjamin of Tudela was born earlier than Gabriele
      de'' Gabrielli.

    c2fd1876-1738-49cf-86ee-b27e22567986: '**Step 1:**


      - Benjamin of Tudela was born in the 12th century, and Gabriele de'' Gabrielli
      was born in the 14th century.

      - This means that Benjamin of Tudela was born much earlier than Gabriele de''
      Gabrielli.


      **Step 2:**


      - Benjamin of Tudela''s birth date is not explicitly mentioned in the context,
      so I cannot determine his exact birth date.

      - Gabriele de'' Gabrielli''s birth date is also not explicitly mentioned, so
      I cannot determine his exact birth date either.

      Benjamin of Tudela is a historical figure mentioned in the context.

      **Step 2:**


      Gabriele de'' Gabrielli is also a historical figure mentioned in the context.

      The birth dates of Benjamin of Tudela and Gabriele de'' Gabrielli are not provided
      in the context.

      **Step 4:**


      Therefore, we cannot answer the question with a YES or NO answer.


      In conclusion, historical figures can be discussed in many ways, but not all
      of them can be answered with a YES or NO. The question in this case requires
      a few steps of reasoning and a search for the birth dates of the historical
      figures mentioned in the context.
