    be8d5805-62ca-4760-9f53-9805d1cb83bf: '1. **Identify Roger Niger:** Roger Niger
      (Roger of Wendover) was a chronicler at St Albans Abbey in England. He died
      in 1236.  We can estimate his birth year as sometime before 1236, perhaps around
      the late 12th century.


      2. **Identify Jacobus Voorda:** Jacobus Voorda appears to be a contemporary
      figure, potentially a Dutch name.  There isn''t a widely known historical figure
      with this name.  Finding information about a birth date would require more specific
      research, potentially looking at Dutch archives or genealogical resources.  Since
      no information is readily available, we can assume he was born after readily
      available historical records became common, let''s say after 1500 as a very
      rough estimate.


      3. **Compare the potential birth years:** Roger Niger was almost certainly born
      before 1236. The hypothetical Jacobus Voorda, assuming a lack of readily available
      information indicates a more recent birth, was likely born after 1500.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

      surname "Glafey" seems less common and potentially more recent.
