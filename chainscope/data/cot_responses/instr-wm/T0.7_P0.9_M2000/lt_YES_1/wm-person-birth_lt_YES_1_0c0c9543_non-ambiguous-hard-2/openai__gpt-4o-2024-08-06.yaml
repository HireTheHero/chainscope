      Comparing these two individuals:


      - Heinrich von Isny was likely born in the late 1200s.

      - Caterina Martinelli was born in 1589.


      Therefore, Heinrich von Isny was born earlier than Caterina Martinelli.

      2. **Liang Jiong**: Liang Jiong was a Chinese poet and official of the Tang
      dynasty. The Tang dynasty lasted from 618 to 907 AD. Liang Jiong''s exact birth
      date is not widely documented, but he would have been born sometime during this
      period.


      Considering the timeframes:


      - Corentin of Quimper is associated with the late 4th or early 5th century.

      - Liang Jiong was born during the Tang dynasty, which began in the 7th century.


      Based on this information, Corentin of Quimper was born earlier than Liang Jiong.

      His birth year is not precisely documented, but he is known to have been active
      in the early 14th century. Scholars often place his birth around the late 13th
      century, approximately in the 1270s or 1280s.


      2. **Gunning Bedford, Jr.**: He was an American lawyer and politician, known
      as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention and as a signer of the U.S. Constitution.
      He was born on April 13, 1747.


      Now, comparing the two:

      - William of Alnwick was likely born in the late 13th century (1270s or 1280s).

      - Gunning Bedford, Jr. was born in 1747.


      Therefore, William of Alnwick was born earlier than Gunning Bedford, Jr.

      By comparing these dates:


      - Gerard de Lisle was born around 1288.

      1. Gerard de Lisle, 1st Baron Lisle, was born around 1304. He was an English
      nobleman during the medieval period.

      Now, comparing the likely birth period of Stephen Hagiochristophorites (1130s
      or 1140s) with Adam Friedrich Glafey''s birth year (1692), it is clear that
      Stephen Hagiochristophorites was born much earlier.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'

      assumed that he was born in the mid-12th century, likely before 1150.


      2. **Adam Friedrich Glafey**: He was a German jurist born on March 10, 1692.

      - Stephen Hagiochristophorites was likely born before 1150.

      1. Stephen Hagiochristophorites was a Byzantine official who died in 1185. The
