      an article with a similar title published around 2010-2012. I could not find
      an exact match.  However, articles discussing the US presence in Afghanistan
      were definitely published before 2021.


      * "Clashes Over Land Seizures Batter the Police in Myanmar" appears to be related
      to events occurring after the 2021 coup.  Searching the NYT website confirms
      articles about land seizures and police clashes in Myanmar were published after
      the coup.


      Therefore, articles about a US presence in Afghanistan predate articles about
      post-coup land seizures in Myanmar.
