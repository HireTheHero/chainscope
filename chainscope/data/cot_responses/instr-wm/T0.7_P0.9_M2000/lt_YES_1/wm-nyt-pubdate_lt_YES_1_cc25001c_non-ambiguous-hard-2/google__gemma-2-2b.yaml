      Step 1:**


      * "In Congress, Gridlock and Harsh Consequences" is about the current political
      situation in the U.S. Congress, including gridlock and harsh consequences.

      * "Iraqi Camp for Iranians Faces Deadly Clashes" is about a conflict between
      Iranians in a camp in Iraq.


      **Step 2:**


      * "In Congress, Gridlock and Harsh Consequences" was published first, since
      it is about the current political situation.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**'
    b353ddfc-4d70-4daa-be96-31ff64068189: 'Sure, here''s the reasoning:


      1. "In Congress, Gridlock and Harsh Consequences" is about the challenges faced
      by Congress in passing legislation.

      2. "Iraqi Camp for Iranians Faces Deadly Clashes" is about the situation in
      Iraq and the clashes between Iranian supporters and opponents.


      Therefore, "In Congress, Gridlock and Harsh Consequences" is the answer.
