      of each headline.


      1. **"Syrian Opposition Joins Meeting of Arab League."**: This headline suggests
      an event where the Syrian opposition is engaging diplomatically with the Arab
      League. Such developments were prominent during the early stages of the Syrian
      Civil War, particularly around 2012-2013, when efforts were being made to involve
      the Syrian opposition in regional diplomacy.


      2. **"Hezbollah Threatens Israel Over Syria Strikes."**: This headline indicates
      a response by Hezbollah to Israeli military actions in Syria. Hezbollah has
      been involved in the Syrian conflict supporting the Assad regime, and Israel
      has conducted numerous strikes in Syria targeting Hezbollah and Iranian interests.
      Such activities have been ongoing but became more prominent and frequent as
      the conflict progressed, especially after 2013.

      - The involvement of the Syrian opposition with the Arab League is an event

      Chief Says His Forces Will Stay in Syria.", we need to identify the publication
      dates of both articles.


      1. **Find the publication date for "Greenpeace Activists May Face Russian Piracy
      Charges."**: This article refers to an event that occurred in 2013 when Greenpeace
      activists were detained by Russian authorities after attempting to board an
      oil platform in the Arctic. The incident and related news coverage, including
      potential piracy charges, occurred around September 2013.

      the leader of Hezbollah, regarding the group''s involvement in the Syrian Civil
      War. Hezbollah''s involvement in Syria was significant during the 2010s, and

      is likely related to the incident involving Greenpeace activists in Russia,
      which occurred in 2013. The specific event took place in September 2013 when
      Greenpeace activists were arrested by Russian authorities.


      2. **"Hezbollah Chief Says His Forces Will Stay in Syria."** - This article
      likely pertains to Hezbollah''s involvement in the Syrian conflict, which has
      been ongoing for several years. However, specific statements about Hezbollah''s
      continued presence in Syria were made by their leader, Hassan Nasrallah, around
      the time of the Syrian civil war, particularly intensifying around 2013 and
      2014.


      By comparing the context and the likely dates of these articles:


      - The Greenpeace article is related to an event in September 2013.

      - The Hezbollah article likely corresponds to events around the same time, but
      given the ongoing nature of the conflict, it could be later than September 2013.

      1. "Cardinals Signal Careful Pace Toward Vote on Pope": This article likely

      Fates in Benghazi Uproar." was published earlier than "Chinese Police Blame
      Religious Extremists for Violence in Region.", we need to consider the events
      related to these articles.


      1. The phrase "Benghazi Uproar" likely refers to the attack on the U.S. diplomatic
      compound in Benghazi, Libya, which occurred on September 11, 2012. Articles
      about this event and its aftermath were predominantly published shortly after
      this date.


      2. The phrase "Chinese Police Blame Religious Extremists for Violence in Region."
      suggests an article related to incidents involving religious extremism in China,
      possibly referring to events in regions like Xinjiang. Such incidents have been
      reported over various years, but without a specific event mentioned, it''s not
      immediately clear when this article was published. However, it''s reasonable
      to assume it could be related to ongoing tensions and incidents in the region.


      Given that the Benghazi event is tied to a specific date in 2012, while the
      article about violence in China could be tied to any number of events over the
      years, it is reasonable to conclude that the Benghazi-related article was likely
      published earlier.

      1. **"Nazi War Crimes Suspect, 98, Dies Awaiting Trial."**: This headline suggests

      1. **Article 1:** "Kerry Says U.S. and Russia Are Working Toward Syria Talks."

      2. **Article 2:** "Discussing Iran, Obama and Netanyahu Display Unity."


      Step 1: Determine the publication date of Article 1.

      - "Kerry Says U.S. and Russia Are Working Toward Syria Talks." This article
      likely pertains to discussions or negotiations involving Syria, Russia, and
      the U.S. during John Kerry''s tenure as Secretary of State. John Kerry served
      as Secretary of State from February 2013 to January 2017.


      Step 2: Determine the publication date of Article 2.

      - "Discussing Iran, Obama and Netanyahu Display Unity." This article likely
      involves discussions between President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu regarding
      Iran, which were prominent during Obama''s presidency, specifically around negotiations
      concerning the Iran nuclear deal. Obama''s presidency was from January 2009
      to January 2017.


      Step 3: Compare the contexts and dates:

      - The discussions involving Syria and John Kerry likely fall into the period
      when Kerry was Secretary of State, between 2013 and 2017.

      - The discussions involving Obama and Netanyahu regarding Iran could have occurred
      at various points during Obama''s presidency, but they were particularly intense
      around the time of the Iran nuclear deal negotiations, which culminated in 2015.

      Iran, Obama and Netanyahu Display Unity.") likely pertains to a period earlier

      \ date for \"Syrian Forces Strike Rebels in Wide-Ranging Assaults.\"**\n   -\
      \ This article is likely to be about events in the Syrian Civil War. The Syrian\
      \ Civil War began in 2011, and major offensives occurred at various times throughout\
      \ the conflict.\n\n2. **Research the publication date for \"Taliban Spokesman\
      \ Is Ousted for \u2018Creating Mistrust\u2019.\"**\n   - This article involves\
      \ a Taliban spokesman, which suggests a connection to the Taliban's activities,\
      \ particularly around the period when the Taliban regained control in Afghanistan\
      \ in 2021.\n\n3. **Compare the dates:**\n   - If the first article was published\
      \ during the Syrian Civil War (2011 onwards) but specifically before the Taliban\

      \   - Without exact publication dates, we can assume that articles related to\

      \ political event within the Palestinian Authority, involving the selection\
      \ of a new premier or prime minister. Such events can be pinpointed to specific\
      \ timeframes when changes in leadership occur.\n\nGiven the nature of these\
      \ articles, we need to consider specific historical events:\n- North Korea faced\
      \ significant U.N. sanctions following nuclear tests in 2006, 2009, 2013, and\
      \ later years.\n- The Palestinian Authority has had several changes in its premiership,\
      \ but the notable selection of a professor as premier points to Rami Hamdallah,\
      \ who was appointed in 2013.\n\nConsidering these contexts:\n- If the U.N. sanctions\
      \ article refers to the 2013 sanctions following North Korea's nuclear test\
      \ in February 2013, this would be around the same time as the selection of Rami\
      \ Hamdallah, who was appointed in June 2013.\n- However, earlier sanctions related\
      \ to North Korea (e.g., after 2006 or 2009 nuclear tests) would precede the\
      \ 2013 appointment in the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThus, if the Korean article\
      \ refers to sanctions prior to 2013, it was published earlier. If it refers\
