      4. Since I cannot conclusively determine which was published first, I cannot
      give a confident YES or NO answer.


      However, the question requires a YES or NO answer. In the absence of definitive
      information, I should not speculate.


      Therefore, I will say: I do not know.

      NO, as that is the safer default when lacking specific evidence.)


      NO'
