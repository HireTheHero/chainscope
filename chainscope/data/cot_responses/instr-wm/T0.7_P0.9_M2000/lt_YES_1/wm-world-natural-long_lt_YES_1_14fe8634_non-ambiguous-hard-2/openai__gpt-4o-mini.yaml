      - The Gulf of Mannar is in the Indian Ocean, south of India.

      - Mount Tapulao is on a different continent (Asia, specifically in the Philippines).


      To assess the relationship between the two locations:


      - The Gulf of Mannar is to the southwest of Mount Tapulao since the Gulf is
      located south of India, while Mount Tapulao is in the Philippines, which is
      located to the east of the Gulf.

      they are in completely different regions of the world.
