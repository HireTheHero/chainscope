      west of Bay of Islands, Newfoundland and Labrador, let''s go through the steps:


      1. **Locate Bay of Islands**: The Bay of Islands is located on the west coast
      of the island of Newfoundland, in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and
      Labrador.


      2. **Locate Gravelly Lake**: There are multiple lakes named Gravelly Lake, so
      we need to identify the correct one in context. One known Gravelly Lake is located
      in the Northwest Territories of Canada, in the western part of the country.


      3. **Compare Longitudinal Positions**: To determine whether Gravelly Lake is
      west of Bay of Islands, we compare their longitudes. Newfoundland is in the
      eastern part of Canada, while the Northwest Territories are much farther west.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since the Gravelly Lake in the Northwest Territories is significantly
      west of Newfoundland and Labrador, it is indeed west of the Bay of Islands.


      Final answer: **YES**.'

      west of the Kitanglad Mountain Range, we need to:


      1. Identify the location of Sayram Lake.

      2. Identify the location of the Kitanglad Mountain Range.

      3. Compare their relative positions to determine if Sayram Lake is west of the
      Kitanglad Mountain Range.


      Step 1: Sayram Lake is located in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in the
      far northwest of China, near the border with Kazakhstan.


      Step 2: The Kitanglad Mountain Range is located in the province of Bukidnon
      on the island of Mindanao in the southern Philippines.


      Step 3: Now, comparing the locations:

      - Sayram Lake is in northwestern China, which is part of mainland Asia.

      - The Kitanglad Mountain Range is located in the Philippines, which is an island
      nation to the southeast of China.


      Since China is generally west of the Philippines, and specifically, northwest
      China (where Sayram Lake is) is much farther west than the southern Philippines
      (where the Kitanglad Range is), we can conclude that Sayram Lake is indeed west
      of the Kitanglad Mountain Range.

      2. Identify the location of Wazee Lake.

      3. Compare their longitudinal coordinates to determine which one is farther
      west.


      **Step 1: Location of Packwood Lake**

      Packwood Lake is located in the state of Washington in the United States. It
      is situated in the Cascade Mountains near the town of Packwood. Geographically,
      it is in the Pacific Northwest region.
