    18e7f09d-0b88-406e-bd00-db6dc10bffd7: '1. **Locate Gravelly Lake:** Gravelly Lake
      is in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.  A quick search reveals
      multiple Gravelly Lakes in the province.  This necessitates more specificity.


      2. **Locate Bay of Islands:** Bay of Islands is a bay on the west coast of Newfoundland.


      3. **Determine Relative Positions:** To answer the question, we need to find
      the location of *a* Gravelly Lake relative to the Bay of Islands.  Several online
      maps show multiple Gravelly Lakes, most notably one near Goose Bay in central
      Labrador, and several smaller ones dispersed throughout the island portion of
      the province.  None appear to be near Bay of Islands.


      4. **West of Bay of Islands:**  "West" of Bay of Islands puts a location in
      the Gulf of St. Lawrence or further inland on the island of Newfoundland.


      5. **Conclusion:** Since the prominent Gravelly Lake is in Labrador and other
      smaller ones are scattered elsewhere throughout Newfoundland but not apparently
      near the Bay of Islands, and since "west" of Bay of Islands points towards the
      Gulf, it''s highly unlikely any Gravelly Lake is west of Bay of Islands.


      NO

    701c6ba1-864e-4d6d-ba60-be16c7635dc6: '1. **Locate Gravelly Lake:**  I need to
      find where Gravelly Lake is. A quick search shows there are several Gravelly
      Lakes.  I need to determine if the question is referring to a specific one or
      making a general statement about *all* Gravelly Lakes.  Without further clarification,
      I''ll assume the question refers to *any* Gravelly Lake.


      2. **Locate Bay of Islands:** The question specifies Bay of Islands, Newfoundland
      and Labrador, so I know precisely which Bay of Islands is being referenced.


      3. **Determine relative location:** Now I need to see if *any* Gravelly Lakes
      are west of the Bay of Islands in Newfoundland.  Research shows that the Bay
      of Islands is on the west coast of Newfoundland. Therefore, for a location to
      be west of it, it would have to be in the ocean.


      4. **Lakes are not in the ocean:** Lakes are bodies of freshwater on land.


      5. **Conclusion:** Since Gravelly Lakes are on land, and the area west of Bay
      of Islands is in the ocean, no Gravelly Lake can be located west of Bay of Islands,
      Newfoundland and Labrador.


      NO

    9ac1785d-353b-401d-989c-0d207a870108: '1. **Identify the locations:** We need
      to find Gravelly Lake and the Bay of Islands.  Both are in Newfoundland and
      Labrador, Canada.


      2. **Determine relative positions:**  We need to figure out if Gravelly Lake
      is *west* of the Bay of Islands. This implies comparing their longitudes.  A
      location further west will have a higher longitude value (in the Western Hemisphere).


      3. **Research locations:** A quick search shows that the Bay of Islands is on
      the west coast of Newfoundland, and Gravelly Lake is on the island''s west coast,
      but further south.


      4. **Compare positions:** Being further south does not necessarily mean it''s
      west or east. Looking at a map confirms Gravelly Lake is slightly southeast,
      and therefore *not west* of the Bay of Islands.


      NO

      3. **Compare Locations:** Washington state is on the west coast of North America,
      while Newfoundland is on the east coast.
