      1. First, let me locate Mount Franklin in New Hampshire

      - Mount Franklin is in the White Mountains of New Hampshire

      - It''s part of the Presidential Range

      - It''s located in the northern part of New Hampshire


      2. Now, let me locate Harper Lake

      - Harper Lake is located in the White Mountains region

      - It''s in the eastern part of New Hampshire

      - It''s east of Mount Franklin


      3. Comparing their positions

      - Since Harper Lake is east of Mount Franklin

      - And the question asks if Harper Lake is west of Mount Franklin

      - The positions are opposite of what''s being asked


      Therefore, NO - Harper Lake is not located west of Mount Franklin (New Hampshire).'

      - Mount Franklin is in the White Mountains of New Hampshire

      - Harper Lake is in New Hampshire''s Lakes Region


      2. Looking at their relative positions:

      - Mount Franklin is part of the Presidential Range in the White Mountains, which

      1) First, let me identify the locations:

      - Kankaria Lake is in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India

      - Sulu Sea is located in the southwestern area of the Philippines


      2) Now, let''s consider their relative positions:

      - India is in South Asia

      1. First, I need to locate Lake James in Indiana

      - Lake James is located in northeastern Indiana

      - Specifically, it''s in Steuben County


      2. Next, I need to locate Lake Humboldt

      - Lake Humboldt is located in Nevada

      - It''s in northwestern Nevada


      3. Now I can compare their relative positions

      - Nevada is entirely west of Indiana

      - Therefore, Lake Humboldt must be west of Lake James
