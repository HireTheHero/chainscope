      1.  **Locate Mount Franklin (New Hampshire):** Mount Franklin is one of the
      peaks in the Presidential Range of the White Mountains in New Hampshire, USA.
      New Hampshire is on the East Coast of the United States.


      2.  **Locate Harper Lake:** There are several "Harper Lakes." The most prominent
      one, often referred to in a geographical context, is Harper Dry Lake in the
      Mojave Desert, San Bernardino County, California. California is on the West
      Coast of the United States. There are other, smaller Harper Lakes in various
      states (e.g., Washington, Colorado, Michigan), all of which are also west of
      New Hampshire.


      3.  **Determine the relative positions:** California (and other states like
      Washington, Colorado, Michigan) is west of New Hampshire.


      4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, Harper Lake (referring to the prominent one in
      California, or indeed most other notable Harper Lakes in the US) is located
      west of Mount Franklin (New Hampshire).

      \ internationally recognized \"Blackwater Reservoir\" which is in Scotland,\
      \ unless there's a strong contextual reason to assume a US one.\n\nRe-evaluation:\
      \ The phrase \"world natural places\" doesn't inherently favor one over the\
      \ other if both are natural. However, a question setter might pick two locations\
      \ that require a bit more thought than an obvious local comparison. Let's re-check\
      \ the US options. The Blackwater River in Virginia is significant and has impoundments\
      \ that could be called reservoirs. If we use that:\nNavesink Highlands (NJ)\
      \ is east of Virginia. So, Navesink Highlands is NOT west of Blackwater Reservoir\
      \ (VA).\n\nThis is a tricky one due to the ambiguity.\nLet's try to find the\
      \ *most likely intended* comparison for a general knowledge question.\nOften,\
      \ such questions test knowledge of prominent features within a country or continent\
      \ if not specified.\nNavesink Highlands is clearly in the US. It's more likely\
      \ to be compared with another US feature if not specified.\nThe Blackwater National\
      \ Wildlife Refuge in Maryland is very famous, and the Blackwater River flows\
      \ through it. The Blackwater River system in Virginia is also significant.\n\
      \nIf we assume a US context for both:\nNavesink Highlands, NJ, is on the East\
      \ Coast.\nAny significant \"Blackwater Reservoir\" in the US (e.g., related\
      \ to the Blackwater River in Virginia/North Carolina, or Florida) would likely\
      \ be south or southwest of New Jersey.\nNew Jersey is generally east of Virginia\
      \ and much of Florida.\nSo, Navesink Highlands would be *east* of a Blackwater\
      \ Reservoir in Virginia or Florida.\n\nGiven this, if the implied context is\
      \ within the USA:\nNavesink Highlands (NJ) is *east* of Blackwater Reservoir\
      \ (VA/FL).\nSo, the statement \"Navesink Highlands located west of Black"

      \ longitude is 74.0\xB0 West.\n\n2.  **Locate Blackwater Reservoir:** There\
