      of "west." In this context, "west" means the direction to the left when facing
      north.


      3. **Compare locations**: Given that British Columbia (where Mount Pierre Elliott
      Trudeau is located) is in western Canada and the Andes (where Cordillera Blanca
      is located) are in South America, we can compare their positions geographically.


      4. **Determine the directional relationship**: Since Canada is north of South
      America and British Columbia is on the western side of Canada, we can conclude
      that Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau is west of Cordillera Blanca.


      Based on the geographical locations and their relative positions, the answer
      to whether Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau is located west of Cordillera Blanca
      is: **YES**'

      western direction) of the reference point.


      3. **Compare locations**: Given that the South Sandwich Islands (where Mount
      Michael is located) are in the southern Atlantic Ocean, and Albania (where the
      Bay of Grama is located) is in Europe, the South Sandwich Islands are generally
      west of Albania. This is because Europe is east of the Atlantic Ocean.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographical locations of the South
      Sandwich Islands (Mount Michael) and Albania (Bay of Grama), Mount Michael is
      indeed west of the Bay of Grama.


      The final answer is: YES

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to identify the locations of Niyamgiri
      and Gippsland Lakes. Niyamgiri is a mountain range located in the state of Odisha,
      India. Gippsland Lakes is a group of lakes and lagoons located in the Gippsland
      region of Victoria, Australia.


      2. **Location of Niyamgiri**: Niyamgiri is situated in the Eastern Ghats mountain
      range in the state of Odisha, India.


      3. **Location of Gippsland Lakes**: Gippsland Lakes is located in the southeastern
      part of Victoria, Australia. It is a network of lakes, marshes, and lagoons.


      4. **Compare locations**: Given that Niyamgiri is in India (Asia) and Gippsland
      Lakes is in Australia (Oceania), we can determine their relative positions geographically.


      5. **Determine west or east relationship**: Since India is located in the eastern
      part of the Indian subcontinent and Australia is located in the southern part
      of the Indo-Australian Plate, we can determine that Niyamgiri is indeed west
      of Gippsland Lakes.


      Based on the geographical locations and their relative positions, the answer
      to whether Niyamgiri is located west of Gippsland Lakes is: **YES**'
    bcb7f451-1738-44ca-8cbf-5f526eb586d4: 'To answer this question, we need to identify
      the locations of Niyamgiri and Gippsland Lakes, and then determine their relative
      positions in terms of the "west" direction.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Niyamgiri is a mountain range located in the
      state of Odisha, India. Gippsland Lakes, on the other hand, are a network of
      lakes, marshes, and lagoons located in the Gippsland region of Victoria, Australia.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: "West" refers to the direction to
      the left when facing north on a map or compass. In this context, we need to
      determine if Niyamgiri is located to the left of Gippsland Lakes when facing
      north.


      3. **Compare locations**: Australia (where Gippsland Lakes are located) is situated
      in the southern hemisphere, while India (where Niyamgiri is located) is in the
      northern hemisphere. Since Australia is generally east of India, Gippsland Lakes
      are likely to be east of Niyamgiri.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations of Niyamgiri (India)
      and Gippsland Lakes (Australia), it is unlikely that Niyamgiri is located west
      of Gippsland Lakes. Instead, Niyamgiri is likely located to the east of Gippsland

      the geographical locations of Namcha Barwa and Lake Galilee (Queensland) and
      determine their relative positions.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Namcha Barwa is a mountain in the eastern Himalayas,
      located in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. Lake Galilee (Queensland) is
      a lake in the state of Queensland, Australia.


      2. **Compare locations**: Given that Namcha Barwa is in the Himalayas (China)
      and Lake Galilee (Queensland) is in Australia, we need to consider their relative
      positions geographically. Australia is located in the southern hemisphere, while
      China is in the northern hemisphere.


      3. **Determine the directional relationship**: Since Australia is in the southern
      hemisphere and China is in the northern hemisphere, they are not directly west-east
      of each other. Instead, they are on opposite sides of the globe. Therefore,
      the concept of "west" or "east" becomes less relevant when comparing locations
      in the northern and southern hemispheres.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Namcha Barwa and Lake Galilee (Queensland) are

      1. **Identify the locations**: Moberly Lake is located in British Columbia,
      Canada, while Chicabal Lake is situated in Guatemala.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: "West of" means the location is to
      the west (or in a more western direction) of the reference point.


      3. **Compare locations**: Given that Canada (where Moberly Lake is located)
      is in North America, and Guatemala (where Chicabal Lake is located) is also
      in North America but further south, Canada is generally west of Guatemala. This
      is because North America is oriented in a north-south direction, with Canada
      being more north and west than Guatemala.

      ocean channel) located in southern Greenland.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: To determine if Lake Tappan is located
      west of Prince Christian Sound, we need to understand the concept of "west."
      West is the direction toward the setting sun, or the direction to the left of
      north on a compass.


      3. **Compare locations**: Given that Lake Tappan is in the United States, which
      is in North America, and Prince Christian Sound is in Greenland, which is an
      island in the North Atlantic Ocean, we can compare their relative positions.
      Greenland is located to the northeast of North America.


      4. **Determine the directional relationship**: Since Greenland is to the northeast
      of North America, and Lake Tappan is located in the United States (which is
      part of North America), we can conclude that Lake Tappan is not located west
      of Prince Christian Sound. Instead, it is located to the southwest of Prince
      Christian Sound.


      In conclusion, the answer is: **NO**'

      Sudirman Range are located. Boeung Kak is a lake located in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.
      Sudirman Range, also known as the Maoke Mountains, is a mountain range in Papua,
      Indonesia.


      2. **Determine the directional relationship**: Given that Boeung Kak is in Cambodia
      and Sudirman Range is in Indonesia, we need to consider their relative positions
      geographically. Cambodia is located in Southeast Asia, while Indonesia is also
      in Southeast Asia, but it is an archipelago nation with numerous islands spread
      across the region.


      3. **Conclusion**: Since Cambodia (where Boeung Kak is located) is generally
      west of Indonesia (where Sudirman Range is located), Boeung Kak is indeed west
      of Sudirman Range.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      of Asia, locations in Nepal are typically west of locations in Japan. This is
      because Nepal is situated on the western side of the continent, while Japan
      is located on the eastern side.


      Based on these considerations, we can conclude that Imja Tsho in Nepal is indeed
      located west of Daisetsuzan Volcanic Group in Japan.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Imja
      Tsho and Daisetsuzan Volcanic Group. Imja Tsho is a glacial lake located in
      the Himalayas, specifically in Nepal. Daisetsuzan Volcanic Group is a volcanic
      group in Hokkaido, Japan.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: Next, we need to understand the concept
      of "west." West means the direction that is to the left of north when facing
      the equator. It''s the opposite of east.


      3. **Compare locations**: Given that Nepal (where Imja Tsho is located) is in
      South Asia, and Japan (where Daisetsuzan Volcanic Group is located) is in East
      Asia, we can determine their relative positions. Generally, locations in South
      Asia are west of locations in East Asia.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations of Nepal (Imja Tsho)
      and Japan (Daisetsuzan Volcanic Group), we can conclude that Imja Tsho is indeed
      west of Daisetsuzan Volcanic Group.
