    551bf824-d1a9-4985-9410-072fbc11429d: '1. **Find the locations:** We need the
      locations of both structures to determine their relative east/west positions.

      2. **Determine Longitude:** Longitude is the key factor in determining east/west
      positioning.  A location further east will have a higher degree of longitude
      (more positive, closer to the Prime Meridian going east).

      3. **Compare Longitudes:** Compare the longitudes of the two locations.


      Basilica of Regina Pacis, Brooklyn, NY is located at approximately -73.97 longitude.


      Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus, Joliet, IL is located at approximately -88.23
      longitude.


      Since -73.97 is greater than -88.23, the Basilica of Regina Pacis is east of
      the Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus.

      location further East has a higher longitude value (more positive, or less negative).

      3. **Look up longitudes:** We need to find the longitude of each basilica.

      4. **Compare longitudes:**  If the longitude of Basilica of Regina Pacis is
      greater than the longitude of Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus, the answer
      is YES. Otherwise, the answer is NO.


      Basilica of Regina Pacis, Brooklyn, NY is located at approximately -73.9 degrees
      longitude.

      Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus, Joliet, IL is located at approximately -88.2

      of St. Raymond Nonnatus is in Joliet, Illinois (IL).


      2. **Determine the general east-west relationship between NY and IL:** New York
      is generally east of Illinois.


      3. **Consider any potential exceptions:** While some parts of very eastern IL
      might be slightly east of very western portions of NY due to the curvature of
      the Earth and state boundaries, Joliet is firmly in the northern/central portion
      of Illinois, well west of most of New York. The Basilica of Regina Pacis is
