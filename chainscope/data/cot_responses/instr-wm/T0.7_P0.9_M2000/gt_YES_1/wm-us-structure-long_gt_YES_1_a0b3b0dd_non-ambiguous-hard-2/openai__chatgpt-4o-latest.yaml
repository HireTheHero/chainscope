      Reservoir in Texas is located east of Parker Canyon Lake in Arizona, we need
      to identify the relative geographic positions of both bodies of water.


      **Step 1: Locate Parker Canyon Lake, AZ**

      - Parker Canyon Lake is in southeastern Arizona, near the border with Mexico.

      - It is located in Cochise County, Arizona.


      **Step 2: Locate Richland-Chambers Reservoir, TX**

      - Richland-Chambers Reservoir is located in east-central Texas.

      - It is situated in Navarro and Freestone counties, southeast of the city of
      Corsicana.


      **Step 3: Compare longitudinal (east-west) positions**

      - Arizona is generally west of Texas.

      - Parker Canyon Lake is in the southeastern part of Arizona, which is still
      west of central and eastern Texas.

      - Richland-Chambers Reservoir is in east-central Texas, considerably farther
      east than any location in Arizona.


      **Conclusion:**

      Since Richland-Chambers Reservoir is in east-central Texas and Parker Canyon
      Lake is in southeastern Arizona, the reservoir is clearly east of the lake.

      located east of Lake Mohawk (Ohio), OH, let''s go through the reasoning step
      by step.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Watson Pond, MA.

      - Watson Pond is in Taunton, Massachusetts.

      - Taunton is located in southeastern Massachusetts.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Mohawk (Ohio), OH.

      - Lake Mohawk is a census-designated place in Carroll County, in eastern Ohio.


      Step 3: Compare the relative longitudinal positions of the two locations.

      - Massachusetts is in the eastern part of the United States.

      - Ohio is located to the west of Massachusetts.

      - Therefore, Taunton, MA (and Watson Pond) is east of Carroll County, OH (and
      Lake Mohawk).


      Conclusion:

      Since Massachusetts is east of Ohio, Watson Pond, MA is located east of Lake
      Mohawk, OH.
