      2. **Understand the geography**: Rockport Reservoir is located in the state
      of Utah, and Saint Sophia Cathedral is in Los Angeles, California.


      3. **Determine the general geographical positions of Utah and California**:
      Utah is located east of California within the United States.


      4. **Consider the specific locations within their states**: Rockport Reservoir
      is in northeastern Utah. Saint Sophia Cathedral is in Los Angeles, which is
      in southern California.


      5. **Apply geographical knowledge to compare locations**: Since Utah is east
      of California, any location in Utah (like Rockport Reservoir) will be east of
      any location in California (like Los Angeles, where Saint Sophia Cathedral is

      positions (east-west positions). Florida is known to be one of the southeastern
      states, which generally places it east of Iowa.


      Given these considerations, the Sarasota Opera House in Florida is indeed located
      east of St. Raphael''s Cathedral in Dubuque, Iowa.

      \ consider - Sarang Community Church of Southern California, CA, and St. Mark's\
      \ Episcopal Cathedral, Seattle, WA.\n\n2. **Understand the geography**: California\
      \ (CA) is a state located on the West Coast of the United States, while Washington\
      \ (WA), where Seattle is located, is also on the West Coast but is situated\
      \ north of California.\n\n3. **Determine the relative positions**: Since both\
      \ locations are on the West Coast, we need to consider their longitudinal (east-west)\
      \ positions relative to each other. However, given that both are on the western\
      \ edge of the United States, the critical factor is their latitudinal (north-south)\
      \ positions and the general geography of the region.\n\n4. **Consider Seattle\
      \ and California's general positions**: Seattle, WA, is north of the southern\
      \ part of California. \n\n5. **Analyze the east-west positioning**: Given the\
      \ question asks if one location is east of the other, we must consider the general\
      \ east-west layout of the United States. The entire West Coast, including both\
      \ California and Washington, is relatively far to the west. The question of\
      \ one being east of the other depends on their specific longitudes.\n\n6. **Conclusion\
      \ based on geography**: Since both locations are on the West Coast and given\
      \ that Seattle is north and slightly east due to the curvature of the coastline\
      \ and the positioning of the states, but not significantly so as to change the\
      \ overall east-west relationship dramatically, we must consider the actual longitude\
      \ of each location. However, without specific longitudes provided, the general\
      \ assumption based on the West Coast geography would suggest that Seattle (being\
      \ part of the state of Washington) and a location in Southern California are\
      \ both far to the west. The significant factor here is the north-south difference\
      \ rather than the east-west, as both are near the Pacific Ocean.\n\n7. **Final\
      \ determination**: To be east of something means you are to the east on the\
      \ map relative to that something. Given the general westward position of both\
      \ locations and without exact coordinates, the question seems to test understanding\
      \ of relative positions on a map. Since Seattle is generally northwest of Southern\
      \ California, it's not straightforward to say one is east of the other without\
      \ considering their specific longitudes. However, considering typical geographical\
      \ knowledge, Seattle is not significantly east of Southern California; it's\
      \ more north. \n\nGiven this analysis, the answer to whether Sarang Community\
      \ Church of Southern California, CA, is located east of St. Mark's Episcopal\
      \ Cathedral, Seattle, WA, is based on understanding that \"east\" implies a\
      \ position to the east on a map. Since Seattle is generally to the north and\
      \ not significantly to the east of Southern California, and considering the\
      \ context of the question which implies a need to understand if one location\
      \ is to the east of the other in a broad geographical sense:\n\nThe final answer\

      \ and slightly east of Nevada, a location in Arizona (like Apache Lake) would\
      \ generally be southeast of a location in southern Nevada (like the Copper Mountain\
      \ Solar Facility).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that Apache Lake is in\

      \ of the Copper Mountain Solar Facility.\n\n6. **Final Analysis**:\n   - While\
      \ Apache Lake is southeast of the Copper Mountain Solar Facility, \"east\" does\
      \ not fully capture the southeast relationship. However, in a broad geographic\
      \ sense, southeast does include an easterly direction. But for precision in\
      \ direct cardinal directions without additional context of their exact longitudes,\
      \ we consider \"east\" to mean directly east or slightly more than the direct\
      \ southward direction from one point to another.\n\nGiven the above steps and\
      \ understanding, the answer to whether Apache Lake (Arizona) is located east\
      \ of Copper Mountain Solar Facility (Nevada) would be **NO**, because while\
      \ it is southeast, which includes an easterly component, the direct question\
      \ of \"east\" implies a direction that might not fully capture the nuance of\
      \ their geographic relationship, emphasizing the importance of considering both\
      \ latitude and longitude in such comparisons."

    3a9d138a-d0c6-419f-a1a1-9a7f0e850663: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Apache Lake is in Arizona (AZ), and Copper Mountain
      Solar Facility is in Nevada (NV).


      2. **Understand the geography**: Arizona and Nevada are adjacent states in the
      United States. Arizona is located to the east of Nevada.


      3. **Consider the specific locations within the states**: Apache Lake in Arizona
      and Copper Mountain Solar Facility in Nevada. We need to determine their relative
      positions, specifically whether Apache Lake is east of the Copper Mountain Solar
      Facility.


      4. **General knowledge of US geography**: The western part of Arizona shares
      a border with the southern part of Nevada. Given that Copper Mountain Solar
      Facility is in Nevada, for Apache Lake to be east of it, Apache Lake would need
      to be on the eastern side of Arizona, closer to the New Mexico border, or at
      least not as far west as the Arizona-Nevada border.


      5. **Specific location of Apache Lake**: Apache Lake is located in the Tonto
      National Forest in Arizona. It''s more towards the central part of Arizona,
      not as far east as the Arizona-New Mexico border but definitely east of the
      Arizona-Nevada border.


      6. **Copper Mountain Solar Facility location**: This facility is in Boulder
      City, Nevada, which is relatively close to the Arizona-Nevada border, specifically
      southwest of the Hoover Dam.


      7. **Determining east-west relationship**: Given that Apache Lake is in central
      Arizona and Copper Mountain Solar Facility is in southern Nevada near the Arizona
      border, Apache Lake is indeed east of the facility because Arizona lies to the
      east of Nevada.


      **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical relationship between Arizona and Nevada,
      and the specific locations of Apache Lake and Copper Mountain Solar Facility,
      Apache Lake is indeed east of Copper Mountain Solar Facility.

      the locations of C. J. Strike Dam, ID, and Mount Baker Theatre, WA, and then
      figure out which one is east of the other.


      1. **Location of C. J. Strike Dam, ID**: C. J. Strike Dam is located in Idaho.
      Idaho is a state in the northwestern United States.


      2. **Location of Mount Baker Theatre, WA**: Mount Baker Theatre is located in
      Washington state. Washington is also a state in the northwestern United States,
      situated directly west of Idaho.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Given that Idaho is east of Washington, any location
      in Idaho would be east of any location in Washington.


      Therefore, since C. J. Strike Dam is in Idaho and Mount Baker Theatre is in
      Washington, and Idaho is east of Washington, it follows that C. J. Strike Dam,
      ID, is indeed east of Mount Baker Theatre, WA.


      ANSWER: YES'

      \ **Identify Locations**:\n   - C. J. Strike Dam is located in Idaho.\n   -\
      \ Mount Baker Theatre is located in Washington state.\n\n2. **Understand Geographic\
      \ Relationship**:\n   - Idaho is a state located east of Washington state in\

      \ in southwestern Idaho.\n   - Mount Baker Theatre is in Bellingham, Washington,\
      \ which is in the northwestern part of the state.\n\n4. **Compare Longitudes**:\n\
      \   - Generally, Idaho is east of Washington. However, to be precise, we need\
      \ to consider the specific longitudes of these locations.\n   - The longitude\
      \ of C. J. Strike Dam is approximately 116.05\xB0 W.\n   - The longitude of\
      \ Bellingham, Washington (where Mount Baker Theatre is located), is approximately\
      \ 122.47\xB0 W.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since 116.05\xB0 W (C. J. Strike\
      \ Dam) is less than 122.47\xB0 W (Mount Baker Theatre), C. J. Strike Dam is\
      \ indeed located east of Mount Baker Theatre.\n\nGiven these steps, the answer\

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to identify Sandals Church, CA, and Lost
      Creek Lake, OR. Sandals Church is in California, and Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon.


      2. **Understand the geography**: California (CA) and Oregon (OR) are two states
      in the United States. California is located to the south of Oregon.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Without knowing the exact locations
      of Sandals Church and Lost Creek Lake, we can consider their general positions
      based on their states. Since California is south of Oregon, any location in
      California would generally be south (and possibly slightly east or west, depending
      on the specific locations) of any location in Oregon.


      4. **Consider the specific question**: The question asks if Sandals Church,
      CA, is located east of Lost Creek Lake, OR. Given that California is south of
      Oregon, for Sandals Church to be east of Lost Creek Lake, it would have to be
      significantly east of it, considering the general north-south alignment of the
      state borders.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since California is generally south of Oregon, and without
      more specific information about the exact longitudes of these locations, we
      cannot definitively say that Sandals Church, CA, is east of Lost Creek Lake,
      OR, based solely on their states. However, considering the general geography,
      it''s more likely that Sandals Church would be south rather than east of Lost
      Creek Lake. But, to answer the question with a simple YES or NO without specific
      longitudes or more detailed geographical information, we must consider if it''s
      possible for any part of California to be east of any part of Oregon. Given
      the shapes and positions of these states, there could be scenarios where parts
      of California are east of parts of Oregon, especially considering the western
      United States'' geography.


      However, the question seems to be asking for a definitive geographical comparison
      without providing specific longitude information for these locations. Given
      this, the most straightforward answer, based on typical geographical understanding
      and without precise location data, would lean towards the fact that California
      is generally south of Oregon, but the question''s phrasing suggests a need for

      \   - **Eighth & Main, ID**: This refers to a specific address or location in\
      \ Idaho. Idaho is a state in the northwestern United States.\n   - **Red Bluff\
      \ Diversion Dam, CA**: This is a dam located in California, specifically on\
      \ the Sacramento River. California is a state on the West Coast of the United\
      \ States.\n\n2. **Understand Geographic Relations**:\n   - Idaho is located\
      \ to the east of California. However, the question is about specific locations\
      \ within these states, not the states themselves.\n\n3. **Consider Specific\
      \ Locations**:\n   - Without exact coordinates, we know that Idaho is generally\
      \ east of California. However, to answer this question, we need to consider\
      \ the westernmost part of Idaho and the easternmost part of California to understand\
      \ the potential overlap or relation.\n\n4. **Geographic Extremes**:\n   - The\
      \ westernmost part of Idaho is near the Oregon-Idaho border, close to the Snake\
      \ River.\n   - The easternmost part of California includes areas near the Nevada\
      \ and Arizona borders, but for our purposes, we're considering its relation\
      \ to Idaho, which would involve areas like the Modoc National Forest or the\
      \ region around the Red Bluff Diversion Dam.\n\n5. **Red Bluff Diversion Dam\
      \ Location**:\n   - The Red Bluff Diversion Dam is located in the northern part\
      \ of California, near the city of Red Bluff. This is relatively far west compared\
      \ to Idaho's eastern border.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that Idaho is\
      \ east of California and considering the locations mentioned, Eighth & Main\
      \ in Idaho would indeed be east of the Red Bluff Diversion Dam in California,\
      \ as the entire state of Idaho lies to the east of California.\n\nThe final\

      1. First, we identify the states where the dams are located: Montana (MT) for
      Fort Peck Dam and Washington (WA) for Ice Harbor Dam.

      2. Next, we consider the general geography of the United States. Montana is
      located in the north-central part of the U.S., and Washington is in the far
      northwest.

      3. Since Washington is on the west coast, anything east of it would be towards
      the central or eastern parts of the United States.

      4. Montana, being more central and not on the west coast, is indeed east of
      Washington state.


      Given these steps, we conclude that Fort Peck Dam, MT is indeed east of Ice
      Harbor Dam, WA.


      YES.'

      \ The more west a location is, the higher its longitude number (up to 180 degrees\
      \ west for the westernmost parts of the world). Montana's longitude ranges are\
      \ roughly between 104\xB0 and 116\xB0 west, while Washington's ranges are roughly\

      part of California.


      4. **Longitude Comparison**: To determine if Lake Mohave is east of Loch Lomond,
      we compare their longitudes. Since Arizona is generally to the east of California,
      we can infer that Lake Mohave, being in Arizona, would be east of locations
      in California, including Loch Lomond.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Arizona is east of California, and considering

    623ec1ba-f9d9-4f9f-aa87-2c8070a8f3e2: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We have two locations to consider - Piqua Nuclear
      Generating Station, OH, and Hillsdale Lake, KS. The first is in Ohio, and the
      second is in Kansas.


      2. **Understand the geographical context**: Ohio is located in the Eastern United
      States, while Kansas is in the Central United States. Generally, when moving
      from Kansas to Ohio, one would be moving eastward.


      3. **Specific locations within states**: Now, we need to consider where within
      these states our specific locations are. Piqua, Ohio, is in the western part
      of Ohio. Hillsdale Lake, Kansas, is in the eastern part of Kansas.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Given that Piqua, Ohio, is in the western part
      of Ohio and Hillsdale Lake, Kansas, is in the eastern part of Kansas, and knowing
      that Ohio is generally east of Kansas, we need to determine if the specific
      location of Piqua is east of Hillsdale Lake.


      5. **Determine the answer**: Since Piqua, Ohio, is in the western part of Ohio
      and considering Ohio''s eastern position relative to Kansas, Piqua would still
      be east of Hillsdale Lake, Kansas, because the entirety of Ohio is east of the
      entirety of Kansas.


      Based on the step-by-step analysis, the answer is: **YES**'

      1. **Identify the locations**: Big Stone Lake is in South Dakota (SD), and Sahuarita
      Lake is in Arizona (AZ).


      2. **General geography of the United States**: Arizona is located in the southwestern
      part of the United States, while South Dakota is in the northern part of the
      Great Plains region, which is more towards the center of the U.S. but significantly
      north and somewhat east of Arizona.


      3. **Determine the relative east-west positions**: Since Arizona is in the southwest,
      any location that is not in the westernmost parts of the U.S. and is significantly
      to the east or northeast of Arizona would be considered east of it. South Dakota,
      being centrally located but to the north, would indeed be east of Arizona when
      considering the country''s overall geography.


      Given these steps, Big Stone Lake, SD would indeed be east of Sahuarita Lake,

      both.


      1. First, identify the locations: Big Stone Lake is located in South Dakota,
      and Sahuarita Lake is in Arizona.

      2. Next, consider their general positions in the United States: South Dakota
      is in the northern part of the U.S., relatively central but leaning towards
      the east, while Arizona is in the southwest.

      3. Now, compare their longitudinal positions (east-west): Arizona is generally
      west of South Dakota because it is in the southwest, and South Dakota is more
      towards the central-northeast part of the U.S.

      number (in the Western Hemisphere). Arizona has a higher longitude than South
      Dakota, indicating Arizona is west of South Dakota.

    ee900aa3-b0c1-492a-b986-db211c3b02bb: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Minidoka Dam is located in Idaho (ID), and Anderson
      Lake is in California (CA).


      2. **Understand the geography**: Idaho is a state located in the northwestern
      United States, and California is a state on the West Coast.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Since both Idaho and California are western states,
      we need to consider their relative positions. Idaho is landlocked and situated
      east of the Cascade Range and the Sierra Nevada mountains, which run along the
      border between California and Nevada/Oregon. California, being on the coast,
      is west of Idaho.


      4. **Consider Anderson Lake''s location within California**: Without specific
      knowledge of Anderson Lake''s exact location within California, we can still
      infer based on the state''s geography. California spans a significant portion
      of the western coast of the United States, but given that it''s a coastal state,
      any location within it would generally be west of Idaho.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Idaho (where Minidoka Dam is located) is east
      of California (where Anderson Lake is located), it follows that Minidoka Dam,
      ID, is indeed east of Anderson Lake, CA.


      The answer is: YES'

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to understand the locations mentioned.
      King Mountain Wind Farm is in Texas (TX), and Causey Reservoir is in Utah (UT).


      2. **Understand Geographic Terms**: "East of" is a geographic term that means
      something is located to the east, or in the direction the sun rises, relative
      to something else.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Texas (where King Mountain Wind Farm is located) and
      Utah (where Causey Reservoir is located) are both in the United States but are
      not adjacent to each other. Texas is generally southeast of Utah.


      4. **Determine Direction**: Since Texas is southeast of Utah, structures in
      Texas would generally be southeast, not east, of structures in Utah. However,
      the question asks if King Mountain Wind Farm is east of Causey Reservoir, which
      requires a more precise understanding of their relative positions.


      5. **Consider the Possibility**: Given that Texas is to the southeast of Utah,
      it is possible for a location in Texas to be east of a location in Utah, depending
      on the exact positions of the two locations relative to each other. However,
      considering the general geography, Texas is more to the south than directly
      east of Utah.


      6. **Conclusion**: Without exact coordinates, we rely on general geographic
      knowledge. Considering Texas is generally southeast of Utah, for King Mountain
      Wind Farm to be directly east of Causey Reservoir, it would need to be positioned
      in such a way that it is more eastward than southward relative to Causey Reservoir.
      However, given the broad nature of states and the fact that Texas is more south
      than east of Utah, it''s less likely but not impossible without precise locations.

      \ located east of Badin Lake, NC, let's analyze the locations step by step:\n\
      \n1. **Identify the locations**: \n   - 2 Columbus Circle is in New York City,\
      \ New York.\n   - Badin Lake is in North Carolina.\n\n2. **Determine the general\
      \ geographic locations**:\n   - New York City is in the Northeastern United\
      \ States.\n   - Badin Lake, North Carolina, is in the Southeastern United States.\n\
      \n3. **Consider the longitudinal positions**:\n   - New York City is at a higher\
      \ latitude and longitude compared to most of North Carolina. However, longitude\
      \ (east-west position) is what matters for determining if one location is east\
      \ of another.\n   - Generally, as you move south along the East Coast of the\
      \ United States, the longitude decreases slightly due to the curvature of the\
      \ Earth and the orientation of the coastlines. However, the difference in longitude\
      \ between New York and North Carolina is not significant enough to override\
      \ the general east-west positioning based on their latitudes and the fact that\
      \ both are on the East Coast.\n\n4. **Make a comparison**:\n   - New York City\
      \ is north and slightly east of North Carolina due to the shape of the U.S.\
      \ East Coast. \n   - Given that Badin Lake is in North Carolina, which is south\
      \ of New York, and considering the east coast's geography, New York would generally\
      \ be northeast of North Carolina, not strictly east but more north than east\
      \ in relation to North Carolina.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the geography\
      \ and relative positions, 2 Columbus Circle, NY is not strictly east of Badin\
      \ Lake, NC; it's more to the north. Therefore, the answer is NO, considering\
