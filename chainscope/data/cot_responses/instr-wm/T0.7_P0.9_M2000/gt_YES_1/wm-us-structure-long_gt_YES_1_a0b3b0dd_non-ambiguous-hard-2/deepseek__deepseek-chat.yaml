      of Olympia Centre.


      ---


      ### Step 1: Locate the Cyclorama Building in Gettysburg, PA

      The Cyclorama Building is located in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Gettysburg is
      in the eastern part of the United States, specifically in the northeastern region.


      ---


      ### Step 2: Locate Olympia Centre in IL

      Olympia Centre is a building in Chicago, Illinois. Chicago is in the Midwestern
      United States, located further west than Gettysburg, PA.


      ---


      ### Step 3: Compare the locations

      Gettysburg, PA, is east of Chicago, IL. Therefore, the Cyclorama Building in
      Gettysburg is east of Olympia Centre in Chicago.

      the relative geographic positions of Rosary Cathedral in Toledo, Ohio, and Omaha
      Community Playhouse in Omaha, Nebraska.


      ### Step-by-step reasoning:

      1. **Locate Toledo, Ohio**: Toledo is in the northwestern part of Ohio, near
      the border with Michigan. It is situated to the east of the central United States.

      2. **Locate Omaha, Nebraska**: Omaha is in the eastern part of Nebraska, near
      the border with Iowa. It is located further west than Toledo, Ohio.

      3. **Compare their positions**: Since Toledo, Ohio, is east of Omaha, Nebraska,
      any structure in Toledo (like Rosary Cathedral) will also be east of any structure
      in Omaha (like Omaha Community Playhouse).

    655abfcd-03b9-4860-9c3b-0e274dde0ac8: 'To determine whether the Basilica of Saints
      Peter and Paul in Lewiston, Maine, is located east of the Brewster-Douglass
      Housing Projects in Michigan, we need to consider the geographic locations of
      these two places.


      1. **Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul**: This is located in Lewiston, Maine,
      which is in the northeastern part of the United States.

      2. **Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects**: These were located in Detroit, Michigan,
      which is in the Midwestern part of the United States.


      Now, let''s analyze their relative positions:

      - Maine is generally to the east of Michigan. Lewiston, Maine, is significantly
      farther east than Detroit, Michigan.


      Therefore, the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul in Lewiston, Maine, is indeed
      located east of the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects in Michigan.

      \ Temple in Washington, D.C. To determine this, I'll need to understand the\
      \ geographical locations of both places and then compare their positions relative\
      \ to each other.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\n**Sterling Memorial\
      \ Library** is located in New Haven, Connecticut. Connecticut is a state in\
      \ the northeastern part of the United States.\n\n**House of the Temple** is\
      \ in Washington, D.C., which is the capital of the United States. Washington,\
      \ D.C., is situated along the East Coast, between the states of Maryland and\
      \ Virginia.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Geographical Layout\n\nTo determine\
      \ if one location is east of the other, I need to look at their positions on\
      \ a map. Generally, moving from west to east across the United States, regions\
      \ are arranged from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n### Step 3:\
      \ Locate Connecticut and Washington, D.C., on the Map\n\n**Connecticut** is\
      \ one of the New England states, located in the northeastern corner of the U.S.\
      \ It borders Massachusetts to the north, Rhode Island to the east, and New York\
      \ to the west.\n\n**Washington, D.C.** is located in the Mid-Atlantic region,\
      \ south of Maryland and north of Virginia.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Relative\
      \ Positions\n\nLooking at a map:\n\n- **Connecticut** is situated to the northeast\
      \ of **Washington, D.C.**\n  \n  - Specifically, **New Haven, CT**, where Sterling\
      \ Memorial Library is located, is to the northeast of Washington, D.C.\n\n###\
      \ Step 5: Define \"East\"\n\nIn geographical terms, \"east\" refers to the direction\
      \ towards the sunrise, which is to the right on most maps.\n\n### Step 6: Compare\
      \ the Longitudes\n\nTo be more precise, I can compare the longitudes of both\
      \ locations:\n\n- **Washington, D.C.** has a longitude of approximately 77\xB0\
      \ W.\n  \n- **New Haven, CT**, has a longitude of approximately 72\xB0 W.\n\n\
      Since 72\xB0 W is numerically smaller (further east) than 77\xB0 W, **New Haven,\

      \ Sterling Memorial Library is in New Haven, Connecticut, and New Haven is east\
