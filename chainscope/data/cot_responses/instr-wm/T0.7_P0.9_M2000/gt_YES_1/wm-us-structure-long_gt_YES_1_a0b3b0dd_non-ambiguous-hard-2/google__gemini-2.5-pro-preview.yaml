      1.  **Location 1:** 41 Cooper Square is in New York, NY.

      2.  **Location 2:** Gibson Generating Station is in Owensville, Indiana (though
      often associated with Illinois due to its proximity and service area, its physical
      location is Indiana, near the Illinois border). Even if we consider it as "IL"
      for the sake of the question referring to Illinois, the core logic remains the
      same.

      3.  **Geographic Relationship:** New York (NY) is on the East Coast of the United
      States. Illinois (IL) and Indiana (IN) are Midwestern states.

      4.  **Conclusion:** The East Coast (where NY is) is east of the Midwest (where
      IL/IN are). Therefore, 41 Cooper Square, NY is east of Gibson Generating Station.

      1.  **Identify the location of 41 Cooper Square:** This building is in New York
      City, New York (NY).

      2.  **Identify the location of Gibson Generating Station:** The question states

    d7ba2ca9-c558-444e-bdaf-3e1bfe480dbe: 'Okay, let''s break this down:


      1.  **Locate 2 Columbus Circle, NY:** This address is in Manhattan, New York
      City. New York City is on the eastern coast of the United States.

      2.  **Locate Badin Lake, NC:** Badin Lake is in North Carolina. While North
      Carolina is an eastern state, Badin Lake is situated more towards the central/western
      part of North Carolina, in the Piedmont region.

      3.  **Compare their longitudes (east-west position):** New York City is significantly
      further east than central North Carolina. If you were to draw a vertical line
      (longitude) through Badin Lake, New York City would be to the east of that line.


      Therefore, 2 Columbus Circle, NY is located east of Badin Lake, NC.
