    ffe2227f-964c-4507-bd86-e3b2b11bd31a: 'If you are a student of geography, you
      may have heard about the term "East-West" or "North-South". These terms are
      used to describe the direction of a line, and the distance between two points
      along that line.


      In this question, we are asked to find the distance between two points on a
      line, and we are given the following information:


      - The line is located east of the Pacific Ocean.

      - The line is located north of the Mississippi River.

      - The line is located south of the Atlantic Ocean.


      To find the distance between the two points, we need to use the Pythagorean
      Theorem. The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square
      of the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the
      squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the two points
      are the ends of the line, and we can assume that the line is a right triangle
      with the hypotenuse as the line itself.


      Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find the distance between the two points
      as follows:


      - The distance between the two points is the square root of the sum of the squares
      of the distances between each point and the line.

      - The distance between each point and the line is the distance from that point
      to the nearest point on the line.

      - The distance from each point to the nearest point on the line is the distance
      from that point to the nearest point on the line, which is the distance from
      the point to the nearest point on the line, which is the distance from that
      point to the nearest point on the line.

      - The distance from each point to the nearest point on the line is the distance
      from that point to the nearest point on the line, which is the distance from
      that point to the nearest point on the line.

      - The distance from each point to the nearest point on the line is the distance
      from that point to the nearest point on the line.

      - The distance from each point to the nearest point on the line is the distance
      from that point to the nearest point on the line.

      - The distance from each point to the nearest point on the line is the distance
      from that point to the nearest point on the line.

      the East Branch Clarion River Lake in Pennsylvania and the Episcopal Cathedral
      of Saint Philip in Georgia. To answer this question, we need to understand the
      geography of the United States and the location of these two structures.


      The East Branch Clarion River Lake is located in Pennsylvania, specifically
      in the state''s northwestern corner. It is part of a larger river system, the
      Clarion River, which flows through the Allegheny National Forest and into Lake
      Erie. The lake is a popular destination for fishing, boating, and swimming,
      and is home to a variety of fish species, including walleye, smallmouth bass,
      and northern pike.


      The Episcopal Cathedral of Saint Philip is located in Atlanta, Georgia. It is
      the second-largest cathedral in the United States, and is the seat of the Episcopal
      Diocese of Atlanta. The cathedral is known for its impressive architecture,
      with a stunning stained glass window, and a 1,000-seat auditorium. It is also
      home to a number of religious and educational programs, including a summer camp
      for children and a youth ministry program.


      To answer the question, we need to understand the geography of the United States
      and the location of these two structures. The East Branch Clarion River Lake
      is located in Pennsylvania, while the Episcopal Cathedral of Saint Philip is
      located in Georgia. Therefore, the answer is NO, the East Branch Clarion River
      Lake is not located east of the Episcopal Cathedral of Saint Philip.


      In conclusion, the East Branch Clarion River Lake is located in Pennsylvania,
