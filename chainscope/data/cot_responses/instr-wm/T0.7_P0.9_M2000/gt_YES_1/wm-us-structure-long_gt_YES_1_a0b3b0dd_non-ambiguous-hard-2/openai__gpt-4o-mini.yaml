      3. **Determine the relative positions**: To find out if the shrine is east of
      Lac qui Parle, we can visualize or consult a map. Since the shrine is in northeastern
      Wisconsin and Lac qui Parle is in western Minnesota, we can see that northeastern
      Wisconsin is significantly to the east of western Minnesota.


      Based on this reasoning, we conclude that the National Shrine of Our Lady of
      Good Help is indeed east of Lac qui Parle.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'

    dd14d03c-da0a-47a1-bd9b-932aadaf1e3d: 'To determine whether the Astor Court Building
      in New York is located east of Tappan Lake in Ohio, we need to consider the
      geographical locations of both places.


      1. **Locate Tappan Lake, OH**: Tappan Lake is located in the eastern part of
      Ohio, specifically in Harrison County.


      2. **Locate Astor Court Building, NY**: The Astor Court Building is located
      in New York City, which is in the southeastern part of New York State.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: New York City is east of Ohio. Since

      east.


      4. **East-West Orientation**: Generally, if a place is to the northeast, it

      is south of Nebraska, and Nashville is generally to the southeast of Nebraska.


      4. **Visualize the map**: If we visualize a map of the United States, Nashville,
      TN is south of Harlan County Reservoir, NE, and since Nashville is southeast
      of Nebraska, it would not be considered east.
