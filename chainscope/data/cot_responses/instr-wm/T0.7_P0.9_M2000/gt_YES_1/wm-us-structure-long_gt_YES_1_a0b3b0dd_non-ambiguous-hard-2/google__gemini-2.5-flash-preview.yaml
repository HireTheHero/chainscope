    85f58f36-ef8c-4691-9a8c-71da58189401: 'Here''s my thought process to answer the
      question:


      1.  **Identify the key locations:** The question asks about Hebgen Lake, MT
      and Carson Mansion, CA.

      2.  **Determine the states:** Hebgen Lake is in Montana (MT). Carson Mansion
      is in California (CA).

      3.  **Determine the general geographical relationship of the states:** Montana
      is located in the northern Great Plains/Rocky Mountains region of the US. California
      is located on the West Coast of the US.

      4.  **Visualize or recall the relative positions of Montana and California on
      a map:** California is significantly to the west of Montana. California forms
      the western edge of the continental US. Montana is inland, east of states like
      Idaho and Washington (which are themselves east of California''s northern parts)
      and directly east of Idaho.

      5.  **Consider the specific locations within the states (optional but good for
      confirmation):** Hebgen Lake is in southwestern Montana. The Carson Mansion
      is in Eureka, California, on the far northern coast of California. Even considering
      these specific locations, southwestern Montana is clearly east of northern coastal
      California.

      6.  **Formulate the comparison:** The question asks if Hebgen Lake (MT) is *east*
      of Carson Mansion (CA). Since Montana is generally east of California, and specifically
      southwestern Montana is east of northern California, the answer is yes.

      7.  **Final Answer Format:** The question requires a YES or NO answer.


      **Conclusion:** Based on the geographical relationship between Montana and California,
      and the specific locations within those states, Hebgen Lake, MT is located east
      of Carson Mansion, CA.

      asks about St. Mary''s Episcopal Cathedral in Memphis, Tennessee, and Lake Icaria
      in Iowa.

      2.  **Determine the relative location of Lake Icaria, IA:** Lake Icaria is located
      in southwestern Iowa.

      3.  **Determine the relative location of Memphis, TN:** Memphis, TN is located
      in southwestern Tennessee.

      4.  **Compare the longitudes:** Iowa is generally west of Tennessee. More specifically,
      southwestern Iowa (where Lake Icaria is) is significantly west of southwestern
      Tennessee (where Memphis is). Lake Icaria is roughly around 94 degrees West
      longitude. Memphis is roughly around 90 degrees West longitude.

      5.  **Determine the East/West relationship:** Since Memphis is at a lower (closer
      to 0) West longitude than Lake Icaria, Memphis is located *east* of Lake Icaria.


      Therefore, St. Mary''s Episcopal Cathedral (Memphis, Tennessee) is located east
      of Lake Icaria, IA.

      \ a directional relationship between two specific buildings in two different\
      \ states: Is Civic Theatre (New Orleans, LA) located *east* of Dal-Tex Building\
      \ (Dallas, TX)?\n\n2.  **Identify the key locations:**\n    *   Building 1:\
      \ Civic Theatre\n    *   City 1: New Orleans\n    *   State 1: Louisiana (LA)\n\
      \    *   Building 2: Dal-Tex Building\n    *   City 2: Dallas\n    *   State\
      \ 2: Texas (TX)\n\n3.  **Determine the relative geographical positions of the\
      \ cities/states:** I need to know the general location of New Orleans, LA, relative\
      \ to Dallas, TX.\n    *   Mentally picture or look at a map of the United States.\n\
      \    *   Locate Texas. It's a large state in the South-Central US. Its major\
      \ cities like Dallas are generally in the northern/central part of the state\
      \ relative to the Gulf Coast.\n    *   Locate Louisiana. It's east of Texas,\
      \ bordering the Gulf of Mexico. New Orleans is in the southeastern part of Louisiana,\
      \ near the Gulf.\n    *   Compare their positions: New Orleans, LA is clearly\
      \ *east* of Dallas, TX.\n\n4.  **Consider the specific buildings:** The question\
      \ refers to specific buildings within those cities. While the *exact* street\
      \ address might slightly alter the *precise* bearing, the overall directional\
      \ relationship between two points that are hundreds of miles apart will be dominated\
      \ by the relative position of their respective cities. New Orleans is significantly\
      \ east of Dallas. A building in New Orleans will be east of a building in Dallas,\
      \ regardless of their specific locations within their cities, given the large\
      \ distance involved.\n\n5.  **Formulate the conclusion based on the relative\
      \ city positions:** Since New Orleans, LA, is geographically east of Dallas,\
      \ TX, any building in New Orleans will be located east of any building in Dallas.\n\
      \n6.  **Apply the conclusion to the specific buildings:** Therefore, the Civic\
      \ Theatre in New Orleans, LA, is located east of the Dal-Tex Building in Dallas,\

      \ on the geographical relationship between the cities.\n\n8.  **Final Answer:**\
      \ YES.Okay, let's break this down:\n\n1.  **Identify the locations:** We are\
      \ comparing the location of New Orleans, Louisiana (where the Civic Theatre\
      \ is) and Dallas, Texas (where the Dal-Tex Building is).\n2.  **Determine the\
      \ relative geographical position of the cities:** New Orleans, LA is located\
      \ significantly east of Dallas, TX.\n3.  **Apply the city relationship to the\
      \ buildings:** Since New Orleans is east of Dallas, any building in New Orleans\
      \ will be east of any building in Dallas, given the large geographical separation\
      \ of the cities.\n\nTherefore, the Civic Theatre in New Orleans is located east\

      \n4.  **Apply the east/west comparison to the question:** The question asks\
      \ if the California church is located *east* of the Seattle cathedral. Since\
      \ Southern California is generally *west* of Seattle, the church in Southern\
      \ California will be west of the cathedral in Seattle.\n\n5.  **Formulate the\

      Lake, OR. The question doesn''t specify a particular Sandals Church, so we''ll
      consider a few key locations or assume it refers to the general presence. Let''s
      consider the main campus in Riverside, CA.


      2. **Locate Lost Creek Lake, OR:** Lost Creek Lake is in southwestern Oregon.


      3. **Determine the general geographic relationship:** Riverside, CA is in Southern
      California. Lost Creek Lake, OR is in Southern Oregon. California is generally
      south of Oregon.


      4. **Compare East/West positions:** To be east of Lost Creek Lake, CA would
      need to be located to the right of it on a map, relative to the lines of longitude.
      Lost Creek Lake is near the Oregon coast, which is relatively far west. Riverside,
      CA is further inland than the California coast, but it is still significantly
      west of the vast majority of the United States.


      5. **Conclusion:** Considering the relative positions, Riverside, CA is clearly
      located south and west of Lost Creek Lake, OR. Even if we considered other Sandals
      Church locations in California, it''s highly unlikely any would be located east
      of Lost Creek Lake, which is in a relatively western part of Oregon.


      Therefore, Sandals Church, CA is not located east of Lost Creek Lake, OR.

      is north. More importantly, the question asks if Tower 49 is *east* of Lake
      Wateree. Since New York City is far to the north of Lake Wateree, it cannot
      be considered "east" of it in the conventional sense of relative direction on
      a map. Lake Wateree is roughly southwest of New York City.

      7.  **Final Conclusion:** Tower 49 is north (and slightly east) of Lake Wateree,
      but it is not located *east* of Lake Wateree.

      2.  **Determine the states:** Sparks Shot Tower is in Pennsylvania (PA). Atlanta
      Symphony Hall is in Georgia (GA).

      3.  **Determine the general relative location of the states:** Pennsylvania
      is a state in the northeastern/mid-Atlantic region of the US. Georgia is a state
      in the southeastern region of the US. Georgia is generally south and west of
      Pennsylvania.

      4.  **Determine the general location of Atlanta:** Atlanta is in northern Georgia.

      5.  **Determine the general location of Sparks Shot Tower:** Sparks Shot Tower
      is specifically in Philadelphia, PA (though the city isn''t strictly necessary
      for the state-level comparison). Philadelphia is in southeastern Pennsylvania.

      6.  **Compare the locations:** Philadelphia, PA (where Sparks Shot Tower is)
      is located considerably north and east of Atlanta, GA (where Atlanta Symphony
      Hall is).

      2.  **Determine the state of each location:** Sparks Shot Tower is in Pennsylvania
      (PA). Atlanta Symphony Hall is in Georgia (GA).

      3.  **Determine the general geographic relationship between PA and GA:** Pennsylvania
      is located north of Georgia. Georgia is located south of Pennsylvania.

      4.  **Consider the East/West relationship:** Since Pennsylvania is significantly
      north of Georgia, and both states are in the eastern half of the US, their relative
      East/West positions depend on their specific longitude. However, given the large
      north-south distance, it''s highly likely that a point in southern PA is west
      of a point in northern/central GA, or roughly due north/south.

      5.  **Find the longitude of Sparks Shot Tower, PA:** Research shows Sparks Shot
      Tower is in Philadelphia, PA. Philadelphia''s longitude is approximately 75.1
      degrees West.

      6.  **Find the longitude of Atlanta Symphony Hall, GA:** Atlanta''s longitude
      is approximately 84.4 degrees West.

      7.  **Compare the longitudes:** 75.1 degrees West (Philadelphia) is further
      east than 84.4 degrees West (Atlanta). A smaller West longitude number means
      the location is further east.


      Therefore, Sparks Shot Tower, PA is located east of Atlanta Symphony Hall, GA.


      The answer is YES.'

      3.  **Confirm the specific locations:** Herb Parsons Lake is near Collierville,
      TN. Lewis and Clark Lake is on the border of Nebraska and South Dakota, near
      Yankton, SD.

      4.  **Compare longitudes:** A quick check of coordinates or a map confirms that
      Tennessee is significantly east of Nebraska. Specifically, Herb Parsons Lake
      is around 89.7 degrees West longitude, while Lewis and Clark Lake is around
      97.4 degrees West longitude.

      5.  **Conclusion:** A smaller West longitude number means the location is further
      east. Since 89.7 is less than 97.4, Herb Parsons Lake is east of Lewis and Clark
      Lake.

      County, South Carolina. This is in the northwestern part of South Carolina,
      within the Appalachian Mountains foothills.


      3.  **Compare the locations:** Washington, D.C. is situated significantly to
      the northeast of South Carolina. To be more precise, relative to South Carolina,
      Washington, D.C. is both further north and further east. Jocassee Dam is in
      the western part of South Carolina.


      4.  **Determine the relative East/West position:** Since Washington, D.C. is
      located to the northeast of the general location of South Carolina, and Jocassee
      Dam is in the western part of South Carolina, Washington, D.C. is clearly located
      *east* of Jocassee Dam.


      5.  **Formulate the answer:** The question asks if the courthouse is *east*
      of the dam. Based on the comparison, it is.
