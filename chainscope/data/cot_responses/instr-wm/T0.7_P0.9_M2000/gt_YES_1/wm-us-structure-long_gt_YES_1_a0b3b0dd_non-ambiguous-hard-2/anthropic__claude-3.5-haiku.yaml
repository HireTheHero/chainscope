      4. Therefore, any location in Chicago (like Olympia Centre) would be west of
      Gettysburg.


      5. The question asks if the Cyclorama Building is east of Olympia Centre.


      6. Since Olympia Centre is west of Gettysburg, and the Cyclorama Building is
      in Gettysburg, the Cyclorama Building would be east of Olympia Centre.

    befc6e61-7139-4847-8a83-e3f463e8d310: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate Independent Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Alabama

      - This is in the eastern part of Alabama

      - Alabama is in the southeastern United States


      2. Next, locate Truman Reservoir in Missouri

      - Truman Reservoir is in west-central Missouri

      - Missouri is west of Alabama


      3. Consider the geographical relationship between these two locations

      - Alabama is east of Missouri

      - Independent Presbyterian Church is even further east within Alabama


      4. Determine the relative positioning

      - Since the church is in Alabama (east) and Truman Reservoir is in Missouri
      (west), the church is definitely east of the reservoir


      5. Conclusion:

      - YES, Independent Presbyterian Church (Birmingham, Alabama) is located east
      of Truman Reservoir, MO.

      3. I''ll compare their relative east-west positions


      Lovewell Reservoir is located in north-central Kansas, near the Nebraska border.

      John Martin Reservoir is located in southeastern Colorado.


      When comparing their positions, Lovewell Reservoir is east of John Martin Reservoir.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      relationship between them is not relevant.


      6. However, the question asks specifically about east/west positioning.


      7. Utah is east of Washington, so UCCU Center would technically be east of Lake
      Tapps.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      1. First, I''ll locate Kendall Cogeneration Station in Massachusetts

      2. Then, I''ll locate Rose Valley Lake in Pennsylvania

      3. Then I''ll determine their relative east-west positions


      Step 1: Kendall Cogeneration Station is located in Cambridge, Middlesett County,
      Massachusetts. This is in the northeastern part of the state.


      Step 2: Rose Valley Lake is located in Pennsylvania, specifically in Bradford
      County, which is in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Comparing their geographic positions:

      - Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania

      - Cambridge, MA is east of Bradford County, PA

      - Therefore, Kendall Cogeneration Station is east of Rose Valley Lake


      The answer is: YES.'

      - Manhattan (where Barrow Street Theatre is located) is in the eastern part
      of the United States

      - Ohio is west of New York


      4. Specific east/west positioning:

      - Since Barrow Street Theatre is in New York (east) and LaDue Reservoir is in
      Ohio (west), Barrow Street Theatre is indeed east of LaDue Reservoir


      5. Therefore, the answer is: YES


      The answer is YES, Barrow Street Theatre, NY is located east of LaDue Reservoir,
      OH.'
