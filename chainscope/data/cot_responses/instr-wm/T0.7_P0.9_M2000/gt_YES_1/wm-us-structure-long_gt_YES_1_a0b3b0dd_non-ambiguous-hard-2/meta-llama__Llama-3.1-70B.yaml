      1. The Independent Presbyterian Church is located in Birmingham, Alabama. Alabama
      is a state in the southeastern United States.


      2. Truman Reservoir is located in Missouri. Missouri is a state in the midwestern
      United States.


      3. Since Missouri is generally north of Alabama (with some parts of Missouri

      the locations of C. J. Strike Dam, ID, and Mount Baker Theatre, WA, and then
      compare their positions.


      1. C. J. Strike Dam is located in Idaho. Idaho is a state in the northwestern
      United States.


      2. Mount Baker Theatre is located in Washington. Washington is a state in the
      northwestern United States.


      3. Since Idaho is generally east of Washington (with some parts of Idaho being

      their positions.


      1. Sandals Church is located in the state of California. California is a state
      on the West Coast of the United States.


      2. Lost Creek Lake is located in the state of Oregon. Oregon is a state in the
      Pacific Northwest region of the United States.


      3. Since California is generally west of Oregon when considering their overall
      positions, we can conclude that Sandals Church, CA, is not east of Lost Creek

      positions of the states:


      1. California is located on the West Coast of the United States.

      2. Oregon is located to the north of California.

      3. Therefore, California is generally to the south of Oregon.


      However, when we consider the east-west axis, California is not entirely east
      of Oregon. California stretches from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Sierra
      Nevada mountains in the east, while Oregon stretches from the Pacific Ocean
      in the west to the Rocky Mountains in the east. Therefore, parts of California
      are east of parts of Oregon, but other parts are not.

      compare their positions.


      1. Sparks Shot Tower is located in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is a state in
      the northeastern United States.


      2. Atlanta Symphony Hall is located in Atlanta, Georgia. Atlanta is the capital
      city of the state of Georgia, which is located in the southeastern United States.


      3. Since Pennsylvania is generally east of Georgia (with some parts of Pennsylvania
      being almost directly north of parts of Georgia but still generally to the east

      the locations of Mountaineer Wind Energy Center, WV, and Chicago Avenue Pumping
      Station, IL, and then compare their positions.


      1. Mountaineer Wind Energy Center is located in West Virginia. West Virginia
      is a state in the eastern United States.


      2. Chicago Avenue Pumping Station is located in Illinois. Illinois is a state
      in the Midwestern United States.


      3. Since West Virginia is generally east of Illinois (with some parts of West
      Virginia being almost directly south of parts of Illinois but still generally
      to the east when considering their overall positions), we can conclude that
      Mountaineer Wind Energy Center, WV, is indeed east of Chicago Avenue Pumping
      Station, IL.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Big Stone Lake is located in South Dakota (SD)
      while Sahuarita Lake is in Arizona (AZ).


      2. **Understand the geography**: South Dakota is located in the north-central
      part of the United States, while Arizona is in the southwestern part.


      3. **Compare the locations**: On a map, you''ll see that South Dakota is generally
      to the east of Arizona. While there are parts of South Dakota that might be
      west of parts of Arizona due to the irregular shapes of the states, the overall
      trend is that South Dakota is east of Arizona.


      4. **Specific locations**: Big Stone Lake is in the northeastern part of South
      Dakota, which is further east compared to most of Arizona. Sahuarita Lake is
      in southern Arizona, which is west of most of South Dakota.

      their positions.


      1. Meander Creek Reservoir is located in the state of Ohio. Ohio is a state
      in the Midwestern region of the United States.


      2. Rend Lake is located in the state of Illinois. Illinois is a state in the
      Midwestern region of the United States.


      3. Both Ohio and Illinois are Midwestern states, and Illinois is generally to
      the west of Ohio (with some parts of Illinois being directly north of parts
      of Ohio but still generally to the west when considering their overall positions).


      4. Since Meander Creek Reservoir is in Ohio and Rend Lake is in Illinois, and
      Illinois is generally west of Ohio, we can conclude that Meander Creek Reservoir,
      OH, is not east of Rend Lake, IL.
