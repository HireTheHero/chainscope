      1) First, let''s locate both places:

      - National Weather Center is in Norman, Oklahoma

      - Barker Meadow Reservoir is in Boulder County, Colorado


      2) To determine if one is east of the other, we need to compare their relative
      positions:

      - Oklahoma is east of Colorado (CO is in the Rocky Mountain region, while OK
      is in the Great Plains)

      - Any point in Oklahoma will be east of any point in Colorado


      3) Therefore, since the National Weather Center is in Oklahoma, and Barker Meadow
      Reservoir is in Colorado, the National Weather Center must be east of Barker
      Meadow Reservoir.

      1) California Theatre is in San Bernardino, California, which is in Southern
      California


      2) The Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was located in Columbia County, Oregon, near
      the Columbia River

      - Civic Theatre is in New Orleans, Louisiana

      - Dal-Tex Building is in Dallas, Texas

      1) First, let''s establish that Heron Lake is in New Mexico (NM) and Boulder
      City Hospital is in Nevada (NV)


      2) When comparing east/west positions in the US, we can use the states'' general
      locations:

      - Nevada is in the western US

      - New Mexico is in the southwestern US, but lies east of Nevada


      3) Since these locations are in different states, we can use the states'' relative
      positions:

      - Any point in New Mexico will be east of any point in Nevada, as the states
      don''t overlap longitudinally

      - New Mexico lies entirely east of Nevada
