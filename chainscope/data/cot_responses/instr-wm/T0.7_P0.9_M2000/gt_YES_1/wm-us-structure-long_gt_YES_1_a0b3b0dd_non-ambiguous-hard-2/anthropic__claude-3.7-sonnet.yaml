      - St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral is in Seattle, Washington (WA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of California and Washington states.

      - Washington state is located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United
      States

      - California is located south of Washington state along the west coast


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning.

      - Both states are on the west coast of the United States

      - Washington is north of California

      - In the United States, locations that are in the same coastal region generally
      have similar east-west positioning

      - However, the west coast angles slightly, with northern areas (like Washington)
      typically being slightly more western than southern areas (like California)


      Step 4: Southern California specifically would be in the southern portion of
      California, which would position it slightly more eastward compared to Seattle
      in Washington.


      NO


      The correct answer is NO. While California is south of Washington, the east-west
      positioning doesn''t make Sarang Community Church east of St. Mark''s Cathedral.
      Both are on the west coast, and the slight angle of the coastline would actually
      place the California location slightly more westward or at approximately the
      same longitude as the Seattle location.'

      - Since Arizona as a state is east of California, and these cities maintain
      that same general east-west relationship (neither is at an extreme edge that
      would change this orientation), the Orpheum Theater in Flagstaff, Arizona must
      be east of Saint Joseph Parish in Mountain View, California.

      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Tennessee is located east of Oklahoma on the US map. Tennessee is in the southeastern
      region, while Oklahoma is in the south-central region.


      Step 4: Verify the specific locations within their states.

      Tellico Reservoir is in eastern Tennessee, which maintains its eastern position
      relative to Oklahoma.

      Blue Canyon Wind Farm is in Oklahoma, and regardless of its specific location
      within Oklahoma, it would still be west of any point in Tennessee.


      Therefore, Tellico Reservoir, TN is indeed located east of Blue Canyon Wind
      Farm, OK.
