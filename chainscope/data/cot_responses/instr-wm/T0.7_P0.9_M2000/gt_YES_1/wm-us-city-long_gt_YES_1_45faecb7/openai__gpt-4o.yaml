      2. **Locate Hamel, IL:** Hamel is a village in Madison County, in the southwestern
      part of Illinois.


      3. **Compare the Longitudes:** Since Illinois is generally aligned north to
      south, determining whether one city is east of another involves comparing their
      longitudinal coordinates. A city with a smaller (more negative) longitude is
      farther west, while a city with a larger (less negative) longitude is farther
      east.


      Given that Hamel is in the southwestern part of the state and Lanark is in the
      northwestern part, Hamel is indeed east of Lanark when comparing their positions

      West Virginia.


      2. Identify the location of Sunset Village, GA: Sunset Village is an unincorporated

      3. **Compare Longitudes**: Generally, locations to the east have a higher longitude
      in the Western Hemisphere. Virginia is north of North Carolina, but east or
      west positioning needs to be checked by longitude.


      Based on the general locations:

      - Union Mill, VA is located in the northern part of Virginia, which is more
      inland and typically west of the coastal areas of North Carolina.

      - Sneads Ferry, NC is located on the coast of North Carolina.


      Therefore, Union Mill, VA is located west of Sneads Ferry, NC.
