    f54f8d1a-aab9-4bb9-b7bd-16eea2dbf4b9: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll need to locate Raubsville, PA and Carlls Corner, NJ on a map.


      2. Raubsville is located in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, near the border
      with New Jersey.


      3. Carlls Corner is located in Warren County, New Jersey.


      4. Looking at a map, Raubsville is situated west of the Delaware River, which
      forms the border between Pennsylvania and New Jersey.


      5. Carlls Corner is located east of the Delaware River in New Jersey.


      6. Since Raubsville is west of the Delaware River and Carlls Corner is east
      of the river, Raubsville is west of Carlls Corner.


      7. Therefore, Raubsville is NOT east of Carlls Corner.

      1. First, let''s locate Crowley Lake, CA:

      - Crowley Lake is in Mono County, California

      - It is located in the eastern part of California, near the Sierra Nevada mountains

      - This means it is in the eastern portion of the state
