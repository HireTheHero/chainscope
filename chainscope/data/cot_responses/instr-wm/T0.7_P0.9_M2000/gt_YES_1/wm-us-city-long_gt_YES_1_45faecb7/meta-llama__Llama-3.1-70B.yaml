      County are both in the western part of Texas. However, Edwards County is located
      further south compared to Stonewall County.


      4. **Compare the specific locations of the cities**: Within their respective
      counties, Rocksprings is located in the southern part of Edwards County, while
      Aspermont is in the eastern part of Stonewall County.


      5. **Conclude based on the east-west positioning**: Given the geographical layout
      of the counties and the positions of the cities within them, Rocksprings, being
      in the southern part of its county, would generally be west of Aspermont, which
      is in the eastern part of its county, as we''re considering the east-west orientation.

      2. **Determine their relative positions**: Massachusetts is located to the north

      we can assume that they share a similar east-west orientation.


      4. **Compare their longitudes**: If we were to compare their exact longitudes

      have a lower longitude value, and a location further west would have a higher
      longitude value. However, we don''t have exact coordinates for these locations,

      east of Dandridge, TN, we need to consider the geographical locations of both
      cities. Here''s a step-by-step approach:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Ossineke, MI, is a small village located in Alpena
      County, Michigan, in the United States. Dandridge, TN, is a town located in
      Jefferson County, Tennessee, also in the United States.


      2. **Understand the concept of "east"**: In a geographical context, "east" refers
      to the direction towards the rising sun. It is the opposite of "west," which
      is the direction towards the setting sun. The Earth rotates from west to east,
      causing the sun to appear to rise in the east and set in the west.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Michigan is located in the eastern
      part of the United States, while Tennessee is located in the central part. Therefore,
      Michigan is generally east of Tennessee.


      4. **Consider the specific locations**: While Ossineke, MI, is located in Michigan,
      which is generally east of Tennessee, Dandridge, TN, is located in the eastern
      part of Tennessee. This means that Dandridge is closer to the eastern border
      of Tennessee than the western border.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Ossineke, MI, is located in Michigan, which is
      generally east of Tennessee, and Dandridge, TN, is located in the eastern part
      of Tennessee, we can conclude that Ossineke, MI, is located east of Dandridge,

      \ Yakima County, Washington, while Orcutt is a census-designated place in Santa\
      \ Barbara County, California.\n\n2. **Understand the general geography**: California\
      \ is west of Washington, with the Pacific Ocean to the west and Nevada and Arizona\
      \ to the east. This means that, in general, cities in California will be west\
      \ of cities in Washington.\n\n3. **Compare specific locations**: \n   - Wapato,\

      \ (or higher in value) than 120.4338\xB0 W (Orcutt, CA), Wapato, WA, is actually\

      Atlantic Ocean, east of the South Carolina mainland. Orangeburg is located in
      the central part of the state, west of the coast.


      3. **Compare the locations**: To determine if Daufuskie Island is located east
      of Orangeburg, we need to compare their geographical positions. Since Daufuskie
      Island is located east of the South Carolina mainland, and Orangeburg is located

      east of Hampton, VA, we need to understand the geographical locations of both
      cities and then compare their positions. Here''s a step-by-step process:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Poquoson and Hampton are both cities in Virginia,
      USA. Poquoson is situated on the Virginia Peninsula, while Hampton is also on
      the peninsula but more towards the south.


      2. **Determine their general geographical positions**: Both cities are on the
      eastern seaboard of the United States.


      3. **Consider their relative positions within Virginia**: Poquoson is on the
      northeastern part of the Virginia Peninsula, while Hampton is more towards the
      southeastern part of the peninsula.


      4. **Compare their longitudinal positions (east-west)**: Since they are both
      on the same peninsula and relatively close to each other, the difference in
      their east-west positions is not significant.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Poquoson and Hampton are both on the same peninsula
      and relatively close to each other, and considering the general east-west alignment
      of the Virginia Peninsula, Poquoson is not significantly east of Hampton. Therefore,
      the answer is: **NO**'

      \ northeastern part of New York.\n\n4. **Compare their longitudinal positions\
      \ (east-west):**\n   - Since New Jersey is east of New York, a location in southern\
      \ New Jersey would still be east of a location in northeastern New York, given\
      \ the general east-west alignment of the state borders.\n\nBased on these steps,\
      \ Manahawkin, NJ, being in southern New Jersey, is indeed east of Paul Smiths,\
