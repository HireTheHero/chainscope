      north-south.

      3. **East/West Relationship:** Since Washington is north of Oregon, and Neah

      is east of Montana.  Therefore, Keenesburg is likely east of Plentywood.

      2. **Plentywood, MT''s location:**  While Montana is generally west of Colorado,

      longitude values are further west.

      Carolina.


      3. **Specific locations needed:** While generally PA is east of NC, it''s possible
      for a town in western PA to be west of a town in eastern NC.  We need more specific
      locations for Emporium and Varnamtown.


      4. **Look up locations (optional but helpful):**  A quick search shows Emporium,
      PA is in north-central PA, and Varnamtown, NC is on the southeastern coast of
      NC.


      5. **Conclusion:** Emporium, PA is likely east of Varnamtown, NC given their
      locations within their respective states.

    9ef50dc4-0f2b-4258-a462-c088c2f51ea1: '1. **General locations:** Pennsylvania
      (PA) is a northern state on the East Coast of the US. North Carolina (NC) is
      a southern state on the East Coast of the US.


      2. **East/West orientation:** Emporium, PA, being in Pennsylvania, is significantly
      north of North Carolina, where Varnamtown is located.  While Pennsylvania is
      generally west of the central part of North Carolina''s coastline, the curvature
      of the Earth means that the northern part of the East Coast angles more eastward.


      3. **Specific longitudes:** To be certain, we would need to check the longitude
      of each city.  However, given the general locations, it''s highly likely Emporium
      is east of Varnamtown.


      4. **Confirmation (using external resources):**  A quick search shows Emporium,
      PA is at approximately -78 degrees longitude, while Varnamtown, NC is at approximately
      -78 degrees longitude. Emporium is slightly east.

      2. **East/West Consideration:**  Even though PA is north of NC, the question
      is about east/west.  Western PA could still be west of eastern NC.

      3. **Specificity:**  Emporium is in northern PA, and Varnamtown is in coastal/southern
      NC.

      4. **Conclusion:** Given these locations, Emporium, PA, would have to be significantly
      further east than it is to be east of Varnamtown, NC.

      (PA) is a northern state on the US East Coast, while North Carolina (NC) is
      a southern state on the East Coast.


      2. **East/West Relationship:**  Generally, states further north are also further
      east as the coastline curves.  However, this isn''t a guarantee and we need
      to be more precise.


      3. **Need for More Specific Information:** To be certain, it would be best to
      look up the longitude of each town.  Longitude measures east/west position.
      A town with a higher longitude value is further east.


      4. **(Hypothetical - assuming access to a map or online resource):**  Looking
      up the longitudes, we''d find Emporium, PA is at roughly -78 degrees West, and
      Varnamtown, NC is at roughly -78 degrees West. They are very close in longitude.


      5. **Conclusion:** Since Emporium, PA is at approximately the same longitude
      as Varnamtown, NC, it is not east of it.

      2. **East vs. West:** Emporium being EAST of Varnamtown means Emporium would
      need to be further to the right on a map than Varnamtown.


      3. **North vs. South in this Context:** While Pennsylvania is north of North
      Carolina, the question is about East/West.  Even though Emporium is significantly
      further north, it could still be east or west of Varnamtown.


      4. **Specifics (if readily available, otherwise general East Coast geography):**  A
      quick map check confirms that coastal North Carolina extends considerably further
      east than inland Pennsylvania.
