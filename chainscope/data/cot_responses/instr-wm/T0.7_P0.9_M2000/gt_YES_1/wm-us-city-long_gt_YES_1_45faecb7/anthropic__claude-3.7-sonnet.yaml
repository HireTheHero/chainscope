      - Garnavillo is in Iowa (IA)

      - Newellton is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Iowa is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Louisiana is in the South/Gulf Coast region of the United States

      - Butner is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Bowmans Addition is in Maryland (MD)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Maryland is on the eastern seaboard of the US, roughly in the mid-Atlantic
      region.

      - North Carolina is also on the eastern seaboard, but is located south of Maryland.


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning.

      - Maryland and North Carolina both stretch from the Atlantic Ocean westward.

      - Maryland is generally positioned more to the west than North Carolina when
      comparing their eastern borders, as the coastline angles toward the southwest.


      Step 4: Look at specific locations.

      - Butner, NC is located in central North Carolina, somewhat inland from the
      coast.

      - Bowmans Addition, MD is likely in western Maryland based on naming patterns
      of "Additions" which are often in the western part of the state.


      Step 5: Make the comparison.

      - Western Maryland is further west than central North Carolina.

      - The eastern edge of North Carolina extends further east than Maryland due
      to the Outer Banks.

      US.

      - Bowmans Addition is in Maryland (MD), which is also on the eastern seaboard
      but further north than North Carolina.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west positioning of these states.

      - Maryland is generally north of North Carolina.

      - On the US east coast, locations that are further north tend to be further
      west when comparing coastal states, due to the northeast-to-southwest angle
      of the Atlantic coastline.


      Step 3: More specifically, Maryland is located in the mid-Atlantic region, northwest
      of North Carolina. North Carolina extends further east into the Atlantic Ocean
      than Maryland does.


      Step 4: Butner, NC is located in central North Carolina, not on the coast. Bowmans

      (SC).

      - Conestee is in South Carolina (SC).


      Step 2: Consider their longitudes.

      - Florida extends further west than South Carolina along the Gulf Coast, but
      the eastern coast of both states roughly aligns along the Atlantic.

      - To determine which is further east, I need to consider their specific longitudes.


      Step 3: Analyze their specific locations.

      - Pebble Creek, FL is in the Tampa Bay area in western Florida.

      - Conestee, SC is near Greenville in the western part of South Carolina.

      - Western Florida is generally further west than western South Carolina.


      Step 4: Compare their positions on the map.

      - South Carolina is entirely east of the western parts of Florida.

      - The Tampa area where Pebble Creek is located is significantly further west
      than any part of South Carolina.


      Therefore, Pebble Creek, FL is west of Conestee, SC, not east of it.

      Step 1: Recall the general geography of Oregon (OR) and Washington (WA).

      - Washington is north of Oregon

      - Both states are on the west coast of the United States


      Step 2: Consider the locations of these specific cities.

      - Port Orford is on the Oregon coast

      - Neah Bay is on the Washington coast


      Step 3: Determine their specific coastal positions.

      - Neah Bay is at the northwestern tip of Washington state, at the entrance to
      the Strait of Juan de Fuca

      - Port Orford is on the southern Oregon coast


      Step 4: Compare their east-west positions.

      - The Washington coastline generally extends further west than the Oregon coastline

      - Neah Bay, being at the northwestern tip of Washington, is one of the westernmost
      points in the contiguous United States

      - Port Orford, while on the coast, is east of Neah Bay


      NO, Port Orford, OR is not located east of Neah Bay, WA. Port Orford is actually
      west of Neah Bay.


      Wait, I need to double-check this. Looking more carefully at the map orientation:

      - Neah Bay is at the northwestern tip of Washington, jutting into the Pacific

      - Port Orford is on the southern Oregon coast


      Correcting my analysis: Port Orford is located southeast of Neah Bay, which
      means it is indeed east of Neah Bay (though also south).


      YES, Port Orford, OR is located east of Neah Bay, WA.'

      Step 1: Recall the geographic positions of Oregon and Washington states.

      - Washington is north of Oregon

      - Both states are on the west coast of the United States


      Step 2: Consider the coastal geography of these states.

      - The Pacific coastline of Washington and Oregon generally runs north-south

      - Neah Bay, WA is on the northwestern tip of Washington''s Olympic Peninsula

      - Port Orford, OR is on the southern Oregon coast


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      - Neah Bay is at the far western edge of Washington state, jutting out into
      the Pacific

      - Port Orford, while also coastal, is slightly inland from the westernmost point
      of Oregon

      - However, Neah Bay is significantly farther west than Port Orford because the
      Olympic Peninsula extends westward into the Pacific


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Neah Bay is at the far western tip of Washington, and Port Orford is
      on the Oregon coast but not at its westernmost point, Port Orford would be east
      of Neah Bay


      NO, Port Orford, OR is not located east of Neah Bay, WA. Port Orford is actually
      located southeast of Neah Bay.

      Step 3: More specifically:

      - Six Mile Run is in the western part of Somerset County.

      - New Egypt is in the western part of Ocean County, but Ocean County as a whole
      is east of Somerset County.


      Step 4: Comparing their specific locations:

      is a borough in Allegheny County, located in the southwestern part of Pennsylvania,
      south of Pittsburgh.


      Step 2: Now I''ll identify where Allison Park, PA is located. Allison Park is
      a census-designated place also in Allegheny County, but it''s located north
      of Pittsburgh.


      Step 3: Since both are in Allegheny County, I need to determine their positions
      relative to each other. With Pittsburgh as a reference point, Pleasant Hills
      is south of Pittsburgh, while Allison Park is north of Pittsburgh.


      Step 4: On a west-east axis, Pleasant Hills is slightly southeast of Pittsburgh,
      while Allison Park is northeast of Pittsburgh. They''re both relatively similar
      in their east-west positioning, but I need to be precise about which is further
      east.


      Step 5: Looking at their specific coordinates, Pleasant Hills is slightly west
      of Allison Park when comparing their longitudes.


      Therefore, Pleasant Hills is NOT east of Allison Park, but rather west of it.

      Step 1: Recall the general locations of South Carolina and Florida.

      - South Carolina is on the east coast of the US, roughly in the middle of the
      Atlantic seaboard.

      - Florida extends southward from the southeastern United States, with the Atlantic
      Ocean on its east and the Gulf of Mexico on its west.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions.

      - South Carolina is north of Florida.

      - On the east coast, locations that are further north are generally not significantly
      east or west of each other, as the coastline runs roughly north-south.


      Step 3: Consider more specific geography.

      - Elloree, SC would be in the interior of South Carolina.

      - Malabar, FL is likely on the eastern side of Florida (the Atlantic side).

      - The Florida peninsula does curve slightly to the southeast, which means eastern
      Florida locations could be slightly east of South Carolina locations.


      Step 4: Based on the general shape of the eastern US coastline, South Carolina
      tends to be slightly east of Florida, even accounting for Florida''s eastern
      coast.


      NO, Elloree, SC is not east of Malabar, FL. Malabar, FL is slightly east of
      Elloree, SC.'

      of Elloree, South Carolina and Malabar, Florida to answer whether Elloree is
      east of Malabar.


      Step 1: Consider the general geography of South Carolina and Florida.

      - South Carolina is located on the east coast of the United States, north of
      Florida.

      - Florida extends southward and is also on the east coast, but has a long peninsula
      that extends south and southwest.


      Step 2: Think about the east-west positioning.

      - South Carolina is generally positioned along the Atlantic coast.

      - Florida''s east coast is also along the Atlantic, but the state extends westward
      into the Gulf of Mexico.

      - Malabar, FL is located on Florida''s east coast, specifically on the Atlantic
      side of the peninsula.

      - Elloree, SC would be in the interior of South Carolina.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes.

      - Places further east have lower longitude numbers in the western hemisphere.

      - South Carolina as a state is generally east of most of Florida except for
      the very eastern coastline of Florida.

      - Elloree, SC is in central/eastern South Carolina.

      - Malabar, FL is on Florida''s eastern coastline, which puts it at a very eastern
      longitude.


      Based on their specific locations, Elloree, SC is likely slightly west of Malabar,
      FL, since Malabar is right on Florida''s Atlantic coast, which juts out eastward.


      NO, Elloree, SC is not located east of Malabar, FL.'

      - Paramount-Long Meadow is in Maryland (MD), which is on the eastern seaboard
      of the United States.

      - Arkport is in New York (NY), which is also on the eastern side of the US.


      Step 2: Let me consider the relative positions of Maryland and New York states.

      - Maryland is south of New York state.

      - However, the question asks about east/west positioning, not north/south.


      Step 3: Looking at the geographic layout of the eastern US:

      - Maryland is generally positioned to the west of the eastern parts of New York
      state.

      - However, New York is a large state that extends far westward.

      - Arkport, NY is likely in the western part of New York state (based on my knowledge
      of NY geography).

      - Paramount-Long Meadow, MD would be in western Maryland near the Appalachian
      region.


      Step 4: Comparing the specific locations:

      - Arkport, NY is in the western part of New York state, in the Southern Tier
      region.

      - Paramount-Long Meadow, MD is in Washington County in western Maryland.

      - Western Maryland is generally east of western New York where Arkport is located.


      NO'

      - Paramount-Long Meadow is in Maryland (MD)

      - Arkport is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Maryland is located in the mid-Atlantic region of the eastern United States

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Maryland is generally south of New York

      - In terms of east-west positioning, Maryland is slightly west of New York''s
      eastern portions but east of New York''s western portions

      - Arkport, NY is located in the western part of New York state (in Steuben County)

      - Paramount-Long Meadow, MD is in the western part of Maryland (near Hagerstown)


      Step 4: Make the final comparison.

      - Western Maryland is west of western New York

      - Paramount-Long Meadow (in western MD) would be west of Arkport (in western
      NY)


      NO, Paramount-Long Meadow, MD is not located east of Arkport, NY. It is located
      west of Arkport.'

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both cities.

      - Ossineke, Michigan is in the northeastern part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula,
      near Lake Huron.

      - Dandridge, Tennessee is in eastern Tennessee, near the Great Smoky Mountains.


      Step 2: Compare their longitudes (east-west positioning).

      - Michigan is generally north of Tennessee, but that doesn''t tell us about
      east-west positioning.

      - The eastern part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula extends quite far east, especially
      near Lake Huron.

      - Eastern Tennessee is in the Appalachian region, which is in the eastern part
      of the United States.


      Step 3: Consider their specific positions.

      - Ossineke, MI is located near Lake Huron, which forms Michigan''s eastern border.

      - Dandridge, TN is in eastern Tennessee, but Tennessee as a whole is west of
      the Atlantic coastal states.

      - Michigan''s eastern portions near Lake Huron are generally further east than
      eastern Tennessee.


      Based on their geographic coordinates, Ossineke, Michigan is indeed east of
      Dandridge, Tennessee. Michigan''s eastern regions extend further east than eastern
      Tennessee.

      - San Lorenzo, CA is in the San Francisco Bay Area, near the western coast of
      California

      - Lake Holm, WA is near Seattle in western Washington


      Step 5: Compare east-west positions.

      - Since both locations are in the western portions of their respective states,

      be at similar longitudes

      - However, due to the curvature of the coastline, locations in Washington tend
      to be slightly east of locations at the same distance from the coast in California


      NO. San Lorenzo, CA is not located east of Lake Holm, WA. San Lorenzo is actually

      San Francisco.

      - Boring is east of Portland, Oregon, but still in the western part of Oregon.


      Step 4: Compare the longitudes (east-west positions).

      - Both cities are in the western parts of their respective states.

      - Since Oregon is directly north of California, and both cities are in the western
      portions of their states, they would be roughly aligned north-south.

      - However, the coastline angles slightly, with Oregon''s coast being slightly
      more eastward than northern California''s coast.

      - Boring, being east of Portland, is further inland from the coast than North
      Richmond.

      - Whitewright, TX is in Texas, which is in the south-central United States.

      - Yutan, NE is in Nebraska, which is in the central United States, north of
      Texas.


      Step 2: Let me consider their east-west positioning.

      - Texas generally extends further east than Nebraska.

      - Specifically, Whitewright is in northeastern Texas.

      - Yutan is in eastern Nebraska.


      Step 3: To be more precise about their relative east-west positioning:

      - Whitewright, TX is located in Grayson County in northeastern Texas, near the
      Texas-Oklahoma border.

      - Yutan, NE is located in Saunders County in eastern Nebraska.

      - Comparing longitudes, places in northeastern Texas are typically east of places
      in eastern Nebraska.


      Step 4: Making my final determination based on their geographic positions on
      the US map, Whitewright, TX is indeed east of Yutan, NE.


      YES'

      - Crofton, MD is in Maryland, which is on the east coast of the United States.

      - Oriental, NC is in North Carolina, which is also on the east coast of the
      United States.

      - To determine if one is east of the other, I need to consider their positions
      relative to each other longitudinally.


      Step 3: Checking the geographical coordinates:

      - Maryland generally lies west of the Chesapeake Bay, while eastern North Carolina
      extends further east toward the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Oriental, NC is specifically located on the Neuse River near the Pamlico Sound,
      which puts it very close to the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Crofton, MD is in central Maryland, west of Annapolis and the Chesapeake Bay.


      Step 4: Based on longitude comparison:

      - Oriental, NC is further east than Crofton, MD because it''s situated near
      the Atlantic coast.

      - Crofton, MD is more inland and therefore further west than Oriental, NC.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both cities in California.

      - Crowley Lake is in Mono County in eastern California, near Mammoth Lakes,
      on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada mountains.

      - Simi Valley is in Ventura County in southern California, northwest of Los
      Angeles.


      Step 2: Consider their positions relative to each other.

      - Eastern California (where Crowley Lake is) is east of southern California
      (where Simi Valley is).

      - Crowley Lake is much closer to the Nevada border, while Simi Valley is closer
      to the Pacific Ocean.


      Step 3: Determine their east-west relationship.

      - California generally runs north-south, with the eastern parts of the state
      being closer to Nevada.

      - Crowley Lake is in the eastern Sierra region, while Simi Valley is in the
      coastal region.


      Based on these geographic positions, Crowley Lake is indeed east of Simi Valley.


      YES'

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Wynnewood is in Oklahoma (OK)

      - The Homesteads is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Oklahoma is directly north of Texas

      - Oklahoma generally shares its southern border with northern Texas


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning.

      - Oklahoma is positioned such that most of it is directly north of the eastern
      half of Texas

      - Western Oklahoma borders the Texas Panhandle


      Step 4: More specifically, Wynnewood is in south-central Oklahoma, while The
      Homesteads would be somewhere in Texas.


      Step 5: Based on the general geography, a location in south-central Oklahoma
      (like Wynnewood) would typically be east of most locations in Texas except for
      the easternmost parts of Texas.


      Since Wynnewood is in south-central Oklahoma, and The Homesteads is in Texas
      (which extends much further west than Oklahoma), Wynnewood is very likely east
      of The Homesteads.


      NO


      Wait, I need to verify this more carefully. Without specific coordinates for
      The Homesteads, TX, I cannot be absolutely certain of its position relative
      to Wynnewood, OK. If The Homesteads is in far eastern Texas, it could potentially
      be east of Wynnewood.


      Given the information available and the general geography of the two states,
      I should not make a definitive claim.


      I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer without more specific location

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Wynnewood is a city in Oklahoma (OK)

      - The Homesteads is a location in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Oklahoma and Texas.

      - Oklahoma is located directly north of Texas

      - Oklahoma''s eastern border roughly aligns with the eastern portion of Texas


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning.

      - Texas extends much further west than Oklahoma

      - Oklahoma is positioned in the central-eastern portion of the United States

      - The Homesteads, TX is likely in the main body of Texas, which extends far
      to the west


      Step 4: Make a determination based on state positions.

      - Since Oklahoma is generally east of much of Texas (especially western and
      central Texas), and Wynnewood is in Oklahoma, it''s highly likely that Wynnewood
      is east of The Homesteads, TX.


      However, without knowing the exact location of "The Homesteads, TX" (which could
      be in eastern Texas), I cannot be completely certain. If The Homesteads is in
      far eastern Texas, it could potentially be east of Wynnewood, OK.

      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of Port Wentworth, GA and Edmund,
      SC.

      - Port Wentworth is a city in Georgia, located near Savannah in the eastern
      part of Georgia.

      - Edmund (or Edmond), SC would be in South Carolina.


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Georgia and South Carolina.

      - South Carolina is located directly east of Georgia.

      - Georgia''s eastern border meets South Carolina''s western border.


      Step 3: Determine the specific locations within their states.

      - Port Wentworth is near Savannah, which is on Georgia''s Atlantic coast in
      the far eastern part of the state.

      - Edmund, SC would be somewhere within South Carolina, which is entirely east
      of Georgia (except for locations right at the border).


      Step 4: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Since South Carolina is east of Georgia, and Port Wentworth is in Georgia
      while Edmund is in South Carolina, Edmund would generally be east of Port Wentworth.

      - Therefore, Port Wentworth would NOT be east of Edmund.

      - However, Port Wentworth is in the eastern part of Georgia, close to the South
      Carolina border.


      Step 3: Check the specific locations.

      - Port Wentworth is located just northwest of Savannah, GA, near the Savannah
      River which forms part of the GA-SC border.

      - Edmund, SC appears to be in the central or western part of South Carolina.


      Step 4: Compare the east-west positions.

      SC is in the central part of South Carolina, which would place it east of Port
      Wentworth which is on Georgia''s eastern border. Georgia is generally west of
      South Carolina, so a city in Georgia would typically be west of a city in central

      - Edmund, SC would be somewhere within South Carolina.


      Step 3: Consider their specific locations.

      - Port Wentworth is on the Savannah River, which forms part of the GA-SC border,
      and is very close to the Atlantic coast.

      - Looking at the specific location of Edmund, SC - I need to note that Edmund
      is not a major city in South Carolina, and may be referring to a smaller community.


      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison.

      - Port Wentworth is in the far eastern part of Georgia, right on the border
      with South Carolina.

      - Most of South Carolina, including any place called Edmund, would be east of
      the Georgia border.

      - Virginia is mostly west of North Carolina when at similar latitudes

      - Union Mill, VA is in northern Virginia

      - Sneads Ferry, NC is on North Carolina''s coast, near the Atlantic Ocean


      Step 4: Sneads Ferry is specifically on North Carolina''s eastern coast, very
      close to the Atlantic Ocean, making it quite far east.

      - Union Mill, VA, being in Virginia, is likely further inland and therefore
      west of Sneads Ferry.

      Step 1: Locate West Sand Lake, NY.

      West Sand Lake is located in Rensselaer County in eastern New York state, near
      Albany and Troy.


      Step 2: Locate Old Brookville, NY.

      Old Brookville is located on Long Island in Nassau County, which is in the southeastern
      part of New York state.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      New York state generally extends from west to east, with the western part bordering
      Lake Erie and the eastern part including Long Island which extends into the
      Atlantic Ocean. Long Island (where Old Brookville is) is in the southeastern
      portion of the state, extending eastward into the Atlantic. The Albany/Troy
      area (where West Sand Lake is) is in the eastern part of the mainland of New
      York, but is still west of Long Island.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Old Brookville is on Long Island, which extends further east than the
      Albany area where West Sand Lake is located, West Sand Lake is actually west
      of Old Brookville, not east.


      NO, West Sand Lake, NY is not located east of Old Brookville, NY. It is located
      west of Old Brookville.'

      Step 1: Let me identify the states. Minnesota (MN) is in the upper Midwest,
      and Iowa (IA) is directly south of Minnesota.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west positioning of these states. Minnesota
      and Iowa are roughly aligned along the north-south axis, with Minnesota to the
      north of Iowa.


      Step 3: Let me think about the specific cities. Park Rapids is in north-central
      Minnesota. Elk Horn is in western Iowa.


      Step 4: Comparing the east-west positions: Minnesota and Iowa are roughly aligned
      on the east-west axis, but Park Rapids is in the central part of Minnesota,
      while Elk Horn is in the western part of Iowa. This means Park Rapids is likely
      east of Elk Horn.

      - MO is Missouri, located in the central United States


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      - Minnesota is generally north and east of Missouri

      - Minnesota is positioned in the Upper Midwest, while Missouri is in the Midwest


      Step 3: Check the specific locations of these cities.

      - St. Michael is in Minnesota, which is positioned to the northeast of Missouri

      - Leeton is in Missouri, which is positioned to the southwest of Minnesota


      Step 4: Consider longitude (east-west positioning).

      - States in this region generally follow a pattern where locations further east
      have higher longitude values

      - Minnesota is positioned somewhat east of Missouri, though they are both in
      the central part of the country


      Based on the geographic arrangement of the United States, St. Michael, Minnesota
      would be located east of Leeton, Missouri, as Minnesota is positioned east of
      Missouri in the U.S. map.


      NO


      Wait, I need to double-check this. Looking more carefully at the map positions:

      - Minnesota is primarily north of Missouri

      - Minnesota is also somewhat east of Missouri


      So St. Michael, MN would indeed be east of Leeton, MO.

      United States.

      - Nisqually Indian Community is in Washington (WA), which is also on the west
      coast, but north of California.


      Step 2: Consider their general east-west positioning.

      - Both locations are in west coast states.

      - Washington is directly north of California.

      - Generally, locations in Washington and California tend to be roughly aligned
      on a north-south axis rather than east-west.


      Step 3: Consider more specific geography.

      - Penngrove, CA is likely in the western part of California, probably near the
      coast.

      - Nisqually Indian Community, WA is likely in western Washington, as many tribal
      lands in Washington are in that region.

      - When comparing locations on the same coast but in different states (one north
      of the other), the eastern/western relationship depends on how the coastline
      curves.


      Step 4: The Pacific coastline angles slightly northeast as it goes from California
      to Washington, which means Washington locations tend to be slightly east of
      California locations at the same distance from the coast.


      Based on this geographic reasoning, Penngrove, CA would likely be west of Nisqually
