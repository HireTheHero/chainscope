      1) First, let me recall the general geography:

      - Iowa (IA) is in the upper Midwest

      - Louisiana (LA) is in the Deep South

      2) Let me consider their positions relative to the Mississippi:

      - Garnavillo, IA is in Clayton County, right along the Mississippi River on
      the Iowa side

      - Newellton, LA is in Tensas Parish, also near the Mississippi River on the
      Louisiana side


      3) Since both cities are near the Mississippi River, which flows north to south,

      - Garnavillo is on the west bank of the Mississippi in Iowa

      - Newellton is on the west bank of the Mississippi in Louisiana


      4) Since they''re both on the same side of the river and Louisiana is directly
      south of Iowa, they are roughly in the same longitudinal alignment, with Newellton
      being slightly further west.

      2. To determine which is further east, I can consider that:

      - South Deerfield is in the Connecticut River Valley of western MA

      - Thompsonville is also in the Connecticut River Valley

      - Both cities are actually quite close to the Connecticut River


      3. Looking at their specific positions:

      - It''s in southwestern PA, near Uniontown

      - It''s close to the West Virginia border


      2. Next, let me recall where Oil City, PA is located:

      - Oil City is in Venango County

      - It''s in northwestern PA

      - It''s in the oil region of PA


      3. Now I can compare their relative positions:

      - Hopwood is in the southwestern part of PA

      - Oil City is in the northwestern part of PA

      - When comparing east-west positions, Hopwood is further east than Oil City


      Therefore: YES'

      - Collegeville lies along the Perkiomen Creek

      - Chesterbrook is near Valley Forge

      - Looking at a mental map, Collegeville is to the northwest of Chesterbrook


      3. Therefore, since Collegeville is to the northwest of Chesterbrook, it cannot
      be east of it.

      - Wapato, WA is in Washington state, in the Yakima Valley

      - Orcutt, CA is in California, near Santa Maria on the central coast


      2) To determine if one is east of the other, I need to compare their relative
      positions:

      - Wapato, WA being in Washington state is much further north

      - Orcutt, CA is on the California coast, meaning it''s very western

      - Washington state extends further east than California''s coast


      3) Looking at their relative longitude:

      - Orcutt is right on the Pacific coast

      east of Orcutt

      1. First, let me recall the locations:

      - Wynnewood, OK is in south-central Oklahoma

      - The Homesteads, TX is in eastern Texas


      2. To determine if one place is east of another, I need to compare their relative
      positions on an east-west axis.


      3. Oklahoma is generally north of Texas, but that''s not relevant for east-west
      positioning.


      4. Wynnewood, OK is located in south-central Oklahoma, while The Homesteads,
      TX is in eastern Texas.


      5. Being in eastern Texas, The Homesteads would be further east than a location
      in central Oklahoma.


      Therefore: NO, Wynnewood, OK is not located east of The Homesteads, TX.'

      2. To determine east/west positioning:

      - Louisiana is west of Mississippi

      - Elmwood is in southeastern Louisiana

      - Crenshaw is in northwestern Mississippi


      3. Even though Elmwood is in eastern Louisiana and Crenshaw is in western Mississippi,
      Mississippi as a whole lies east of Louisiana. Since these cities aren''t near
      the border in a way that would create an exception, Elmwood must be west of
      Crenshaw.
