      1. **Pattambi:** Pattambi is a town and a municipality in the Palakkad district

      2. **Burnley:** Burnley is a town in Lancashire, England. It has a well-defined

      Now, let''s compare the two:


      - Pattambi, being a town in India, tends to have a smaller area compared to
      larger administrative regions but can vary significantly compared to towns in
      other countries.

      - Burnley, as a town within the UK, also has a defined but relatively small
      area.


      Thus, to determine which is larger, we would need specific area measurements
      for both locations. However, generally speaking, towns in India can sometimes
      cover larger areas due to less dense urban development compared to UK towns.


      Given typical size comparisons, Pattambi is likely to cover a larger area than
      Burnley, but specific data would be required to confirm this with certainty.


      Based on general assumptions, the answer is likely:


      NO, Pattambi does not have a larger area than Burnley.'

      Upazilas in Bangladesh vary in size, but Comilla Sadar Dakshin Upazila is relatively
      small given the context of administrative divisions in Bangladesh.


      2. **Paros (regional unit)**: This is a regional unit in Greece, which includes
      the island of Paros and some surrounding smaller islands. Greek islands and
      their respective regional units can vary in size, with Paros being a reasonably
      sized island.


      3. **Area of Paros**: The island of Paros has an area of approximately 196 square
      kilometers.


      4. **Area of Comilla Sadar Dakshin Upazila**: The area is approximately 241
      square kilometers.


      By comparing these figures, Comilla Sadar Dakshin Upazila (241 square kilometers)
      is larger than the island of Paros (196 square kilometers).


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.'

      the relative sizes of Qit''at Jaradah and the Zhongsha Islands.


      1. **Qit''at Jaradah**: This is a small, uninhabited island in the Persian Gulf.
      It is known to be a very small islet, often submerged at high tide, indicating
      that it has a very minimal land area.


      2. **Zhongsha Islands**: Also known as the Macclesfield Bank, this is not a
      traditional island group with substantial land area. Instead, it is mostly a
      submerged atoll in the South China Sea. While it is referred to as "islands,"
      it does not have significant land above sea level.


      When comparing the two:


      - **Qit''at Jaradah** has a very small land area, sometimes submerged.

      - **Zhongsha Islands**, primarily a submerged bank, technically has no land
      area above water.


      Therefore, while neither location has significant land area, Qit''at Jaradah,

      Jaradah has a larger area than the Zhongsha Islands, we need to consider the
      following points:


      1. **Qit''at Jaradah**: This is a small, uninhabited island in the Persian Gulf,
      located between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. It is known for being a tidal island,
      meaning its size can vary with the tide, but it is generally very small.


      2. **Zhongsha Islands**: This refers to the Macclesfield Bank, which is an entirely
      submerged atoll in the South China Sea. It is part of the disputed territories
      in the region claimed by several countries, including China. The Zhongsha Islands
      do not have any land area above sea level.


      Comparing the two:


      - **Qit''at Jaradah** has some land area, albeit very small, since it is a tidal
      island.

      - **Zhongsha Islands (Macclesfield Bank)** have no land area above water as
      they are completely submerged.


      Thus, based on the definition of having an actual land area above sea level,
      Qit''at Jaradah, despite its small size, has a larger area than the Zhongsha
      Islands, which have no land area at all.

      1. **Qit''at Jaradah**: This is a tiny, disputed islet in the Persian Gulf,
      located between Bahrain and Qatar. It is known for being very small, often described
      as a tidal sandbank that may even be submerged at high tide.


      2. **Zhongsha Islands**: Also known as the Macclesfield Bank, this is a large,
      submerged atoll in the South China Sea. While it is mostly underwater, the area
      it covers is extensive, even though it does not have land that is above sea
      level.


      In terms of land area, Qit''at Jaradah, despite being very small, is an islet
      that can be above water, while the Zhongsha Islands (Macclesfield Bank) are
      entirely submerged. However, if considering the overall area they cover, including
      submerged portions, the Zhongsha Islands cover a much larger area.


      Given the context of land area that is above water, Qit''at Jaradah would technically
      be "larger" in the sense that it has some above-water presence, but in terms
      of total area covered, the Zhongsha Islands are larger.

      2. **Identify Zhongsha Islands**: The Zhongsha Islands, also known as the Macclesfield

      urban agglomeration around the capital, San Salvador.

      small, but since it is in a rural part of Belarus, it might have a larger area
      than an urbanized city like Mejicanos.


      To answer the question accurately, we need to check the specific land areas
      of both Mejicanos and Horki:


      - Mejicanos has an area of approximately 22.12 square kilometers.

      - Horki has an area of approximately 18.08 square kilometers.

      down:


      1. **Identify Avarua**: Avarua is the capital of the Cook Islands, located on
      the island of Rarotonga.


      2. **Identify Ballenger Creek, Maryland**: Ballenger Creek is a census-designated
      place (CDP) in Frederick County, Maryland, USA.


      3. **Determine the area of Avarua**: Avarua is a district on the island of Rarotonga
      and does not cover the entire island. The island of Rarotonga itself has an
      area of about 67 square kilometers, but Avarua is just a part of it.


      4. **Determine the area of Ballenger Creek, Maryland**: According to the United
      States Census Bureau, Ballenger Creek has an area of about 22.1 square kilometers
      (8.5 square miles).


      5. **Compare the areas**: Given that Avarua is only a part of Rarotonga, its
      area is likely smaller than the total area of Ballenger Creek, Maryland.


      Based on these steps, the answer is:


      NO, Avarua does not have a larger area than Ballenger Creek, Maryland.'

      1. **Avarua**: Avarua is the capital of the Cook Islands, located on the island
      of Rarotonga. It is a district rather than a large city, and the Cook Islands
      themselves are relatively small in terms of land area.


      2. **Ballenger Creek, Maryland**: Ballenger Creek is a census-designated place
      (CDP) in Frederick County, Maryland, USA. CDPs generally cover a small geographic
      area.


      Next, we need to find the approximate area of each location:


      - The Cook Islands, including Avarua, have a total land area of about 240 square
      kilometers, but Avarua itself is just a small part of Rarotonga.

      - Ballenger Creek covers an area of approximately 20 square miles (around 52
      square kilometers).


      Given these approximations, Avarua, as a district within a small island, is

      1. **Avarua**: Avarua is the capital and largest town on the island of Rarotonga

      the Cook Islands. The area of Avarua itself is relatively small since it is
      essentially a town rather than an extensive geographical area.


      2. **Ballenger Creek, Maryland**: Ballenger Creek is a census-designated place

      has a defined area that is larger than a small town or village, but smaller
      than a city.


      Next, we need to look at the approximate sizes:


      - Avarua, as a town, covers only a portion of Rarotonga, which itself is a small
      island with an area of about 67 square kilometers (26 square miles).

      - Ballenger Creek, Maryland, based on its designation as a census-designated
      place, would cover an area typical for such regions in the United States, generally
      several square miles, but likely less than the entire island of Rarotonga.


      Given these considerations, it is unlikely that the town of Avarua itself has

      area than Qingshui District, let''s analyze the two locations step by step:


      1. **Hlohovec**: This is a town in Slovakia. It is not a large city, and its
      area is relatively small compared to major urban districts.


      2. **Qingshui District**: This is a district in Taichung, Taiwan. Districts
      in major cities like Taichung can vary in size, but they often cover a substantial
      urban area.


      Now, let''s compare the two:


      - Hlohovec, being a town in Slovakia, is unlikely to have a very large area
