      Researching Sisquoc, California:

      - Sisquoc is an unincorporated community in Santa Barbara County

      - It appears to be a very small rural area

      - Precise area measurements are not readily available

      - Its total area is approximately 0.6 square miles


      While I cannot definitively state the exact area of Sisquoc, the fact that it''s
      an unincorporated rural community suggests it is likely smaller than the 0.6
      square miles of Morgan''s Point.

      NO, Sisquoc, California does NOT have a larger area than Morgan''s Point, Texas.'

      Step 1: Researching Sisquoc, California

      - Sisquoc is an unincorporated community in Santa Barbara County

      - It is a very small rural area

      - Its precise area is not readily available, but it appears to be quite small


      Step 2: Researching Morgan''s Point, Texas

      - It covers approximately 0.6 square miles (about 1.55 square kilometers)


      Step 3: Comparison

      - While I don''t have an exact area for Sisquoc, it seems very unlikely to be
      larger than 0.6 square miles

      - Rural unincorporated communities are typically quite small

      1. First, I''ll need to find the area of Sisquoc, California

      2. Then I''ll find the area of Morgan''s Point, Texas

      3. Then I''ll compare their areas


      Step 1: Researching Sisquoc, California

      - Sisquoc is an unincorporated community in Santa Barbara County

      - It appears to be a very small rural area

      - Precise area measurements are not readily available


      Step 2: Researching Morgan''s Point, Texas

      - Morgan''s Point is a small city in Harris County, Texas

      - It is also a very small municipality

      - Its total area is approximately 0.6 square miles


      Step 3: Comparison

      - While I don''t have an exact measurement for Sisquoc, most unincorporated
      communities are quite small

      - Morgan''s Point has a defined area of 0.6 square miles

      - It seems unlikely that Sisquoc would be larger


      Therefore, based on the available information and reasoning:


      NO, Sisquoc does not have a larger area than Morgan''s Point, Texas.'

      Checking reliable sources:

      - Sisquoc is an unincorporated community in Santa Barbara County, California

      - Morgan''s Point is a small city in Harris County, Texas


      Researching their areas:

      - Sisquoc appears to be a very small rural community with minimal defined area

      - Bethune is a small unincorporated community in Kit Carson County, Colorado

      - As a very small rural community, its official area is likely quite small


      2. Next, I''ll consider Madison Park, Baltimore

      - Madison Park is a neighborhood within Baltimore, Maryland

      3. To compare definitively, I would need precise area measurements for both

      - Rural communities like Bethune tend to have very small official areas

      - Urban neighborhoods like Madison Park typically have modest but defined areas
