      North Carolina, has an area of approximately 1,413 square kilometers.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that 1,427 square kilometers (Caldwell County, Texas)
      is greater than 1,413 square kilometers (Mecklenburg County, North Carolina),
      we can conclude that Caldwell County, Texas, has a larger area than Mecklenburg
      County, North Carolina.

    798cf798-adf7-4944-8df8-fd4759987f1c: 'To determine whether Bethune, Colorado,
      has a larger area than Madison Park, Baltimore, we need to break down the information
      and compare the areas of these two places.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to understand what Bethune, Colorado,
      and Madison Park, Baltimore, are. Bethune is a town in Kit Carson County, Colorado,
      in the United States. Madison Park is a neighborhood in Baltimore, Maryland,
      also in the United States.


      2. **Find Area Information**: Next, we need to find the area of both locations.
      The area of Bethune, Colorado, is approximately 0.42 square miles. For Madison
      Park, Baltimore, its area is not explicitly stated, but we can assume it''s
      a relatively small neighborhood within the city.


      3. **Compare Areas**: Now, we compare the areas. Bethune has an area of 0.42
      square miles, which is a small town. Madison Park, being a neighborhood in a
      city, would typically have a smaller area.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Bethune has an area of 0.42 square miles, which
      is relatively small, and Madison Park is a neighborhood within a city, it''s
      reasonable to conclude that Bethune, Colorado, does not have a larger area than

      of approximately 21,934 square kilometers, while Androy has an area of approximately
      19,317 square kilometers.


      Given these areas, it is clear that Atsinanana has a larger area than Androy.


      The answer is: $\boxed{YES}$

      4. **Conclusion**: Given that 77.53 square kilometers (Urbania) is less than
      3,778 square kilometers (Yoro Department), we can conclude that Urbania does
      not have a larger area than Yoro Department.

      3. **Compare Areas**: Given that the area of Brightwell-cum-Sotwell is 7.97
      square kilometers, and assuming that Shirali has a smaller area, we can conclude
      that Brightwell-cum-Sotwell has a larger area than Shirali.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the available information and assumptions, it is
      reasonable to conclude that Brightwell-cum-Sotwell has a larger area than Shirali.
