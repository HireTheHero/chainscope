      Mandamarri is a town in Mancherial district, Telangana, India.


      2. **Find the location of Penuganchiprolu:** Penuganchiprolu is a village in
      Krishna district, Andhra Pradesh, India.


      3. **Determine area:**  Generally, towns have a larger area than villages.  While
      precise area measurements might be hard to find quickly,  it''s highly probable
      based on their respective designations (town vs. village) that Mandamarri is
      larger.

    c0d87b5a-fab1-438d-804e-039d626defc7: '1. **Identify the locations:** Mandamarri
      and Penuganchiprolu are both in India.  Mandamarri is a town in Telangana, while
      Penuganchiprolu is a village in Andhra Pradesh.


      2. **Consider area size relating to designation:** Towns generally have a larger
      area than villages.


      3. **Reasoning:** Given that Mandamarri is a town and Penuganchiprolu is a village,
      it is highly probable that Mandamarri has a larger area.

      India.


      2. **General knowledge about towns and villages:** Towns generally have larger
      areas than villages within the same region.


      3. **Reasoning:** Since Mandamarri is a town and Penuganchiprolu is a village,
      it''s highly likely Mandamarri has a larger area.

    f3b4fb77-2ba0-464c-a98f-7488c6a00d7d: '1. **Identify the locations:** Mandamarri
      and Penuganchiprolu are both towns/villages in India.  Mandamarri is in Telangana
      state, and Penuganchiprolu is in Andhra Pradesh state.


      2. **Find a reliable source for area information:**  A good source for this
      type of information would be a government website or a reputable geographic
      database.  Unfortunately, precise area measurements for small towns/villages
      are not always readily available.  Population figures are easier to find, but  population
      doesn''t necessarily equate to area.


      3. **Compare the areas (if possible):**  Since precise area information isn''t
      readily available for small administrative units like these, a definitive comparison
      is difficult.


      4. **Consider alternative approaches:**  Looking at maps may give a general
      idea, but can be misleading without a scale.


      Since I can''t find reliable area data for these specific towns, I cannot definitively
      answer the question.  Therefore, I cannot say YES or NO.

      quick search reveals County Kilkenny, Ireland is approximately 2,061 square
      kilometers.


      2. **Find the area of Puster Valley:** Searching for the area of Puster Valley
      (Pustertal in German) is trickier.  It''s not an administratively defined area
      like a county. It''s a valley in the Alps spanning parts of Italy and Austria.  Therefore,
      finding a precise area is difficult.  However, sources suggest it''s *much*
      smaller than Kilkenny.  For example, the area of the "Puster Valley District"
      (Bezirk Lienz/Osttirol), which encompasses *part* of the valley within Austria,
      is around 2,020 sq km. Even if the entire valley, including the Italian portion,
      were twice that size, it would still be comparable to Kilkenny.  However, it''s
      unlikely the Italian portion is anywhere near that large.

      Valley extends beyond this district.  Therefore, determining a precise area
      is difficult.

      3. **Consider the scope of "Puster Valley":**  We need to clarify what constitutes
      the "Puster Valley" for this comparison.  It''s a long valley encompassing several
      municipalities and even crossing a national border.  Any area calculation would
      need to define the specific boundaries in question.  Without a clear definition,
      a precise comparison is impossible.

      we cannot determine whether it''s larger than County Kilkenny.

      a town in India. Versailles, Pennsylvania is a borough in the United States.


      2. **Consider the concept of area:**  Towns/cities/boroughs encompass a certain
      land area.  We need to determine which one covers more land.


      3. **Research the areas (if possible):** While precise area comparisons might
      be difficult to find readily, general knowledge suggests Indian towns, especially
      those with industrial significance like Patratu (known for its thermal power
      plant), are likely to be larger than a small borough in Pennsylvania.


      4. **Reasoning:**  Given the general size difference between a town in India
      and a small borough in the US, it''s highly probable Patratu has a larger area.



      **Answer: YES**

    42b42f39-9f87-49ca-81d5-67dcfcd66d39: '1. **Identify Patratu:** Patratu is a town
      in Jharkhand, India.  It''s known for its thermal power plant and dam.  While
      it has an urban area, it isn''t a large city.


      2. **Identify Versailles, Pennsylvania:** Versailles is a borough in Allegheny
      County, Pennsylvania, USA.  It''s a suburb of Pittsburgh and likely much smaller
      than a town in India.


      3. **Consider "area":** The question asks about area.  While Patratu might have
      a larger urbanized area or greater population, Versailles, being part of a county
      in the US, might have a larger formally defined municipal area encompassing
      surrounding land.  However, given the difference in population and general size
      of settlements in India vs. small-town USA, it''s very likely Patratu covers
      a larger area.

      County, Pennsylvania, USA.  It''s also a relatively small place.


      3. **Consider the relative sizes:** While both are small, Indian towns often
      encompass a larger surrounding area than similarly named places in the US, which
      tend to be more densely populated.


      4. **Look for data if possible:**  Finding definitive area measurements for
      both might be difficult.


      5. **Reasoning based on general knowledge:**  Given the typical urban development
      patterns in India vs. the US, it''s more probable that Patratu covers a larger
      area, even if its population isn''t necessarily bigger.

      County, Pennsylvania, USA.  Boroughs in Pennsylvania are usually relatively
      small.


      3. **Compare likely sizes:**  Indian towns, even smaller ones, often encompass
      surrounding rural areas.  A Pennsylvania borough will likely be more tightly
      defined.

      area than Versailles, Pennsylvania.

      is a town in India. Versailles, Pennsylvania is a borough in the United States.


      * **Step 2: Consider what "larger area" implies.** This refers to physical size,
      land area.


      * **Step 3: Find information about their areas.**  While precise area for Patratu
      might be hard to find readily, it is a town encompassing multiple villages and
      industrial areas. Versailles, Pennsylvania is a small borough.  General knowledge
      suggests Indian towns, even smaller ones, typically encompass a larger area
      than small boroughs in the US.


      * **Step 4: Compare the likely areas.**  Given the nature of these places (town
      in India vs. small borough in the US), Patratu is highly likely to have a larger

      industrial town in Ramgarh district, Jharkhand, India.  While it might have
      a surrounding urban area, it''s not a major city.


      2. **Identify Versailles, Pennsylvania:** Versailles is a borough in Allegheny
      County, Pennsylvania, USA.  It''s also a relatively small place.


      3. **Compare Sizes (generally):**  Indian towns, even small industrial ones,
      often have larger populations and potentially larger areas than similarly described
      boroughs in the USA.  This is a generalization, but a reasonable starting point
      for comparison.


      4. **Look for Data (if readily available):**  A quick search doesn''t immediately
      yield precise area figures for either place, making direct comparison difficult
      without more in-depth research.


      5. **Reasoning based on General Knowledge:** Given the nature of Indian towns

      in Jharkhand, India.  While it has a surrounding valley and a thermal power
      plant, its specific municipal area is likely smaller than a larger city or region.


      2. **Identify Versailles, Pennsylvania:** Versailles is a borough in Allegheny
      County, Pennsylvania, USA.  Boroughs in the US are generally incorporated municipalities,
      meaning they have a defined area.


      3. **Compare likely sizes:**  Indian towns can vary greatly in size, but given
      Patratu is not a major city, it''s reasonable to assume its formal area is smaller
      than a US borough, which is a clearly defined municipality.


      4. **Consider potential ambiguity:** The question asks about "area."  This could
      theoretically refer to a broader region around Patratu, rather than a specifically
      defined municipal area. However, without further clarification, it''s best to
      compare like-for-like (municipality to municipality).

      3. **Compare Sizes:**  Generally speaking, even small towns in India have larger

    03c59135-0fde-4a25-9c14-8519a4e0596c: '1. **Identify Eisacktal:** Eisacktal (Isarco
      Valley) is a valley in South Tyrol, Italy.  It''s not an administratively defined
      area with precise borders, so determining its exact area is difficult.


      2. **Identify Lospalos:** Lospalos is a town and administrative post (subdistrict)
      in East Timor (Timor-Leste).  Again, the exact area might be hard to pin down
      definitively, but it''s a defined region.


      3. **Compare likely areas:** A valley is generally geographically larger than
      a town or even a subdistrict. Even a long valley like Eisacktal is likely to
      encompass a larger area than the administrative region around the town of Lospalos.


      4. **Consider ambiguities:** While the area of Eisacktal is vague, it seems
      highly improbable that the area commonly referred to by that name would be *smaller*
      than the area administered from Lospalos.


      **Answer:** YES

      Valley) is in South Tyrol, Italy.  It''s a valley, not a precisely defined political
      entity.  Therefore, its area is not officially defined.


      2. **Identify Lospalos:** Lospalos is a town in East Timor, now officially called
      Lospalos (municipality).  This is a defined administrative region.


      3. **Compare areas:** Since Eisacktal''s area is not officially defined, a precise
      comparison is impossible. However, even considering a generous estimate of the
      area encompassed by the valley, it''s highly unlikely to be larger than an entire
      municipality.


      4. **Conclusion:** NO.

      to refer to the area surrounding the Isarco River.


      2. **Identify Lospalos:** Lospalos is a town and administrative post (subdistrict)

      talking about the town itself or the wider administrative area.


      3. **Compare likely areas:** Even the larger definition of Lospalos (the administrative

      valley.  Valleys tend to encompass significant land area, while administrative
      posts, even in less densely populated regions, are usually smaller.

      3. **Comparing Valley to Municipality:** Comparing a valley (a geographical
      feature) to a municipality (an administrative region) is tricky.  A municipality
      has set boundaries. A valley has a less precise definition.  However, even a
      generous interpretation of the Eisacktal region would likely be smaller than
      an entire municipality.


      4. **Reasonable Size Comparison:**  Thinking generally, valleys tend to be smaller
      than entire administrative districts like municipalities.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.

    7bb45636-84ea-4c23-88cf-c29f118347d3: '1. **Identify the entities:** Severo-Kurilsky
      District is in Russia. Quetta is a city in Pakistan.

      2. **Compare entity types:**  A district (similar to a county or province) is
      generally larger than a city.

      3. **Consider extreme cases:** While a very large city *might* be bigger than
      a very small district, this is unlikely given the locations. Russia has large
      districts, and Quetta, while a major city in Pakistan, isn''t exceptionally
      vast.


      Therefore, the answer is almost certainly **YES**.
