      2. Let me find the area of Madison Park, Baltimore:

      - Madison Park is a neighborhood in Baltimore, Maryland

      - Based on available data, Madison Park is a small residential neighborhood

      - However, I cannot find a definitive area measurement for Madison Park


      3. Reasoning:

      - While I know Bethune''s area is 0.2 square miles

      - I cannot make a direct comparison without knowing Madison Park''s exact area

      - Therefore, I cannot make a conclusive comparison


      Since I cannot find reliable area data for Madison Park to compare with Bethune''s
      0.2 square miles, I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer to this question.


      I must abstain from giving a YES/NO answer due to insufficient data.'

      1. First, let me check Bethune, Colorado:

      - Bethune is a statutory town in Kit Carson County, Colorado

      - It has a total area of 0.2 square miles


      2. Now, let me check Madison Park, Baltimore:

      - Madison Park is a neighborhood in Baltimore, Maryland

      - While exact area data is hard to find for this neighborhood, based on maps

      a few blocks


      3. Comparing:

      - Bethune at 0.2 square miles is a very small town

      - Madison Park as an urban neighborhood likely covers less than 0.2 square miles

      4. Making a conclusion:

      - While exact data for Madison Park is limited, as a small urban neighborhood
      it''s likely smaller than even the small town of Bethune


      Answer: YES'

      2) Zhongsha Islands (also known as Macclesfield Bank) is a group of underwater
      reefs and shoals in the South China Sea

      - While mostly submerged, it covers a significant area of ocean

      - The total area of the bank is approximately 6,448 square kilometers


      3) Comparing the two:

      - Qit''at Jaradah: ~few hundred square meters

      - Zhongsha Islands: ~6,448 square kilometers (which is millions of square meters)


      NO (Qit''at Jaradah is much smaller than Zhongsha Islands)'

      1. First, let me recall what Qit''at Jaradah is:

      - It''s a tiny uninhabited sand bank/islet between Bahrain and Qatar

      - It''s extremely small, just a patch of sand barely above water

      - Its area is approximately 0.01 square kilometers


      2. Now, let me recall what Zhongsha Islands are:

      - They are a group of underwater reefs and banks in the South China Sea

      - While mostly submerged, they cover a significant maritime area

      - The total area of the maritime zone is several thousand square kilometers


      3. Comparing the two:

      - Qit''at Jaradah is just a tiny speck of sand

      - Zhongsha Islands, even though mostly underwater, cover a much larger area


      NO (Qit''at Jaradah does not have a larger area than Zhongsha Islands)'

      - Lospalos is a town in East Timor


      2) For a fair comparison, I need to find their areas:

      - However, I''m unable to find reliable area measurements for either location

      - Eisacktal is a significant valley in northern Italy

      - Lospalos is a relatively small town

      - Lospalos is a small administrative town


      Based on these considerations, while I cannot be 100% certain without exact

      or size

      - Yoro Department is a department (administrative division) in Honduras


      2. Since I cannot find reliable information about Urbania''s area, or even confirm
      if it exists as a real place...


      3. Without having definitive area measurements for both places to compare, I
      cannot make a valid comparison.


      4. When unable to verify the necessary information to make a comparison, I cannot
      make a definitive claim.


      Answer: NO reliable YES/NO answer can be given due to insufficient information
      about Urbania.'

      - Brightwell-cum-Sotwell is a village and civil parish in Oxfordshire, England

      - Shirali is a village in Karnataka, India


      2. Looking for area measurements:

      - For Brightwell-cum-Sotwell, I can find that it has an area of approximately
      6.69 square kilometers

      - For Shirali, I cannot find a reliable specific area measurement


      3. Reasoning:

      - While I know Brightwell-cum-Sotwell''s area, I don''t have enough information
      about Shirali''s area to make a definitive comparison

      - Without both measurements, I cannot make a valid comparison


      4. Conclusion:

      YES or NO answer.
