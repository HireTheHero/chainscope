      Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is in the northern part of Pakistan, while Balochistan is
      in the southwestern part. This means Khanpur Dam is at a higher latitude (more
      north) than Mirani Dam, which is in the south.

      - Andhra Pradesh Secretariat is in Andhra Pradesh, a state in southern India.

      Hyderabad, but Hyderabad went to Telangana after the state split).

      - Polgolla Barrage is a dam/barrage located in Sri Lanka, specifically in the
      central highlands of Sri Lanka.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Andhra Pradesh (India) is located on the mainland of South Asia, north of
      Sri Lanka.

      - Sri Lanka is an island nation south of India, separated by the Palk Strait.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Any location in mainland India (including Andhra Pradesh) would be north of
      most locations in Sri Lanka.

      - Polgolla Barrage, being in central Sri Lanka, is definitely south of any point
      in Andhra Pradesh.


      Therefore, the Andhra Pradesh Secretariat is located north of Polgolla Barrage.

      of Skaill House and Sacred Heart Church in Wimbledon to answer this question.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Skaill House.

      Skaill House is a historic manor house located in Orkney, Scotland. Specifically,
      it''s on the west coast of Mainland, Orkney, near the Bay of Skaill and the
      prehistoric settlement of Skara Brae.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Sacred Heart Church, Wimbledon.

      Sacred Heart Church in Wimbledon is located in southwest London, England.


      Step 3: Compare their geographic positions.

      Orkney is an archipelago in the northern part of Scotland, which is significantly
      north of London. Scotland is north of England, and Orkney is in the far north
      of Scotland.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Skaill House is in Orkney, Scotland (far north), and Sacred Heart Church
      is in Wimbledon, London (southern England), Skaill House is definitely located
      north of Sacred Heart Church.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Benthall Hall is a historic house in Shropshire, England, UK.

      - Cruas Nuclear Power Plant is located in Cruas, France.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - England is located north of France in Europe.

      - Shropshire is in the west midlands of England.

      - Cruas is in southern France.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Locations in England are generally at higher latitudes (more northerly) than
      locations in southern France.

      - Shropshire, England is definitely north of the southern region of France where
      Cruas is located.


      Based on this analysis, Benthall Hall is indeed located north of Cruas Nuclear

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both places.

      - Buckhorn Lake is in Kentucky, which is a state in the eastern United States.

      - The Majestic Theatre is in San Antonio, Texas, which is in the southern United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on a map.

      - Kentucky is generally located in the north-central to northeastern part of
      the United States.

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Kentucky is significantly north of Texas on a map of the United States.

      - San Antonio is in southern Texas.

      - Buckhorn Lake would be in Kentucky, which is entirely north of any part of
      Texas.


      Therefore, Buckhorn Lake (Kentucky) is indeed located north of the Majestic
      Theatre (San Antonio, Texas).
