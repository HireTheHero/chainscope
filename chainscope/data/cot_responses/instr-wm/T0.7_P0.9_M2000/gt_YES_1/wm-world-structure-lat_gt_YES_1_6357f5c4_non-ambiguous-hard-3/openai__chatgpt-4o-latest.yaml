      1. Identify the location of Windy Hill Wind Farm.

      2. Identify the location of St Mark''s Church, Darling Point.

      3. Compare their relative positions on the map to determine if Windy Hill Wind
      Farm is north of St Mark''s Church.


      Step 1: Windy Hill Wind Farm is located near Ravenshoe, in Far North Queensland,
      Australia. Ravenshoe is situated inland and is known as the highest town in
      Queensland.


      Step 2: St Mark''s Church is located in Darling Point, which is a suburb of

      Step 3: Comparing the two locations:

      - Ravenshoe (and thus Windy Hill Wind Farm) is in Far North Queensland, which
      is significantly further north than Sydney (where Darling Point is located).

      - Sydney is in the southeastern part of Australia, whereas Far North Queensland
      is in the northeastern part, and much closer to the equator.

      the geographic locations of both:


      1. **Inner City Bypass, Brisbane**: This road is located in Brisbane, which

      northeastern part of Australia.


      2. **South Gippsland Freeway**: This freeway is located in Victoria, Australia,

      part of Australia.


      3. **Relative Position**: Brisbane (Queensland) is significantly farther north
      than Melbourne (Victoria). Therefore, any location within Brisbane, such as
      the Inner City Bypass, would be to the north of any location in Melbourne, including
      the South Gippsland Freeway.


      So, step by step:

      - Identify the cities and states where each roadway is located.
