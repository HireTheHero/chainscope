      to establish the geographical locations of both structures.


      1. **Identify the location of the Church of the Life-Giving Trinity**: This
      church is located in Pyongyang, the capital city of North Korea.


      2. **Identify the location of Casa de Segunda**: Casa de Segunda is located
      in Madrid, Spain.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Pyongyang is situated in East Asia,
      while Madrid is in Southern Europe. Given that Pyongyang is significantly north
      of the equator, and Madrid is further south in Europe, we can conclude that
      Pyongyang is north of Madrid.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Casa de Segunda is in Madrid, and the Church of the
      Life-Giving Trinity is in Pyongyang (which is north of Madrid), it follows that
      the Church of the Life-Giving Trinity is also geographically north of Casa de
      Segunda.

      geographical positions of both structures in Riga, Latvia.


      1. **Location of Riga Castle**: Riga Castle is situated on the banks of the
      Daugava River in the city of Riga. It is a prominent historical structure and
      serves as the official residence of the President of Latvia.


      2. **Location of the Palace of the National Military Circle**: The Palace of
      the National Military Circle is also located in Riga, near the city center.
      It is known for its role in military and cultural events.


      3. **Geographical Orientation**: To establish the relative positions, we can
      refer to maps or geographical knowledge. The Palace of the National Military
      Circle is located slightly to the southeast of Riga Castle.


      4. **Direction Analysis**: Since the Palace of the National Military Circle
      lies to the southeast of Riga Castle, this means that Riga Castle is not north
      of it.

      Parliament Building is located in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia,
      which is in the eastern part of Africa.


      3. **Geographical Orientation**: Since the Enguri Dam is in Georgia and the
      Ethiopian Parliament Building is in Ethiopia, we need to assess their geographical
      relationship. Georgia is situated north of Turkey and is part of the Caucasus
      region, while Ethiopia is located in East Africa, further south of Georgia.


      4. **Comparative Positioning**: When comparing the two locations, the Enguri
      Dam in Georgia is located significantly to the north of the Ethiopian Parliament
      Building in Addis Ababa.


      Based on this reasoning, the Enguri Dam is indeed located north of the Ethiopian
      Parliament Building.


      **Answer: YES**'

      the geographical locations of both places.


      1. **Locate Buckhorn Lake, Kentucky**: Buckhorn Lake is situated in the eastern
      part of Kentucky.


      2. **Locate Majestic Theatre, San Antonio**: The Majestic Theatre is in downtown
      San Antonio, Texas, which is located in the southern part of Texas.


      3. **Compare the latitudinal positions**: Kentucky is generally located to the
      north of Texas. Since San Antonio is in southern Texas and Buckhorn Lake is
      in Kentucky, Buckhorn Lake is likely positioned to the north of San Antonio.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Buckhorn Lake is in Kentucky (northern location) and
      Majestic Theatre is in San Antonio (southern location), Buckhorn Lake is indeed
      located north of the Majestic Theatre.

      1. **Identify the location of Matilda House**: Matilda House is a well-known
      landmark, but its exact geographical coordinates or position need to be confirmed.
      Typically, it is known to be in a particular area.


      2. **Identify the location of the Tomb of the King of Boni**: The Tomb of the
      King of Boni is located in a specific region, which is often associated with
      historical sites.


      3. **Compare their locations**: Once we have the coordinates or general locations
      of both structures, we can determine their relative positions. Specifically,
      we need to see if the Tomb of the King of Boni is situated to the north of Matilda
      House.


      4. **Final determination**: Based on the geographical information gathered,
      we can conclude whether the statement is true or false.


      Since I do not have specific data on the exact locations of Matilda House and
