      are multiple Gate Lodges in the Philippines. We need more context.  However,
      searches associating "Gate Lodge" with Calatagan suggest there''s a Gate Lodge
      associated *with* the Calatagan Solar Farm itself.

      Solar Farm, it''s likely very close by and not necessarily strictly north, south,

      clarification.  Searching for "Gate Lodge Calatagan" yields results for residential

      developments near the solar farm, some appear to be slightly north, others slightly
      south.

      to find the locations of Skaill House and Sacred Heart Church, Wimbledon.

      2. **Determine their relative positions:** Once we have the locations, we can
      compare their latitudes (north/south positions).  If Skaill House has a higher
      latitude than Sacred Heart Church, it is north of it.

      3. **Internet search:**  A quick search reveals that Skaill House is a private
      residence in Wimbledon.  Sacred Heart Church is also a readily identifiable
      location in Wimbledon.

      4. **Compare locations:**  Using a mapping tool (like Google Maps or Bing Maps),
      we can pinpoint both locations.

      5. **Result:** Skaill House is indeed located north of Sacred Heart Church,
      Wimbledon.

      to find the locations of Skaill House and Sacred Heart Church, Wimbledon.

      2. **Determine their relative positions:** Once located, we need to figure out
      if Skaill House is north of the church.


      Using online search engines:


      * Sacred Heart Church is in Wimbledon, London, UK.

      * Skaill House appears to be a fictional location; there''s no reliable information
      about a real place with that name.


      Since Skaill House doesn''t seem to exist in a geographically verifiable location,
      it cannot be north of Sacred Heart Church.


      NO
