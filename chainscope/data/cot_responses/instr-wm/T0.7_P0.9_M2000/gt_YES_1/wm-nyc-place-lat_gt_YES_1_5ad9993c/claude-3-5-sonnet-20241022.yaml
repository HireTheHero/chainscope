      1) First, I need to understand the general geography of NYC boroughs:

      - Queens is located east of Brooklyn

      - Both boroughs are on Long Island

      - In general, Queens locations tend to be further east but not necessarily further
      north than Brooklyn locations


      2) Let me locate these specific places:

      - Springfield Playground is in southeastern Queens

      - Riverdale Avenue Middle School is in eastern Brooklyn


      3) Looking at their relative positions:

      - Springfield Playground is in the Springfield Gardens neighborhood of Queens

      - This area is actually slightly SOUTH of where Riverdale Avenue Middle School
      is located in Brooklyn


      Therefore, NO - Springfield Playground is not located north of Riverdale Avenue
      Middle School.

      - STANTON STREET COURTS is just west of Attorney Street


      3. Since they''re both on Stanton Street, and HOPE GARDEN is east of STANTON

      - Stanton Street is between East Houston Street (which would be "Zero" Street)

      - This puts Stanton Street several blocks below East 8th Street

      - Harlem is in Upper Manhattan


      3. On Manhattan''s grid:

      - Harlem starts around 110th Street

      - East Village''s 7th Street is much further south


      4. Therefore, since Harlem (where the Boys Club is) is much further north than

      be north of the Boys Club.

      2. Looking at the addresses:

      - Both schools are actually at the exact same address

      - This means they are likely in the same building or school complex


      3. If they share the exact same address:

      - Neither school can be north or south of the other

      - They occupy the same geographical location


      Therefore: NO (PS 26 is not north of Madiba Prep since they are at the same

      2. Next, I need to find MADIBA PREP MIDDLE SCHOOL in Brooklyn

      - It is located at 1084 Lafayette Avenue, Brooklyn


      3. Both schools are on Lafayette Avenue, so I can directly compare their street
      numbers

      - PS 26 JESSE OWENS: 1014 Lafayette Avenue

      - MADIBA PREP: 1084 Lafayette Avenue

      - 1014 is a lower number than 1084


      4. On Lafayette Avenue in Brooklyn, street numbers increase as you go east

      - Therefore, PS 26 JESSE OWENS is west of MADIBA PREP


      5. Final step: Determine if west means north in this case

      - Lafayette Avenue runs roughly east-west in this area

      - Resurrection Church is located in Gerritsen Beach, Brooklyn

      - Coney Island Prep High School is located in Coney Island, Brooklyn


      2) Looking at the geography of Brooklyn:

      - Gerritsen Beach is located north of Coney Island

      - Resurrection Church is in Gerritsen Beach, therefore it is north of anything

      1) First, let''s establish the boroughs:

      - Two Bridges Senior Housing is in Manhattan

      - Holy Trinity Church is in Brooklyn


      2) Manhattan and Brooklyn''s general orientation:

      - Brooklyn is generally southeast of Manhattan

      - The dividing line between them is the East River


      3) Two Bridges is in the Lower East Side of Manhattan

      - This area is in the southern part of Manhattan

      - It''s close to the Manhattan Bridge and Brooklyn Bridge

      4. Therefore, any location in the Bronx would be north of Manhattanville, which

      3) Compare locations:

      - Without more specific address information for the pre-K center in the Bronx,

      their latitudes

      determination of which location is further north.


      NO - I cannot provide a definitive YES/NO answer without more specific location

      However, I should still provide a YES/NO as requested:


      NO
