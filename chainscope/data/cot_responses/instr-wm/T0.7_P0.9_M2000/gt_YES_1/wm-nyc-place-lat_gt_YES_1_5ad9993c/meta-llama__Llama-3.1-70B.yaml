      Bathhouse is located north of Ethical Culture Fieldston School in the Bronx,
      we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations or
      addresses of both Van Cortlandt Women''s Bathhouse and Ethical Culture Fieldston
      School in the Bronx, New York City.


      2. **Geographical Reference**: The Bronx is one of the five boroughs of New
      York City, and it is located in the northern part of the city. Understanding
      the geography of the Bronx, including its major streets, landmarks, and neighborhoods,
      is crucial.


      3. **Van Cortlandt Park and Fieldston**: Knowing that Van Cortlandt Park is
      a large park in the Bronx and Fieldston is a neighborhood in the Bronx provides
      a starting point. Fieldston is generally located in the northwestern part of
      the Bronx, near Riverdale and the Hudson River.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: If Van Cortlandt Women''s Bathhouse is located within
      Van Cortlandt Park, and considering that Van Cortlandt Park is in the northwestern
      part of the Bronx, we need to pinpoint its exact location relative to Fieldston.
      Given that Fieldston is in the northwestern part of the Bronx, any location
      significantly north of it would be closer to the northernmost tip of the borough.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Location**: Without the exact addresses but knowing
      the general areas, if Van Cortlandt Women''s Bathhouse is not in the immediate
      vicinity of Fieldston and is located more towards the northern parts of Van
      Cortlandt Park, it would be north of Ethical Culture Fieldston School.


      Given these steps and without exact coordinates but understanding the general
      layout of the Bronx, the question can be answered based on the relative positions
      of these locations within the borough.

      is located north of Belgium Consulate in Manhattan, we need to follow these
      steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the specific addresses
      or locations of both Italy Mission to UN and Belgium Consulate in Manhattan.


      2. **Geographic Reference**: Manhattan is one of the boroughs of New York City,
      and it''s generally known for its north-south orientation along the Hudson River.
      This means that locations in Manhattan can be compared in terms of their north-south
      positions.


      3. **Compare Addresses**: If we have the exact addresses or locations of both
      the Italy Mission to UN and the Belgium Consulate, we can compare their positions
      on a map or using online mapping tools.


      4. **Determine North/South Orientation**: In Manhattan, north is generally considered
      to be towards the northern tip of the island, while south is towards the southern
      tip. This means that if the Italy Mission to UN is located further north than
      the Belgium Consulate, it would be considered to be located north of the consulate.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Comparison**: If the Italy Mission to UN is located
      further north than the Belgium Consulate, the answer to the question would be
      YES. If it''s located further south or at a similar latitude, the answer would
      be NO.


      Given these steps and the general understanding of Manhattan''s geography, we
      can make a reasoned determination about the relative positions of these locations.

    7b75469d-b358-46c1-a59d-89600a557479: 'To determine if Central Park Cedar Hill
      is located north of Grace St Pauls Lutheran Church in Manhattan, we need to
      understand the locations of both places and compare their positions.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations or
      addresses of both Central Park Cedar Hill and Grace St Pauls Lutheran Church
      in Manhattan, New York City.


      2. **Geographical Reference**: Manhattan is one of the five boroughs of New
      York City, and it is located in the central part of the city. Understanding
      the geography of Manhattan, including its major streets, landmarks, and neighborhoods,
      is crucial.


      3. **Central Park and Grace St Pauls Lutheran Church**: Knowing that Central
      Park Cedar Hill is a specific location within Central Park and Grace St Pauls
      Lutheran Church is likely a church located somewhere in Manhattan provides a
      starting point.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: If Central Park Cedar Hill is located within Central
      Park, and considering that Central Park is a large park in the center of Manhattan,
      we need to pinpoint its exact location within the park. Central Park stretches
      from 59th Street to 110th Street, covering a significant portion of Manhattan''s
      north-south axis. Grace St Pauls Lutheran Church could be located anywhere in
      Manhattan, but its position relative to Central Park would determine whether
      it''s north or south of Cedar Hill.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Location**: Without the exact addresses but knowing
      the general areas, if Central Park Cedar Hill is located in the northern part
      of Central Park (above 90th Street, for example), it would likely be north of
      most locations in Manhattan, including Grace St Pauls Lutheran Church.


      Given these steps and without exact coordinates but understanding the general
      layout of Manhattan, the question can be answered based on the relative positions
      of these locations within the borough.

      \ Park Cedar Hill**: This is a specific area within Central Park, which covers\
      \ a vast area in Manhattan. Central Park itself is oriented in a north-south\
      \ direction, with the northern boundary at 110th Street and the southern boundary\
      \ at 59th Street.\n\n- **Grace St. Paul's Lutheran Church**: The church is located\
      \ on West 114th Street, which is north of the northern boundary of Central Park\
      \ (110th Street). Therefore, it is likely north of Central Park Cedar Hill.\n\
      \nWithout exact addresses or geographic coordinates, we cannot accurately determine\
      \ their relative positions. However, for the sake of providing a structured\
      \ response, let's assume we found the following (hypothetical) information:\n\

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations of
      Hope Garden and Stanton Street Courts in Manhattan, New York City.


      2. **Geographic Reference**: Manhattan is one of the five boroughs of New York
      City. Understanding the geography of Manhattan, including its neighborhoods,
      streets, and landmarks, is crucial.


      3. **Hope Garden**: Based on a search, Hope Garden appears to be a community
      garden located in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan. The East Village
      is in the eastern part of Manhattan, generally east of Broadway and south of
      14th Street.


      4. **Stanton Street Courts**: Stanton Street Courts is likely referring to a
      sports or recreational facility, possibly a basketball court or a park, located
      on Stanton Street in Manhattan. Stanton Street runs through multiple neighborhoods
      in Manhattan, including the Lower East Side, East Village, and Bowery.


      5. **Comparing Locations**: The East Village, where Hope Garden is located,
      is generally south of Stanton Street. This means that Hope Garden is likely
      south of Stanton Street Courts, which could be located anywhere along Stanton
      Street.


      6. **Conclusion Based on Location**: Given that Hope Garden is in the East Village
      and Stanton Street Courts could be anywhere along Stanton Street, it is unlikely
      that Hope Garden is north of Stanton Street Courts.


      Based on the general locations and understanding of Manhattan''s geography,
      the answer to the question is:


      NO'

      3. **Compare their positions**: Once we have their geographic positions, we
      can compare them to determine which one is located north of the other.


      Without knowing the exact addresses or locations of these places, I cannot provide
      a definitive answer. However, based on the general understanding of the Bronx''s
      geography, I can provide a possible answer:


      - **West Farms Library**: West Farms is a neighborhood in the Bronx. Libraries
      are often located in central or easily accessible areas within neighborhoods.
      Based on this, I''d estimate that West Farms Library is located in the central
      or western part of West Farms.

      - **Middletown Plaza Main Building**: Middletown is another neighborhood in
      the Bronx. Plazas are often located in commercial areas or near transportation
      hubs. Based on this, I''d estimate that Middletown Plaza Main Building is located
      in the central or eastern part of Middletown.


      Considering these estimates, I would say that West Farms Library is likely located
      north of Middletown Plaza Main Building in the Bronx. However, please note that
      this is based on general assumptions and without knowing the exact locations,
      there could be variations.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of COLONEL
      CHARLES YOUNG TRIANGLE and BRONX INTERNATIONAL ACADEMY in NYC.


      2. **COLONEL CHARLES YOUNG TRIANGLE Location**: This location is likely in Manhattan,
      given that it''s named after Colonel Charles Young, who was an influential figure
      in American history.


      3. **BRONX INTERNATIONAL ACADEMY Location**: This location is in the Bronx,
      as indicated by its name.


      4. **Consider Manhattan and Bronx Geography**: Manhattan is one of the five
      boroughs of NYC, located on an island, while the Bronx is another borough located
      north of Manhattan.


      5. **Determine North/South Orientation**: In NYC, north generally refers to
      moving up the island, while south refers to moving down the island. Given that
      the Bronx is north of Manhattan, it''s reasonable to assume that a location
      in the Bronx would be north of a location in Manhattan.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the general locations, COLONEL CHARLES YOUNG TRIANGLE
      (in Manhattan) is south of BRONX INTERNATIONAL ACADEMY (in the Bronx). Therefore,
      COLONEL CHARLES YOUNG TRIANGLE is not north of BRONX INTERNATIONAL ACADEMY.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations or
      addresses of both CHURCH OF THE COVENANT in Manhattan and USTA WEST GATE in
      Queens.


      2. **Geographical Reference**: Manhattan and Queens are two of the five boroughs
      of New York City. Manhattan is located south of Queens, and both boroughs have
      their distinct geographical features.


      3. **Church of the Covenant**: This church is likely located in Manhattan, given
      its name. Manhattan is a densely populated island with a grid-like street layout,
      and it''s important to know the specific address to pinpoint its exact location.


      4. **USTA West Gate**: USTA stands for United States Tennis Association, and
      the West Gate is likely a reference to an entrance or gate of a tennis facility.
      Queens is home to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, which hosts
      the US Open, located in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.


      5. **Comparing Locations**: If CHURCH OF THE COVENANT is in Manhattan and USTA
      WEST GATE is in Queens, we need to determine the relative positions of these
      locations. Manhattan is south of Queens, so any location in Manhattan would
      generally be south of locations in Queens.


      6. **Conclusion Based on Location**: Given the general positions of Manhattan
      and Queens and assuming the locations of CHURCH OF THE COVENANT and USTA WEST
      GATE are accurate, it''s unlikely that CHURCH OF THE COVENANT would be located
      north of USTA WEST GATE.


      Given these steps and without exact coordinates but understanding the general
      layout of Manhattan and Queens, the question can be answered based on the relative
      positions of these locations within their respective boroughs.

      is located in a northern neighborhood compared to the neighborhood where Trinity
      CME Methodist Church is located.

      1. **Identify the Locations**: We need to identify the locations of ORWELL HOUSE
      BUILDING and PS 9 SARAH ANDERSON in Manhattan.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Once we have the locations, we need to
      determine their geographic positions, specifically their north-south positions
      relative to each other.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Based on their geographic positions, we can compare
      whether ORWELL HOUSE BUILDING is located north of PS 9 SARAH ANDERSON.


      4. **Consider Manhattan''s Layout**: Manhattan is a long, narrow island with
      a generally north-south orientation. Locations on the southern part of Manhattan
      are generally considered "downtown," while those on the northern part are considered
      "uptown."


      5. **Assume Locations**: Without exact addresses, we can assume general locations
      based on the names. "Orwell House" might suggest a building or residence, and
      "PS 9 Sarah Anderson" indicates a school.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given that Manhattan is long and narrow with a north-south
      orientation, and without specific addresses, we can make a reasoned guess. If
      the Orwell House Building is in a location that is generally considered "uptown"
      (north) compared to PS 9 Sarah Anderson, which is likely located in a more central
      or southern part of Manhattan, then we can conclude that the Orwell House Building
      is located north of PS 9 Sarah Anderson.

      the typical layout of Manhattan, the answer to whether ORWELL HOUSE BUILDING
      is located north of PS 9 SARAH ANDERSON is:

      2. **Frick Collection**: The Frick Collection is a renowned art museum located
      on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. It is situated on East 70th Street between
      Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue.


      3. **Pier 96 Boathouse**: Pier 96 is a pier located on the Hudson River in Manhattan.
      It is situated in the Hell''s Kitchen neighborhood, which is in the western
      part of Manhattan.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Manhattan is a long and narrow island, and its geography
      is primarily oriented along an east-west axis. To determine whether one location
      is north or south of another, we need to consider their positions on this axis.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Location**: The Frick Collection is located on the
      Upper East Side, which is in the eastern part of Manhattan. Pier 96 Boathouse
      is located in Hell''s Kitchen, which is in the western part of Manhattan. Since
      the Frick Collection is on the eastern side of the island, it is not north of
      Pier 96 Boathouse, which is on the western side.

      layout of Manhattan, the question can be answered based on the relative positions
      of these locations within the borough.

      4 is located north of CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP 4 BUILDING 5 in the Bronx, we need

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations or
      addresses of both CLAREMONT REHABS GROUP 4 and CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP 4 BUILDING
      5 in the Bronx, New York City.


      2. **Geographical Reference**: The Bronx is one of the five boroughs of New
      York City, and it is located in the northern part of the city. Understanding
      the geography of the Bronx, including its major streets, landmarks, and neighborhoods,
      is crucial.


      3. **Claremont**: Knowing that Claremont is a neighborhood in the Bronx provides
      a starting point. The exact locations of the specific buildings (CLAREMONT REHABS
      GROUP 4 and CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP 4 BUILDING 5) within the neighborhood are
      essential for comparison.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: If both locations are in the same neighborhood (Claremont),
      we need to determine their relative positions within that neighborhood. Without
      exact addresses or coordinates, we can''t pinpoint their exact locations. However,
      we can consider the general layout of the neighborhood and the naming conventions
      of buildings.


      5. **Building Naming Conventions**: In many urban areas, buildings within the
      same complex or neighborhood are often numbered or labeled in a way that reflects
      their relative positions. For example, a higher number might indicate a location
      farther north or east.


      6. **Conclusion Based on Naming**: Given that both locations are in the same
      neighborhood (Claremont) and considering typical building naming conventions,
      if the numbering of the buildings suggests that one is located farther north
      or east compared to the other, it would be reasonable to assume that the building
      with the higher number is located north of the other.


      Given these steps and without exact coordinates but understanding the general
      layout of the neighborhood and typical building numbering conventions, the question
      can be answered based on the relative positions of these locations within the

      a Swedish diplomat who saved thousands of Hungarian Jews during World War II.
      It is located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, which is in the northern
      part of the borough.


      4. **First Union Baptist Church**: The First Union Baptist Church is a historic
      church located in the Morrisania neighborhood of the Bronx. Morrisania is in
      the central part of the Bronx, and it is generally located to the north of the

      2. **Coney Island Houses**: Coney Island Houses is a public housing complex
      located in Coney Island, Brooklyn. It is situated near the beach and amusement
      park area of Coney Island.


      3. **Coney Island Houses Building 3**: Since the question mentions Building
      3, we can assume that it is one of the buildings within the Coney Island Houses
      complex.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Since both locations are within the same complex,
      they are likely to be in close proximity to each other. Without more specific
      information about the layout of the complex, it is challenging to determine
      which one is exactly north of the other.


      5. **Geographic Considerations**: In general, Coney Island is located in the
      southern part of Brooklyn. If we assume that the Coney Island Houses complex
      is relatively compact, it''s unlikely that one building would be significantly
      north of another within the same complex.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the available information, it is challenging to
      determine if CONEY ISLAND HOUSES is located north of CONEY ISLAND HOUSES BUILDING
      3. However, given that they are both part of the same complex in Coney Island,
      which is in the southern part of Brooklyn, it is unlikely that one would be
      significantly north of the other.


      Given the constraints and aiming for a reasoned approach based on the available
      information:

      3. **St. Stephen Hungarian Church and Lenox Hill Hospital**: Knowing that St.
      Stephen Hungarian Church and Lenox Hill Hospital are both located in Manhattan
      provides a starting point. Lenox Hill Hospital is generally located in the Upper
      East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, while the specific location of St. Stephen
      Hungarian Church is not immediately clear.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Without exact addresses but knowing the general

      Manhattan. The Upper East Side is generally located in the northeastern part
      of Manhattan, and it''s known for its upscale residential and medical facilities.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Location**: Given the general understanding of Manhattan''s
      geography and the locations of these two places, if St. Stephen Hungarian Church
      is not in the immediate vicinity of the Upper East Side and is located more
      towards the central or southern parts of Manhattan, it would be south of Lenox
      Hill Hospital Percy & Harold Uris Pavilion.

      layout of Manhattan, the question can be answered based on the relative positions
      of these locations within the borough.

      neighborhoods. The geographic layout of Queens can vary significantly from north
      to south and east to west. Some neighborhoods are closer to the northern parts
      of Queens, while others are closer to the southern parts.


      5. **Comparing Locations**: To compare the locations of Lynne''s Riding School

    d33d5e88-2581-4597-b188-93ce2575be9e: 'To determine whether Karma Hookah Bar &
      Lounge in Manhattan is located north of Peter Chahales Park in Queens, we need
      to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Karma Hookah Bar & Lounge and Peter Chahales Park. Karma Hookah Bar & Lounge
      is in Manhattan, and Peter Chahales Park is in Queens.


      2. **Geographic Orientation**: In New York City, Manhattan is generally located
      to the west of Queens. If we draw a line from the center of Manhattan to the
      center of Queens, it would be roughly a west-to-east line.


      3. **Relative Positions**: To determine if one location is north of another,
      we need to consider their relative positions on this west-to-east line. If a
      location is north of the other, it would be farther along this line towards
      the north.


      4. **Karma Hookah Bar & Lounge**: Since Karma Hookah Bar & Lounge is in Manhattan,
      it''s generally located to the west of Queens. So, it''s unlikely to be north
      of Peter Chahales Park, which is in Queens.


      5. **Peter Chahales Park**: Peter Chahales Park is in Queens, which is generally
      to the east of Manhattan. Therefore, it''s more likely to be north of Karma
      Hookah Bar & Lounge.


      Given these steps and considering the typical geographic layout of Manhattan
      and Queens, the answer to whether Karma Hookah Bar & Lounge in Manhattan is
      located north of Peter Chahales Park in Queens is:


      NO'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of KARMA
      HOOKAH BAR & LOUNGE in Manhattan and PETER CHAHALES PARK in Queens.


      2. **KARMA HOOKAH BAR & LOUNGE Location**: KARMA HOOKAH BAR & LOUNGE is likely
      located in Manhattan, but without a specific address, we can''t pinpoint its
      exact location.


      3. **PETER CHAHALES PARK Location**: PETER CHAHALES PARK is located in Queens,
      but again, without a specific address, we can''t pinpoint its exact location.


      4. **Geographic Relationship**: Manhattan and Queens are two separate boroughs
      of New York City. Manhattan is located to the west of Queens, and Queens is
      located to the east of Manhattan.


      5. **North/South Orientation**: In New York City, the north-south orientation
      is generally determined by the direction of the Hudson River and the East River.
      The Hudson River flows south along the western side of Manhattan, and the East
      River flows south along the eastern side of Manhattan.


      6. **Manhattan and Queens**: Based on the general geographic relationship between
      Manhattan and Queens, if KARMA HOOKAH BAR & LOUNGE is located in Manhattan and
      PETER CHAHALES PARK is located in Queens, it''s highly likely that KARMA HOOKAH
      BAR & LOUNGE is located north of PETER CHAHALES PARK.

      Terminal is located north of the Church of the Epiphany on York Avenue, we need
      to establish the locations of both places and compare their positions. Here''s
      a step-by-step approach:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations or
      addresses of both the Manhattan Cruise Terminal and the Church of the Epiphany
      on York Avenue in Manhattan, New York City.


      2. **Manhattan Geography**: Manhattan is one of the five boroughs of New York
      City and is known for its grid-like street layout. Understanding the geography
      of Manhattan, including its major streets, landmarks, and neighborhoods, is
      crucial.


      3. **Cruise Terminal and York Avenue**: The Manhattan Cruise Terminal is located
      in the Hudson River Park, which runs along the western side of Manhattan. York
      Avenue is a street that runs north-south in the Upper East Side neighborhood
      of Manhattan.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: If the Manhattan Cruise Terminal is in Hudson River
      Park, it''s likely located in the lower part of Manhattan, closer to the southern
      tip. York Avenue, being in the Upper East Side, is located in the northern part
      of Manhattan.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Location**: Given the general layout of Manhattan,
      the Manhattan Cruise Terminal is likely located south of the Church of the Epiphany
      on York Avenue. Therefore, the Manhattan Cruise Terminal is not located north
      of the Church of the Epiphany on York Avenue.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Great
      Oaks Charter School in Manhattan and Juniper Valley Park Running Track in Queens.


      2. **Manhattan and Queens**: Manhattan and Queens are two separate boroughs
      of New York City. Manhattan is generally located south and west of Queens.


      3. **Great Oaks Charter School**: Based on the information, Great Oaks Charter
      School is located in Manhattan. However, without the specific address, we cannot
      pinpoint its exact location within Manhattan.


      4. **Juniper Valley Park Running Track**: Juniper Valley Park is located in
      Middle Village, Queens. The running track is likely within the park''s boundaries.


      5. **Comparing Locations**: To determine if Great Oaks Charter School is north
      of Juniper Valley Park Running Track, we need to consider the general layout
      of Manhattan and Queens.


      6. **Manhattan''s North-South Orientation**: Manhattan is a long, narrow island.
      Its north-south orientation is generally along the length of the island, with
      the northern tip being near Central Park and the southern tip near Battery Park.


      7. **Queens'' North-South Orientation**: Queens is a larger borough, and its
      north-south orientation can vary depending on the specific location. However,
      generally, the northern parts of Queens are closer to the Long Island Sound
      and the southern parts are closer to the Atlantic Ocean.


      8. **Conclusion Based on Boroughs**: Given that Manhattan is generally south
      and west of Queens, it''s unlikely that Great Oaks Charter School in Manhattan
      would be north of Juniper Valley Park Running Track in Queens. However, without
      specific addresses or a detailed map, it''s challenging to provide a definitive
      answer.

      located on Long Island. Knowing this, we can establish that Two Bridges Senior
      Housing is in Manhattan, while Holy Trinity Church of Ukrainiane is in Brooklyn.


      3. **North-South Orientation**: In New York City, north generally refers to

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of these
      two places. Two Bridges Senior Housing is located in the Two Bridges neighborhood
      in Manhattan, while Holy Trinity Church of Ukrainiane is located in Brooklyn.


      2. **Understand Geographic Relationship**: Manhattan and Brooklyn are two separate
      boroughs of New York City. Manhattan is generally located to the north of Brooklyn.


      3. **Consider the Specific Locations**: While Manhattan is north of Brooklyn
      in general, specific locations within each borough can vary significantly in
      their north-south positioning.


      4. **Research or Knowledge of NYC Geography**: Without exact addresses or detailed
      maps, it''s challenging to pinpoint the exact north-south relationship between
      these two locations. However, understanding the general geography of NYC can
      provide some insights.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Boroughs Alone**: Given that Two Bridges Senior Housing
      is in Manhattan and Holy Trinity Church of Ukrainiane is in Brooklyn, it''s
      likely that Two Bridges Senior Housing is located north of the church, considering
      the general north-south relationship between Manhattan and Brooklyn. However,
      without more specific details, it''s difficult to be absolutely certain.


      Given the information typically available and without specific addresses:

      - **Assumption for Answer**: Since we cannot precisely locate these without
      more specific details and considering the variability in geography within each
      borough, a definitive answer based on typical knowledge might lean towards using
      general geographic principles. However, this question requires precise geographic
      knowledge or a map to answer accurately.


      Given the constraints and aiming for a reasoned approach based on typical geographic
      knowledge of NYC boroughs and assuming an average understanding of their layout:


      The final answer is: $\boxed{YES}$

      City.


      2. **Geographical Reference**: Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs of New York

      a series of steps to determine if Parkside Preparatory Academy is located north
      of Explore Charter School in Brooklyn, New York City:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations of
      both Parkside Preparatory Academy and Explore Charter School in Brooklyn, NYC.
      This can be done by researching their addresses or using a map.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: After identifying the locations, we need
      to determine their geographic positions in terms of latitude or any other measure
      that can indicate which one is north of the other. Latitude is a measure of
      how far north or south a location is from the equator.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Once we have the geographic positions, we can compare
      them to determine which location is north. If Parkside Preparatory Academy has
      a higher latitude than Explore Charter School, it is located north.


      4. **Consider Proximity**: Since the question is about two locations in the
      same borough (Brooklyn), it''s also important to consider their proximity to
      each other. If they are very close, a small difference in latitude might not
      be significant.


      5. **Research or Knowledge of NYC Geography**: To answer the question accurately,
      we need to have knowledge of the geography of Brooklyn, including its neighborhoods
      and landmarks. This will help us understand the relative positions of the two
      schools.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the above steps, if Parkside Preparatory Academy
      has a higher latitude than Explore Charter School, and considering their proximity
      and the geography of Brooklyn, we can conclude that Parkside Preparatory Academy
      is located north of Explore Charter School.

      - **Assumption for Answer**: Since we cannot precisely locate these without
      more specific details and considering the variability in geography within each
      borough, a definitive answer based on typical knowledge might lean towards using
      general geographic principles. However, this question requires precise geographic
      knowledge or a map to answer accurately.

      Staten Island, New York.


      2. **Understand Geographic Relationship**: Since they are both in Raritan Bay,
      they are south of Staten Island. The question asks if one is north of the other,
      which would mean they are both south of Staten Island.


      3. **Consider the Specific Locations**: Without specific coordinates or maps,
      it''s challenging to determine the exact positions of these navigation markers.
      However, based on their names (RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42 and RARITAN BAY LIGHT 58),
      they likely follow a numbering system that indicates their relative positions.


      4. **Research or Knowledge of Raritan Bay Navigation**: Researching navigation
      markers in Raritan Bay could provide information about their positions. In many
      cases, navigation markers are arranged in a specific pattern, with higher numbers
      indicating a position farther along a waterway or channel.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Marker Numbers**: If the numbering system follows the
      typical pattern of higher numbers indicating a position farther along a waterway,
      then RARITAN BAY LIGHT 58 would be farther along the bay compared to RARITAN
      BAY LIGHT 42. This means that RARITAN BAY LIGHT 58 is likely north of RARITAN
      BAY LIGHT 42 within Raritan Bay.

      is located north of YESHIVA HECHAL MOSHE BETH JACOB, we need to establish the
      locations of both places and compare their positions.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations or
      addresses of both FDNY ACADEMY CON ED TRANSFORMER and YESHIVA HECHAL MOSHE BETH
      JACOB in Manhattan, New York City.


      2. **Geographical Reference**: Manhattan is one of the five boroughs of New
      York City and is known for its iconic landmarks and neighborhoods. Understanding
      the geography of Manhattan, including its major streets and areas, is crucial.


      3. **FDNY Academy**: The FDNY Academy is a training facility for the New York
      City Fire Department (FDNY). It''s likely located within the boundaries of Manhattan.


      4. **Yeshiva Hechal Moshe Beth Jacob**: Yeshiva Hechal Moshe Beth Jacob is likely
      a religious institution or school. It''s possible that it''s located in a neighborhood
      with a significant Jewish population, such as the Upper West Side or Upper East
      Side.


      5. **Comparing Locations**: If the FDNY Academy is located within Manhattan,
      and Yeshiva Hechal Moshe Beth Jacob is also in Manhattan, we need to pinpoint
      their exact locations relative to each other. Manhattan is a relatively compact
      borough, so any two locations within it are likely not too far apart.


      6. **Conclusion Based on Location**: Without the exact addresses but knowing
      the general areas, if the FDNY Academy is located in a central or northern part
      of Manhattan and Yeshiva Hechal Moshe Beth Jacob is in a southern part of Manhattan,
      it''s possible that the FDNY Academy is north of the yeshiva. However, this
      requires more specific information about their exact locations.

      layout of Manhattan, the question can be answered based on the relative positions
      of these locations within the borough.

      FDNY Academy Con Ed Transformer and Yeshiva Hechal Moshe Beth Jacob in Manhattan,
      New York City.


      2. **FDNY Academy Con Ed Transformer**: This location likely refers to the FDNY
      Fire Academy and Con Edison''s transformer facility, which are both located
      in Manhattan. The FDNY Fire Academy is typically situated in Randall''s Island,
      which is connected to Manhattan.


      3. **Yeshiva Hechal Moshe Beth Jacob**: This is likely a religious institution
      or school. Without a specific address, it''s challenging to pinpoint its exact
      location in Manhattan.


      4. **Geographic Relationship**: Manhattan is a long, narrow island in New York
      City. Generally, locations in Manhattan are oriented north to south, with the
      northern end of the island being closer to the Bronx and the southern end closer
      to Brooklyn.


      5. **Assumption Based on Limited Information**: Given that we don''t have the
      specific addresses, we can make an assumption based on the general geography
      of Manhattan. Randall''s Island, where the FDNY Academy is located, is in the
      northern part of Manhattan, while religious institutions like Yeshiva Hechal
      Moshe Beth Jacob can be found throughout the borough.


      6. **Conclusion**: Without exact addresses, it''s challenging to determine the
      precise north-south relationship between these two locations. However, considering
      the general geography of Manhattan and the likelihood that the FDNY Academy
      is in the northern part of the island, it''s possible that FDNY Academy Con
      Ed Transformer is located north of Yeshiva Hechal Moshe Beth Jacob.
