      - Queens is located on the eastern part of New York City

      - Brooklyn is located on the western part of Queens and south of Queens


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south relationship between these boroughs.

      - While Queens is generally northeast of Brooklyn, the specific locations within
      each borough matter for an accurate comparison.


      Step 3: More specifically, Springfield Playground is in Queens, likely in the
      Springfield Gardens neighborhood in southeastern Queens.


      Step 4: Riverdale Avenue Middle School would be in Brooklyn, likely near Riverdale
      Avenue, which is in eastern Brooklyn.


      Step 5: When comparing locations in southeastern Queens with eastern Brooklyn,
      the Queens location (Springfield Playground) would typically be north of the
      Brooklyn location (Riverdale Avenue Middle School).


      Based on this geographic analysis of NYC boroughs and the specific neighborhoods,
      I can conclude:

      located between East 112th Street and East 115th Street, east of Park Avenue.


      Step 2: Let me identify where EAST DRIVE OVER THE LOCH is located.

      East Drive is a road in Central Park. "The Loch" is a narrow stream in the northern
      part of Central Park. East Drive crosses over this stream in the northern section
      of the park, approximately around 103rd-105th Street.


      Step 3: Compare the north-south positions.

      Johnson Houses (around 112th-115th Streets) is located north of East Drive over
      the Loch (around 103rd-105th Streets).


      Based on this analysis, Johnson Houses Building 9 is located north of East Drive
      over the Loch in Manhattan.


      NO


      Wait, I made a mistake in my final answer. Since Johnson Houses (112th-115th
      Streets) is north of East Drive over the Loch (103rd-105th Streets), the correct
      answer is:


      YES'

      area of Brooklyn

      - August Martin High School is located in Jamaica, Queens, which is in the southeastern
      part of Queens


      Step 4: Analyzing the north-south relationship.

      - Jamaica, Queens (where August Martin High School is) is located in the southern
      portion of Queens

      - Prospect Lefferts Gardens/Crown Heights (where Stroud Playground is) is in
      the northern half of Brooklyn

      - Even though Brooklyn is generally south of Queens, the northern parts of Brooklyn
      can be at similar latitudes to the southern parts of Queens


      Step 5: Final determination.

      - Stroud Playground in northern Brooklyn is likely south of or approximately
      at the same latitude as August Martin High School in southern Queens, but not
      north of it

      41st Floor, New York, NY 10017.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Interestingly, both are located at the same address: 885 Second Avenue. However,
      since they''re in the same building, I need to consider their vertical positions.
      The Belgium Consulate is specifically on the 41st floor, while the Italy Mission
      doesn''t specify a floor in my information.


      Step 4: In a building, higher floors are considered "above" rather than "north
      of" lower floors. The question specifically asks about north/south geographic
      orientation, not vertical positioning within a building.


      Since both are at the same street address, neither is north or south of the
      other in terms of Manhattan''s geography.

      Step 1: Identify the general locations of Staten Island and Brooklyn within
      NYC.

      Staten Island is the southwesternmost borough of NYC.

      Brooklyn is located east of Staten Island, across the New York Harbor.


      Step 2: Consider the north-south relationship between these boroughs.

      Staten Island is generally south and west of Brooklyn. While there is some overlap
      in the north-south axis, most of Staten Island is south of most of Brooklyn.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their boroughs.

      Terrace Playground is in Staten Island, so it''s likely in the southwestern
      part of NYC.

      PS 207 Elizabeth G. Leary is in Brooklyn, which is generally northeast of Staten
      Island.


      Step 4: Make a determination based on the general geography.

      Given that Staten Island is predominantly south of Brooklyn, a location in Staten
      Island (Terrace Playground) would most likely be south of a location in Brooklyn

      if Church of the Covenant in Manhattan is located north of USTA West Gate in
      Queens.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Church of the Covenant in Manhattan.

      The Church of the Covenant is located in Midtown Manhattan, specifically at
      310 East 42nd Street near the United Nations.


      Step 2: Identify the location of USTA West Gate in Queens.

      The USTA West Gate refers to an entrance to the USTA Billie Jean King National
      Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, which hosts the US Open
      tennis tournament. This is located around the area of Flushing, Queens.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      In New York City geography:

      - Manhattan''s 42nd Street (where Church of the Covenant is) is significantly
      south of Flushing, Queens (where the USTA facility is)

      - Flushing Meadows is approximately at the level of the upper 70s to 90s streets
      if extended from Manhattan''s grid system


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since the Church of the Covenant is at 42nd Street in Manhattan, and the USTA
      facility in Flushing is much further north (equivalent to upper 70s-90s in Manhattan''s
      grid), the Church is south of the USTA West Gate.


      NO, the Church of the Covenant in Manhattan is not located north of USTA West
      Gate in Queens.'

      - PATRICK JEROME GLEASON SQUARE is located in Long Island City, Queens.

      - BATTALION 53 ENGINE 326 LADDER 160 (FDNY firehouse) is located in South Queens,
      specifically in the Rockaway area.


      Step 2: Consider the geography of Queens.

      - Long Island City is in the northwestern part of Queens, near the East River.

      - The Rockaway area is in the southernmost part of Queens, on the Rockaway Peninsula.


      Step 3: Determine the north-south relationship.

      - In NYC geography, "north" generally means closer to the Bronx/upper Manhattan,
      while "south" means closer to Brooklyn and the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Long Island City is definitely north of the Rockaway area.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since PATRICK JEROME GLEASON SQUARE is in Long Island City (northern Queens)
      and BATTALION 53 ENGINE 326 LADDER 160 is in the Rockaway area (southern Queens),
      the square is located north of the firehouse.

      Step 2: Determine their relative positions within Queens.

      - Long Island City is in the northwestern part of Queens, near the East River
      and Manhattan.

      - Queens Village is in the eastern part of Queens, much further east and slightly
      south compared to Long Island City.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positioning.

      - Long Island City is generally considered to be in northern Queens.

      - Queens Village is in east-central Queens, which is south of Long Island City''s
      position.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Long Island City (where PATRICK JEROME GLEASON SQUARE is located) is in
      the northern part of Queens, and Queens Village (where BATTALION 53 ENGINE 326
      LADDER 160 is located) is further south, PATRICK JEROME GLEASON SQUARE is north

      NO


      Wait, I need to double-check this. After reviewing the geography of Queens again:

      - Long Island City is definitely in northwestern Queens

      - Queens Village is in eastern Queens


      When comparing their latitudes, Long Island City is indeed further north than
      Queens Village.

      - NEW YORK UNIVERSITY 7 ST RESIDENCE HALL would be an NYU residence hall on
      7th Street in Manhattan.

      - ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER BOYS CLUB is an educational facility in Manhattan.


      Step 2: Determine their approximate locations.

      - NYU''s 7th Street Residence Hall would be in the East Village area, as NYU

      Step 1: Identify the location of NEW YORK UNIVERSITY 7 ST RESIDENCE HALL.

      NYU''s 7th Street Residence Hall would be located on 7th Street in Manhattan,
      which is in the East Village area of Lower Manhattan.


      Step 2: Identify the location of ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER BOYS CLUB.

      The Boys Club typically refers to the Boys Club of New York, which has locations
      in different parts of the city. Without specific address information, I need
      to make a reasonable inference. Alternative Learning Centers in NYC are typically
      spread throughout the boroughs, but based on context, this appears to be referring
      to a facility in Manhattan.


      Step 3: Compare the locations based on Manhattan''s grid system.

      In Manhattan, streets run east-west and are numbered sequentially from south
      to north. 7th Street is quite far downtown in the East Village area.


      Alternative Learning Centers are often located in various neighborhoods throughout
      Manhattan, including areas both downtown and uptown. Without a specific street
      address for the Boys Club location, I need to consider what''s most likely.


      Step 4: Make a determination based on available information.

      Given that 7th Street is very far downtown in Manhattan (in the single digits

      north of it. The vast majority of Manhattan extends north of 7th Street.


      Without specific address information for the Alternate Learning Center Boys
      Club, and considering that most of Manhattan lies north of 7th Street, the probability
      strongly suggests that the Boys Club would be located north of the NYU residence

      - ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER BOYS CLUB would need to be located somewhere in

      Step 2: Determine their relative north-south positions.

      - In Manhattan''s grid system, streets run east-west and are numbered from south

      - 7th Street is in lower Manhattan, relatively far south in the Manhattan grid.

      - Without specific information about the ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER BOYS CLUB''s

      - Most Boys Club facilities and alternative learning centers in Manhattan would

      Washington Heights, or other uptown locations which would be north of 7th Street.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Since 7th Street is quite far south in Manhattan''s numbered street system,

      it''s highly likely that the ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER BOYS CLUB is north of
      the NYU residence hall.

      - Without specific information about the ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER BOYS CLUB
      location, I need to make an educated determination.


      Step 3: Alternate Learning Centers in NYC are typically located throughout the
      city, but based on the name "Boys Club," this may refer to a facility associated
      with the Boys Club of New York, which has locations in Harlem and other areas
      that would be north of 7th Street.


      Step 4: In Manhattan''s geography, street numbers increase as you go north.
      Since NYU''s residence hall is on 7th Street, any location with a higher street
      number would be north of it, and most alternative learning centers would be
      distributed throughout the city.

      the likely location of the Boys Club being in Harlem or another area above 7th

      - However, if the Boys Club is in Harlem, Upper Manhattan, or even Midtown,
      it would be north of 7th Street.


      Since I don''t have the exact address of the ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER BOYS
      CLUB, I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer. I would need more specific
      location information about the Boys Club to make this determination accurately.'

      the relative positions of these two locations in Manhattan.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - NEW YORK UNIVERSITY 7 ST RESIDENCE HALL would be located on 7th Street in
      Manhattan, which would be in the East Village area of Lower Manhattan.

      - ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER BOYS CLUB - I need to determine where this is located
      in Manhattan.


      Step 2: Consider Manhattan''s grid system.

      - Manhattan streets are numbered from south to north (1st Street is further
      south than 14th Street, etc.)

      - The Boys Club/Alternate Learning Centers in Manhattan are typically located
      in various neighborhoods, but I need to find the specific location.


      Step 3: Based on available information about typical locations:

      - NYU''s 7th Street Residence Hall would be around East 7th Street in the East
      Village

      - Alternate Learning Centers are often in Upper Manhattan neighborhoods like
      Harlem or Washington Heights, though without specific address information, I
      can''t be certain.


      Step 4: Making a determination based on typical locations:

      If the Alternate Learning Center Boys Club is located above 7th Street (which
      is very likely if it''s in neighborhoods like Harlem), then NYU''s 7th Street
      Residence Hall would be south of it.


      Since I don''t have the exact address of the Alternate Learning Center Boys
      Club, but based on the typical distribution of these facilities in Manhattan
      which are often in uptown areas, and NYU''s residence hall being on 7th Street
      in Lower Manhattan:


      NO


      (Note: If you have specific address information for the Alternate Learning Center
      Boys Club that would place it south of 7th Street, the answer would change accordingly.)'

      Step 1: Identify the location of NEW YORK UNIVERSITY 7 ST RESIDENCE HALL.

      NYU''s 7th Street Residence Hall would be located on 7th Street in the East
      Village area of Manhattan, which is in lower Manhattan.


      Step 2: Identify the location of ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER BOYS CLUB.

      The Boys Club Alternate Learning Centers in Manhattan are typically located
      in Harlem or other uptown areas of Manhattan.


      Step 3: Compare the north-south positions.

      In Manhattan, street numbers increase as you go north. The East Village (where
      7th Street is located) is in downtown/lower Manhattan, while Harlem and similar
      areas where Boys Clubs are typically located are in uptown/upper Manhattan.


      Step 4: Make a determination based on Manhattan''s geography.

      Since 7th Street is in lower Manhattan and Boys Club facilities are typically
      in upper Manhattan, the NYU residence would be south of the Boys Club location.


      NO, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY 7 ST RESIDENCE HALL is not located north of ALTERNATE
      LEARNING CENTER BOYS CLUB. It would be located south of it.'

      the relative positions of these two locations in Manhattan.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both places.

      - NEW YORK UNIVERSITY 7 ST RESIDENCE HALL would be on 7th Street in Manhattan,
      likely in the East Village area where NYU has several buildings.

      - ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER BOYS CLUB location needs to be determined.


      Step 2: Manhattan''s street grid generally runs with numbered streets going
      east-west, with street numbers increasing as you go north.

      - Lower street numbers are in downtown/southern Manhattan

      - Higher street numbers are in uptown/northern Manhattan


      Step 3: Based on the name, NYU''s 7 ST RESIDENCE HALL would be located on 7th
      Street, which is in the lower part of Manhattan.


      Step 4: Without specific information about the ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER BOYS
      CLUB''s address, I need to make a reasonable inference based on where such facilities
      typically exist in Manhattan. Boys Clubs and alternative learning centers can
      be found throughout Manhattan, including areas both north and south of 7th Street.


      Step 5: However, since 7th Street is quite far downtown (in the East Village
      area), most of Manhattan lies north of it. The majority of Manhattan''s neighborhoods
      would be north of 7th Street.


      Given that 7th Street is quite far downtown in Manhattan, and without specific
      location information for the ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER BOYS CLUB, the most likely
      answer is:


      NO


      NYU''s 7 ST RESIDENCE HALL is likely not north of the ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER
      BOYS CLUB, as the residence hall is in a southern part of Manhattan, meaning
      the Boys Club is more likely to be north of it.'

      two places in Manhattan and compare them to see which one is further north.


      Step 1: Let me identify the location of NEW YORK UNIVERSITY 7 ST RESIDENCE HALL.

      - This appears to be an NYU residence hall on 7th Street in Manhattan.

      - NYU''s main campus is in Greenwich Village in lower Manhattan.

      - A residence hall on 7th Street would be in the East Village area.


      Step 2: Let me identify the location of ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER BOYS CLUB.

      - The Boys Club typically refers to the Boys Club of New York.

      - They have locations in different parts of Manhattan.

      - Without specific address information, I need to make a reasonable inference
      based on "Alternate Learning Center" which suggests it might be in Harlem or
      another area where such centers are common.


      Step 3: Compare the north-south positions.

      - East Village (where NYU''s 7th Street residence would be) is in lower Manhattan,
      roughly between 14th Street and Houston Street.

      - Most Boys Club locations and alternative learning centers in Manhattan are
      in midtown or uptown areas, which would be north of the East Village.


      Based on the typical locations of these types of facilities in Manhattan, the
      NYU residence on 7th Street would likely be south of an Alternate Learning Center

      Step 1: Let me identify the location of Mullaly Park Soccer Field 1.

      - Mullaly Park is located in the South Bronx, near Yankee Stadium.

      - The soccer fields in Mullaly Park are situated along Jerome Avenue and the
      Cross Bronx Expressway.


      Step 2: Let me identify the location of Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics.

      - This is a high school located at 1363 Fulton Avenue in the Bronx.

      - It''s in the Morrisania section of the South Bronx.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Mullaly Park is in the western part of the South Bronx, near Yankee Stadium
      and the Grand Concourse.

      - Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics is further east in the Morrisania
      neighborhood.

      - In terms of north-south positioning, Mullaly Park is slightly north of the

      Looking at these names carefully:

      - "CLAREMONT REHABS GROUP 4" appears to be a general designation for a housing

      - "CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP 4 BUILDING 5" seems to be a specific building (Building

      refer to the entire development, while "CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP 4 BUILDING 5"
      is a specific building within that development.


      Without specific geographic coordinates, I cannot determine the exact north-south
      positioning of these locations. The general designation of a group doesn''t
      have a single geographic point that could be considered north or south of a
      specific building within that group.


      Since "CLAREMONT REHABS GROUP 4" likely encompasses the area containing "BUILDING
      5," it wouldn''t be accurate to say one is north of the other - the first location

      - THE NEW SCHOOL FOR LEADERSHIP AND JOURNALISM is also in the Bronx


      Step 2: To determine if one is north of the other, I need to know their specific
      locations within the Bronx.


      The Harry H. Gordon School Annex (P721X) is part of District 75 and is located
      in the Co-op City area of the northeast Bronx.


      The New School for Leadership and Journalism (MS/PS 244) is located in the Kingsbridge
      area of the western Bronx.


      Step 3: Compare the north-south positioning of these locations.

      Co-op City is in the northeast section of the Bronx, while Kingsbridge is in
      the western part of the Bronx. On a map of the Bronx, Co-op City is positioned
      further north than Kingsbridge.


      Therefore, HARRY H GORDON SCHOOL ANNEX is located north of THE NEW SCHOOL FOR
      LEADERSHIP AND JOURNALISM.

      Ella Baker School is on East 67th Street. Since Manhattan''s street grid runs
      with higher numbers going north, and 67th Street is north of 59th Street, Ella
      Baker School is indeed north of The Pond.

      the relative locations.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both places.

      - ELLA BAKER SCHOOL is located at 317 East 67th Street in Manhattan (Upper East
      Side).

      - CENTRAL PARK THE POND is located at the southeast corner of Central Park,
      near 59th Street and 5th Avenue.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on Manhattan''s grid system.

      - Manhattan streets run east-west and are numbered from south to north (higher
      numbers = further north).

      - Ella Baker School is on 67th Street.

      - The Pond in Central Park is around 59th Street.


      Step 3: Make the north-south comparison.

      - Since 67th Street is a higher number than 59th Street, it is located further
      north.

      - Therefore, Ella Baker School (67th St) is north of The Pond in Central Park
      (59th St).


      NO


      Wait, I need to double-check my reasoning. The question asks if Ella Baker School
      is north of The Pond, and my analysis shows that it is indeed north (67th St
      is north of 59th St). So the correct answer is:

      - Central Park''s Pond (often called "The Pond") is located at the southeast

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Cambridge Hotel is in Manhattan

      - RFK Bridge Pedestrian and Bike Path is in the Bronx


      Step 2: Understand the geography of NYC boroughs.

      - The Bronx is the northernmost borough of NYC

      - Manhattan is directly south of the Bronx


      Step 3: Locate the RFK Bridge.

      - The RFK Bridge (formerly Triborough Bridge) connects Manhattan, Queens, and
      the Bronx

      - The Bronx section of the RFK Bridge is at the southern edge of the Bronx


      Step 4: Consider the Cambridge Hotel''s location in Manhattan.

      - Since it''s in Manhattan, it must be south of the Bronx portion of the RFK
      Bridge

      - Even if the hotel is in northern Manhattan, it would still be south of any
      point in the Bronx


      Therefore, Cambridge Hotel in Manhattan cannot be north of the RFK Bridge pedestrian
      and bike path in the Bronx.

      Side of Manhattan at 210 East 77th Street.


      Step 2: Compare the street numbers.

      - St. Stephen Hungarian Church is on East 82nd Street

      - Lenox Hill Hospital Percy & Harold Uris Pavilion is on East 77th Street

      Step 1: Let me think about what I know about the Bronx''s geography. The Bronx
      is the northernmost borough of NYC, and within the Bronx, locations can be relatively
      north or south of each other.


      Step 2: Based on the name "SOUTH BRONX COMMUNITY CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL," this
      school is likely located in the South Bronx area, which is the southern portion
      of the borough.


      Step 3: The name "J K EARLY EDUCATIONAL CENTER" doesn''t indicate a specific
      geographic area within the Bronx.


      Step 4: Without specific address information for both locations, I need to rely
      on the naming convention. Schools with "South Bronx" in their name are typically
      located in the southern part of the Bronx.


      Step 5: Any location in the Bronx that is not specifically in the South Bronx
      would likely be north of a location that is explicitly in the South Bronx.

      - SOUTH BRONX COMMUNITY CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL is also in the Bronx

      The Bronx is one of NYC''s five boroughs, and locations within it can be described
      as more northern or southern relative to each other.


      Step 3: Analyze the name of the second institution.

      The "SOUTH BRONX" in the charter school''s name indicates it''s located in the

      Step 4: Make a reasonable inference.

      Since the charter school specifically has "SOUTH BRONX" in its name, it''s very
      likely located in the southern portion of the Bronx. The J K EARLY EDUCATIONAL
      CENTER doesn''t have a directional indicator in its name, so it could be anywhere
      in the Bronx, but is more likely to be in a more central or northern area than

      Brooklyn, while the eastern neighborhoods like East New York are generally to
      the northeast of Red Hook. Since Jerome Gardens is in eastern Brooklyn, it would
      be positioned northeast of Red Hook Park Baseball Fields.


      YES'
    ffc15767-512f-4452-ab86-018449aa9957: 'I need to determine the relative positions
      of Jerome Gardens and Red Hook Park Baseball Fields, both in Brooklyn, NYC.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Jerome Gardens is located in Brooklyn.

      Jerome Gardens appears to be in East New York or Brownsville area of Brooklyn,
      which is in the eastern part of Brooklyn.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Red Hook Park Baseball Fields is located.

      Red Hook Park Baseball Fields is in the Red Hook neighborhood, which is in the
      western part of Brooklyn along the waterfront.


      Step 3: Determine the north-south relationship between these locations.

      In NYC geography, Brooklyn generally extends east-west, with northern Brooklyn
      being closer to Queens and Manhattan, while southern Brooklyn faces the Atlantic
      Ocean.


      Red Hook is in the northwestern part of Brooklyn, while East New York/Brownsville
      areas are in the central-eastern part of Brooklyn.


      On a map of Brooklyn, East New York and Brownsville are positioned more to the
      east and slightly south of Red Hook. Red Hook is further north in Brooklyn''s
      geography.


      Therefore, Jerome Gardens is NOT north of Red Hook Park Baseball Fields. Jerome
      Gardens would be east and slightly south of Red Hook.


      NO'

      Step 1: Identify the first location. "BELT SHORE PKW BR OV OCEAN PKWY" appears
      to refer to the Belt Parkway bridge over Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn. The Belt
      Parkway runs along the southern shore of Brooklyn.


      Step 2: Identify the second location. "BAY FAMILY CENTER" is likely a community
      center in Brooklyn. Based on the name, it might be located in an area like Bay
      Ridge, Sheepshead Bay, or another bay-adjacent neighborhood in Brooklyn.


      Step 3: Consider the geography of Brooklyn. The Belt Parkway runs along the
      southern edge of Brooklyn, and the Ocean Parkway intersection with the Belt
      Parkway is in the southern part of Brooklyn, near Coney Island.


      Step 4: Make a determination based on the Belt Parkway''s location. Since the
      Belt Parkway (especially where it crosses Ocean Parkway) is in the very southern
      part of Brooklyn, most locations in Brooklyn would be north of it.


      However, without specific information about the exact location of the BAY FAMILY
      CENTER, I cannot make a definitive determination. If the BAY FAMILY CENTER is
      in southern Brooklyn near the shore (like in Sheepshead Bay or Coney Island),
      it could potentially be south of or at a similar latitude to the Belt Parkway
      bridge.

      This appears to be the Belt Parkway (Shore Parkway) bridge over Ocean Parkway
      in Brooklyn.

      The Belt Parkway (also called Shore Parkway in some sections) runs along the
      southern shore of Brooklyn. The point where it crosses over Ocean Parkway is
      in southern Brooklyn, near Coney Island.


      Step 3: Identify what "BAY FAMILY CENTER" refers to.

      This appears to be a community or family center in Brooklyn.


      Step 4: Without specific information about the BAY FAMILY CENTER''s exact location,
      I need to make an educated assessment based on naming conventions.

      Places with "Bay" in their name in Brooklyn are typically located in areas like
      Sheepshead Bay, Gravesend Bay, or Jamaica Bay - all in southern Brooklyn.


      Step 5: Compare the locations.

      The Belt Parkway bridge over Ocean Parkway is in southern Brooklyn. If the BAY
      FAMILY CENTER is indeed in one of the southern Brooklyn bay areas, they would
      be roughly in the same general area of Brooklyn.


      However, without the exact address of BAY FAMILY CENTER, I cannot definitively
      determine if the bridge is north of it.

      - Queens is generally to the east of Manhattan, not directly north.

      - Alley Pond Park is located in eastern Queens, near the Nassau County border.

      - This puts it in the northeast section of NYC relative to Manhattan.

      - The Stein Senior Center is in Manhattan, which is entirely west of Queens.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on absolute geography.

      - While Queens has portions that are north of parts of Manhattan, Alley Pond
      Park specifically is in eastern Queens and is more accurately described as northeast
      of Manhattan rather than directly north.

      - The Motor Parkway pedestrian bridge over Alley Pond Park would therefore be
      northeast of any location in Manhattan, including the Stein Senior Center.


      YES, the MOTOR PKWY PED BR OVR ALLEY PRK in Queens is located north of STEIN
      SENIOR CENTER in Manhattan. While it''s also east, from a north-south perspective,
      Queens'' Alley Pond Park area is indeed north of Manhattan locations.'

      bridge over Alley Pond Park along the Motor Parkway.

      - STEIN SENIOR CENTER is in Manhattan.


      Step 2: Determine their general positions in NYC.

      - Queens is located to the east of Manhattan on Long Island.

      - In NYC''s geography, Queens is generally to the east and slightly north of
      Manhattan.


      Step 3: Consider the north-south relationship.

      - Manhattan extends roughly from south to north (from the Battery to Inwood).

      - Queens is positioned to the east of Manhattan, but their north-south relationship
      depends on the specific locations within each borough.

      - Alley Pond Park is in northeastern Queens, which is indeed north of most of
      Manhattan.

      - The Motor Parkway pedestrian bridge would be in this northeastern section
      of Queens.

      - The Stein Senior Center is likely in a more central or southern part of Manhattan.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on NYC geography.

      - Given that Alley Pond Park is in the northern part of Queens, and Queens extends
      further north than much of Manhattan, the pedestrian bridge is very likely north
      of the Stein Senior Center.


      NO


      Wait, I need to reconsider. Let me verify more carefully:


      - Alley Pond Park is indeed in the northeastern part of Queens.

      - The Motor Parkway pedestrian bridge over Alley Pond Park would be in this
      area.

      - This northeastern part of Queens is definitely north of most of Manhattan.

      - Without knowing the exact location of Stein Senior Center in Manhattan, I
      can still conclude that the pedestrian bridge in northeastern Queens is almost
      certainly north of any location in Manhattan.

      of NYC.

      - STEIN SENIOR CENTER is in Manhattan, another borough of NYC.


      Step 2: Determine the general geographic relationship between Queens and Manhattan.

      - Manhattan is west of Queens.

      - In terms of north-south positioning, Queens extends both north and south of
      Manhattan, with parts of Queens being north of upper Manhattan.


      Step 3: Try to pinpoint more specific locations.

      - MOTOR PKWY PED BR (Pedestrian Bridge) OVR ALLEY PRK likely refers to a pedestrian
      bridge over Alley Pond Park, which is located in eastern Queens, in the northeastern
      part of the borough.

      - STEIN SENIOR CENTER is in Manhattan, but without knowing its specific location
      in Manhattan, I need to consider Manhattan''s overall position.


      Step 4: Compare the north-south positions.

      - Alley Pond Park is in the northeastern section of Queens, which would place
      it north of most of Manhattan.

      - Even the northernmost parts of Manhattan (like Inwood) would generally be
      south of Alley Pond Park area.

      Step 4: Consider the north-south relationship of the boroughs.

      - Queens is generally positioned to the east and somewhat northeast of Manhattan

      - However, parts of Queens are directly east or even southeast of parts of Manhattan

      Bartlett Playground is located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, near Bartlett Street
      and Harrison Avenue.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Yeshiva Beth Hillel of Williamsburg is located.

      Yeshiva Beth Hillel of Williamsburg is located in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn,
      around Marcy Avenue and Division Avenue.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      In Brooklyn, Williamsburg''s streets generally follow a pattern where locations
      further north have higher street numbers or are closer to the Williamsburg Bridge,
      while South Williamsburg is, as the name suggests, south of the main Williamsburg
      area.


      Bartlett Playground is in the main Williamsburg area, while Yeshiva Beth Hillel
      is in South Williamsburg. This means Bartlett Playground would be north of Yeshiva
      Beth Hillel of Williamsburg.


      NO


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me correct this:


      Bartlett Playground is located in the main Williamsburg area, which is north
      of South Williamsburg where Yeshiva Beth Hillel is located.

      Step 1: Let me identify the location of Bartlett Playground in Brooklyn.

      Bartlett Playground is located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, near Bartlett Street.


      Step 2: Let me identify the location of Yeshiva Beth Hillel of Williamsburg.

      Yeshiva Beth Hillel of Williamsburg is an educational institution also located
      in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      Bartlett Playground is located around Bartlett Street between Throop Avenue
      and Harrison Avenue in Williamsburg.

      Yeshiva Beth Hillel of Williamsburg is located in South Williamsburg, in the
      area south of Broadway.


      Step 4: Compare north-south positioning.

      Williamsburg''s streets are generally oriented with lower numbers to the north
      and higher numbers to the south. Broadway serves as a significant dividing line
      in Williamsburg. Since Bartlett Playground is in the northern part of Williamsburg,
      and Yeshiva Beth Hillel is in South Williamsburg (south of Broadway), Bartlett
      Playground would be north of the Yeshiva.


      NO


      Wait, I need to verify this conclusion. Let me reconsider:


      Bartlett Playground is indeed in the northern part of Williamsburg, while Yeshiva
      Beth Hillel is in South Williamsburg. This means Bartlett Playground is located
      north of Yeshiva Beth Hillel of Williamsburg.


      YES'

      Bartlett Playground is located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, near Bartlett Street
      and Harrison Avenue.


      Step 2: Let me identify the location of Yeshiva Beth Hillel of Williamsburg.

      Yeshiva Beth Hillel of Williamsburg is located in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn,
      on Bartlett Street.


      Step 3: Compare the relative north-south positions.

      In New York City geography, Williamsburg is generally north of South Williamsburg.
      Since Bartlett Playground is in Williamsburg proper, and Yeshiva Beth Hillel
      is specifically in South Williamsburg, the playground would be north of the
      yeshiva.


      NO


      Wait, I need to be more careful. Let me verify the exact locations rather than
      rely on neighborhood names alone.


      Bartlett Playground is located at the intersection of Bartlett Street and Throop
      Avenue in Brooklyn.

      Yeshiva Beth Hillel of Williamsburg is located at 525 Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn.


      Looking at the map of Brooklyn, Bedford Avenue runs north-south and is west
      of Throop Avenue. The specific location of Yeshiva Beth Hillel on Bedford Avenue
      is actually north of where Bartlett Playground is situated.


      YES


      Actually, I need to be more precise. Without specific addresses and coordinates,
      I cannot definitively determine their north-south relationship. My previous
      reasoning contained assumptions that may not be accurate.


      NO


      The answer is NO. Bartlett Playground is not located north of Yeshiva Beth Hillel
      of Williamsburg. Based on their locations in Brooklyn, Yeshiva Beth Hillel is
      actually north of Bartlett Playground.'

      Yeshiva Beth Hillel is located on Harrison Avenue between Wallabout Street and
      Bartlett Street.


      Since Bartlett Street is north of Wallabout Street in this area of Brooklyn,

      Step 1: Let me think about what these designations likely refer to. Raritan
      Bay is located on the south shore of Staten Island, and these appear to be navigational
      lights along the bay, numbered 42 and 58.


      Step 2: In navigational systems, light markers or buoys are typically numbered
      in sequence along a waterway. Lower numbers generally indicate markers that
      come earlier in the sequence when entering from the sea.


      Step 3: Since Raritan Bay is on the south shore of Staten Island, and assuming
      standard navigational numbering, Light 42 would come before Light 58 when entering
      the bay from the ocean.


      Step 4: When entering Raritan Bay from the ocean (from the east), you would
      move westward and slightly northward into the bay. This means earlier numbered
      lights (like 42) would typically be more eastward (and possibly more southward)
      than higher numbered lights (like 58).


      Step 5: Based on standard navigational numbering systems, Light 42 would likely

      The numbers 42 and 58 likely refer to specific light markers or buoys.


      Step 2: In navigational systems, particularly in the United States, marker numbers

      1) Raritan Bay is located on the south shore of Staten Island, between Staten
      Island and New Jersey.


      2) In navigational systems, lights in waterways are typically numbered sequentially
      along a channel or waterway.


      3) Generally, lower numbers are assigned to navigational markers that are encountered
      first when entering a waterway from the sea.


      4) Since Raritan Bay opens to the Atlantic Ocean on the east, the numbering
      would likely increase as you move westward into the bay.


      5) Therefore, Light 42 would be encountered before Light 58 when entering Raritan
      Bay from the ocean.


      6) In Raritan Bay''s orientation, this would mean Light 42 is more eastward
      than Light 58.


      7) However, the question asks about north/south positioning, not east/west.


      8) The channel in Raritan Bay generally runs east-west, with some curves. Without
      a specific nautical chart, I cannot determine with certainty the exact north/south
      relationship between these two lights.


      9) That said, based on typical navigational numbering patterns, the lower-numbered
      Light 42 would likely be closer to the entrance of the bay (eastward) than Light
      58, but this doesn''t necessarily indicate its north/south position.

      - CIVIL COURT, Queens would be located in Queens County.

      - BUSHWICK HOUSES BLDG 8, Brooklyn would be located in Brooklyn (Kings County).


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of NYC boroughs.

      - Queens is generally to the east and northeast of Brooklyn.

      - The northern parts of Queens are indeed north of Brooklyn.


      Step 3: More specifically, Bushwick is a neighborhood in the northern part of
      Brooklyn, close to the Queens border.

      - Bushwick Houses is a public housing development in Bushwick.

      - The Civil Court of Queens is likely in Jamaica, Queens or Long Island City,
      Queens.


      Step 4: Determine relative positions.

      - Even though Bushwick is in northern Brooklyn, it is still south of most of
      Queens.

      - The Queens Civil Court, regardless of which Queens location, would be north
      of Bushwick Houses.


      NO


      Actually, let me reconsider. I need to be more precise about the exact locations.


      The Queens Civil Court is likely in Jamaica, Queens, which is in the central-eastern
      part of Queens. Bushwick Houses is in northern Brooklyn. When comparing these
      specific locations, the Queens Civil Court would indeed be northeast or east
      of Bushwick Houses, and therefore at least partially north.

      while Bushwick Houses is in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, which is
      in the northern part of Brooklyn near the Queens border.


      Step 4: Make a directional determination.

      Given that Queens is generally north/northeast of Brooklyn, and the Civil Court
      would be in a central area of Queens, while Bushwick (though in northern Brooklyn)
      is still south of the Queens border, the Queens Civil Court would be north of
      Bushwick Houses.

      The name indicates this location is in Queens, another borough of NYC.

      The HRA (Human Resources Administration) CRPU is likely located in a government
      administrative building in Manhattan.


      Step 2: Let me identify where QUEENS COLLEGE FRESE HALL is located.

      Queens College is located in the Flushing neighborhood of Queens. Frese Hall
      is on the Queens College campus.


      Step 3: Consider the geographic relationship between Manhattan and Queens.

      Manhattan is west of Queens. In terms of north-south positioning, Manhattan
      extends both north and south of parts of Queens, depending on the specific locations.


      Step 4: Compare the north-south positions.

      Queens College is located in the north-central part of Queens. This area is
      roughly aligned with the upper part of Manhattan (above midtown). Without the
      specific street address of the HRA office, I can''t pinpoint its exact north-south
      position in Manhattan, but most Manhattan administrative offices are in the
      southern or central parts of Manhattan, which would place them south of Queens
      College.


      Based on the typical locations of city administrative offices in Manhattan and
      the location of Queens College in northern Queens, the most likely answer is:


      NO

      - Manhattan is primarily west of Queens

      - Parts of Manhattan can be north of parts of Queens, but this depends on the

      Step 3: More specifically:

      - Manhattan''s northern sections (like Harlem, Washington Heights) extend further
      north than most of Queens

      - Queens College is located in Flushing, which is in north-central Queens

      - CRPU offices are typically administrative facilities, often located in central
      or downtown areas of Manhattan


      Step 4: Based on typical locations:

      - Queens College/Frese Hall is fairly far north in the Queens borough

      - Manhattan administrative offices are typically not in the northernmost parts

      Manhattan is west of Queens. When we talk about "north of" in NYC geography,

      Cafe Metro in Brooklyn, it would need to be compared to the court''s location.


      Step 3: Consider Brooklyn''s geography.

      In Brooklyn, "north" generally means closer to Manhattan/Downtown Brooklyn,
      while "south" refers to areas further from Manhattan (like Coney Island, Sheepshead
      Bay, etc.).


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since I don''t have confirmed information about a Cafe Metro location in Brooklyn,
      I cannot definitively determine its position relative to the Brooklyn Supreme
      Court Civil.


      However, since Brooklyn Supreme Court Civil is in downtown Brooklyn (which is
      the northernmost part of Brooklyn), it would be difficult for any Brooklyn location
      to be north of it unless it''s in the Greenpoint or Williamsburg neighborhoods.


      NO - Based on the typical location of Brooklyn Supreme Court Civil in downtown
      Brooklyn (one of the northernmost areas of Brooklyn), it is unlikely that a
      Cafe Metro in Brooklyn would be located north of it, though I cannot be completely
      certain without specific address information.'

      of Cafe Metro in Brooklyn and Brooklyn Supreme Court Civil to answer whether

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      - Brooklyn Supreme Court Civil is located in downtown Brooklyn at 360 Adams
      Street, Brooklyn.

      - There are multiple Cafe Metro locations in NYC, but I need to focus on any
      Brooklyn location.


      Step 2: Based on my knowledge, Cafe Metro is primarily a Manhattan-based chain
      of fast-casual restaurants. If there is a Brooklyn location, I would need its
      specific address to determine its position relative to the court.


      Step 3: Without having confirmed information about a Cafe Metro location in
      Brooklyn, I cannot make a definitive north/south comparison.


      Step 4: The Brooklyn Supreme Court Civil is in downtown Brooklyn, which is in
      the northwestern part of Brooklyn. Any location south or east of downtown Brooklyn
      would be south of the court.


      Since I don''t have confirmed information about a Cafe Metro location in Brooklyn

      - Brooklyn Supreme Court Civil is located at 360 Adams Street in Downtown Brooklyn.


      Step 2: Consider their positions.

      Downtown Brooklyn generally has the courts clustered in one area. The Brooklyn
      Supreme Court Civil is part of this court complex.


      Step 3: Based on my knowledge of Brooklyn geography:

      Cafe Metro locations are typically in business districts. If there is one in

      - East Harlem (where Washington Houses is located) is in the northeastern part

      - Amsterdam Avenue on the Upper West Side also extends through similar street

      Amsterdam Residence (or Amsterdam Houses) is a public housing development on
      the Upper West Side of Manhattan, located in the area of West 61st to West 64th

      East Harlem (where Washington Houses is located) is in the upper 90s to 100s
      streets, while Amsterdam Residence is in the low 60s streets.


      Step 4: Apply Manhattan geography.

      In Manhattan, street numbers increase as you go north. So the 90s-100s streets

      would place it somewhere in the west side of Manhattan, potentially in the 70s-90s
      street range.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      In Manhattan, street numbers increase as you go north. East Harlem (where Washington

      - Henry Street Settlement has a location on Montgomery Street in the Lower East
      Side of Manhattan, which is in the southern part of Manhattan.

      - Al Mamoor School is in Queens. Without the exact address, I need to consider
      Queens'' general position. Most of Queens is east and slightly north of lower
      Manhattan.


      Step 4: Compare north-south positions.

      The Lower East Side of Manhattan (where Montgomery Street is located) is in
      the southern portion of Manhattan. Queens generally extends further north than
      the Lower East Side.


      Based on this geographic analysis, Henry Street Settlement on Montgomery Street
      in Lower Manhattan is likely south of Al Mamoor School in Queens.

      the relative positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Let me identify the boroughs. HENRY STREET SETTLEMENT CCC MONTGOMERY
      ST is in Manhattan, while AL MAMOOR SCHOOL is in Queens.


      Step 2: In New York City geography, Manhattan is generally west of Queens, not
      north or south of it. The two boroughs are adjacent but arranged more in an
      east-west configuration.


      Step 3: To determine north/south positioning specifically, I need to consider
      where in Manhattan and Queens these locations are.

      - Henry Street Settlement locations are typically in the Lower East Side of
      Manhattan, which is in the southern part of Manhattan.

      - Montgomery Street in Manhattan is in the Lower East Side.

      - Al Mamoor School in Queens would likely be in one of the Queens neighborhoods.


      Step 4: In terms of north-south positioning, the Lower East Side of Manhattan
      (where Henry Street Settlement is) is generally south of most of Queens.


      Based on this geographical analysis, Henry Street Settlement CCC Montgomery
      St in Manhattan would not be north of Al Mamoor School in Queens. It would be
      south and west of it.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - HENRY STREET SETTLEMENT CCC MONTGOMERY ST is in Manhattan

      - AL MAMOOR SCHOOL is in Queens


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of NYC boroughs.

      - Manhattan is west of Queens

      - In terms of north-south positioning, Manhattan extends both north and south
      of parts of Queens, so I need to be more specific about these locations


      Step 3: Montgomery Street in Manhattan is in the Lower East Side, which is in
      the southern portion of Manhattan.


      Step 4: Al Mamoor School in Queens is likely in Jamaica, Queens (based on common
      knowledge of this institution), which is in the central-eastern part of Queens.


      Step 5: When comparing north-south positioning in NYC:

      - Lower Manhattan (where Montgomery St is located) is generally south of central
      Queens

      - The Lower East Side is one of the southernmost neighborhoods in Manhattan


      Therefore, HENRY STREET SETTLEMENT CCC MONTGOMERY ST in Manhattan is NOT north

      Step 2: Consider Manhattan and Queens geography.

      - Manhattan is an island west of Queens

      - In NYC geography, Manhattan is generally west/southwest of Queens

      - The north-south relationship depends on the specific locations within each
      borough


      Step 3: Analyze the north-south positioning.

      - Henry Street Settlement/Montgomery St would be in the Lower East Side of Manhattan
      (based on the name Henry Street, which is in Lower Manhattan)

      - Lower Manhattan is south of most of Queens

      - Al Mamoor School in Queens would likely be in a more northern position relative

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - HENRY STREET SETTLEMENT CCC MONTGOMERY ST is in Manhattan, specifically on
      Montgomery Street.

      - AL MAMOOR SCHOOL is in Queens.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of NYC boroughs.

      - Manhattan is west of Queens.

      - In NYC, locations are typically described as "uptown" (north) or "downtown"
      (south) within Manhattan.

      - When comparing across boroughs, we need to consider actual geographic coordinates.


      Step 3: Montgomery Street in Manhattan is in the Lower East Side, which is in
      the southern portion of Manhattan.

      - The Lower East Side is in downtown Manhattan.


      Step 4: Queens generally lies to the east of Manhattan, with parts of Queens
      extending both north and south of various parts of Manhattan.

      - Without specific address information for AL MAMOOR SCHOOL in Queens, I need
      to consider the general position of Queens relative to Lower Manhattan.

      - Most of Queens is actually northeast of Lower Manhattan.


      Step 5: The Lower East Side (where Montgomery Street is located) is one of the
      southernmost parts of Manhattan.

      - Almost all of Queens would be north of this location.


      NO


      Actually, I should revise my answer. Without the exact coordinates of AL MAMOOR
      SCHOOL in Queens, I cannot definitively determine its north/south position relative
      to HENRY STREET SETTLEMENT. Queens is a large borough with areas both north
      and south of parts of Manhattan. Since I don''t have the specific location data
      for AL MAMOOR SCHOOL, I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer.'

      has a higher (more northern) position than the Queens location.


      Step 5: Henry Street Settlement is located in the Lower East Side of Manhattan,
      which is in the southern portion of Manhattan.


      Step 6: Al Mamoor School in Queens is likely in central or northern Queens based
      on typical Islamic school distributions in NYC.
