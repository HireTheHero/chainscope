      UNITY PLAZA seems to refer to several buildings in Brooklyn. Assuming "17,24,25A

      is difficult.  Similarly, while several churches may use the name "TRINITY CME
      METHODIST CHURCH," I need a specific address in Brooklyn.

      Island Prep High School in Brooklyn.  A quick search reveals multiple Resurrection
      churches in Brooklyn.  I need to be more specific.  However, Coney Island Prep
      has a clear location.  Let''s assume the question refers to the most prominent
      Resurrection Church, which is the Roman Catholic Parish of the Resurrection.

      I can compare their latitudes.  The location further north will have a higher
      latitude.

      We need to determine the locations of REFORMED CHURCH SI and MARKHAM GARDENS
      BUILDING 10 on Staten Island.  This can be done using a map (like Google Maps)
      or a similar online resource.


      2. **Compare their latitudes.** Once the locations are found, we need to specifically
      look at their north-south positions, which are represented by latitude.  A location
      further north will have a higher latitude.


      3. **Determine the relationship.** If REFORMED CHURCH SI has a higher latitude
      than MARKHAM GARDENS BUILDING 10, then it is north of it.

      * **Reformed Church SI** appears to refer to several churches, so I would need

      * **Markham Gardens Building 10** is a specific apartment building on Staten
      Island.


      Since both are on Staten Island, comparing their north/south positions will
      determine which is further north.  I need the specific Reformed Church to be

      in Brooklyn.

      2. **Determine their relative positions:** Once we''ve located them, we need
      to figure out which one is further north than the other.


      Using a map (e.g., Google Maps), we can find that BELT SHORE PKW BR OV OCEAN
      PKWY refers to the overpass where Belt Parkway crosses Ocean Parkway in southern
      Brooklyn.  BAY FAMILY CENTER is located further north, in Bath Beach.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.

    4007ce7f-abd4-4df3-8b00-ae24c17c2948: '1. **Manhattan Cruise Terminal:** This
      refers to the Manhattan Cruise Terminal located on the West Side of Manhattan,
      specifically in Hell''s Kitchen.


      2. **Church of the Epiphany York Ave:** This refers to a church located on the
      East Side of Manhattan, specifically on York Avenue.


      3. **North/South in Manhattan:**  Generally, streets with higher numbers are
      further north in Manhattan.  Avenues run north-south, so comparing street numbers
      is relevant for determining relative north/south positions.


      4. **West Side vs. East Side:** While not directly relevant to north/south,
      understanding they are on opposite sides of the island helps visualize the locations.


      5. **General Knowledge:** The Manhattan Cruise Terminal is in the 40s/50s street
      area (West Side). York Avenue is on the East Side, and churches are generally
      found in more residential areas, which tend to be further uptown/north.  While
      not definitive, this suggests the church is likely north of the cruise terminal.


      6. **More Precise Information (Needed for a definitive answer):** A quick search
      shows the Manhattan Cruise Terminal is around West 50th Street. The Church of
      the Epiphany is at York Avenue and 74th Street.


      7. **Conclusion:** 74th Street is north of 50th Street.

      2. **Determine more precise locations:** Manhattan Cruise Terminal is located
      on the West Side, generally in the midtown/Hell''s Kitchen area. The Church
      of the Epiphany is located on the East Side, on York Avenue, typically considered
      the Upper East Side.


      3. **Consider uptown/downtown in Manhattan:** In Manhattan, "north" equates
      to "uptown."  The Upper East Side is generally further north/uptown than the
      midtown/Hell''s Kitchen area.


      4. **Final comparison:**  Therefore, Manhattan Cruise Terminal is further downtown
      (south) than the Church of the Epiphany.

      3. **Church of the Epiphany:** The Church of the Epiphany is located on the
      East Side of Manhattan, specifically on York Avenue.


      4. **West Side vs. East Side:**  Streets on the West Side run North-South. Streets
      on the East Side also run North-South.  Therefore, the question of North/South
      can be answered independent of East/West.


      5. **Find cross-streets:** The Manhattan Cruise Terminal is around 72nd Street.
      The Church of the Epiphany is around 74th Street.


      6. **Compare street numbers:** 72nd Street is south of 74th Street.

      Avenue.

      5. **West Side vs. East Side:**  The West Side and East Side run roughly parallel

      2. **Compare their latitudes:** Once I have their locations, I''ll compare the
      latitude coordinates.  A higher latitude indicates a location further north.


      3. **Determine the answer:** If Parkside Preparatory Academy has a higher latitude
      than Explore Charter School, the answer is YES. Otherwise, the answer is NO.


      Using online search engines, I find:


      * **Parkside Preparatory Academy:** Located in Flatbush, Brooklyn.

      * **Explore Charter School:** Located in Flatbush, Brooklyn, seemingly further
      south than Parkside Preparatory.


      More specifically, Parkside Preparatory Academy is located near the intersection
      of Caton and Bedford Avenues, while Explore Charter School is near the intersection
      of Caton and Ocean Avenues.  Ocean Avenue is east of Bedford Avenue, so this
      doesn''t tell us about north/south.  However, a more detailed search indicates
      Parkside Preparatory is further north.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

      Using a search engine, I find:

      is generally north of the main island of Manhattan.

      cross streets, to compare their positions relative to each other.


      3. **Compare North/South Position:**  I will compare the latitude coordinates
      (or cross streets running east-west) of the two locations.  A higher latitude
      indicates a more northerly position.


      4. **Determine Answer:** Based on the comparison, I can determine if the Jerome

      Since Jamaica is generally north of Flushing in Queens, the answer is likely
      YES.  Confirming with a map shows that the Jerome Hardeman Early Childhood Center
      is indeed North of the Bowne Street Community Church.

      (Assuming I have internet access and can perform the searches, I would find
      that Washington Houses Building 6 is at 1890 Amsterdam Avenue and Amsterdam

      Williamsburg in Brooklyn. Since there''s no neighborhood called Williamsburg

      However, if we assume the question meant to compare Hillman Houses in Manhattan
