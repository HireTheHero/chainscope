      - The RFK Bridge connects Manhattan and the Bronx

      - The bike/pedestrian path would be near the bridge''s northern end


      Step 3: Comparing positions

      - Manhattan is south of the Bronx

      - Cambridge Hotel, being in Midtown Manhattan, would be south of the Bronx

      - Cambridge Hotel is located in Manhattan

      - Specifically, it appears to be in the Midtown area

      - RFK Bridge connects Manhattan and the Bronx

      - The bike/pedestrian path is at the bridge''s location


      Step 3: Relative Positioning

      - The RFK Bridge connects Manhattan and the Bronx

      - Manhattan is generally south of the Bronx in NYC''s geography

      - So the RFK Bridge Ped and Bike Path in the Bronx would be NORTH of a location
      in Manhattan
