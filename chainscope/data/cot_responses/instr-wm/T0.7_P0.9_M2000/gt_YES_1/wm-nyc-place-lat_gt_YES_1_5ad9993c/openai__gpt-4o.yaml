      is situated to the southwest of Manhattan and Brooklyn is to the east of Manhattan.
      Given that Liberty Island is south of the southern tip of Manhattan and Brooklyn
      is to the northeast of Liberty Island across the water, Liberty Island would
      be positioned south of Brooklyn.


      Thus, Liberty Island and its ferry landing are located south of the Brooklyn

      1. **Identify the location of Astor Apartments, Manhattan**: Astor Apartments
      is typically associated with an area in Manhattan around Astor Place. Astor
      Place is in Lower Manhattan, which is relatively south in Manhattan compared
      to areas like Midtown or Uptown.

      are located in the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn, which is in the southwestern
      part of the borough.


      2. **Identify the location of Jerome Gardens**: This location is less well-known
      and may not be a widely recognized landmark or neighborhood. It might refer
      to a smaller community or specific area within a larger neighborhood.


      3. **Research Jerome Gardens**: If Jerome Gardens refers to an area within a
      neighborhood, it is essential to determine which neighborhood it is part of.
      Without specific information available, we may need to use available maps or
      resources to verify its exact position in Brooklyn.


      4. **Compare their positions**: Once the exact location of Jerome Gardens is
      identified, compare its latitude with that of Red Hook Park Baseball Fields
      to determine if it is to the north.


      Without the specific and verifiable location of Jerome Gardens available, we
      cannot accurately determine its position relative to Red Hook Park Baseball
      Fields. In general, if Jerome Gardens is indeed a location in Brooklyn, it would
      be necessary to use a detailed map or geographic information system to ascertain
      its position.


      Given the lack of specific information or confirmation of Jerome Gardens as
      a widely recognized location, it is not possible to definitively answer the
      question without further geographic data.


      Thus, based on available and typical information:

      - **NO**, with the caveat that this is based on the assumption that Jerome Gardens
      is not a standard, mapped location easily found north of Red Hook Park Baseball
      Fields.'

      situated in the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn, which is in the southwestern
      part of the borough.


      2. Identify the location of Jerome Gardens: Jerome Gardens is not a well-known
      neighborhood or park within Brooklyn, so it might not be officially recognized
      on maps or in databases. However, if we assume it refers to a location within
      Brooklyn, we need to establish its position relative to Red Hook Park.


      3. General orientation of Brooklyn: Brooklyn is generally oriented with north
      towards Manhattan and the East River on the northwestern side, with the Atlantic
      Ocean to the south.


      4. Since Red Hook is in the southwestern part of Brooklyn, for Jerome Gardens
      to be north of it, Jerome Gardens would need to be located further north within
      Brooklyn.


      Without a specific reference to Jerome Gardens being a recognized place, it
      is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume that Jerome
      Gardens is a hypothetical or less commonly known place within Brooklyn, and
      considering that many areas in Brooklyn are north of Red Hook, it is plausible
      to conclude:


      YES, if Jerome Gardens is a location within Brooklyn, it is likely to be north

      their relative positions in terms of latitude. The location with the higher
      latitude is further north.


      3. **Compare Latitudes**: Compare the latitude of Lynne''s Riding School with

      the Harlem neighborhood of Upper Manhattan. Harlem is situated in the northern
      part of Manhattan.


      3. **Comparing the two locations**: The southern tip of the Bronx, where Maritime
      College is located, is generally north of most parts of Manhattan, including
      Harlem.


      Based on the relative positions on the map, the Maritime College Water Pump
      Building in the Bronx is indeed located north of Harlem Village Green in Manhattan.


      Final answer: YES.'

      Considering the general layout of NYC:

      - Manhattan''s midtown is relatively central in terms of latitude within New

      - Alley Pond Park, being in the northern part of Queens, is likely at a similar

      2. **Research the Campus Layout:** Bronx Community College is situated in the
      University Heights neighborhood of the Bronx. The campus has several buildings
      and facilities.


      3. **Relative Positioning:** Typically, campus maps will show the relative positions
      of buildings. If such a map or a reliable source indicates the positions of
      these two specific locations, we can determine which is north of the other.


      Without specific coordinates or a detailed campus map reference, the answer
      can be derived from available campus resources or maps.


      Assuming access to a valid source indicating their positions, the answer is
      based on the known campus layout.


      Given the typical structure of campus layouts or if a specific map is accessible,
      the answer to whether the Bronx CC Greenhouse is located north of the Bronx
      CC Student Center Annex would be:


      **NO** (This assumes based on standard campus layouts or specific mapping that
      the Greenhouse is not north of the Student Center Annex. Please verify with
      a map for precise details.)'

      - The Lower East Side is generally situated to the north of Williamsburg, Brooklyn.


      Therefore, while the question mentions "Williamsburg, Manhattan," which doesn''t
