      \ GROUP 4, Bronx\" is located north of \"CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP 4 BUILDING 5,\
      \ Bronx,\" let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Names**:\
      \  \n   - \"CLAREMONT REHABS GROUP 4, Bronx\" appears to refer to a broader\
      \ complex or grouping of buildings.  \n   - \"CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP 4 BUILDING\
      \ 5, Bronx\" specifically refers to Building 5 within that group.  \n\n2. **Checking\
      \ Location Details**:  \n   - The Claremont Rehab Group is a known residential\
      \ development in the Bronx, likely part of NYCHA (New York City Housing Authority)\
      \ or another managed housing group.  \n   - Within a numbered building system,\
      \ higher-numbered buildings do not necessarily indicate a geographic order (i.e.,\
      \ Building 5 does not have to be south of the general Group 4 area).  \n\n3.\
      \ **Establishing Relative Positioning**:  \n   - If \"CLAREMONT REHABS GROUP\
      \ 4\" refers to the general complex, then it likely encompasses multiple buildings,\
      \ possibly including Building 5.  \n   - To determine if the general Claremont\
      \ Rehabs Group 4 is north of Building 5, we would need specific address details\
      \ or a verified map.  \n   - If the entire \"GROUP 4\" spans a certain area\
      \ and includes multiple buildings, we cannot definitively say that it is entirely\
      \ north of Building 5.  \n\n**Final Answer:** NO.  \nWithout precise mapping,\
      \ we cannot definitively state that the entire Claremont Rehabs Group 4 is north\
      \ of Building 5, especially if Building 5 is within the same group."

      \  \n   - \"CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP 4 BUILDING 5, Bronx\"  \n   Both belong to\

      \ is in the Midtown or Lower East Side area.  \n\n3. **Compare their relative\
      \ positions**:  \n   - Manhattan is generally west of Queens.  \n   - Alley\
      \ Pond Park is in eastern Queens, which is significantly farther east than Manhattan.\
      \  \n   - Since Manhattan is positioned to the west and generally south of Alley\
      \ Pond Park in Queens, we need to determine if the pedestrian bridge (MOTOR\
      \ PKWY PED BR) is north of the Stein Senior Center.  \n\n4. **Latitude comparison**:\
      \  \n   - Midtown Manhattan is at a lower latitude compared to the northern\
      \ parts of Queens.  \n   - Alley Pond Park and the Motor Parkway are located\
      \ in the northern part of Queens, above many parts of Manhattan.  \n\n### Conclusion:\
      \  \nYes, MOTOR PKWY PED BR OVR ALLEY PRK, Queens is located north of STEIN\
      \ SENIOR CENTER, Manhattan.  \n\n**Final Answer: YES.**"
