      in the northern part of the country along the Mediterranean coast.


      2. **Identify the location of Ghasm**: Ghasm is a town that is located in the

      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Since Hydra is a district within Algiers,

      east of Algiers. Therefore, Ghasm is east of Hydra.

      locations of both places:


      1. **Batang Padang District**: This is a district in the state of Perak, Malaysia.
      It is located on the western side of Peninsular Malaysia.


      2. **Dhiffushi (Kaafu Atoll)**: This is an island in the Maldives, specifically
      located in the Kaafu Atoll. The Maldives is situated in the Indian Ocean, southwest
      of Sri Lanka and India.


      Now, let''s determine their relative positions:


      - The Maldives is located in the Indian Ocean, whereas Malaysia is part of mainland
      Southeast Asia.

      - Specifically, Peninsular Malaysia (where Batang Padang is located) lies to
      the northeast of the Maldives.
