      *   Nepal is in South Asia.

      *   Lebanon is in the Middle East (Western Asia).


      If you were to draw a line from Jezzine District (Lebanon) eastward, you would
      pass through countries like Syria, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and then Pakistan
      before reaching Nepal.


      **Conclusion:**

      Yes, Lumle (in Nepal) is located significantly to the east of Jezzine District
      (in Lebanon).

      answer.


      1.  **Locate Koraput:** Koraput district is in the state of Odisha, India.

      2.  **Locate Agame:** This is the tricky part. "Agame" doesn''t appear to be
      a recognized place name (city, district, or significant geographical feature)
      that would allow for a direct east/west comparison with Koraput. It might be
      a misspelling, a very small local village, or a non-existent place in the context
      of world geography.


      Since "Agame" cannot be definitively located as a geographical point, a direct
      east/west comparison with Koraput district is impossible.


      Therefore, the question cannot be answered with a definitive YES or NO based
      on verifiable geographical information.


      **However, the instructions require a YES or NO answer.** Given that "Agame"
      is not a recognizable geographical entity against which Koraput can be positioned,
      the premise of the question is flawed. If we *must* choose, without any verifiable
      information to support an "east" relationship, the default would be "no" because
      we cannot confirm "yes."


      But to be precise about the *reasoning*:


      **Step 1:** Identify the location of Koraput. Koraput is a district in Odisha,
      India.

      **Step 2:** Attempt to identify the location of "Agame." A search for "Agame"
      as a place name (city, town, district, significant landmark) does not yield
      a recognizable geographical entity that can be plotted on a map for comparison.


      **Conclusion:** Without a verifiable location for "Agame," it''s impossible
      to determine its geographical relationship to Koraput.


      Since the premise of the question relies on a verifiable location for "Agame"
      which does not exist in common geographical databases, the question is unanswerable
      as posed. But if forced to pick, the lack of evidence for "east" means the answer
      is not "yes."

      answer.


      **Step 1: Locate Yuli, Hualien.**

      Yuli is a township located in Hualien County, Taiwan. Taiwan is an island nation
      in East Asia.


      **Step 2: Locate Mopidevi.**

      "Mopidevi" is not a recognized geographical location or place. It doesn''t appear
      on standard maps, in gazetteers, or in geographical databases. It''s possible
      it''s a misspelling, a very obscure local name, or a fictional name.


      **Step 3: Compare their longitudes.**

      Since Mopidevi cannot be located, we cannot determine its longitude or compare
      it to Yuli, Hualien''s longitude.


      **Conclusion:**

      Without a verifiable location for "Mopidevi," it is impossible to determine
      if Yuli, Hualien is east of it.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**, because the premise of comparing two locations
      requires both to be identifiable, and "Mopidevi" is not.'

      answer:


      1.  **Locate Ghasm:** There isn''t a widely recognized major city or geographical
      feature named "Ghasm" that immediately comes to mind in the context of world
      geography, especially in relation to Algeria. It''s possible it''s a very small,
      local place, a misspelling, or a fictional name.


      2.  **Locate Hydra, Algeria:** Hydra is a well-known, upscale neighborhood in
      Algiers, the capital city of Algeria. Algiers is located on the Mediterranean
      coast of North Africa.


      3.  **Consider the "east of" relationship:** For Ghasm to be east of Hydra,
      it would need to be located further to the east (towards the rising sun) than
      Hydra.


      **Conclusion based on readily available geographical information:**


      Since "Ghasm" is not a readily identifiable geographical location, especially
      not one that would be commonly compared to a well-known neighborhood in Algiers,
      it''s highly improbable that there''s a significant place named Ghasm that is
      definitively east of Hydra, Algeria. If "Ghasm" refers to a very minor, obscure,
      or even non-existent location, then the question cannot be definitively answered

      However, the question asks for a clear YES or NO. If Ghasm doesn''t exist or
      isn''t a known place, then it cannot be east of Hydra.


      Therefore, the most accurate answer based on available information is:


      NO'

      Because there's no clear, universally identifiable place called \"Ghasm,\" it's\
      \ impossible to determine its location relative to Hydra, Algeria. Therefore,\
      \ the question cannot be answered with a definitive YES or NO.\n\nHowever, if\

      \ If the question implies that \"Ghasm\" *does* exist and *can* be located,\
      \ then the answer depends entirely on its actual, unknown coordinates.\n\nSince\
      \ I cannot locate \"Ghasm,\" I cannot determine its relationship to Hydra. Therefore,\
      \ I cannot answer YES or NO.\n\n*(Self-correction: The prompt asks for a clear\
      \ YES or NO. If the information is insufficient to answer, the most accurate\
      \ response is to state that, but if forced into a binary, it implies a lack\
      \ of information to confirm either way.)*\n\nGiven the constraint to answer\
      \ YES or NO, and the inability to locate \"Ghasm,\" the most truthful answer\

      \ it isn't. However, if forced to choose based on the *absence* of information\
      \ to confirm it is east, the answer leans towards \"no\" because we cannot verify\
      \ the \"yes.\"\n\nLet's re-evaluate the premise: \"It requires a few steps of\
      \ reasoning. So first, think step by step, and only then give a YES / NO answer.\"\

      1.  **Locate Ghasm:** There isn''t a widely recognized major city or geographical
      feature named "Ghasm" that would be easily found on a standard world map or
      in a geographical database. It''s possible it''s a very small, obscure, or misspelled
      location. However, if we assume it''s a misspelling of a known place, or perhaps
      a very local name, we need more information. Without a clear location for "Ghasm,"
      it''s impossible to establish its position relative to Hydra.


      2.  **Locate Hydra, Algeria:** Hydra is a well-known upscale neighborhood/municipality
      within Algiers, the capital city of Algeria. Algiers is located on the Mediterranean
      coast of North Africa.


      3.  **Determine relative positions:** Since "Ghasm" cannot be reliably located,
      we cannot determine if it is east of Hydra.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**, not because it *isn''t* east, but because the
      premise contains an unidentifiable location, making a definitive comparison
      impossible.'

    816c60a6-2bc0-42ad-bafd-565a03a9a5f9: 'Let''s break this down:


      1.  **Locate White County, Indiana:** Indiana is a state in the Midwestern United
      States. White County is within Indiana.

      2.  **Locate Lockeford, California:** California is a state on the West Coast
      of the United States. Lockeford is within California.

      3.  **Determine relative positions:** The United States spans a large geographic
      area from west to east. California is the westernmost of the contiguous 48 states,
      while Indiana is further east, in the Midwest.


      Therefore, any location in Indiana will be east of any location in California.

      1.  **Locate White County, Indiana:** Indiana is in the Midwest region of the
      United States. White County is within Indiana. So, White County, Indiana is
      in the *eastern half* of the contiguous United States.


      2.  **Locate Lockeford, California:** California is on the West Coast of the
      United States. Lockeford is within California. So, Lockeford, California is
      in the *western half* of the contiguous United States.


      3.  **Compare their longitudes:** Since Indiana is in the Midwest/East and California
      is on the West Coast, any point in Indiana will have a longitude further east
      (closer to the Prime Meridian) than any point in California (which will have
      a longitude further west, closer to the International Date Line).


      Therefore, White County, Indiana is located east of Lockeford, California.
