      2. **Rivercess County**: Rivercess County is located in Liberia, which is in

      Next, we need to consider the geographic relationship between Uganda and Liberia.
      Uganda is situated to the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is
      far to the east when compared to Liberia.


      Now, looking at the two locations:

      - Kibaale District (Uganda) is in East Africa.

      - Rivercess County (Liberia) is in West Africa.


      Since Uganda (where Kibaale District is located) is significantly east of Liberia

      - Pemba Island is located much further to the west, in the Indian Ocean, near
      the coast of Africa.


      Considering the geographical locations:

      - Nusa Kambangan is in the southern part of Southeast Asia, while Pemba Island
      is in the eastern part of Africa.


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Nusa Kambangan is to the east of Pemba Island.


      Thus, the answer to whether Nusa Kambangan is located east of Pemba Island is
      **NO**.'

      \ of Java and further south in the Indian Ocean.\n- **Pemba Island** is located\
      \ much further north in the Indian Ocean, near the eastern coast of Tanzania,\

      \ County, Kentucky?\n\nThe answer is: **NO**."
    d5a7fe7d-a114-4d35-95db-44f5e35a83c6: 'To determine if the Region of Murcia is
      located east of Trimble County, Kentucky, we can follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the Location of Trimble County, Kentucky**: Trimble County is
      located in the United States, specifically in the state of Kentucky. It is situated
      in the northern part of the state, near the border with Indiana.


      2. **Identify the Location of the Region of Murcia**: The Region of Murcia is
      located in southeastern Spain, along the Mediterranean coast.


      3. **Determine the Relative Positions**: To ascertain if one location is east
      of another, we need to look at their positions on a map. Trimble County is in
      North America, while the Region of Murcia is in Europe.


      4. **Geographical Orientation**: Since Murcia is in Europe and Trimble County
      is in North America, we consider the longitudinal positioning. Generally, Europe
      is east of North America when viewed on a global map.


      Considering these points, we conclude that the Region of Murcia is indeed located
      east of Trimble County, Kentucky.

      (West Bank) and Sibi District is in South Asia (Pakistan), we can conclude that
      Sibi District is not in the same region or continent as Beit Jala.


      Based on this reasoning, we conclude that Sibi District is not located east
      of Beit Jala, as they are in entirely different geographical areas.

      Hydra, Algeria, let''s break down the reasoning step by step:


      1. **Identify the Location of Hydra**: Hydra is a suburb of Algiers, the capital
      city of Algeria. It is situated to the east of the city center of Algiers.


      2. **Determine the Location of Ghasm**: Ghasm is a lesser-known locality in
      Algeria. To find its position relative to Hydra, we would need to check its
      geographical coordinates or map position.


      3. **Comparative Positioning**: Once we have both locations identified, we can
      compare their longitudes and latitudes to determine if Ghasm is positioned to
      the east of Hydra.


      4. **Final Assessment**: After comparing the locations, we conclude whether
      Ghasm lies to the east of Hydra.


      Based on this reasoning and geographical information, the answer is:

      is on the West Coast. Therefore, any location in Maryland, including Brandywine,
      will have a higher longitude (more to the east) relative to locations in California.


      4. **Determine relative east-west positions**: Since Brandywine is in the eastern
      part of the U.S. and Litchfield is in the western part, it follows that Brandywine
      is indeed east of Litchfield.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:


      YES'

      - South Korea is located to the east of the Indian subcontinent.

      - Within India, Punjab is situated to the northwest of the Indian mainland.


      Since Chungju (South Korea) is significantly east of India as a whole, it can

      1. **Identify Locations**: Urbisaglia is a town in Italy, while Barclay is a
      neighborhood in Baltimore, Maryland, USA.


      2. **Geographical Orientation**: Next, we need to understand the geographical
      positions of these two places. Urbisaglia is situated in central Italy, whereas
      Baltimore is located on the east coast of the United States.


      3. **Comparative Position**: To find out if Urbisaglia is east of Barclay, we
      need to consider their relative longitudes. Italy is located to the east of
      the United States. However, Urbisaglia is specifically in a central part of
      Italy, which means it is not directly east of Baltimore but rather further east
      and somewhat south.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Urbisaglia is in Italy and Barclay is in the United
      States, Urbisaglia cannot be said to be directly east of Barclay.

    5620b073-16cb-4d9b-aba5-70c139e4413a: 'To determine whether Bandar Baharu District
      is located east of Idjwi, we need to identify the geographical locations of
      both places.


      1. **Identify Idjwi**: Idjwi is an island located in Lake Kivu, which is situated
      between the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda.


      2. **Identify Bandar Baharu District**: Bandar Baharu is a district in the state
      of Kedah, Malaysia, located on the mainland of Southeast Asia.


      3. **Geographical Context**: Idjwi is in central Africa, while Bandar Baharu
      is in Southeast Asia. The two locations are thousands of kilometers apart, on
      different continents.


      4. **Direction**: Given that Bandar Baharu is in Malaysia (east of the African
      continent) and Idjwi is in Africa, it is not possible to categorize Bandar Baharu
      as being east or west of Idjwi in any practical sense because they are not in
      the same geographical context.


      Considering these steps, we conclude that the question of whether Bandar Baharu
      District is located east of Idjwi is not applicable in a direct spatial relationship.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.'
