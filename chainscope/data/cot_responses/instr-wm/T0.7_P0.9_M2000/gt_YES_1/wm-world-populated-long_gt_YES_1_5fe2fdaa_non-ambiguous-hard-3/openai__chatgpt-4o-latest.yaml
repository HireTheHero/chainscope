      is located east of Magalia, California, we need to compare their geographical
      longitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Vanderbilt is a town in Pennsylvania, which is in the eastern United States.

      - Magalia is a town in California, which is in the western United States.


      Step 2: Understand U.S. geography.

      - Pennsylvania is generally located in the northeastern part of the U.S.

      - California is located on the west coast.


      Step 3: Compare relative positions.

      - Since Pennsylvania is in the east and California is in the west, any town
      in Pennsylvania, including Vanderbilt, will be east of any town in California,
      including Magalia.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      YES.'

      \ Baharu District.\n2. Identify the location of Idjwi.\n3. Compare their longitudinal\
      \ positions to determine which one is farther east.\n\n**Step 1: Location of\
      \ Bandar Baharu District**\n\nBandar Baharu District is located in the state\
      \ of Kedah in Malaysia. Kedah is in the northwestern part of Peninsular Malaysia,\
      \ near the border with the state of Penang and close to southern Thailand.\n\
      \n**Step 2: Location of Idjwi**\n\nIdjwi is an island located in Lake Kivu,\
      \ which lies between the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda in\
      \ central Africa. Idjwi is part of the DRC and is situated in eastern DRC.\n\
      \n**Step 3: Comparison**\n\nNow, let's consider the approximate longitudes:\n\
      \n- Bandar Baharu, Malaysia is approximately at 100.5\xB0 East longitude.\n\
      - Idjwi, DRC is approximately at 29.0\xB0 East longitude.\n\nSince 100.5\xB0\
      E is significantly farther east than 29.0\xB0E, Bandar Baharu District is located\
      \ east of Idjwi.\n\n**Final Answer: YES**."
