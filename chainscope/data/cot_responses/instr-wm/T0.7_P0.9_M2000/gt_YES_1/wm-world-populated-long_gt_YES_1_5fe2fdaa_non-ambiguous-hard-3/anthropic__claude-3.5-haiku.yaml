    5d35621e-11c5-4310-a1ad-8e13823d840c: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s locate Bandar Baharu District:

      - This is a district in Malaysia, specifically in the state of Kedah

      - It is located in the northwestern part of Peninsular Malaysia


      2. Next, let''s locate Idjwi:

      - Idjwi is an island in Lake Kivu

      - It is located in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo

      - It is situated between the DRC and Rwanda


      3. Comparing their geographical locations:

      - Bandar Baharu District is in Southeast Asia (Malaysia)

      - Idjwi is in Central Africa (Democratic Republic of the Congo)

      - These locations are on completely different continents, very far apart


      4. To determine east or west, I''ll visualize their global positions:

      - Malaysia is east of Africa

      - Therefore, Bandar Baharu District would be east of Idjwi


      5. Conclusion:

      Since Bandar Baharu District is located east of Idjwi, the answer is:


      YES'
