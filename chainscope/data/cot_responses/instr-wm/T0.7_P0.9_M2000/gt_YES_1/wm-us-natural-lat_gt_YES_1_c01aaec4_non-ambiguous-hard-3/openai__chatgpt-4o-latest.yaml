      MN is located north of Lake Stanley Draper, OK, we need to consider the geographical
      coordinates or relative positions of both locations within the United States.


      1. **Cass Lake, Minnesota** is a city and lake in northern Minnesota. Minnesota
      is located in the northern part of the United States, and Cass Lake is specifically
      situated in north-central Minnesota.


      2. **Lake Stanley Draper** is located in Oklahoma, near Oklahoma City. Oklahoma
      is situated in the south-central region of the United States.


      3. Since Minnesota is significantly farther north than Oklahoma, and Cass Lake
      is in the northern part of Minnesota, it is safe to say that Cass Lake is well
      north of Lake Stanley Draper.
