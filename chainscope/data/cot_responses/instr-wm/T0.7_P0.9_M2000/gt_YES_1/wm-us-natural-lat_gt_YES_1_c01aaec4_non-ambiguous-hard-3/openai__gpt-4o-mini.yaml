    fd5867eb-0396-487a-aa5f-21559c8fee46: 'To answer the question, let''s first identify
      the locations of both lakes.


      1. **Lake Sharpe, SD**: Lake Sharpe is located in South Dakota, and it is a
      reservoir on the Missouri River.


      2. **Inks Lake, TX**: Inks Lake is located in Texas, specifically in Burnet
      County, and is part of the Highland Lakes chain.


      Now, we need to determine the relative positions of these two lakes:


      - **South Dakota (where Lake Sharpe is located)** is north of Texas (where Inks
      Lake is located).

      - Given that Lake Sharpe is in South Dakota, it is generally positioned to the
      north of Texas, including Inks Lake.


      Since Lake Sharpe is in a state that is geographically north of Texas, we can
      conclude that it is indeed located north of Inks Lake.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is **YES**.'
