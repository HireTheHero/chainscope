      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Wallowa Lake is in Oregon (OR)

      - Baldwin Hills is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Determine their general locations within their states.

      - Oregon is entirely north of California

      - Wallowa Lake is in northeastern Oregon, near the Oregon-Idaho border

      - Baldwin Hills is in Los Angeles County in southern California


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Since Oregon is north of California, and Wallowa Lake is in Oregon while Baldwin
      Hills is in California, Wallowa Lake must be north of Baldwin Hills.


      NO WAIT - I need to be more precise. Let me check the specific locations:

      - Wallowa Lake is indeed in northeastern Oregon

      - Baldwin Hills is in the Los Angeles metropolitan area in southern California


      Given that Oregon is entirely north of California, and Wallowa Lake is in Oregon
      while Baldwin Hills is in southern California, the conclusion remains the same.

      step.


      Step 1: Consider the general geographic locations of New York (NY) and Florida
      (FL).

      - New York is a state in the northeastern United States.

      - Florida is a state in the southeastern United States, at the southern tip
      of the country.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      - New York state is generally located much further north than Florida.

      - Any location in New York would typically be north of any location in Florida.


      Step 3: Specifically for Lake Tonawanda, NY and Lake Washington, FL:

      - Lake Tonawanda would be in New York state, placing it in the northern part
      of the US.

      - Lake Washington would be in Florida, placing it in the southern part of the
      US.


      Therefore, based on the geographic positions of these states, Lake Tonawanda,
      NY would be located north of Lake Washington, FL.

      The Kettle River Range is a mountain range located in northeastern Washington
      state, near the border with Canada.

      1) Tatoosh Range is located in Washington state (WA), which is in the Pacific
      Northwest region of the United States.


      2) Kern Lake in Kern County is located in California (CA), which is south of

      4) Since Tatoosh Range is in Washington state, and Kern Lake is in California,
      the Tatoosh Range must be north of Kern Lake.


      5) This is true regardless of the specific locations within each state, as the
      entirety of Washington is north of California.


      YES, Tatoosh Range, WA is located north of Kern Lake (Kern County), CA.'

      - Mount Rainier National Park is in the southern part of Washington state.

      - Kern County is in the southern portion of California.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Even the southernmost part of Washington state is still significantly north

      NO. Actually, I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me verify this more carefully:


      Montana is indeed entirely north of California on a map of the United States.
      Cabinet Mountains is in northwestern Montana, and Henninger Flats is in southern
      California (near Los Angeles). Therefore, Cabinet Mountains is definitely north

      United States.

      - Henninger Flats is in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Determine their relative north-south positions.

      - Montana borders Canada and is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous
      US.

      - California extends quite far north but its southern portion reaches much further
      south than Montana.

      - Henninger Flats is specifically in southern California, near Pasadena/Los
      Angeles.


      Step 3: Compare latitudes.

      - Cabinet Mountains in Montana are located roughly between 47-48 degrees North
      latitude.

      - Henninger Flats in southern California is around 34 degrees North latitude.

      - Since 47-48 degrees North is higher (more northerly) than 34 degrees North,
      the Cabinet Mountains are north of Henninger Flats.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Blue Hole (Castalia) is in Ohio, which is in the northern United States.

      - The Clermont chain of lakes is in Florida, which is in the southeastern United
      States.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on a north-south axis.

      - Ohio is significantly north of Florida on the map of the United States.

      - Castalia, Ohio would be located in northern Ohio.

      - Clermont, Florida is in central Florida.


      Step 3: Make the determination.

      - Since Ohio is entirely north of Florida, any location in Ohio (including Blue
      Hole in Castalia) would be north of any location in Florida (including the Clermont
      chain of lakes).

      Step 2: Determine their general positions within the United States.

      - Ohio is a northern state, located in the Midwest region

      - Florida is a southern state, located at the southeastern tip of the United
