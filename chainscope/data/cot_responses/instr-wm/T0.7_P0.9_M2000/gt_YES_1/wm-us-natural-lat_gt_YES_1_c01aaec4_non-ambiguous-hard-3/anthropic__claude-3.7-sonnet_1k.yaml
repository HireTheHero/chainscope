      to determine the locations of Wallowa Lake, Oregon and Baldwin Hills, California,
      and then compare their latitudes to determine which is further north.


      First, let''s identify these locations:


      1. Wallowa Lake is in Oregon (OR). Oregon is a state in the Pacific Northwest
      region of the United States, bordering the Pacific Ocean, Washington state to
      the north, Idaho to the east, and California and Nevada to the south.


      2. Baldwin Hills is in California (CA). California is a state on the west coast
      of the United States, bordering Oregon to the north, Nevada and Arizona to the
      east, and Mexico to the south.


      Generally speaking, Oregon is north of California, so one might expect that
      a location in Oregon would be north of a location in California. However, I
      need to be more precise since California is a large state and parts of southern
      Oregon could potentially be at a similar latitude to northern California.


      Wallowa Lake is located in northeastern Oregon, in Wallowa County, near the
      Idaho border.


      Baldwin Hills is located in Los Angeles County in southern California.


      Given these locations:

      - Northeastern Oregon is definitely north of southern California

      - Wallowa Lake is quite far north in Oregon

      - Baldwin Hills is in the southern part of California


      So Wallowa Lake, OR is indeed located north of Baldwin Hills, CA.</think>I need
      to determine the relative north-south positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Wallowa Lake is in Oregon (OR), located in the northeastern part of the state
      in Wallowa County.

      - Baldwin Hills is in California (CA), located in the Los Angeles area in southern
      California.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      - Oregon is generally north of California on the map of the United States.

      - Specifically, Wallowa Lake is in the northeastern part of Oregon, placing
      it quite far north.

      - Baldwin Hills is in southern California, in the Los Angeles metropolitan area,
      which is in the southern portion of the state.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - Given that Wallowa Lake is in northeastern Oregon and Baldwin Hills is in
      southern California, Wallowa Lake is significantly north of Baldwin Hills.


      YES, Wallowa Lake, OR is located north of Baldwin Hills, CA.'

      Step 1: Identify where Wallowa Lake, Oregon is located.

      Wallowa Lake is in northeastern Oregon, near the Idaho border. It''s in Wallowa
      County.


      Step 2: Identify where Baldwin Hills, California is located.

      Baldwin Hills is in Los Angeles County, in southern California. It''s essentially
      in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions (latitudes).

      Oregon is generally north of California. Specifically, northeastern Oregon (where
      Wallowa Lake is) is significantly north of southern California (where Baldwin
      Hills is).


      So based on their geographic positions, Wallowa Lake in Oregon would be north
      of Baldwin Hills in California.</think>I''ll determine this by comparing the
      geographic locations of these two places.


      Step 1: Locate Wallowa Lake, Oregon

      Wallowa Lake is located in northeastern Oregon, near the town of Joseph in Wallowa
      County. Oregon is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.


      Step 2: Locate Baldwin Hills, California

      Baldwin Hills is a mountain range/neighborhood located in Los Angeles County
      in southern California. It''s essentially within the Los Angeles metropolitan
      area in the southern part of California.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes

      Oregon is entirely north of California. Specifically, northeastern Oregon (where
      Wallowa Lake is located) is significantly north of southern California (where
      Baldwin Hills is situated).


      YES, Wallowa Lake, OR is located north of Baldwin Hills, CA.'

      And then compare their latitudes to determine if Wallowa Lake is north of Baldwin
      Hills.


      First, let me recall what I know about Wallowa Lake, OR:

      Wallowa Lake is located in northeastern Oregon, near the town of Joseph. Oregon
      is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.


      Now, let me recall what I know about Baldwin Hills, CA:

      Baldwin Hills is an area in Los Angeles, California. It''s in the southern part
      of California.


      Generally speaking, Oregon is north of California, as Oregon borders California
      to the north. So geographically, most places in Oregon would be north of most
      places in California.


      Specifically:

      - Wallowa Lake is in northeastern Oregon, which puts it quite far north

      - Baldwin Hills is in Los Angeles in southern California, which puts it quite
      far south


      Therefore, Wallowa Lake, OR is definitely north of Baldwin Hills, CA.</think>I
      need to determine the relative positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Wallowa Lake, OR.

      Wallowa Lake is located in northeastern Oregon, near the town of Joseph in Wallowa
      County.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Baldwin Hills, CA.

      Baldwin Hills is located in Los Angeles County in southern California. It''s
      part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Oregon is entirely north of California on a map. Furthermore, Wallowa Lake is
      in the northeastern part of Oregon, which places it very far north, while Baldwin
      Hills is in southern California, placing it very far south.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Oregon is north of California, and specifically northeastern Oregon is
      significantly north of southern California, Wallowa Lake is definitely north
      of Baldwin Hills.

      1. Priest Lake is in Idaho (ID), which is a state in the northwestern United
      States.

      2. Diaz Lake is in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the United

      Step 1: Identify the states

      ID stands for Idaho, which is in the northwestern United States.

      CA stands for California, which is on the west coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Determine their general locations

      Idaho is generally north of California. Idaho borders Canada to the north, and
      California is further south, bordering Mexico.


      Step 3: More specifically locate these lakes

      Priest Lake is in the northern part of Idaho, near the Canadian border.

      Diaz Lake is in California, and while I don''t know its exact location, California
      is entirely south of Idaho.


      Step 4: Compare latitudes

      Diaz Lake is somewhere in California, it''s very likely that Priest Lake is
      north of Diaz Lake.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:

      States.

      - Diaz Lake is located in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the
      United States.


      Step 2: Compare the geographical positions of these states.

      - Idaho is positioned north of California in the United States.

      - Idaho shares its northern border with Canada, while California extends much
      further south.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations of these lakes.

      - Priest Lake is in the northern part of Idaho, relatively close to the Canadian
      border.

      - Diaz Lake is in California, which is entirely south of Idaho.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on latitude.

      - Since the entirety of Idaho is north of California, and Priest Lake is in
      Idaho while Diaz Lake is in California, Priest Lake must be north of Diaz Lake.

      to determine the locations of Lake Osakis in Minnesota and Lake of the Arbuckles
      in Oklahoma, specifically their relative positions north/south of each other.


      1. Lake Osakis is in Minnesota (MN), which is a northern state in the US.

      2. Lake of the Arbuckles is in Oklahoma (OK), which is a southern state in the
      US.


      Minnesota is generally located north of Oklahoma in the United States. Minnesota
      borders Canada to the north, while Oklahoma is much further south, not far from
      Texas which borders Mexico.


      Since Lake Osakis is in Minnesota and Lake of the Arbuckles is in Oklahoma,
      it''s almost certain that Lake Osakis is located north of Lake of the Arbuckles.


      To be completely sure, I would need the exact coordinates of both lakes, but
      based on the states they''re in, the answer is very likely "YES".</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both lakes.

      - Lake Osakis is in Minnesota (MN)

      - Lake of the Arbuckles is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Minnesota is a northern state, bordering Canada

      - Oklahoma is a southern state, located in the central-southern part of the
      US


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Minnesota is significantly north of Oklahoma on the US map

      - Any lake in Minnesota would therefore be north of any lake in Oklahoma


      Since Lake Osakis is in Minnesota and Lake of the Arbuckles is in Oklahoma,
      and Minnesota is located north of Oklahoma, I can conclude:


      YES'

      This is a geography question comparing the latitudes of two lakes in different
      states.

      Minnesota (MN) is a northern state that borders Canada, located in the Upper
      Midwest region of the US.

      Oklahoma (OK) is located in the South Central region of the US.


      Step 2: Generally speaking, Minnesota is north of Oklahoma in the United States.


      Step 3: Since Lake Osakis is in Minnesota, and Lake of the Arbuckles is in Oklahoma,
      it''s very likely that Lake Osakis is north of Lake of the Arbuckles.


      However, to be completely certain, I would need to know the exact latitudes

      2) Minnesota is located in the northern part of the United States, bordering
      Canada.

      3) Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States.

      4) Geographically, Minnesota is significantly north of Oklahoma on the map.

      5) Lake Osakis is in Minnesota, while Lake of the Arbuckles is in Oklahoma.

      2. Mountain Lodge Lake in Florida


      Specifically, I need to determine if Indian Lake (Ohio) is located north of
      Mountain Lodge Lake (Florida).


      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - Ohio is a northern state, located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Florida is a southern state, located in the southeastern part of the United
      States


      In the US, states that are further north have higher latitudes than states that
      are further south. Ohio is significantly north of Florida on the map of the

      - Indian Lake is in Ohio (OH)

      - Mountain Lodge Lake is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Ohio and Florida.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Florida is located in the southernmost part of the eastern United States


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      - Ohio is positioned much further north in the United States compared to Florida

      - Any location in Ohio would be north of virtually any location in Florida


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on these states'' relative positions.

      Since Indian Lake is in Ohio, and Mountain Lodge Lake is in Florida, and Ohio
      is definitively north of Florida, Indian Lake must be north of Mountain Lodge
      Lake.

      Boundary Bay, WA refers to a bay in Washington state. Washington state is in
      the northwestern United States, bordering Canada.


      Lake Cunningham, CA would be a lake in California. California is on the west
      coast of the United States, south of Washington state.


      Generally speaking, Washington state is entirely north of California. This is
      because the US states on the west coast, from north to south, are:

      1. Washington

      2. Oregon

      3. California


      So based on the fact that Washington is north of California, Boundary Bay in
      Washington would be north of Lake Cunningham in California.


      Therefore, the answer is YES, Boundary Bay, WA is located north of Lake Cunningham,
      CA.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of these two locations.

      - California is located on the west coast, south of Washington

      - The entire state of Washington is north of California


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Since Boundary Bay is in Washington, and Lake Cunningham is in California, and
      Washington is entirely north of California, Boundary Bay must be north of Lake
      Cunningham.

      I need to determine if Big Spirit Lake is located north of Carancahua Bay.


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Iowa (IA) is a state in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Texas (TX) is a state in the southern United States


      Since Iowa is significantly further north than Texas in the United States, it''s

      Iowa is a Midwestern state located in the northern portion of the United States.

      Texas is a southern state that extends down to the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      Big Spirit Lake is in Dickinson County in the far northern part of Iowa, near
      the Minnesota border.

      Carancahua Bay is on the Gulf Coast of Texas, connected to the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare latitudes.

      Iowa''s position in the northern United States means it has a much higher latitude
      than Texas.

      Even the southernmost point of Iowa would be significantly north of a coastal
      bay in Texas.


      YES, Big Spirit Lake, IA is located north of Carancahua Bay, TX.'

      Since Lake Winnebago is in Wisconsin, and Lac des Allemands is in Louisiana,
      and Wisconsin is significantly north of Louisiana, Lake Winnebago must be north
      of Lac des Allemands.

      First, let me think about where these places are located within their respective
      states:


      1. The Mummy Range is in Colorado (CO), which is a state in the western United
      States.

      2. The Chisos Mountains are in Texas (TX), which is a state in the southern
      United States.


      Now, let me think about the general geographical relationship between Colorado
      and Texas:

      - Colorado is located north of Texas

      - Colorado''s southern border connects with New Mexico, which then borders Texas
      to the west


      Since Colorado is entirely north of Texas, and the Mummy Range is in Colorado
      while the Chisos Mountains are in Texas, it follows that the Mummy Range would
      be north of the Chisos Mountains.


      To be even more precise, the Mummy Range is in northern Colorado in Rocky Mountain
      National Park, while the Chisos Mountains are in southern Texas in Big Bend
      National Park near the Mexico border. This makes the north-south separation
      even more definitive.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions
      of these two mountain ranges.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both mountain ranges.

      - The Mummy Range is located in northern Colorado, within Rocky Mountain National
      Park.

      - The Chisos Mountains are located in southern Texas, within Big Bend National
      Park near the Mexican border.


      Step 2: Compare the states'' geographic positions.

      - Colorado is entirely north of Texas on a map of the United States.

      - Texas is in the southern United States, while Colorado is further north in
      the western/central United States.


      Step 3: Since the Mummy Range is in Colorado (a northern state) and the Chisos
      Mountains are in Texas (a southern state), the Mummy Range must be north of
      the Chisos Mountains.

      each other.

      Colorado is located in the western United States, north of Texas. Texas is located
      in the south-central United States, south of Colorado.


      Step 2: Determine the locations of the specific mountain ranges within their

      Mummy Range is in Colorado, specifically in the northern part of Rocky Mountain
      National Park.

      Chisos Mountains are in Texas, specifically in Big Bend National Park in the

      Kern Lake is in Kern County, California (CA).


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states. Washington
      is in the northwestern United States, while California is located directly south
      of Washington along the west coast.


      Step 3: Washington state is entirely north of California state. Any location

      Michigan is a northern state in the US, bordering Canada. It''s in the upper

      Walloon Lake is in northern Michigan, in the northern part of the Lower Peninsula.

      Jackson Lake in Georgia is likely in central or northern Georgia.


      Even if Jackson Lake is in the northernmost part of Georgia and Walloon Lake

      Washington state is located in the northwest of the United States, bordering
      Canada to the north and Oregon to the south. Washington is one of the northernmost
      states in the contiguous United States.


      California is located on the west coast of the United States, south of Oregon
      and Washington. It extends much further south than Washington.


      So generally speaking, locations in Washington state tend to be north of locations
      in California.


      Pine Lake in Washington state would be somewhere within Washington state, which
      means it would be north of most or all of California.


      Tulare Lake is (or was) a lake in California''s Central Valley. Historically
      it was one of the largest freshwater lakes west of the Great Lakes, but it has
      been mostly dried up due to water diversion for agriculture. It would be located
      somewhere in central or southern California.


      Given these geographical facts, Pine Lake in Washington would almost certainly
      be located north of Tulare Lake in California.</think>I need to determine the
      relative positions of these two lakes by examining their locations.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Pine Lake (Washington) is located.

      Pine Lake is in Washington state, which is in the northwestern United States,
      bordering Canada to the north.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Tulare Lake is located.

      Tulare Lake is in California, specifically in the San Joaquin Valley in central
      California.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Washington state is entirely north of California. Any lake in Washington state
      would be north of any lake in California, as Washington is one of the northernmost
      states in the contiguous US, while California extends south from Oregon.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      Since Pine Lake is in Washington state, and Tulare Lake is in California, Pine
      Lake must be located north of Tulare Lake.


      YES'

      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Washington state is in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada

      - California is on the west coast, south of Washington (and Oregon in between)


      So in general, locations in Washington state are north of locations in California.
      However, I should be more precise, as the question is about specific lakes.


      Pine Lake in Washington state would be located somewhere in Washington, which
      is entirely north of California.


      Tulare Lake is in California, specifically in the San Joaquin Valley in central
      California.


      Since Washington state is entirely north of California, any lake in Washington
      (including Pine Lake) would be north of any lake in California (including Tulare

      Step 3: Compare the geographic positions of Washington and California.

      - Washington state is positioned entirely north of California on the west coast
      of the United States.

      - Washington state borders Canada to the north, while California is further
      south, with Oregon in between.


      Step 4: Make the comparison between the specific lakes.

      - Since Washington state is entirely north of California, any location in Washington
      (including Pine Lake) must be north of any location in California (including
      Tulare Lake).

      First, let me identify the states:

      - MN is Minnesota, which is in the northern part of the United States

      - AR is Arkansas, which is in the southern central part of the United States


      Minnesota is generally located north of Arkansas. Minnesota borders Canada to
      the north, while Arkansas is much further south.


      Woman Lake is in Minnesota, and the Ouachita Mountains are in Arkansas.


      Given the general geography of the United States, with Minnesota being significantly
      north of Arkansas, it''s almost certain that Woman Lake, MN is located north
      of the Ouachita Mountains, AR.</think># Is Woman Lake, MN located north of Ouachita
      Mountains, AR?


      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1. Woman Lake is located in Minnesota (MN)

      2. The Ouachita Mountains are located in Arkansas (AR)

      3. Minnesota is a northern state that borders Canada

      4. Arkansas is a southern state in the central United States

      5. Geographically, Minnesota is located entirely north of Arkansas


      Since Woman Lake is in Minnesota and the Ouachita Mountains are in Arkansas,

      Step 1: Let me recall the general geographical locations.

      - Minnesota (MN) is a northern state in the US, bordering Canada.

      - Arkansas (AR) is a southern state in the US.


      Step 2: In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Minnesota is significantly north of Arkansas in the United States.

      - Minnesota is in the northern part of the US, while Arkansas is in the southern/central
      part.


      Step 3: More specifically:

      - Woman Lake would be somewhere in Minnesota, which means it''s in the northern
      state.

      - The Ouachita Mountains are in Arkansas, which is the more southern state.


      Since Minnesota is entirely north of Arkansas, any lake in Minnesota (including
      Woman Lake) would be north of any mountain range in Arkansas (including the
      Ouachita Mountains).</think># Is Woman Lake, MN located north of Ouachita Mountains,

      To answer this question, I need to consider the geographic locations of these
      two places:


      1. Lake Chelan is in Washington state, which is in the Pacific Northwest region
      of the United States, bordering Canada.

      2. Rogers Dry Lake is in California, which is south of Washington state along
      the Pacific coast.


      In general, Washington state is entirely north of California. So any location
      in Washington would typically be north of any location in California.


      Let me confirm this more specifically:

      - Lake Chelan is located in north-central Washington state

      - Rogers Dry Lake is in the Mojave Desert in southern California (I believe

      3. CA refers to California, which is on the west coast of the United States,

      1. Lake Chelan, WA (Washington state)

      2. Rogers Dry Lake, CA (California)


      The question asks if Lake Chelan is located north of Rogers Dry Lake.


      To answer this, I need to consider the general geography of the western United
      States. Washington state is located in the northwestern part of the US, bordering
      Canada to the north. California is located on the west coast, south of Washington
      state (with Oregon in between).


      Given this general north-south arrangement of these states:

      - Washington is farther north than California

      - Therefore, locations in Washington would generally be north of locations in
      California


      Since Lake Chelan is in Washington (WA) and Rogers Dry Lake is in California
      (CA), it''s very likely that Lake Chelan is north of Rogers Dry Lake.


      Let me double-check my geographic understanding: Washington state is indeed
      north of California. Washington is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous
      US, while California extends along the west coast but is significantly further
      south.</think># Is Lake Chelan, WA north of Rogers Dry Lake, CA?

      3) Washington state is positioned significantly north of California on the west
      coast of the United States

      4) Washington borders Canada to the north, while California is further south,
      even bordering Mexico at its southern end

      5) Any location in Washington state would be north of almost any location in
      California due to this geographical arrangement


      Since Lake Chelan is in Washington and Rogers Dry Lake is in California, and
      Washington is north of California, Lake Chelan must be north of Rogers Dry Lake.

      is north of California.


      Step 2: Let''s be more specific about the locations. The Cabinet Mountains are

      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Montana (MT) is a northern state bordering Canada, while California (CA) is
      a western coastal state. Generally, Montana is north of California on a map
      of the United States.

      Cabinet Mountains are located in northwestern Montana.

      Henninger Flats is located in Southern California, in the San Gabriel Mountains
      near Pasadena.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Since Montana is significantly north of Southern California, and the Cabinet
      Mountains are in the northern part of Montana, they must be considerably north
      of Henninger Flats which is in Southern California.

      - Montana is a northern state that borders Canada

      - California is a western coastal state that lies significantly south of Montana


      Step 3: Looking at their relative positions:

      - All of Montana is north of California on a map

      - Therefore, any location in Montana would be north of any location in California


      Step 4: Since Cabinet Mountains are in Montana and Henninger Flats is in California,
      the Cabinet Mountains must be north of Henninger Flats.

      To answer this, I need to know the general geographic positions of Montana and
      Arizona within the United States:


      Montana (MT) is located in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada
      to the north.


      Arizona (AZ) is located in the southwestern United States, bordering Mexico
      to the south.


      In terms of north-south positioning, Montana is definitely north of Arizona
      in the United States. Montana is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous
      US, while Arizona is one of the southernmost states.


      Since the Sapphire Mountains are in Montana, and Water Ranch Lake is in Arizona,
      it follows that the Sapphire Mountains must be north of Water Ranch Lake.</think>To
      determine if Sapphire Mountains, MT is located north of Water Ranch Lake, AZ,
      I need to consider the geographic positions of Montana and Arizona.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the two states.

      Montana (MT) is located in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada.

      Arizona (AZ) is located in the southwestern United States, bordering Mexico.


      Step 2: Compare their north-south positions.

      Montana is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US.

      Arizona is one of the southernmost states in the contiguous US.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific locations.

      Since Sapphire Mountains are in Montana, and Water Ranch Lake is in Arizona,
      the mountains must inherit their state''s relative position.


      YES, Sapphire Mountains, MT is located north of Water Ranch Lake, AZ.'

      - AZ is Arizona, which is in the southwestern part of the United States


      Montana is definitely north of Arizona in terms of latitude. Montana borders
      Canada to the north, while Arizona borders Mexico to the south.


      So if Sapphire Mountains is in Montana (MT), and Water Ranch Lake is in Arizona
      (AZ), then Sapphire Mountains must be north of Water Ranch Lake.


      The question is asking: Is Sapphire Mountains, MT located north of Water Ranch

      - Water Ranch Lake is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of these states.

      - Montana is located in the northern United States, bordering Canada

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, bordering Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Montana is significantly north of Arizona on any map of the United States

      - Any location in Montana would be north of any location in Arizona


      Since Sapphire Mountains is in Montana and Water Ranch Lake is in Arizona, the
      Sapphire Mountains must be located north of Water Ranch Lake.

      - Lake Pend Oreille is in northern Idaho

      - Coyote Lake in San Bernardino County would be in southern California


      So based on general geography, Lake Pend Oreille in northern Idaho would definitely
      be north of Coyote Lake in southern California.</think># Is Lake Pend Oreille,
      ID north of Coyote Lake (San Bernardino County, CA)?


      Let me work through this step by step:


      1) Lake Pend Oreille is located in northern Idaho, in the Idaho Panhandle region.


      2) Coyote Lake is in San Bernardino County, which is in southern California.


      3) Geographically, Idaho is positioned well north of southern California in
      the United States.


      4) Northern Idaho (where Lake Pend Oreille is) is even further north within
      the state of Idaho.


      5) San Bernardino County in California is quite far south, being near the border
      with Mexico.


      Therefore, Lake Pend Oreille in Idaho is definitely located north of Coyote
      Lake in San Bernardino County, California.

      Minnesota (MN) and the Sans Bois Mountains in Oklahoma (OK).


      To determine if one is north of the other, I need to think about their relative
      latitudes:


      1. Minnesota is a northern state, bordering Canada

      2. Oklahoma is a south-central state, well below Minnesota


      Since Minnesota is significantly north of Oklahoma, Big Sandy Lake in MN would
      be north of any location in Oklahoma, including the Sans Bois Mountains.


      US states from north to south in this region would roughly be:

      - Minnesota (far north, bordering Canada)

      - (Several states in between)

      - Oklahoma (south-central)


      Therefore, Big Sandy Lake, MN is indeed north of the Sans Bois Mountains, OK.</think>To
      determine if Big Sandy Lake, MN is located north of Sans Bois Mountains, OK,
      I need to consider the geographic positions of Minnesota and Oklahoma.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both states.

      - Minnesota (MN) is located in the northern United States, bordering Canada.

      - Oklahoma (OK) is located in the south-central United States.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions.

      - Minnesota is significantly further north than Oklahoma on the map.

      - Any location in Minnesota would be north of any location in Oklahoma.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific locations.

      - Big Sandy Lake is in Minnesota.

      - The Sans Bois Mountains are in Oklahoma.

      - Therefore, Big Sandy Lake must be north of the Sans Bois Mountains.

      locations of Big Sandy Lake in Minnesota and the Sans Bois Mountains in Oklahoma.


      First, let me consider the states:

      - Minnesota (MN) is located in the northern part of the United States

      - Oklahoma (OK) is located in the south-central part of the United States


      Minnesota is significantly north of Oklahoma. Any location in Minnesota would
      generally be north of any location in Oklahoma.


      Since Big Sandy Lake is in Minnesota and the Sans Bois Mountains are in Oklahoma,
      it''s highly likely that Big Sandy Lake is north of the Sans Bois Mountains.


      Let me verify this reasoning:

      - Minnesota shares a border with Canada to the north

      - Oklahoma is much further south, bordering Texas to its south

      - The geographic layout of the US means Minnesota is several states north of
      Oklahoma</think># Is Big Sandy Lake, MN located north of Sans Bois Mountains,
      OK?


      To solve this question, I need to determine the relative locations of these
      two places based on their states.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1. Big Sandy Lake is located in Minnesota (MN)

      2. The Sans Bois Mountains are located in Oklahoma (OK)

      3. Minnesota is a northern state that borders Canada

      4. Oklahoma is a south-central state, positioned much further south in the United
      States

      5. Geographically, Minnesota is entirely north of Oklahoma on the map of the
      United States


      Since any location in Minnesota (including Big Sandy Lake) would be north of
      any location in Oklahoma (including the Sans Bois Mountains), the answer is:


      YES'

      2. Big Sandy Lake, MN would be in Minnesota (abbreviated as MN).


      3. Sans Bois Mountains, OK would be in Oklahoma (abbreviated as OK).


      4. Now I need to determine their relative positions. In the US, Minnesota is
      located in the northern part of the country, while Oklahoma is located in the
      south-central part.


      5. Minnesota is definitely north of Oklahoma on a map of the United States.


      6. So if Big Sandy Lake is in Minnesota, and Sans Bois Mountains are in Oklahoma,
      then Big Sandy Lake would be north of Sans Bois Mountains.</think>I''ll think
      through this step by step:

      the Upper Midwest region of the United States.


      3) The Sans Bois Mountains are in Oklahoma (OK), which is located in the south-central
      region of the United States.


      4) Looking at the geographic positions of these states, Minnesota is significantly
      north of Oklahoma on the map of the United States.


      5) Since Big Sandy Lake is in Minnesota and the Sans Bois Mountains are in Oklahoma,
      and Minnesota is north of Oklahoma, it follows that Big Sandy Lake is north
      of the Sans Bois Mountains.


      YES'

      Oklahoma is located in the South Central region of the United States.


      Given the general geography of the US, Minnesota is located north of Oklahoma.
      Therefore, places in Minnesota would generally be north of places in Oklahoma.


      Big Sandy Lake is in Minnesota (MN), and the Sans Bois Mountains are in Oklahoma
      (OK).


      Since Minnesota is north of Oklahoma, Big Sandy Lake, MN would be north of the
      Sans Bois Mountains, OK.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of

      Coleto Creek Reservoir is in Texas (TX), which is a southern state.


      Since Iowa is significantly north of Texas on the map of the United States,
      East Okoboji Lake in Iowa would be north of Coleto Creek Reservoir in Texas.</think>I
      need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two bodies of
      water.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these lakes are located.

      - East Okoboji Lake is in Iowa (IA)

      - Coleto Creek Reservoir is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Iowa is in the northern part of the central United States, located along the
      upper Mississippi River region.

      Texas is in the southern United States, bordering Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Iowa is substantially north of Texas on any map of the United States. The southernmost
      point of Iowa is still considerably north of the northernmost point of Texas.


      Step 4: Make the determination about the specific lakes.

      Since East Okoboji Lake is in Iowa and Coleto Creek Reservoir is in Texas, the
      lake in Iowa must be north of the reservoir in Texas.

      if East Okoboji Lake in Iowa (IA) is located north of Coleto Creek Reservoir
      in Texas (TX).


      To answer this, I need to compare the latitudes of these two locations.


      First, I need to think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Iowa (IA) is a state in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Texas (TX) is a state in the South/Southwest region of the United States


      In general, Iowa is located north of Texas on a map of the United States. Iowa
      shares a border with Minnesota to the north and Missouri to the south. Texas
      is much further south, sharing a border with Mexico.


      Given this general geographic knowledge, East Okoboji Lake in Iowa would almost
      certainly be north of Coleto Creek Reservoir in Texas.


      To be even more specific:

      - East Okoboji Lake is in northern Iowa, part of the Iowa Great Lakes region

      - Coleto Creek Reservoir is in southern Texas


      So East Okoboji Lake in Iowa is definitely north of Coleto Creek Reservoir in
      Texas.</think>To determine if East Okoboji Lake, IA is located north of Coleto
      Creek Reservoir, TX, I need to consider the geographical positions of Iowa and
      Texas.


      Step 1: Identify the general locations of the two states.

      Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States.

      Texas is located in the southern United States.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions.

      Iowa is positioned significantly north of Texas on the map of the United States.
      Iowa borders Minnesota to the north and Missouri to the south, while Texas extends
      much further south, even sharing a border with Mexico.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within each state.

      East Okoboji Lake is in Dickinson County in northern Iowa.

      Coleto Creek Reservoir is in South Texas, between Victoria and Goliad counties.


      Given these geographical positions, East Okoboji Lake in Iowa is definitely
      north of Coleto Creek Reservoir in Texas.

      if Saginaw Bay, Michigan is located north of Kingsley Lake, Florida.


      To answer this, I need to recall the relative geographic positions of Michigan
      and Florida within the United States.


      Step 1: Recall the locations of Michigan and Florida

      - Michigan is in the northern part of the United States, bordering the Great
      Lakes region

      - Florida is in the southeastern United States, at the bottom of the country


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions

      - Michigan is much further north than Florida

      - Florida is one of the southernmost states in the continental US

      - Michigan is in the upper Midwest


      Step 3: Specifically for Saginaw Bay and Kingsley Lake

      - Saginaw Bay is part of Lake Huron in Michigan

      - Kingsley Lake is in Florida


      Since Michigan is significantly north of Florida, any bay in Michigan (including
      Saginaw Bay) would be north of any lake in Florida (including Kingsley Lake).</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of these two bodies of water.

      - Saginaw Bay is located in Michigan (MI), which is in the northern United States.

      - Kingsley Lake is located in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of Michigan and Florida.

      - Michigan is in the Great Lakes region, in the northern part of the continental
      US.

      - Florida is one of the southernmost states in the continental US.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Michigan''s location is significantly farther north than Florida.

      - Any body of water in Michigan would be north of any body of water in Florida.


      YES, Saginaw Bay, MI is located north of Kingsley Lake, FL.'

      - Wyoming''s southern border is significantly north of Texas''s northern border

      - Any location in Wyoming would be north of any location in Texas


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Bear Lodge Mountains are in Wyoming and Christmas Mountains are in Texas,
      and Wyoming is entirely north of Texas, Bear Lodge Mountains must be north of

      locations of West Okoboji Lake in Iowa (IA) and Aransas Bay in Texas (TX).


      First, let me consider the states:

      - Iowa (IA) is in the northern central part of the United States

      - Texas (TX) is in the southern part of the United States


      Since Iowa is a northern state and Texas is a southern state, a lake in Iowa
      would generally be north of a bay in Texas.


      To be more specific:

      - West Okoboji Lake is in northwest Iowa

      - Aransas Bay is on the Gulf Coast of Texas


      The entire state of Iowa is north of Texas geographically. Since West Okoboji
      Lake is in Iowa and Aransas Bay is in Texas, West Okoboji Lake must be north
      of Aransas Bay.</think>To determine if West Okoboji Lake, IA is located north
      of Aransas Bay, TX, I need to analyze their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Iowa (IA) is located in the upper Midwest region of the United States, while
      Texas (TX) is in the southern part of the country. Iowa is significantly north
      of Texas.


      Step 2: Locate the specific bodies of water.

      West Okoboji Lake is in Dickinson County in northwest Iowa.

      Aransas Bay is on the Gulf Coast of Texas, near Rockport.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Iowa''s southern border is entirely north of Texas''s northern border. Since
      West Okoboji Lake is well within Iowa and Aransas Bay is on the southern coast
      of Texas (on the Gulf of Mexico), the lake must be considerably north of the
      bay.


      YES, West Okoboji Lake, IA is located north of Aransas Bay, TX.'

      - Iowa (IA) is a state in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Texas (TX) is a state in the southern United States


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - Iowa is located much further north than Texas

      - Texas borders Mexico to the south, while Iowa is several states north of Texas


      Since West Okoboji Lake is in Iowa, and Aransas Bay is in Texas, it''s very
      likely that West Okoboji Lake is located north of Aransas Bay.


      To be more specific:

      - West Okoboji Lake is in northwestern Iowa

      - Aransas Bay is on the Gulf Coast of Texas


      So geographically, West Okoboji Lake in Iowa is definitely north of Aransas
      Bay in Texas.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative
      north-south positions of these two water bodies.

      - Aransas Bay is located in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Iowa and Texas within the United
      States.

      - Iowa is a Midwestern state located in the northern portion of the United States

      - Texas is a southern state that borders the Gulf of Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Iowa is significantly north of Texas on the map

      - Any lake in Iowa would be north of a bay on the Texas coast


      Since West Okoboji Lake is in Iowa (a northern state) and Aransas Bay is in
      Texas (a southern state), West Okoboji Lake is definitely located north of Aransas
      Bay.

      Midwest region of the US.

      - Arkansas is a southern state, located in the southern-central region of the
      US.


      Based on the general locations of these states, Minnesota is definitely north
      of Arkansas on the map.


      Now, for the specific locations:

      - Saganaga Lake is in Minnesota, likely in the northern part of the state given
      that many of Minnesota''s lakes are in its northern region.

      - White Oak Lake State Park is in Arkansas.


      Since Minnesota is entirely north of Arkansas, any location in Minnesota (including
      Saganaga Lake) would be north of any location in Arkansas (including White Oak
      Lake State Park).</think># Reasoning Step by Step


      To determine if Saganaga Lake, MN is located north of White Oak Lake State Park,
      AR, I need to consider the geographic positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' positions.

      - Minnesota (MN) is located in the northern United States, bordering Canada

      - Arkansas (AR) is located in the southern United States


      Step 2: Analyze relative positions.

      - Minnesota is entirely north of Arkansas on the US map

      - Minnesota is in the Upper Midwest region

      - Arkansas is in the South-Central region


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations.

      - Saganaga Lake is in Minnesota, in the northern part of the state (near the
      Canadian border)

      - White Oak Lake State Park is in Arkansas


      Since any point in Minnesota is geographically north of any point in Arkansas,
      Saganaga Lake must be north of White Oak Lake State Park.

      locations of Saganaga Lake in Minnesota (MN) and White Oak Lake State Park in
      Arkansas (AR).


      First, let''s think about the states:

      - Minnesota (MN) is in the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada

      - Arkansas (AR) is in the southern part of the United States


      Just based on the states alone, Minnesota is north of Arkansas. But I need to
      check the specific locations to be sure.


      Saganaga Lake is in Minnesota, specifically in the northeastern part of the
      state, near the border with Canada. It''s part of the Boundary Waters Canoe
      Area.


      White Oak Lake State Park is in Arkansas. Arkansas is significantly south of
      Minnesota.


      Given that Minnesota is north of Arkansas, and Saganaga Lake is in northern
      Minnesota (near the Canadian border), while White Oak Lake State Park is in
      Arkansas, it''s very clear that Saganaga Lake is north of White Oak Lake State
      Park.</think>To determine if Saganaga Lake, MN is located north of White Oak

      - Saganaga Lake is located in northeastern Minnesota, in the Boundary Waters
      Canoe Area near the Canadian border.

      - White Oak Lake State Park is in southern Arkansas.


      Step 3: Compare latitudes.

      - Minnesota is entirely north of Arkansas.

      - Saganaga Lake, being in the northern part of Minnesota (near the Canadian
      border), is significantly further north than any point in Arkansas.

      - White Oak Lake State Park, being in Arkansas, is much further south.


      YES, Saganaga Lake, MN is located north of White Oak Lake State Park, AR.'

      - Wisconsin (WI) is in the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada

      - Louisiana (LA) is in the southern part of the United States, bordering the
      Gulf of Mexico


      Given the locations of these states, Wisconsin is clearly north of Louisiana.


      Since Lake Delton is in Wisconsin and Catahoula Lake is in Louisiana, it follows
      that Lake Delton would be north of Catahoula Lake.


      So the answer would be YES, Lake Delton, WI is located north of Catahoula Lake,
      LA.</think>To determine if Lake Delton, WI is located north of Catahoula Lake,
      LA, I need to consider the geographical locations of both lakes.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each lake is located.

      - Lake Delton is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - Catahoula Lake is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical position of these states.

      - Wisconsin is located in the northern part of the United States, in the Upper
      Midwest region

      - Louisiana is located in the southern United States, along the Gulf of Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Wisconsin is much further north in the United States compared to Louisiana

      - Any location in Wisconsin would generally be north of any location in Louisiana


      Since Lake Delton is in Wisconsin (a northern state) and Catahoula Lake is in
      Louisiana (a southern state), Lake Delton must be located north of Catahoula
      Lake.

      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - Montana (MT) is a northern state, bordering Canada

      - Arizona (AZ) is a southwestern state, bordering Mexico


      Just based on the states, Montana is definitely north of Arizona. Montana is
      one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US, while Arizona is a southern
      border state.


      So if Echo Lake is in Montana, and Topock Gorge is in Arizona, then Echo Lake
      would be north of Topock Gorge.


      Let me double-check this logic:

      - Echo Lake, MT is in Montana (northern US)

      - Topock Gorge, AZ is in Arizona (southern US)

      - Montana is north of Arizona

      - Therefore, Echo Lake must be north of Topock Gorge</think># Is Echo Lake (Montana)
      located north of Topock Gorge, AZ?


      To answer this question, I need to consider the geographical locations of both
      places and their respective states.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions

      - Montana (MT) is located in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada

      - Arizona (AZ) is located in the southwestern United States, bordering Mexico


      ## Step 2: Consider their north-south positioning

      - Montana is significantly farther north than Arizona in the United States

      - Montana is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US

      - Arizona is a southern border state


      ## Step 3: Apply this to the specific locations

      Since Echo Lake is in Montana and Topock Gorge is in Arizona, and Montana is
      entirely north of Arizona, Echo Lake must be north of Topock Gorge.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      to determine the relative locations of Lake Sharpe in South Dakota (SD) and
      Inks Lake in Texas (TX).


      First, let me think about the general geographic locations of the states:

      - South Dakota (SD) is in the northern part of the United States, bordering
      North Dakota to the north, Minnesota to the east, Iowa to the southeast, Nebraska
      to the south, Wyoming to the west, and Montana to the northwest.

      - Texas (TX) is in the southern part of the United States, bordering Oklahoma
      to the north, Arkansas and Louisiana to the east, Mexico to the south, and New
      Mexico to the west.


      Based on the locations of the states, South Dakota is significantly north of
      Texas. South Dakota is in the northern Great Plains region, while Texas extends
      far into the southern United States, even bordering Mexico.


      Since Lake Sharpe is in South Dakota and Inks Lake is in Texas, and South Dakota
      is north of Texas, Lake Sharpe would be north of Inks Lake.</think>I need to
      determine the relative north-south positions of these two lakes.

      - Lake Sharpe is in South Dakota (SD)

      - Inks Lake is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - South Dakota is located in the northern part of the United States

      - Texas is located in the southern part of the United States

      - South Dakota is significantly north of Texas on any map of the US


      Step 3: Since lakes are located within their respective states, their relative
      positions follow the same pattern.

      - Since Lake Sharpe is in South Dakota, and South Dakota is north of Texas,
      then Lake Sharpe must be north of Inks Lake (which is in Texas)

      Step 1: Recall the relative positions of South Dakota and Texas.

      South Dakota is in the northern part of the United States, near the Canadian

      Step 2: Since Lake Sharpe is in South Dakota and Inks Lake is in Texas, just
      based on the states alone, Lake Sharpe would be north of Inks Lake.


      Step 3: To be thorough, let me consider the specific locations of the lakes
      within their states. Lake Sharpe is a reservoir on the Missouri River in central
      South Dakota. Inks Lake is a reservoir on the Colorado River in central Texas.


      Even considering their specific locations within their respective states, the
      fact that South Dakota is so much farther north than Texas means that Lake Sharpe

      Great Plains region. Texas is located in the southern United States, bordering
      Mexico.


      3) South Dakota is significantly north of Texas in terms of latitude. The entire
      state of South Dakota lies north of the entire state of Texas.


      4) Lake Sharpe is a reservoir on the Missouri River in central South Dakota,
      while Inks Lake is a reservoir in central Texas.

      to determine the relative positions of Swan Lake in Montana (MT) and Vulture
      Mountains in Arizona (AZ).


      First, I need to think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Montana is a state in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada to
      the north

      - Arizona is a state in the southwestern United States, bordering Mexico to
      the south


      In terms of latitude:

      - Montana is significantly north of Arizona in the United States

      - Montana is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US

      - Arizona is one of the southernmost states in the contiguous US


      Since Swan Lake is in Montana and Vulture Mountains are in Arizona, it''s very
      likely that Swan Lake is located north of Vulture Mountains simply based on
      the positions of these states.


      So my reasoning is:

      1. Montana is north of Arizona

      2. Swan Lake is in Montana

      3. Vulture Mountains are in Arizona

      4. Therefore, Swan Lake (MT) is north of Vulture Mountains (AZ)</think># Is
      Swan Lake (Montana), MT located north of Vulture Mountains, AZ?


      I''ll think about the relative geographic positions of these locations step
      by step:


      1) Let me consider the states first: Montana (MT) is located in the northwestern
      United States, while Arizona (AZ) is in the southwestern United States.


      2) In terms of latitude, Montana is much further north than Arizona. Montana
      borders Canada to the north, while Arizona is near the Mexican border in the
      south.


      3) Swan Lake is in Montana, which means it inherits Montana''s northern position.


      4) The Vulture Mountains are in Arizona, inheriting Arizona''s southern position.


      5) Since Montana is entirely north of Arizona on the map, any location in Montana
      (including Swan Lake) would be north of any location in Arizona (including the
      Vulture Mountains).


      Therefore, YES, Swan Lake (Montana), MT is located north of Vulture Mountains,
      AZ.'

      Washington state is located on the west coast of the United States, near the
      Canadian border.

      California is also on the west coast, but further south.

      In general, Washington is north of California.


      Step 3: Check if there might be any exceptions or confusion about these specific
      locations.

      The Strait of Georgia is typically associated with the body of water between
      Vancouver Island and mainland British Columbia, Canada. However, the question

      - Grizzly Bay, CA is in California


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Washington state is located on the west coast of the United States near the
      Canadian border, while California is also on the west coast but further south.
      On a map of the United States, Washington is positioned entirely north of California.

      Step 2: Consider their relative positions within the United States.

      - South Dakota is in the northern part of the country, close to the Canadian
      border.

      - Texas is in the southern United States, with its southern portions reaching
      the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare their approximate latitudes.

      - South Dakota is entirely north of Texas.

      - Any lake in South Dakota, including Lake Kampeska, would be north of any bay

      Trinity Bay is on the coast of Texas, near Houston, which is in the southeastern
      part of Texas, along the Gulf of Mexico.


      Based on the general geography of the United States, South Dakota is significantly
      north of Texas. Any lake in South Dakota would be north of any bay in Texas.

      Plains region

      - Trinity Bay is in Texas (TX), which is a southern state bordering the Gulf

      Looking at their positions within the United States:

      - South Dakota is located in the northern part of the country, roughly between
      the 43rd and 46th parallels north

      - Texas is much further south, with Trinity Bay specifically located along the
      Gulf Coast near Houston, roughly around the 29th parallel north


      Since South Dakota''s southernmost point is still significantly north of Texas''s
      Gulf Coast region, any lake in South Dakota (including Lake Kampeska) must be
      north of Trinity Bay in Texas.

      locations of Ford Lake in Michigan and Lake Monroe in Florida.


      First, let''s consider the general geography of Michigan and Florida within
      the United States:

      - Michigan is a northern state, located in the Great Lakes region

      - Florida is the southernmost state in the continental United States


      Just based on the states alone, I can already say that any location in Michigan
      would be north of any location in Florida. This is because Michigan''s entire
      territory is significantly north of Florida''s entire territory.


      So Ford Lake in Michigan must be north of Lake Monroe in Florida.</think># Is
      Ford Lake (Michigan) north of Lake Monroe (Florida)?


      To answer this question, I need to consider the geographic locations of these
      two lakes.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1. Ford Lake is located in Michigan, which is a northern state in the Great
      Lakes region of the United States.


      2. Lake Monroe is located in Florida, which is the southernmost state in the
      continental United States.


      3. Michigan''s entire territory lies significantly north of Florida''s entire
      territory.


      4. Therefore, any body of water in Michigan (including Ford Lake) must be located
      north of any body of water in Florida (including Lake Monroe).


      ## Answer: YES


      Ford Lake in Michigan is definitely located north of Lake Monroe in Florida.'

      step by step:


      1. The question is comparing the locations of Swiftcurrent Lake, MT and Ivanpah
      Lake, CA

      2. MT refers to Montana, which is a northern state bordering Canada

      3. CA refers to California, which is on the west coast and borders Mexico to
      the south

      4. Montana is generally north of California in the United States

      5. Swiftcurrent Lake is in Montana, so it''s in a northern state

      6. Ivanpah Lake is in California, so it''s in a more southern state


      Based on the general geography of US states, Montana is significantly north
      of California. So any lake in Montana (including Swiftcurrent Lake) would be
      north of any lake in California (including Ivanpah Lake).


      To be more specific:

      - Swiftcurrent Lake is in Glacier National Park in northwestern Montana

      - Ivanpah Lake is a dry lake in the Mojave Desert of southeastern California


      So yes, Swiftcurrent Lake in Montana is definitely located north of Ivanpah
      Lake in California.</think>To determine whether Swiftcurrent Lake, MT is located
      north of Ivanpah Lake, CA, I need to consider the geographic locations of these
      two lakes.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      Montana (MT) is a northern state that borders Canada, while California (CA)
      is a western state that extends much further south.


      Step 2: Locate the specific lakes.

      Swiftcurrent Lake is located in Glacier National Park in northwestern Montana,
      near the Canadian border.

      Ivanpah Lake (a dry lake bed) is located in the Mojave Desert in southeastern
      California, near the Nevada border.


      Step 3: Compare latitudes.

      Montana as a whole state is significantly north of California. Glacier National
      Park where Swiftcurrent Lake is located is in the northernmost part of Montana,
      while the Mojave Desert region where Ivanpah Lake is located is in the southern
      portion of California.


      YES, Swiftcurrent Lake, MT is located north of Ivanpah Lake, CA.'

      2. Ivanpah Lake in California (CA)


      I need to determine if Swiftcurrent Lake is north of Ivanpah Lake.


      Let me reason through this:


      1. Montana is a northern state, bordering Canada, located in the northwestern
      United States.

      2. California is located on the west coast of the United States, south of Oregon
      and north of Mexico.

      3. In general, Montana is north of California.


      More specifically:

      - Swiftcurrent Lake is in Glacier National Park in northwestern Montana, very
      close to the Canadian border.

      - Ivanpah Lake is a dry lake bed located in the Mojave Desert in southeastern
      California near the Nevada border.


      Given their respective states'' positions, and the locations within those states,
      Swiftcurrent Lake in northern Montana would definitely be north of Ivanpah Lake
      in southern California.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine

      - Swiftcurrent Lake is located in Glacier National Park in northwestern Montana
      (MT).

      - Ivanpah Lake is a dry lake bed located in the Mojave Desert in southeastern
      California (CA).


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Montana and California.

      - Montana is a northern state that borders Canada.

      - California is located on the west coast, significantly south of Montana.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Montana''s southern border is still considerably north of California''s northern
      border.

      - Swiftcurrent Lake is in northern Montana, near the Canadian border.

      - Ivanpah Lake is in southeastern California, near the Nevada border.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on their positions.

      Since Montana is entirely north of California, and Swiftcurrent Lake is in northern
      Montana while Ivanpah Lake is in southeastern California, Swiftcurrent Lake
      must be significantly north of Ivanpah Lake.

      in Riverside County. California is on the west coast of the United States, southwest
      of Idaho.


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Idaho is north of California

      - The Spokane area is in the northern part of Idaho, close to the Canadian border
