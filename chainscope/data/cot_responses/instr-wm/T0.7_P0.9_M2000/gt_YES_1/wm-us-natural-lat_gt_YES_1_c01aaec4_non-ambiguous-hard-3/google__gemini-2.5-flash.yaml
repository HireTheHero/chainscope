      1.  **Locate Boundary Bay, WA:** Boundary Bay is on the border between the US
      (Washington State) and Canada (British Columbia). This places it at a high northern
      latitude within the continental US.

      2.  **Locate Lake Cunningham, CA:** Lake Cunningham is located within San Jose,
      California. California is a southern state compared to Washington.
