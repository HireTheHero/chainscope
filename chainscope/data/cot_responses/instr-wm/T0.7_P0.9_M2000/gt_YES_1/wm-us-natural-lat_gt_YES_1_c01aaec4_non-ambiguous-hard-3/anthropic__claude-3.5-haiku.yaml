      - This is a reservoir in Riverside County, California, in the southern part
      of the state


      3. Comparing their geographic locations:

      - Kettle River Range is in northern Washington state

      - Diamond Valley Lake is in southern California


      4. Comparing their north-south positions:

      - Washington state is much further north than California

      - So any location in Washington would be north of a location in California


      5. Therefore, Kettle River Range is definitely north of Diamond Valley Lake.

    e512c2f6-2b4c-45d1-a99a-6fb511cfaa18: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate Ten Mile Lake in Minnesota:

      - Ten Mile Lake is in Cass County, in north-central Minnesota


      2. Next, locate Caddo Lake in Louisiana:

      - Caddo Lake is in the northeast corner of Louisiana, near the Texas border


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Minnesota is located much further north than Louisiana

      - Ten Mile Lake is in northern Minnesota

      - Caddo Lake is in southern Louisiana

      1. First, let''s locate Ford Lake in Michigan:

      - Ford Lake is located in Ypsilanti, Michigan

      - Michigan is in the northern part of the United States


      2. Next, let''s locate Lake Monroe in Florida:

      - Lake Monroe is located in Volusia County, Florida

      - Florida is in the southeastern part of the United States


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Michigan is much further north than Florida

      - Any location in Michigan will be north of any location in Florida


      4. Therefore, Ford Lake (Michigan) is definitely located north of Lake Monroe

      - They are near El Paso, close to the New Mexico border

      - They are located in the southern part of Texas


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Wyoming is north of Texas

      - The specific locations of these mountain ranges also follow this general pattern

      - Bighorn Mountains are much further north compared to Hueco Mountains


      4. Therefore, Bighorn Mountains, WY is indeed located north of Hueco Mountains,
      TX.
