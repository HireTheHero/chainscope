      WA is located north of Grizzly Bay, CA, we can follow these steps:


      1. Identify the location of the Strait of Georgia: The Strait of Georgia is
      a large body of water that lies between Vancouver Island and the mainland coast
      of British Columbia, Canada. It is north of the U.S.-Canada border, but for
      reference in the U.S., it is generally north of the state of Washington.


      2. Identify the location of Grizzly Bay: Grizzly Bay is part of the San Francisco
      Bay estuary system, located in Northern California.


      3. Compare the latitudes: Washington State, where the Strait of Georgia is located
      (just north of it in Canada), is generally north of California, where Grizzly
      Bay is located.


      Based on these steps, the Strait of Georgia is indeed north of Grizzly Bay.

      San Francisco Bay Area, specifically in Solano County, California. It is part
      of the larger San Francisco Bay estuary.


      2. **Identify the location of the Strait of Georgia, WA:** The Strait of Georgia
