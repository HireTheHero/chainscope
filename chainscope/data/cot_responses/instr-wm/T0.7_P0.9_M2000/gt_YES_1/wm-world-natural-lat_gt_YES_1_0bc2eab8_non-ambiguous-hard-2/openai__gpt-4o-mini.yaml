      United States and Lake Balanan is in Indonesia, we need to assess their relative
      latitudes. Montana is significantly farther north than Indonesia, which is closer
      to the equator.


      4. **Determine the relative positions**: Given that Castle Mountains are located
      in the northern hemisphere (Montana) and Lake Balanan is in the southern hemisphere
      (Indonesia), Castle Mountains cannot be north of Lake Balanan because they are
      in different hemispheres.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is NO.'
    e166e0f3-d69d-43dc-a0ee-af1d76a2b023: 'To determine whether Castle Mountains (Montana)
      is located north of Lake Balanan, we need to consider the geographical positions
      of both places.


      1. **Location of Castle Mountains (Montana)**: The Castle Mountains are located
      in the state of Montana in the United States. They are part of the larger Rocky
      Mountains range.


      2. **Location of Lake Balanan**: Lake Balanan is situated in the central part
      of the island of Sumbawa in Indonesia.


      3. **Comparing Locations**: To assess the relative positions, we note that Montana
      is in North America and significantly far north of the equator, while Lake Balanan
      is located near the equator in Indonesia.


      4. **Geographical Context**: Since Lake Balanan is in a different hemisphere
      (southern hemisphere) compared to Montana (northern hemisphere), Castle Mountains
      cannot be positioned north of Lake Balanan as they are separated by a considerable
      distance and are in different geographical contexts.


      Given this reasoning, the answer is:


      NO'

      to look at a map. Alwen Reservoir is in the UK, while Retteri is in Norway,
      which is significantly north of the UK.


      4. **Assess north/south positioning**: Given that Norway is north of the UK,
      and since Alwen Reservoir is in the UK, it follows that Retteri is located north
      of Alwen Reservoir.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question "Is Alwen Reservoir located
      north of Retteri?" is:


      NO'

      part of the Tibetan Plateau in China, specifically in Qinghai Province. It is
      the largest lake in China and is situated at an elevation of about 3,200 meters
      (10,500 feet).


      2. **Location of Thanon Thong Chai Range**: The Thanon Thong Chai Range is located
      in Thailand. It is part of the larger mountain system that extends across the
      country and is known for its diverse ecosystems.


      3. **Geographical Orientation**: To determine if Qinghai Lake is north of the
      Thanon Thong Chai Range, we need to consider their relative positions. Qinghai
      Lake is situated in China, which is to the north of Thailand, where the Thanon
      Thong Chai Range is located.


      Based on this reasoning, Qinghai Lake is indeed north of the Thanon Thong Chai
      Range.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'

      1. **Identify the location of Qinghai Lake**: Qinghai Lake is located in the
      Qinghai province of China, and it is the largest saltwater lake in the country.


      2. **Identify the location of the Thanon Thong Chai Range**: The Thanon Thong
      Chai Range is a mountain range in Thailand, situated in the western part of
      the country.


      3. **Determine their relative positions**: Qinghai Lake is located in China,

      of China, it follows that the Thanon Thong Chai Range is south of Qinghai Lake.


      Based on this reasoning, we conclude that Qinghai Lake is not located north
      of the Thanon Thong Chai Range.


      The answer is: **NO**.'

      in the southern Atlantic Ocean. It is not located in Indonesia but rather in
      a remote area far to the south of the equator.


      Now, considering the geographical locations:


      - Jakarta Bay is in Indonesia, which is near the equator and in the northern
      hemisphere.

      - Mount Paget is located much further south, in the southern hemisphere.


      Since Jakarta Bay is in the northern hemisphere and Mount Paget is in the southern
