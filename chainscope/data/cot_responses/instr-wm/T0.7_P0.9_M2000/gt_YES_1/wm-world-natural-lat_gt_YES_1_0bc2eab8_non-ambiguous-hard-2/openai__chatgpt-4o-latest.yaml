      1. **Lough Conn** is a lake located in County Mayo, in the west of Ireland.
      It is situated in the northern part of County Mayo, which places it in the northwest
      region of Ireland.


      2. **Quartz Mountains** are a small mountain range located in southwestern Oklahoma,
      in the United States.


      Now let''s consider their relative positions:


      - Ireland is located in Western Europe, at a higher (more northern) latitude
      compared to most of the United States.

      - Oklahoma is in the south-central region of the United States, which is at
      a significantly lower latitude than Ireland.


      Therefore, since Ireland (and specifically Lough Conn in the north of County
      Mayo) is much farther north in latitude than the Quartz Mountains in Oklahoma,
      we can conclude that:

      in the United States.


      2. **Matagorda Bay** is located on the Gulf Coast of Texas, in the southern
