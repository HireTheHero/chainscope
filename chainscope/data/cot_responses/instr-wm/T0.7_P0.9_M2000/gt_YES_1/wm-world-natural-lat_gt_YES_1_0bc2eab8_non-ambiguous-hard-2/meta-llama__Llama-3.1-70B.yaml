      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Khyargas
      Nuur and Safa and Marwa. Khyargas Nuur is a lake located in western Mongolia.
      Safa and Marwa are hills located in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.


      2. **Compare Geographic Positions**: Next, we compare their geographic positions.
      Khyargas Nuur is situated in the northern part of Mongolia, while Safa and Marwa
      are in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, which is in the Middle East.


      3. **Determine North-South Relationship**: Considering the vast difference in
      latitude between these two locations, with Khyargas Nuur being far to the north
      and Safa and Marwa being much farther to the south, we can conclude their north-south
      relationship.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Ogilvie
      Mountains and Newfoundland Mountains. Ogilvie Mountains are located in Yukon,
      Canada. Newfoundland Mountains are not a common or well-known mountain range,
      so we''ll need to dig deeper.


      2. **Research Newfoundland Mountains**: Since "Newfoundland Mountains" is not
      a commonly recognized mountain range, we need to investigate. One possible interpretation
      is that "Newfoundland Mountains" could refer to the Long Range Mountains in
      Newfoundland, Canada. This range is part of the Appalachian Mountains.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Now that we have identified Ogilvie Mountains in Yukon,
      Canada, and the Long Range Mountains in Newfoundland, Canada, we can compare
      their locations. The Ogilvie Mountains are in the western part of Canada, while
      the Long Range Mountains are in the eastern part of Canada.


      4. **Determine North-South Relationship**: To determine if Ogilvie Mountains
      are located north of Newfoundland Mountains, we need to consider their relative
      positions. The Ogilvie Mountains are indeed north of the Long Range Mountains
      (Newfoundland Mountains) due to their geographical locations.

      we need to compare their locations. Since both are in Bolivia and part of the
      Andes, we can focus on their positions within the country.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that both Paco and Cordillera Real are in Bolivia and
      part of the Andes, we need to consider their relative positions within the country.
      Paco is located in the Bolivian Altiplano, which is a high plateau region in
      the Andes. Cordillera Real is a mountain range that extends from the Altiplano
      to the northwest. Therefore, Paco is likely located north of Cordillera Real,
      as it''s situated in the Altiplano, which is generally north of the Cordillera
      Real mountain range.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Lake
      Afton and the Gulf of Thailand. Lake Afton is a lake in Kansas, USA, while the
      Gulf of Thailand is a body of water located in Southeast Asia.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to understand the geographic
      relationship between these two locations. The Gulf of Thailand is located in
      Southeast Asia, specifically between Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Kansas,
      where Lake Afton is situated, is a state in the central part of the United States.


      3. **Compare Latitudes**: To determine if one location is north of the other,
      we compare their latitudes. Kansas, being in the central United States, has
      a latitude that places it in the Northern Hemisphere. The Gulf of Thailand,
      being in Southeast Asia, also has a latitude that places it in the Northern
      Hemisphere.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that both Lake Afton (in Kansas, USA) and the Gulf
      of Thailand are in the Northern Hemisphere, we need to consider their relative
      positions within this hemisphere. Since the Gulf of Thailand is located in Southeast
      Asia, which is significantly farther south than Kansas, USA, we can conclude
      that Lake Afton is indeed north of the Gulf of Thailand.

      north of Asir Mountains, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Glarus
      Alps and Asir Mountains. Glarus Alps is a mountain range in Switzerland, while
      Asir Mountains are located in Saudi Arabia.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two locations. Switzerland is in Europe, and Saudi
      Arabia is in the Middle East, so we can assume that Glarus Alps is in the Northern
      Hemisphere and Asir Mountains are in the Southern Hemisphere.


      3. **Compare Latitudes**: To determine if one location is north of the other,
      we need to compare their latitudes. Since Glarus Alps is in Switzerland, which
      is in the Northern Hemisphere, it has a higher latitude than Asir Mountains,
      which are in Saudi Arabia, located in the Southern Hemisphere.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the above steps, we can conclude that Glarus Alps
      is indeed north of Asir Mountains.

    6ca51ca5-ac79-49fd-99dd-a74d1926dcaf: 'To determine whether Caha Mountains is
      located north of Lake Lyndon B. Johnson, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify Caha Mountains**: Caha Mountains is a mountain range located in
      Ireland. It is situated in the southwestern part of the country.


      2. **Identify Lake Lyndon B. Johnson**: Lake Lyndon B. Johnson is a reservoir
      in Texas, USA. It is located in the central part of the state.


      3. **Compare Geographic Locations**: Ireland and Texas are on different continents.
      Ireland is in Europe, while Texas is in North America. Therefore, the Caha Mountains
      and Lake Lyndon B. Johnson are located on different continents.


      4. **Determine North/South Relationship**: Since they are on different continents,
      the north-south relationship is not a straightforward comparison. However, we
      can still make a relative assessment.


      5. **Consider Proximity to the Equator**: Ireland, where the Caha Mountains
      are located, is closer to the equator than Texas, where Lake Lyndon B. Johnson
      is located. This means that the Caha Mountains are generally located further
      south than Lake Lyndon B. Johnson.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the proximity to the equator and their locations
      on different continents, we can conclude that Caha Mountains is located south
      of Lake Lyndon B. Johnson.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Lake
      Balaton and Mardi Himal. Lake Balaton is a lake in Hungary, Central Europe.
      Mardi Himal is a mountain peak located in the Annapurna region of Nepal.


      2. **Compare Geographic Positions**: Next, we compare their geographic positions.
      Lake Balaton is in Central Europe, specifically in Hungary, which is located
      in the northern part of the continent. Mardi Himal, on the other hand, is in
      the Himalayas in Nepal, which is in South Asia.


      3. **Determine North-South Relationship**: Given that Hungary (where Lake Balaton
      is) is in Central Europe and Nepal (where Mardi Himal is) is in South Asia,
      Hungary is significantly north of Nepal. Therefore, Lake Balaton is indeed north
      of Mardi Himal.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Lake Balaton is located north of
      Mardi Himal is: **YES**'
