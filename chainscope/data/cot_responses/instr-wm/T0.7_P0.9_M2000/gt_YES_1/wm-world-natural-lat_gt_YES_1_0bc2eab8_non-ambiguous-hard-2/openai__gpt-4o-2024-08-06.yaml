      1. **Gjende**: This is a lake in Norway, located in the Jotunheimen mountain
      range, specifically in the Innlandet county. It is known for its beautiful turquoise
      water and is a popular spot for hiking.


      2. **Lake Mountains**: This term is not widely recognized as a specific geographic
      location. If you are referring to a specific range or area known locally as
      "Lake Mountains," more context would be needed to identify it precisely. However,
      assuming it might be a general term, it could refer to a region with lakes and
      mountains, but this is not a specific, well-known location.

      one of the northernmost countries in the world, with much of it lying above
      the Arctic Circle.

      - The Yatsugatake Mountains, being in Japan, are located much further south
      compared to Greenland.


      Considering these geographical facts, Independence Fjord in Greenland is indeed
      located to the north of the Yatsugatake Mountains in Japan.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'

      2. **Guardafui Channel**: This is a channel located off the coast of Somalia,
      in the Horn of Africa, near the Cape Guardafui.


      Now, let''s consider their relative positions:


      - The Gulf of Patras is located in Greece, which is in Southern Europe.

      - The Guardafui Channel is located near the equator, off the northeastern coast
      of Africa.


      Since Greece (where the Gulf of Patras is located) is in Europe, it is north
      of the equator, while the Guardafui Channel is near the equator in Africa.


      Thus, the Gulf of Patras is indeed north of the Guardafui Channel.

      salt flat located in the northwest of Argentina, in the province of Salta.


      2. **Identify the location of the Ajay River:** The Ajay River is not a widely
      recognized geographical name, which suggests that it may not be a major river
      or could be a fictional or lesser-known river.


      3. **Compare the locations:** Without a clear identification or verification

      \ Leche**:\n   - Laguna de Leche is the largest natural freshwater lake in Cuba,\
      \ located in the northern part of the island.\n\n3. **Compare the latitudes**:\n\
      \   - Big Sandy Lake in Minnesota is approximately at a latitude of 46 degrees\
      \ North.\n   - Laguna de Leche in Cuba is approximately at a latitude of 22\
      \ degrees North.\n\nSince 46 degrees North is indeed north of 22 degrees North,\
      \ Big Sandy Lake in Minnesota is located north of Laguna de Leche in Cuba.\n\
      \nTherefore, the answer is: YES."
