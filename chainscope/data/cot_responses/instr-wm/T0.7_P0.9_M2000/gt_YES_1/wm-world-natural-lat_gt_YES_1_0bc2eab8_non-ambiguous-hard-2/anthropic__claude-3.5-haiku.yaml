      1. First, I''ll need to determine the locations of Mount Binuluan and Lake Sandoval.


      2. Mount Binuluan is located in the Philippines, specifically in the Cordillera
      region of Luzon.


      3. Lake Sandoval is located in Peru, specifically in the Tambopata National
      Reserve in the Amazon rainforest.


      4. These two locations are on different continents - Mount Binuluan is in Asia,
      while Lake Sandoval is in South America.


      5. Given their vast geographical separation, the concept of "north of" becomes
      meaningful only in a global context.


      6. Considering the global map, Mount Binuluan is indeed north of Lake Sandoval,
      as it is located in the Northern Hemisphere, while Lake Sandoval is in the Southern
      Hemisphere.

      Step 3: Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Castle Mountains is in North America

      Step 1: Castle Mountains is located in southwestern Montana, USA, near the border

      Step 2: Lake Balanan is actually located in the Philippines, specifically on
      Negros Island.

      - Castle Mountains is in North America

      - Lake Balanan is in Southeast Asia

      - These locations are on completely different continents, separated by the Pacific
      Ocean


      Therefore, the question of whether Castle Mountains is "north of" Lake Balanan
      doesn''t have a meaningful geographic comparison.


      However, the question requires a YES or NO answer. Since the locations are so
      far apart and on different continents, the most accurate answer is:


      NO'

    da6cfeb9-0c47-4621-ad09-bcea3242a395: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Chimborazo is a mountain located in Ecuador, which is in South America.


      2. Bogong High Plains are located in Australia, specifically in the state of
      Victoria.


      3. Ecuador is in the western part of South America, near the equator.


      4. Australia is located in the Southern Hemisphere, completely separate from
      South America.


      5. When comparing their geographical locations, Chimborazo is north of the equator,
      while Bogong High Plains are south of the equator.


      6. Therefore, Chimborazo is located north of the Bogong High Plains.
