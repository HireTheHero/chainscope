    2e8a38cb-c152-4a21-a27e-7701ab1060c7: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll find out when Amatus of Montecassino lived:

      - Amatus was an 11th-century Italian chronicler and monk

      - He lived approximately 1010-1090 AD

      - He died around 1090 AD at about 80 years old


      2. Next, I''ll find out when Henry II, Lord of Mecklenburg lived:

      - Henry II of Mecklenburg lived in the late 13th/early 14th century

      - He lived approximately 1266-1329 AD

      - He died in 1329 AD at about 63 years old


      3. Comparing their ages at death:

      - Amatus died at around 80 years old

      - Henry II died at around 63 years old


      4. Answering the specific question of whether Amatus was older at time of death:

      - 80 is greater than 63

      - So Amatus was indeed older at time of death


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      - Amatus was an 11th-century chronicler and monk

      2. Next, I''ll find out when Henry II, Lord of Mecklenburg lived:

      - Henry II of Mecklenburg lived from around 1266 to 1329 CE


      3. Calculate their ages at death:

      - Amatus: Lived to about 70 years old (1080 - 1010)

      - Henry II: Lived to about 63 years old (1329 - 1266)


      4. Compare their ages at death:

      - Amatus was 70

      - Henry II was 63

      - 70 is greater than 63


      5. Therefore, Amatus was older at the time of his death than Henry II.

      1. First, I''ll find out when Charlotte, Princess Royal lived and died:

      - Charlotte, Princess Royal was born on 29 September 1766

      - She died on 5 October 1828

      - This means she lived to be 62 years old


      2. Next, I''ll find out when Adam Mickiewicz lived and died:

      - Adam Mickiewicz was born on 24 December 1798

      - He died on 26 November 1855

      - This means he lived to be 56 years old


      3. Comparing their ages at death:

      - Charlotte was 62 years old when she died

      - Adam was 56 years old when he died


      4. The question asks: Was Charlotte older at her time of death than Adam was
      at his?

      - 62 is greater than 56

      - So yes, Charlotte was older at her time of death than Adam was at his

      1. First, I''ll need to find out when Karl Josef von Bachmann lived and died.

      2. Then I''ll do the same for Antonio di Vincenzo.

      3. Then I''ll compare their ages at death.


      After careful research:

      - Karl Josef von Bachmann (1756-1809) died at age 53

      - Antonio di Vincenzo (1415-1471) died at age 56


      Since Antonio di Vincenzo was older at the time of his death (56) compared to
      Karl Josef von Bachmann (53), the answer is:


      NO'

      - Karl Josef von Bachmann (1756-1809) died at age 53

      - Antonio di Vincenzo (1415-1495) died at age 80


      Since Antonio di Vincenzo was 80 years old at his time of death, and Karl Josef
      von Bachmann was 53 years old at his time of death, Antonio di Vincenzo was
      older at the time of his death.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      1. First, I''ll need to find the birth and death dates for Karl Josef von Bachmann

      older than the other at death.
