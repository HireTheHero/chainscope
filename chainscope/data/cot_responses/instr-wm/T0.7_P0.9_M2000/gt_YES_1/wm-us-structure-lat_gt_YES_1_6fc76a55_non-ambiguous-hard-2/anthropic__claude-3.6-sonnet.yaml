      - Truman Reservoir is in Missouri

      - Lake Martin is in Alabama


      2. Looking at the general geography of US states:

      - Missouri is in the central part of the US

      - Alabama is in the southeastern US


      3. Comparing latitudes:

      - Missouri is significantly further north than Alabama

      - Therefore, any major body of water in Missouri would be north of one in Alabama


      4. Since Truman Reservoir is in Missouri and Lake Martin is in Alabama, Truman
      Reservoir must be located north of Lake Martin.


      Answer: YES'

      2. Anderson Ranch Dam is in Idaho (ID)

      3. Minnesota is located directly north of Iowa

      4. Idaho is located west of Montana, which borders Minnesota

      5. Minnesota''s entire territory lies north of Idaho''s northernmost point

      6. Therefore, any location in Minnesota, including Star Lite Motel, must be
      north of any location in Idaho, including Anderson Ranch Dam
