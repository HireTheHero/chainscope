      York (NY) is located north of Smithville Lake in Missouri (MO), we need to compare
      their relative geographic positions. Here''s a step-by-step approach:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Rondout Reservoir is in New York, and Smithville
      Lake is in Missouri.

      2. **Consider the general geographic locations of NY and MO**: New York is in
      the northeastern United States, and Missouri is in the central part of the country.

      3. **Understand the relative latitudinal positions**: Generally, states in the
      northeastern part of the U.S. are located at higher latitudes than states in
      the central part. This means that New York is generally north of Missouri.

      4. **Specific locations within the states**: Rondout Reservoir and Smithville
      Lake are specific locations within their respective states. Without exact coordinates
      or a detailed map, it''s challenging to determine their precise positions relative
      to each other.

      5. **Research or prior knowledge**: If you have specific information about the
      locations of these reservoirs or lakes within their states, you could use that
      to determine their relative positions. However, without that information, we
      can only rely on general geographic knowledge.

      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic knowledge, New York is generally
      north of Missouri. Therefore, it''s likely that Rondout Reservoir in New York
      is located north of Smithville Lake in Missouri.


      The final answer is: **YES**'

      Barbara, California, which is in the southern part of the state, close to the
      Pacific Ocean.

      2. Red Bluff Reservoir is located in Texas, specifically in the western part

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Sterling Memorial Library is in Connecticut (CT),
      and Big Hill Lake is in Kansas (KS).


      2. **Understand the geography**: Connecticut is a state in the northeastern
      United States, while Kansas is in the central part of the country, more to the
      west.


      3. **Consider the general latitudinal positions of CT and KS**: Generally, Connecticut
      is located more to the east and slightly more to the north than Kansas. This
      is because the United States is oriented in such a way that the northern states
      are generally to the east of the southern states.


      4. **Specific locations within the states**: Without specific knowledge of the
      exact locations of Sterling Memorial Library and Big Hill Lake within their
      respective states, we can''t say for sure which one is north of the other. However,
      given that Connecticut is generally north of Kansas, it''s likely that Sterling
      Memorial Library is located north of Big Hill Lake.


      5. **Research or prior knowledge of the locations**: If we have specific knowledge
      about the exact locations of these two places, we can use that information to
      provide a more accurate answer.


      6. **Latitude comparison**: To definitively answer the question, we would need
      to compare the latitudes of the two locations. If the latitude of Sterling Memorial
      Library is higher (i.e., more north) than the latitude of Big Hill Lake, then
      the answer is YES. If the latitude of Big Hill Lake is higher, then the answer
      is NO.


      7. **Conclusion**: Based on the general knowledge of U.S. geography and the
      likely positions of these two locations, it''s reasonable to conclude that Sterling
      Memorial Library, CT, is located north of Big Hill Lake, KS.

      2. California is located in the western part of the country.


      Given these facts, we can conclude that Ohio is located north of California.
      Therefore, Shrine Church of St. Stanislaus in Ohio is located north of Lexington
      Reservoir in California.


      So, the answer to the question is: YES

      2. **Lexington Reservoir**: This reservoir is located in the Santa Cruz Mountains,
      near Los Gatos, California, in the United States.


      Now, we need to determine if Cleveland, Ohio, is located north of the Santa
      Cruz Mountains, California.


      - Ohio is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States.

      - California is a state in the western region of the United States.


      Given the geographic positions of Ohio and California, it is clear that Ohio
      is located east of California. However, when considering the north-south direction,
      Ohio is not necessarily north of California. In fact, parts of California are
      located north of Ohio.


      Based on the information provided, we can''t definitively say whether the Shrine
      Church of St. Stanislaus in Cleveland, Ohio, is located north of Lexington Reservoir

      \ in Ohio (OH), in the Midwestern region of the United States.\n   - Lexington\
      \ Reservoir is located in California (CA), on the West Coast of the United States.\n\
      \n2. **Understand the geography**: Ohio is located in the Midwest, while California\

      1. **Identify the locations**: Buckhorn Lake is located in Kentucky, and the
      Binoculars Building is in California.


      2. **Understand the relative positions of Kentucky and California**: Kentucky
      is located in the eastern part of the United States, while California is on
      the west coast. Therefore, Kentucky is generally east of California.


      3. **Consider the north-south axis**: Since Kentucky is east of California,
