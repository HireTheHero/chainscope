      \ north of the St. George Theatre in New York, NY.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the\
      \ Locations\n\nFirst, we need to know the exact locations of both theaters.\n\
      \n- **Pantages Theatre (Minneapolis, MN):** This theater is located in downtown\
      \ Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n  \n- **St. George Theatre (New York, NY):** This\
      \ theater is situated in the St. George neighborhood of Staten Island, New York\
      \ City.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Geographic Coordinates\n\nTo determine\
      \ which location is further north, we'll look at their latitudes.\n\n- **Minneapolis,\
      \ MN:** The approximate latitude is around 44.9778\xB0 N.\n  \n- **Staten Island,\
      \ NY (St. George Theatre):** The approximate latitude is around 40.6431\xB0\
      \ N.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Latitudes\n\nLatitude measures how far north\
      \ or south a location is from the equator. The higher the latitude, the further\
      \ north the location.\n\n- **Minneapolis, MN:** 44.9778\xB0 N\n- **Staten Island,\
      \ NY:** 40.6431\xB0 N\n\nSince 44.9778\xB0 N is greater than 40.6431\xB0 N,\
      \ Minneapolis is further north than Staten Island.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\
      \nGiven that the Pantages Theatre in Minneapolis, MN, is located at a higher\
      \ latitude than the St. George Theatre in Staten Island, NY, it is indeed located\
      \ further north.\n\n**Final Answer:** YES, Pantages Theatre (Minneapolis), MN\

      \ let's clarify the two locations in question:\n\n1. **Lake Rescue, Vermont\
      \ (VT):** I need to find where Lake Rescue is in Vermont. Vermont is a state\
      \ in the northeastern United States.\n\n2. **Basilica of the Sacred Hearts of\
