      within the state of Massachusetts (MA). While Bunch-of-Grapes isn''t a town,
      it famously refers to a historical tavern site in Boston, MA.

      2.  **Identify Location 2:** Navajo Lake, NM. This refers to a large reservoir
      located primarily in northwestern New Mexico (NM), extending slightly into southern
      Colorado.

      Massachusetts (MA) and New Mexico (NM).

      4.  **Determine Relative Latitude:** Massachusetts is located in the Northeastern
      United States. New Mexico is located in the Southwestern United States. Geographically,
      the entire state of Massachusetts lies significantly north of the entire state
      of New Mexico in terms of latitude.
