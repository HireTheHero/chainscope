      is the north/south measurement. While parts of California might be at a similar
      latitude to Ohio, the bulk of the state is significantly west.

      4. **North of?:** The question asks if the Ohio location is *north* of the California
      one.


      Since Ohio is east of California and the question is about a north/south relationship,
      the general location of the states is enough information.  The specific latitude
      of each structure isn''t critical.
