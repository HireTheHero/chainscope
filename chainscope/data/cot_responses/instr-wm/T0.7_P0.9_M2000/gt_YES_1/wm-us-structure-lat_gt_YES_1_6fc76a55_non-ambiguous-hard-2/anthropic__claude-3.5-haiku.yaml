      - It is in the western part of Montana, close to Yellowstone National Park


      2. Next, I''ll locate Washington Avenue Immigration Station, PA:

      - This station is located in Pennsylvania

      - Pennsylvania is an eastern state


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Montana is a western state

      - Pennsylvania is an eastern state

      - Montana is geographically north of Pennsylvania


      4. So, is Hebgen Lake specifically north of the Washington Avenue Immigration
      Station?

      - Since the entire state of Montana is north of Pennsylvania, Hebgen Lake (which
      is in western Montana) would also be north of the Pennsylvania location


      5. Therefore, the answer is: YES.


      The answer is YES.'

      1. First, I''ll locate Rondout Reservoir in New York

      - This reservoir is located in Ulster County, New York

      - It is in the southeastern part of New York state


      2. Next, I''ll locate Smithville Lake in Missouri

      - This lake is located in Clay County, Missouri

      3. Compare their geographical locations

      - New York is east of Missouri

      - Southeastern New York is further east than northwestern Missouri

      - This means Rondout Reservoir is geographically east of Smithville Lake


      4. Consider the question of "north"

      - Southeastern New York is actually south of northwestern Missouri

      - So Rondout Reservoir is NOT north of Smithville Lake

    c8b17e21-79cc-486d-b76d-5e213b8c3eec: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Locate Astor Theatre in New York City:

      - New York City is in New York state, in the northeastern United States

      - Specifically located in Manhattan


      2. Locate Cathedral of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus in Knoxville:

      - Knoxville is in Tennessee, in the southeastern United States


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - New York (where the Astor Theatre is) is north of Tennessee (where the Cathedral
      is located)

      - Manhattan is significantly north of Knoxville


      4. Therefore, the Astor Theatre is definitely located north of the Cathedral

    3621b93d-6221-4c33-912d-517e7b0ba5ac: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Locate Scituate Reservoir, Rhode Island:

      - This is in the state of Rhode Island, in the northeastern United States

      - Rhode Island is in the northeastern part of the country


      2. Locate Guardian Angel Cathedral, Nevada:

      - This is in Las Vegas, Nevada

      - Nevada is in the western United States


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Rhode Island is in the northeast

      - Nevada is in the west/southwest

      - Rhode Island is significantly north of Nevada


      4. Determine relative north/south positioning:

      - Since Rhode Island is in the northeastern part of the country and Nevada is
      in the southwestern part, Scituate Reservoir is definitely north of Guardian
      Angel Cathedral


      5. Final reasoning:

      - North of means located at a higher latitude

      - Scituate Reservoir is at a higher latitude than Guardian Angel Cathedral


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

    a8b91c00-d761-4bf1-9f10-3d1c11e419a1: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. South Holston Lake is located in Tennessee, which is in the eastern part
      of the United States.


      2. Balboa Theatre is located in San Diego, California, which is in the western
      part of the United States.

    904797d1-22b6-4aae-8423-aec23583dcb1: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Star Lite Motel, MN (Minnesota)

      2. Then, I''ll locate Anderson Ranch Dam, ID (Idaho)

      3. Then I''ll compare their geographic positions


      Step 1: Star Lite Motel is in Minnesota, which is in the upper Midwestern United
      States, generally in the northern part of the country.


      Step 2: Anderson Ranch Dam is located in Idaho, which is in the western United
      States, specifically in southwestern Idaho.


      Step 3: Comparing their latitudes:

      - Minnesota is at a higher latitude (further north) than Idaho

      - So a location in Minnesota would generally be north of a location in Idaho


      Therefore, Star Lite Motel, MN is indeed located north of Anderson Ranch Dam,
      ID.

      1. First, I''ll locate Star Lite Motel in Minnesota

      2. Then, I''ll locate Anderson Ranch Dam in Idaho

      3. Then I''ll determine their relative geographic positions


      Step 1: Star Lite Motel location

      - Star Lite Motel is in Minnesota (MN)

      - Minnesota is in the upper Midwestern United States


      Step 2: Anderson Ranch Dam location

      - Anderson Ranch Dam is in Idaho (ID)

      - Specifically, it''s in Owyhee County in southwestern Idaho


      Step 3: Geographic comparison

      - Minnesota is located in the northeastern part of the United States

      - Idaho is located in the northwestern part of the United States

      - Minnesota is geographically NORTH of Idaho


      Therefore, the Star Lite Motel in Minnesota is NORTH of Anderson Ranch Dam in
      Idaho.

      Step 1: Star Lite Motel location

      - Star Lite Motel appears to be in Minnesota

      - Minnesota is located in the upper Midwestern United States

      - Minnesota is east of Idaho

      - Minnesota is generally at a more northerly latitude than Idaho

      1. First, I''ll locate Lake Del Valle, CA:

      - Lake Del Valle is in Alameda County, California

      - It is located in the San Francisco Bay Area region of Northern California


      2. Next, I''ll locate Nimrod Lake, AR:

      - Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas

      - Arkansas is located in the southern part of the United States


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - California is west of Arkansas

      - Northern California is even further north geographically

      - Arkansas is in the southern part of the US


      4. Reasoning about their relative north-south position:

      - Lake Del Valle is definitely north of Nimrod Lake

      - The latitude of Lake Del Valle is significantly higher than the latitude of
