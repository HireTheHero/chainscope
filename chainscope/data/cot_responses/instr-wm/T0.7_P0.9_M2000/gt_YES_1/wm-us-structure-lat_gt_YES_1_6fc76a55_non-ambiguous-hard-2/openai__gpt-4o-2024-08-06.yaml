      the town of West Yellowstone. Montana is in the northern part of the United
      States.


      2. **Washington Avenue Immigration Station, PA**: This historical site is located
      in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which is in the northeastern part of the United
      States.


      3. **Relative Latitude Comparison**: Montana is generally further north compared
      to Pennsylvania. Specifically, Hebgen Lake, being in southwestern Montana, is
      indeed situated at a higher latitude than Philadelphia, PA.


      Based on the above reasoning, Hebgen Lake, MT is located north of Washington
      Avenue Immigration Station, PA.

      the relative locations of Barker Meadow Reservoir in Colorado and Lake Arrowhead
      Reservoir in California.


      1. **Identify the location of Barker Meadow Reservoir, CO:** Barker Meadow Reservoir
      is located near Nederland, Colorado, which is in Boulder County. Colorado is
      generally situated in the central western part of the United States.


      2. **Identify the location of Lake Arrowhead Reservoir, CA:** Lake Arrowhead
      Reservoir is located in the San Bernardino Mountains of San Bernardino County,
      California. California is situated on the west coast of the United States.


      3. **Determine the relative positions:** Colorado is located to the east and
      slightly north of California. Specifically, Barker Meadow Reservoir, being in
      Boulder County, is situated at a higher latitude than Lake Arrowhead Reservoir
      in San Bernardino County, California.

      \ Center is located, is approximately 40.6\xB0 N.\n\nSince 45.3\xB0 N (Big Stone\
      \ Lake) is greater than 40.6\xB0 N (Brooklyn, NY), Big Stone Lake is indeed\
      \ north of the Christian Cultural Center.\n\nTherefore, the answer is YES."
