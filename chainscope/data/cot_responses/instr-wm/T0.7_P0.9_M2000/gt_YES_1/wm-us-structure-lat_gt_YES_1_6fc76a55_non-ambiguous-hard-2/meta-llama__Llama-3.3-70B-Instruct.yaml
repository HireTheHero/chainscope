    ecc855ba-668b-49cd-aba0-bd468c1134f2: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of Whitney Peak Hotel in Nevada (NV) and Green River Lake in Kentucky
      (KY) and then compare their positions relative to each other.


      1. **Identify the location of Whitney Peak Hotel**: Whitney Peak Hotel is located
      in Reno, Nevada. Reno is in the northwestern part of Nevada.


      2. **Identify the location of Green River Lake**: Green River Lake is located
      in Kentucky. Specifically, it is in the central part of the state.


      3. **Compare the general geographic locations of Nevada and Kentucky**: Nevada
      is a western state, while Kentucky is in the eastern United States.


      4. **Determine the north-south positioning**: To determine if one location is
      north of the other, we need to consider their latitudes. Generally, Nevada is
      at a higher latitude than Kentucky, meaning it is more to the north.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Nevada (where Whitney Peak Hotel is located) is
      generally north of Kentucky (where Green River Lake is located), and without
      needing the exact latitudes, we can infer that Whitney Peak Hotel in Nevada
      is indeed north of Green River Lake in Kentucky.

      \ is generally north of Missouri, but the specific locations within these states\
      \ can vary.\n\n5. **Lake Wappapello's Location**: Lake Wappapello is in the\
      \ southeastern part of Missouri. This means it is relatively south within the\
      \ state of Missouri.\n\n6. **Nichols Hall's Possible Location**: Without the\
      \ exact location of Nichols Hall in Kansas, we consider Kansas as a whole. Kansas\
      \ is north of Missouri, but the distance between the northernmost part of Kansas\
      \ and the southernmost part of Missouri can vary.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Given\
      \ that Kansas is generally north of Missouri and considering that Lake Wappapello\

      \ Lake Wappapello within Missouri.\n\nGiven these considerations, the answer\
      \ to whether Nichols Hall, KS, is located north of Lake Wappapello, MO, would\
      \ likely be **YES**, based on the general north-south relationship between Kansas\
      \ and Missouri, and considering Lake Wappapello's location in southeastern Missouri.\

    6e37af0f-5b72-4651-a5e7-09defd83aa60: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations mentioned
      - Nichols Hall, KS, and Lake Wappapello, MO. Nichols Hall is likely a building
      or structure, but without specific context, we can infer it''s in Kansas. Lake
      Wappapello is a lake in Missouri.


      2. **Geographical Context**: To determine if Nichols Hall, KS, is north of Lake
      Wappapello, MO, we need to understand the geographical relationship between
      Kansas and Missouri, specifically in relation to these two points.


      3. **Kansas and Missouri Geography**: Kansas is located west of Missouri. Lake
      Wappapello is in southeastern Missouri. Given that Kansas is to the west of
      Missouri, any point in Kansas would generally be west of any point in Missouri,
      but the question of north or south depends on the specific locations.


      4. **Specific Locations**: Without exact coordinates or a detailed map, we can
      consider general geographical knowledge. Lake Wappapello is in southeastern
      Missouri, which places it relatively south in the state. Kansas, being to the
      west, has parts that are both north and south of southeastern Missouri, depending
      on how far north or south in Kansas you are.


      5. **Nichols Hall, KS**: To give a definitive answer, we need to know where
      Nichols Hall is in Kansas. If it''s in southern Kansas, it might be south of
      Lake Wappapello. If it''s in northern Kansas, it could be north of Lake Wappapello.


      6. **Conclusion**: Without the exact location of Nichols Hall within Kansas,
      we cannot definitively say if it is north or south of Lake Wappapello, MO. However,
      considering the general geography and assuming Nichols Hall could be anywhere
      in Kansas, there''s a possibility it could be north of Lake Wappapello if it''s
      located in the northern parts of Kansas.


      Given the information and the process, the most accurate answer based on the
      steps provided and without specific details on Nichols Hall''s location within
      Kansas would lean towards a possibility rather than a definitive geographical
      fact. However, since the question requires a YES or NO answer and considering
      the possibility that Nichols Hall could indeed be in a part of Kansas that is
      north of Lake Wappapello, MO, the answer would be:


      YES'

      Hall, KS, and Lake Wappapello, MO. Nichols Hall is likely a building or structure,
      but without specific context, it''s hard to pinpoint its exact nature. However,
      given it''s in Kansas (KS), we can start to understand its general location.
      Lake Wappapello is a lake in Missouri (MO).


      2. **Understand Geographic Relationships**: Next, understand the geographic
      relationship between Kansas and Missouri. Kansas is located west of Missouri.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Nichols Hall, without more context, is assumed to
      be in the state of Kansas. Lake Wappapello is in southeastern Missouri.


      4. **North-South Relationship**: To determine if Nichols Hall, KS, is north
      of Lake Wappapello, MO, we need to consider the general north-south positioning
      of these locations. Kansas spans a significant north-south distance, but its
      southern parts are generally at the same latitude or slightly south of Missouri''s
      southern parts.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Kansas is west of Missouri and considering the
      latitudes, parts of southern Kansas could be at a similar latitude to southern
      Missouri, where Lake Wappapello is located. However, without the exact latitude
      and longitude of Nichols Hall, we can''t definitively conclude its north-south
      relationship to Lake Wappapello solely based on state locations. But, generally
      speaking, southern Kansas (where Nichols Hall might be, assuming it''s in the
      southern part of the state) could be at a similar latitude or slightly south
      of Lake Wappapello''s location in southeastern Missouri.


      However, since I need to provide a YES or NO answer and considering the steps
      and the lack of precise information about Nichols Hall''s location within Kansas,
      I must make an educated guess based on typical geographic knowledge:


      Given the general information and assuming Nichols Hall could be in the southern
      part of Kansas, it''s plausible that it could be south of Lake Wappapello, MO,

      geography.

      locations of both structures.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Charles Playhouse is located in Massachusetts
      (MA), and Rancho Petaluma Adobe is located in California (CA).


      2. **Determine the general geographic positions of the states**: Massachusetts
      is on the East Coast in the northeastern part of the United States, while California
      is on the West Coast in the southwestern part.


      3. **Consider the latitudes**: Generally, as you move north in the United States,
      the latitude increases. Massachusetts is at a higher latitude than California
      because it is located farther north.


      Given these steps, since Massachusetts is north of California in terms of latitude,
      any location in Massachusetts, including Charles Playhouse, would be north of
      any location in California, including Rancho Petaluma Adobe.

      their positions.


      1. **O''Reilly Theater Location**: The O''Reilly Theater is located in Pittsburgh,
      Pennsylvania. Pittsburgh is a city in the western part of Pennsylvania, in the
      northeastern United States.


      2. **Lake Yosemite Location**: Lake Yosemite is located in Merced County, California.
      It is near the city of Merced, which is in the central valley of California,
      in the western United States.


      3. **Comparing Locations**: Pennsylvania, where the O''Reilly Theater is, is
      generally east of California, where Lake Yosemite is. Considering the map of
      the United States, Pennsylvania is also north of the southern parts of California
      but is generally at a similar latitude or slightly north of the central part

      - Pennsylvania (O''Reilly Theater) is east and slightly north or at a similar
      latitude compared to central California (Lake Yosemite).

      - The question asks if the O''Reilly Theater is located north of Lake Yosemite.


      Based on this comparison, since both locations are roughly at the same latitude
      or Pennsylvania might be slightly north, but definitely east of California,
      the answer to whether O''Reilly Theater is north of Lake Yosemite is not straightforward
      without exact latitude comparisons. However, given typical understandings of
      U.S. geography, Pennsylvania is not significantly north of central California;
      it''s more eastward. But, considering Lake Yosemite is in the central valley
      of California and Pennsylvania is indeed north of the southernmost parts of
      the U.S., and given the specific geography, Pennsylvania (where the O''Reilly

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We have two locations to consider - Our Lady
      of Sorrows Church in Santa Barbara, California, and Red Bluff Reservoir in Texas.


      2. **Determine the states**: Our Lady of Sorrows Church is in California (CA),
      and Red Bluff Reservoir is in Texas (TX). These are two different states.


      3. **Consider geographical positions**: California is located on the West Coast
      of the United States, while Texas is in the South-Central part of the country.


      4. **Analyze the question**: The question asks if Our Lady of Sorrows Church
      (in California) is located north of Red Bluff Reservoir (in Texas).


      5. **Geographical comparison**: Given that Texas is generally southeast of California,
      and considering the vast distance between these two locations, it''s unlikely
      that a location in California would be directly north of a location in Texas,
      as their positions are more east-west relative to each other rather than north-south.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations of California and Texas,
      and without needing the exact latitudes, it''s reasonable to conclude that Our
      Lady of Sorrows Church in California is not north of Red Bluff Reservoir in
      Texas, simply because California and Texas are not aligned in a straightforward
      north-south manner on the US map.

      to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Sterling Memorial Library is in Connecticut,
      and Big Hill Lake is in Kansas.

      2. **Understand geographic locations**: Connecticut is in the northeastern United
      States, while Kansas is in the central part of the country.

      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Generally, the farther north a location is, the
      higher its latitude. We need to compare the latitudes of Connecticut and Kansas
      to determine their relative north-south positions.

      4. **Consider state positions**: Connecticut is one of the northern states in
      the U.S., bordering the Canadian province of Quebec to the north (though not
      directly, as there are other states and Canadian provinces in between). Kansas,
      while not southern, is more centrally located and is south of many states, including
      those in the Northeast like Connecticut.

      5. **Conclusion based on general geography**: Since Connecticut is in the Northeast
      and Kansas is more central, structures in Connecticut, like the Sterling Memorial
      Library, are generally north of locations in Kansas, such as Big Hill Lake.


      Therefore, based on the geographic positions of Connecticut and Kansas, the

      the geographical locations of Oxbow Dam, OR, and the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer
      in Manhattan, NY, and then compare their positions.


      1. **Location of Oxbow Dam, OR**: Oxbow Dam is located in Oregon, which is in
      the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. This places it in the western
      part of the country.


      2. **Location of Church of St. Vincent Ferrer (Manhattan), NY**: The Church
      of St. Vincent Ferrer is located in Manhattan, New York City, New York. This
      places it on the East Coast of the United States.


      3. **Comparing Locations**: Oregon is generally considered to be west and somewhat
      north of New York when looking at a map of the United States. Manhattan, being
      on the East Coast, is relatively southeast of Oregon.


      Given these geographical positions:

      - Oxbow Dam, OR is in the western United States.

      - Church of St. Vincent Ferrer is in the eastern United States, specifically
      in New York City.


      Since Oregon is generally north and west of New York, Oxbow Dam in Oregon is
      indeed north of the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer in Manhattan, NY.

      3. **Determine North-South Relationship**: Since Ohio is east and California
      is west, we must determine if Ohio (or more specifically, the Shrine Church
      of St. Stanislaus in Ohio) is north or south of California. Generally, the northern
      parts of the United States are closer to Canada, and the southern parts are
      closer to Mexico.


      4. **Lexington Reservoir''s Location**: Lexington Reservoir is in California.
      California spans a significant portion of the western United States, with parts
      of it being north and south of other states. However, California''s northernmost
      point is still south of many parts of the northern United States.


      5. **Conclusion**: Considering Ohio''s location in the eastern United States
      and its position relative to the northern parts of the country, and given that
      California is on the west coast with its northern parts still generally south
      of the northernmost U.S. states, it''s reasonable to conclude that Ohio (where
      the Shrine Church of St. Stanislaus is located) is north of California (where
      Lexington Reservoir is located).


      Given these steps, the answer to whether the Shrine Church of St. Stanislaus,
      OH is located north of Lexington Reservoir, CA is: **YES**'

      in Houston, Texas (TX), and West County Energy Center is in Florida (FL).


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we need to understand the geographic
      positions of Texas and Florida relative to each other. Texas is located in the
      southwestern part of the United States, while Florida is in the southeastern
      part.


      3. **Consider North-South Alignment**: Since we''re comparing the positions
      of these two locations in terms of north and south, we need to consider their
      latitudes. Generally, Texas is west and slightly north of Florida, but this
      can vary greatly depending on the specific locations within each state.


      4. **Specific Locations**: Miller Outdoor Theatre in Houston, TX, and West County

      process step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: The Allen Theatre is in Ohio, and the New Exchequer
      Dam is in California.


      2. **Understand geographic positions**: Ohio is generally considered to be in
      the eastern part of the United States, while California is on the west coast.


      3. **Compare latitudes**: To determine if one location is north of another,
      we need to compare their latitudes. Without exact coordinates, we can use general
      knowledge about the states'' positions. Ohio is typically at a higher latitude

      \ Relationship**: To determine if Lake Alan Henry is north of Corpus Christi\
      \ Cathedral, we need to understand the general geography of Texas. Corpus Christi\
      \ is in the southern part of Texas, near the Gulf of Mexico. Lake Alan Henry,\
      \ being in Garza County, is more centrally located but still in the western\
      \ part of Texas.\n\n4. **Compare the Latitudes**: The next step is to compare\
      \ the latitudes of the two locations. Latitude measures how far north or south\
      \ a place is from the equator. If Lake Alan Henry has a higher latitude than\
      \ Corpus Christi Cathedral, it would be north of it.\n\nGiven these steps, without\
      \ specific latitude and longitude coordinates provided in the question, we can\
      \ use general knowledge of Texas geography:\n- Corpus Christi is known to be\
      \ a southern coastal city.\n- Lake Alan Henry is landlocked and more centrally\
      \ located but towards the west of Texas.\n\nHowever, \"north\" in this context\
      \ requires considering the state's layout. Corpus Christi's location near the\
      \ Gulf of Mexico places it in the southern part of the state. Lake Alan Henry,\
      \ being in a more central but western part of Texas, could potentially be north\
      \ or south depending on the exact latitudes, but given Corpus Christi's position,\
      \ it's reasonable to consider that many parts of Texas could be considered \"\
      north\" of it, depending on their latitude.\n\nTo give a precise answer without\
      \ exact coordinates, we rely on the general knowledge that Corpus Christi is\
      \ one of the southernmost major cities in Texas, and Lake Alan Henry, not being\
      \ on the coast and more inland, might indeed be north but let's consider the\
      \ actual geographic positions:\n\n- Corpus Christi, TX is approximately at 27.8\xB0\
      N latitude.\n- Lake Alan Henry, TX, being in Garza County, would be at a higher\
      \ latitude than Corpus Christi, given its more central location in Texas.\n\n\
      Considering these geographic positions, Lake Alan Henry would indeed be north\
      \ of Corpus Christi Cathedral in Corpus Christi, Texas.\n\nThe final answer\
      \ is: $\\boxed{YES}$"

      1. **Identify the locations**: Lake Steilacoom is located in the state of Washington
      (WA), and Royal Oak Music Theatre is in the state of Michigan (MI).


      2. **Understand the geographical context**: Washington state is on the west
      coast of the United States, while Michigan is in the Great Lakes region, more
      towards the eastern part of the northern United States.


      3. **Determine the general north-south orientation**: Michigan is generally
      east and slightly south of Washington state, considering the overall geography
      of the United States.


      4. **Consider specific locations**: Without exact coordinates, we can still
      reason that since Washington state is on the west coast and Michigan is near
      the Great Lakes, for a location in Washington to be north of a location in Michigan,
      it would generally follow the overall north-south alignment of the U.S. given
      the states'' positions.


      5. **Make a comparison**: Knowing that Lake Steilacoom, WA, is on the west coast
      and Royal Oak Music Theatre, MI, is in the eastern part of the northern U.S.,
      and considering the general layout of the U.S., Lake Steilacoom would be west
      and possibly at a similar latitude or slightly north due to Washington''s northern
      position compared to the rest of the continental U.S.


      Given these considerations, the answer to whether Lake Steilacoom, WA, is located

    70a8a6db-a533-40c4-83b8-c350ac15c5cd: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Brookville
      Lake Dam, IN, and O''Neill Forebay, CA. Brookville Lake Dam is located in Indiana,
      and O''Neill Forebay is in California.


      2. **Understand Geographic Terms**: Knowing that "IN" stands for Indiana and
      "CA" stands for California helps. Indiana is in the eastern United States, and
      California is on the west coast.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Generally, the eastern United States (where Indiana
      is located) is east of the western United States (where California is located).
      However, the question asks about north-south positioning, not east-west.


      4. **Consider Latitude**: To determine if one location is north of another,
      we need to consider their latitudes. Without exact coordinates, we know that
      Indiana is generally at a higher latitude (further north) than California.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on general geographic knowledge, Indiana (where Brookville
      Lake Dam is located) is indeed north of California (where O''Neill Forebay is
      located).


      So, considering these steps, the answer to whether Brookville Lake Dam, IN,
      is located north of O''Neill Forebay, CA, is: **YES**.'
