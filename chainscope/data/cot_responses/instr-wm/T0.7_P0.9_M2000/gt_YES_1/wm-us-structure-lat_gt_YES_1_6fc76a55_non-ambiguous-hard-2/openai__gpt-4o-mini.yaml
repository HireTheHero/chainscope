      1. **Charles Playhouse**: This is located in Boston, Massachusetts.

      2. **Rancho Petaluma Adobe**: This historic site is located in Petaluma, California.


      Next, we need to establish their relative positions:


      - **Massachusetts** is located to the northeast of California on the map.

      - Specifically, Boston (where Charles Playhouse is located) is situated in the
      eastern part of Massachusetts.

      - Petaluma is located in the northern part of California.


      Now, we can visualize the locations:


      - If we draw a line from Boston to Petaluma, we see that Boston is considerably
      further north than Petaluma, given that Massachusetts is further north than
      California as a whole.

      1. **Location of Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP)**: WIPP is situated near

      4. **North-South Positioning**: Since WIPP is in New Mexico and Sunrise Musical
      Theater is in Florida, WIPP cannot be north of Sunrise Musical Theater because
      it is further west and not further north.
