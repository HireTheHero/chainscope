      to answer the question:


      1.  **Identify the two locations:** The question asks about the relative locations
      of "Church of St. Joseph (Bronxville, New York), NY" and "Robert S. Kerr Reservoir,
      OK".


      2.  **Determine the state and general location of the first place:** Church
      of St. Joseph is in Bronxville, New York. New York State is a northeastern state
      in the US.


      3.  **Determine the state and general location of the second place:** Robert
      S. Kerr Reservoir is in Oklahoma. Oklahoma is a south-central state in the US.


      4.  **Compare the general locations of the states:** New York is significantly
      further north than Oklahoma.


      5.  **Infer the relative positions of the specific locations:** Since Bronxville,
      NY is in a northern state and Robert S. Kerr Reservoir, OK is in a southern
      state (relative to New York), the location in New York must be further north
      than the location in Oklahoma.


      6.  **Formulate the answer based on the comparison:** Church of St. Joseph (Bronxville,
      New York), NY is located north of Robert S. Kerr Reservoir, OK.


      7.  **Final check:** Does the conclusion directly answer the YES/NO question?
      Yes. Is the conclusion supported by the reasoning? Yes.


      8.  **State the final YES/NO answer.**


      The final answer is $\boxed{YES}$.'

      to find the locations of "Bunch-of-Grapes, MA" and "Navajo Lake, NM".

      2.  **Determine if "Bunch-of-Grapes, MA" is a real place:** Searching for "Bunch-of-Grapes,
      MA" suggests it''s likely a historical tavern in Boston, Massachusetts, not
      a town or geographical feature that can be located on a map relative to another
      place like a lake.

      3.  **Determine if "Navajo Lake, NM" is a real place:** Navajo Lake, New Mexico
      is a real and well-known reservoir located primarily in San Juan County, NM.

      4.  **Compare locations:** Since "Bunch-of-Grapes, MA" is not a fixed geographical
      location (it''s likely a historical building or name within Boston), it cannot
      be geographically compared to Navajo Lake, NM in terms of North/South position.
      The question presumes Bunch-of-Grapes, MA is a place that *can* be located geographically
      like a town or natural feature.


      Based on the premise that "Bunch-of-Grapes, MA" is not a standard geographical
      location like a town or lake, the question cannot be answered with a simple
      geographic comparison. However, if we interpret the question as asking if *the
      general area* of Massachusetts is north of *the general area* of New Mexico
      where Navajo Lake is located, then Massachusetts is significantly north of New
      Mexico. But the question asks about a specific (albeit non-existent as a geographical
      place) location.


      Since the premise of locating "Bunch-of-Grapes, MA" as a geographical point
      is flawed, the question cannot be definitively answered in a geographic sense.
      A YES/NO answer requires both locations to be locatable points on a map.


      Therefore, the question is based on a false premise for one of the locations.
      However, if we strictly interpret the question as "Can a point named Bunch-of-Grapes
      *in* Massachusetts be considered north of Navajo Lake, New Mexico?", then any
      point in Massachusetts is indeed north of Navajo Lake, NM.


      Let''s assume the question intends to refer to the general location of Massachusetts
      relative to Navajo Lake, NM.


      5.  **Locate Massachusetts:** Massachusetts is in the Northeastern United States.

      6.  **Locate Navajo Lake, NM:** Navajo Lake is in the northwestern corner of
      New Mexico.

      7.  **Compare latitudes:** Massachusetts (e.g., Boston is around 42.3 degrees
      N) is at a significantly higher latitude than Navajo Lake, NM (around 36.8 degrees
      N). Higher latitude means further north.


      Therefore, Massachusetts is geographically north of Navajo Lake, NM. If "Bunch-of-Grapes,
      MA" refers to a location within Massachusetts, then that location is north of
      Navajo Lake, NM.


      Let''s re-evaluate based on the most likely interpretation given the wording:
      Is a place *called* Bunch-of-Grapes *in* Massachusetts located north of Navajo
      Lake, NM?


      Yes, any point in Massachusetts is geographically north of Navajo Lake, NM.

      asks about "Bunch-of-Grapes, MA" and "Navajo Lake, NM".

      2.  **Locate Bunch-of-Grapes, MA:** Research indicates that "Bunch-of-Grapes,
      MA" is not a recognized place name or structure in Massachusetts. There was
      a tavern called the Bunch of Grapes Tavern in Boston, but it no longer exists
      as a physical structure (though a modern restaurant uses the name). Assuming
      the question refers to the Boston area or the historical tavern''s location.

      3.  **Locate Navajo Lake, NM:** Research indicates that Navajo Lake is a real
      place, a reservoir in northern New Mexico, primarily in San Juan and Rio Arriba
      counties.

      4.  **Determine the latitude of Boston/Massachusetts:** Boston, MA is located
      at approximately 42.3 degrees North latitude. Massachusetts is generally between
      41 and 42.5 degrees North.

      5.  **Determine the latitude of Navajo Lake, NM:** Navajo Lake, NM is located
      at approximately 36.8 degrees North latitude.

      6.  **Compare the latitudes:** 42.3 degrees North (Boston/MA) is a higher number
      than 36.8 degrees North (Navajo Lake, NM).

      7.  **Interpret the comparison:** A higher North latitude means a location is
      further north.

      8.  **Conclusion:** Since the location in Massachusetts is at a higher North
      latitude than Navajo Lake, NM, it is located north of Navajo Lake, NM.


      Even if "Bunch-of-Grapes, MA" is not a precise geographical point, any location
      within the state of Massachusetts is significantly further north than Navajo
      Lake, NM.

      north than parts of South Carolina, the vast majority of California is significantly
      *west* of South Carolina. More importantly, locations on the west coast are
      generally not considered "north" of locations on the east coast in this context;
      the primary difference is east-west. Herbst Theatre is in San Francisco, which
      is roughly at the same latitude as Virginia/North Carolina, but far to the west.
      Lake Bowen is near Spartanburg, SC, which is south of San Francisco''s latitude.

      7.  **Conclusion:** Herbst Theatre in California is geographically west of Lake
      Bowen in South Carolina. While San Francisco is slightly north of Spartanburg''s
      latitude, the question asks if it''s "north of". Given the massive longitudinal
      separation, the primary direction is west, and the slight latitudinal difference
      makes it slightly *more* north, but the geographical context doesn''t typically
      frame this as "north of". More directly, South Carolina is *east* of California.
      A location in California is not north *of* a location in South Carolina in the
      common geographical sense when they are separated by the entire continent. However,
      strictly by latitude, San Francisco is north of Spartanburg. The question asks
      "is X located north of Y". San Francisco''s latitude (~37.7 N) is greater than
      Spartanburg''s latitude (~35.1 N).


      Based *strictly* on latitude: Yes, San Francisco is north of Spartanburg.

      6.  **Compare the overall latitude/longitude:** Orem, UT is significantly further
      north and east than Palmdale, CA.

      7.  **Formulate the conclusion:** Since Orem, UT (where UCCU Center is) is much

      a northern US state, but Austin, MN is significantly further north than where
      Anderson Ranch Dam is located in Idaho (which is roughly at the latitude of
      southern Oregon/northern Nevada states).

      4.  **Determine if MN is north of ID:** Based on the relative locations of Austin,
      MN and the area of Idaho where Anderson Ranch Dam is located, Austin, MN is
      indeed further north.


      Therefore, Star Lite Motel, MN is located north of Anderson Ranch Dam, ID.

      4.  **Compare the general latitudes:** Both Ohio and California span a range
      of latitudes. However, Ohio is generally located at a more northerly latitude
      than most of California (which extends quite far south). For a more precise
      check, Cleveland, OH (near where the church is located) is at about 41.5 degrees
      North. Lexington Reservoir, CA (near Los Gatos) is at about 37.2 degrees North.

      5.  **Determine if Ohio is north of California based on these general locations
      and specific examples:** Since 41.5 degrees North is a higher (more northerly)
      latitude than 37.2 degrees North, Ohio is generally located north of this specific
      location in California.


      Therefore, the Shrine Church of St. Stanislaus in Ohio is located north of Lexington
      Reservoir in California.

      Northwest region of the United States. It is located north of California and
      Nevada.

      3.  **Determine the general location of Arizona:** Arizona is a state in the
      Southwestern region of the United States. It is located south of Utah and Nevada.

      4.  **Compare the states'' latitudes:** Oregon is significantly further north

      5.  **Consider specific locations within the states:** While the exact latitude
      of Lost Creek Lake and Navajo Generating Station isn''t strictly necessary if
      the states'' relative positions are clear, knowing they are both located within
      their respective states confirms they will generally follow the state''s overall
      north-south positioning. Lost Creek Lake is in southern Oregon, and Navajo Generating
      Station is in northern Arizona. However, southern Oregon is still much further
      north than northern Arizona.

      6.  **Conclusion:** Since Oregon is a northern state and Arizona is a southern
      state, any location in Oregon will be north of any location in Arizona. Therefore,
      Lost Creek Lake, OR is located north of Navajo Generating Station, AZ.

      part of California, near Merced.

      5.  **Compare latitudes:** Ohio is generally east of California and at comparable
      or slightly higher latitudes in its northern parts compared to central California.
      New Exchequer Dam is near 37.5 degrees North latitude. Ohio''s latitude range
      is roughly 38 to 42 degrees North.

      6.  **Visualize or check a map:** Ohio is significantly east of California.
      To be north of a location in California, you would typically need to be at a
      higher latitude. Since Ohio''s latitude range overlaps with or is slightly higher

      4.  **Evaluate the question:** The question asks if Des Moines, IA is *north\

      \ and therefore the latitude of \"Hawke Castle, CA\" is unknown, we cannot compare\
      \ it to the latitude of Des Moines.\n\nTherefore, we cannot determine if Des\
      \ Moines, IA is north of \"Hawke Castle, CA\".\n\nSince a definitive comparison\
      \ is impossible due to the lack of a specific location for \"Hawke Castle, CA\"\
      , a simple YES or NO answer cannot be given.\n\nThe question is unanswerable\
      \ with the given information. However, if forced to give a YES/NO answer based\
      \ on the lack of information allowing a definitive comparison, the answer is\
      \ effectively \"no\" because we cannot *confirm* it is north. But this is based\
      \ on inability to verify, not a comparison of known locations.\n\nLet's assume\
      \ there *is* a location intended by \"Hawke Castle, CA\" and try to find a reasonable\
      \ approximation or acknowledge the ambiguity. Without more information, this\
      \ is pure speculation. However, *if* \"Hawke Castle\" refers to a place in the\
      \ southern half of California (which is a large state covering a wide range\
      \ of latitudes), Des Moines (at ~41.6\xB0N) would likely be north of it. But\
      \ this is a huge assumption.\n\nGiven the ambiguity of \"Hawke Castle, CA\"\
      , the question cannot be answered definitively YES or NO based on factual location\
      \ data.\n\nLet's reconsider the prompt: \"Here is a question with a clear YES\
      \ or NO answer... It requires a few steps of reasoning.\" This implies the required\
      \ information *should* be findable. The ambiguity of \"Hawke Castle, CA\" makes\
      \ it not a question with a clear YES or NO answer.\n\nHowever, if we *interpret*\
      \ \"Hawke Castle, CA\" as a placeholder for *some* location in California, and\
      \ knowing that California spans a wide range of latitudes (from ~32.5\xB0N to\
      \ ~42\xB0N), and Des Moines is at ~41.6\xB0N, it's *possible* for Des Moines\
      \ to be either north or south of a location in California depending on where\
      \ that location is.\n\nLet's assume, for the sake of trying to get to a YES/NO,\
      \ that \"Hawke Castle\" refers to a reasonably well-known or typical location\
      \ in California. Many prominent locations in California (like Los Angeles, San\
      \ Francisco, etc.) are significantly south of 41.6\xB0N. Even Sacramento is\
      \ south of 41.6\xB0N. The northernmost point of California is at 42\xB0N, but\
      \ the vast majority of the state is south of 41.6\xB0N.\n\nGiven that Des Moines\
      \ is relatively far north, it is *highly probable* that any specific location\
      \ in California referred to as \"Hawke Castle\" would be south of it.\n\nLet's\
      \ assume, for the sake of providing a YES/NO answer as requested, that \"Hawke\
      \ Castle, CA\" is located south of 41.6\xB0N.\n\nStep 1: Find the latitude of\
      \ Basilica of St. John (Des Moines, Iowa). It's approximately 41.6\xB0 N.\n\
      Step 2: Assume \"Hawke Castle, CA\" is located somewhere in California. Assume\
      \ its latitude is less than 41.6\xB0 N (as is the case for most of California).\n\
      Step 3: Compare the latitudes. 41.6\xB0 N (Des Moines) is greater than a latitude\
      \ less than 41.6\xB0 N (Hawke Castle, CA).\nStep 4: A location with a greater\
      \ North latitude is north of a location with a smaller North latitude.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ Des Moines, IA is north of \"Hawke Castle, CA\" under the assumption that\
      \ \"Hawke Castle, CA\" is located at a latitude south of 41.6\xB0N.\n\nThis\
      \ assumption is necessary because the location of \"Hawke Castle, CA\" is not\
      \ clearly defined. However, to provide a YES/NO answer as requested, we proceed\
      \ with the most likely scenario for a location in California relative to Des\
      \ Moines.\n\nFinal check: Des Moines is at ~41.6\xB0N. The northern border of\
      \ California is at 42\xB0N. So, *some* locations in California are north of\
      \ Des Moines (e.g., areas right near the northern border). However, most of\
      \ California is south of 41.6\xB0N. Without a specific location for \"Hawke\
      \ Castle\", we cannot be certain.\n\nLet's go back to the strict interpretation:\
      \ Can we definitively say YES or NO based on known locations? No, because \"\
      Hawke Castle, CA\" is not a known, specific location with a readily available\
      \ latitude.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the question is flawed due\
      \ to the ambiguity of \"Hawke Castle, CA\". If we *must* answer YES or NO, we\
      \ have to make an assumption or acknowledge the ambiguity. Since the prompt\
      \ says \"clear YES or NO answer\", this suggests the ambiguity is not intended,\
      \ or that \"Hawke Castle, CA\" is meant to represent a typical location in California.\n\
      \nGiven that most of California is South of Des Moines, the most *likely* answer,\
      \ assuming \"Hawke Castle\" is not in the extreme northern tip of the state,\
      \ is YES.\n\nLet's assume the question is asking about a location in California\
      \ that is not in the small sliver of the state that is north of 41.6\xB0N.\n\
      \nStep 1: Latitude of Des Moines, IA is ~41.6\xB0N.\nStep 2: Assume \"Hawke\
      \ Castle, CA\" is located in California, at a latitude less than 41.6\xB0N (which\
      \ covers most of the state).\nStep 3: Comparing latitudes, 41.6\xB0N is greater\
      \ than a latitude less than 41.6\xB0N.\nStep 4: Therefore, Des Moines is north\
      \ of \"Hawke Castle, CA\".\n\nThis is based on a necessary assumption due to\
      \ the ambiguous location. However, under this reasonable assumption for a location\
      \ within the vast state of California, the answer is YES.\n\nLet's pause and\
      \ think again. Is there any way to get a *certain* YES or NO without assuming\
      \ the location of \"Hawke Castle\"? No. The question is flawed.\n\nHowever,\
      \ if I am forced to provide a YES or NO, I must proceed with the most probable\
      \ scenario or the one that allows a YES/NO conclusion.\n\nLet's assume \"Hawke\
      \ Castle\" is a real place intended by the question setter. A search for \"\
      Hawke Castle California\" doesn't yield a prominent result. This reinforces\
      \ the idea that the location is ambiguous or possibly non-existent as a well-known\
      \ landmark.\n\nSince the prompt insists on a YES/NO answer and implies the information\
      \ is findable, there might be a misunderstanding of the location name or it's\
      \ a less famous place. Without a specific latitude for \"Hawke Castle, CA\"\
      , a definitive comparison to Des Moines (41.6\xB0N) is impossible.\n\nLet's\
      \ assume the question *is* well-formed and there *is* a specific \"Hawke Castle,\
      \ CA\" that the question refers to. If its latitude is less than 41.6\xB0N,\
      \ the answer is YES. If its latitude is greater than or equal to 41.6\xB0N,\
      \ the answer is NO.\n\nWithout knowing the specific location and latitude of\
      \ \"Hawke Castle, CA\", I cannot definitively answer YES or NO.\n\nHowever,\
      \ if forced to guess based on probability (most of CA is south of Des Moines'\
      \ latitude), the answer would lean towards YES. But this is not reasoning based\
      \ on fact, but on probability due to missing information.\n\nLet's operate under\
      \ the assumption that \"Hawke Castle, CA\" refers to a location south of 41.6\xB0\
      N latitude, as is the case for the vast majority of California.\n\nStep 1: Latitude\
      \ of Basilica of St. John (Des Moines, Iowa) is approximately 41.6 degrees North.\n\
      Step 2: Assume \"Hawke Castle, CA\" is located in California at a latitude less\
      \ than 41.6 degrees North.\nStep 3: Comparing the latitudes, 41.6\xB0N is greater\
      \ than a latitude less than 41.6\xB0N.\nStep 4: A location at a higher North\
      \ latitude is located north of a location at a lower North latitude.\n\nConclusion:\
      \ Basilica of St. John (Des Moines, Iowa) is located north of \"Hawke Castle,\
      \ CA\" under the assumption that \"Hawke Castle, CA\" is located south of 41.6"

      3. **Consider the relative locations of the states:** Connecticut is on the
      East Coast of the United States. California is on the West Coast of the United
      States.

      4. **Consider the general latitudinal positions:** Both states are in the contiguous
      United States. While precise latitudes are needed for a definitive answer, the
      general trend across the US is that locations on the East Coast at similar longitudes
      to those on the West Coast tend to be further north or at similar latitudes.
      However, the significant difference in longitude makes this a less reliable
      initial indicator than the general north-south spread of the states.

      asks about the relative positions of Little Goose Dam, WA and Causey Reservoir,
      UT.

      2.  **Determine the state of each location:** Little Goose Dam is in Washington
      (WA). Causey Reservoir is in Utah (UT).

      3.  **Consider the general geographical relationship between Washington and
      Utah:** Washington is a state in the Pacific Northwest of the US. Utah is a
      state in the Mountain West of the US.

      4.  **Compare the latitudes of the states:** Washington is significantly further
      north than Utah.

      5.  **Infer the relative positions of specific locations within those states:**
      Since Washington is generally north of Utah, a location in Washington is highly
      likely to be north of a location in Utah, especially when the locations are
      not near the extreme northern or southern borders of their respective states.
      Little Goose Dam is on the Snake River in southeastern Washington, and Causey
      Reservoir is in northern Utah.

      6.  **Confirm the relative latitudes (optional but confirms the inference):**
      Little Goose Dam is around 46.5 degrees North latitude. Causey Reservoir is
      around 41.4 degrees North latitude.

      7.  **Compare the latitudes:** 46.5 is greater than 41.4.

      8.  **Conclusion:** Little Goose Dam, WA is at a higher latitude (further north)
      than Causey Reservoir, UT.

      north of Utah makes it highly probable that any point in Washington is north
      of any point in Utah.

      5.  **Confirm the general positions:** Little Goose Dam is in southeastern Washington.
      Causey Reservoir is in northern Utah. Southeastern WA is significantly north
      of northern UT.
