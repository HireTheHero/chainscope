      of Bunch-of-Grapes, MA and Navajo Lake, NM to answer this question.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - MA refers to Massachusetts, which is in the northeastern United States.

      - NM refers to New Mexico, which is in the southwestern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south relationship of these states.

      - Massachusetts is located much further north than New Mexico on the map of
      the United States.

      - Massachusetts is in the northern part of the country, while New Mexico is
      in the southern part.


      Step 3: Determine if the specific locations change this general relationship.

      - Regardless of where exactly "Bunch-of-Grapes" is in Massachusetts, it must
      be north of any location in New Mexico.

      - This is because even the southernmost point of Massachusetts is still north
      of the northernmost point of New Mexico.


      Step 4: Conclude based on the geographic facts.

      - Since any location in Massachusetts is north of any location in New Mexico,
      Bunch-of-Grapes, MA must be north of Navajo Lake, NM.


      YES, Bunch-of-Grapes, MA is located north of Navajo Lake, NM.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both water bodies.

      - Twitchell Reservoir is in California (CA)

      - Parker Canyon Lake is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Determine their general geographic positions.

      - California is generally west of Arizona

      - But the question asks about north/south positioning, not east/west


      Step 3: Consider more specific locations.

      - Twitchell Reservoir is in San Luis Obispo County in central/southern California

      - Parker Canyon Lake is in southern Arizona, very close to the Mexican border


      Step 4: Compare latitudes.

      - Central/southern California is at a higher latitude (more northerly) than
      the Arizona-Mexico border region

      - Twitchell Reservoir would be positioned significantly further north than Parker
      Canyon Lake


      Therefore, based on the geographic positions of these two bodies of water, with
      Twitchell Reservoir in central/southern California and Parker Canyon Lake near
      the southern border of Arizona:

      question.


      Step 1: Let me consider the geographic locations of North Carolina and Texas.

      - North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States.

      - Texas is in the southern United States, southwest of North Carolina.


      Step 2: Consider the north-south positioning.

      - North Carolina is generally located north of Texas on a map of the United
      States.

      - Fort Worth is in north-central Texas.

      - Blewett Falls Lake would be in southern North Carolina (as most lakes in NC
      are in the central or southern portions of the state).


      Step 3: Compare latitudes.

      - Even the southern parts of North Carolina are typically north of the northern
      parts of Texas.

      - Fort Worth is not at the extreme northern edge of Texas.


      Based on this geographic reasoning about the states'' positions, Blewett Falls
      Lake in North Carolina would be north of the Blackstone Hotel in Fort Worth,
      Texas.


      NO

      North Carolina is indeed east of Texas, but it''s also north of Texas. The southernmost
      point of North Carolina is still north of Fort Worth, Texas. Therefore, Blewett
      Falls Lake in North Carolina would be north of the Blackstone Hotel in Fort

      Step 1: Determine the location of San Clemente Dam, CA.

      San Clemente Dam is located in California (CA), which is on the west coast of
      the United States.


      Step 2: Determine the location of DeGray Lake, AR.

      DeGray Lake is located in Arkansas (AR), which is in the south-central part

      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - California is generally west of Arkansas.

      - However, the question asks about north/south positioning, not east/west.

      - California extends over a large latitude range, as does Arkansas to a lesser
      extent.

      - Generally, most of California is at a higher latitude (more northerly) than
      Arkansas.


      Step 4: Be more specific about these particular locations.

      - San Clemente Dam is in central/coastal California, in Monterey County.

      - DeGray Lake is in southwestern Arkansas.

      - Central California is typically at a higher latitude (further north) than
      anywhere in Arkansas.


      Therefore, San Clemente Dam in California is located north of DeGray Lake in
      Arkansas.
