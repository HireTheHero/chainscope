      - It''s an animated short film

      - It runs approximately 2 minutes in length


      2. iJustine''s "IPHONE BILL" is a viral video from 2007

      - In it, she shows her 300-page iPhone bill from AT&T

      - The video runs approximately 3 minutes in length


      3. Comparing the lengths:

      - Celery Monster: ~2 minutes

      - iPhone Bill video: ~3 minutes


      NO


      The Stalk of the Celery Monster is shorter than iJustine''s iPhone bill video
      by about a minute.'

      1. First, I need to know the runtimes of both films:

      - Laawaris (1981) is a Bollywood film that runs approximately 180 minutes (3
      hours)

      - Sherlock Holmes and the Leading Lady (1991) is a TV movie that runs approximately
      187 minutes


      2. Comparing the lengths:

      - Laawaris: 180 minutes

      - Sherlock Holmes and the Leading Lady: 187 minutes

      - 187 is greater than 180
