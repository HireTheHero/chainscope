      the run times of the two animated short films directed by Chuck Jones: "Scrambled
      Aches" and "Zipping Along."


      1. **Scrambled Aches**: "Scrambled Aches" is a Warner Bros. Looney Tunes cartoon
      featuring Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. The typical run time for these
      shorts is approximately 6 to 7 minutes.


      2. **Zipping Along**: Similarly, "Zipping Along" is another Looney Tunes cartoon
      featuring the same characters, and it also typically runs for about 6 to 7 minutes.


      Since both films are standard Looney Tunes shorts from the same era, they have
      approximately the same run time, which is typical for these cartoons.


      Therefore, the answer to the question of whether "Scrambled Aches" is longer
      than "Zipping Along" is NO.'

      short featuring Bugs Bunny and others. Looney Tunes shorts from this era usually

      film. However, specific details about the exact running time aren''t widely

      1. **"Haunted Castle" (2001):** This is an IMAX 3D film directed by Ben Stassen.
      The runtime of "Haunted Castle" is approximately 38 minutes.


      2. **"God Is the Bigger Elvis" (2011):** This is a documentary short film directed
      by Rebecca Cammisa. The runtime of "God Is the Bigger Elvis" is approximately
      37 minutes.


      Now, compare the runtimes:


      - "Haunted Castle": 38 minutes

      - "God Is the Bigger Elvis": 37 minutes


      Based on these runtimes, "Haunted Castle" is longer than "God Is the Bigger
      Elvis."

      The Goal! trilogy consists of:

      1. **Goal! (2005)** - Directed by Danny Cannon.

      2. **Goal II: Living the Dream (2007)** - Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra.

      3. **Goal III: Taking on the World (2009)** - Directed by Andy Morahan.


      For the sake of the question, we will consider the trilogy as a whole, even
      though Andy Morahan directed only the third movie. Here are the approximate
      runtimes:

      - Goal! (2005) - 118 minutes

      animated shorts. The first volume contains 56 animated shorts, which collectively
      amount to several hours of content. The exact runtime depends on the length
      of each short, but it is generally over 300 minutes.


      2. **The Chronicles of Narnia**: Michael Apted directed "The Chronicles of Narnia:
      The Voyage of the Dawn Treader," which is a single feature film. The runtime
      of this movie is approximately 113 minutes.


      Now, comparing the runtimes:


      - The total runtime of "Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1" is significantly
      longer than the 113 minutes of "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the
      Dawn Treader."


      Therefore, the answer is YES, Bob Clampett''s "Looney Tunes Golden Collection:
      Volume 1" is longer than Michael Apted''s "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage
      of the Dawn Treader."'

      Looney Tunes cartoons.


      2. **Michael Apted''s The Chronicles of Narnia**: Michael Apted directed "The

      Narnia series. The runtime of "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn
      Treader" is approximately 113 minutes.


      Now, comparing the runtimes:


      - Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1: 411 minutes

      - The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader: 113 minutes


      Based on these runtimes, Bob Clampett''s Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume
      1 is indeed longer than Michael Apted''s The Chronicles of Narnia film.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.'
