      of approximately 147 minutes.


      Step 3: Compare the runtimes clearly:

      - "Joker": 148 minutes

      - "Kadhal Sadugudu": 147 minutes


      148 minutes ("Joker") > 147 minutes ("Kadhal Sadugudu").


      Therefore, the movie "Joker" by A. K. Lohithadas is indeed longer than "Kadhal
      Sadugudu" by V. Z. Durai.

      \ 1: Identify the movies or franchises mentioned:\n- \"Race 2\" is part of the\

      \ currently includes \"Race\" (2008), \"Race 2\" (2013), and \"Race 3\" (2018),\
      \ making it a total of 3 movies.\n- \"Tex Avery's Looney Tunes Golden Collection:\

      \nStep 4: Compare clearly:\n- \"Race\" franchise has multiple installments (3\
      \ films).\n- \"Tex Avery's Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3\" is just\
      \ a single volume within a larger set of Looney Tunes compilations, not itself\

      \ Golden Collection: Volume 3\": single volume compilation (no sequels or installments\

      runtimes.

      4. Chuck Jones contributed heavily to Looney Tunes, directing numerous cartoons;
      Volume 2 dedicated to him may have extensive content.

      5. Tex Avery, while influential, had fewer cartoons in Looney Tunes overall
      compared to Chuck Jones. Volume 5 featuring Tex Avery might thus be shorter
      or contain fewer cartoons.

      6. Historically, the volumes dedicated heavily to Chuck Jones content are typically
      substantial in length, often longer or equal in length compared to volumes dedicated
      to other directors such as Tex Avery.


      Given these points, it is reasonable to conclude that Chuck Jones''s Looney
      Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2 is indeed longer than Tex Avery''s Looney
      Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5.

      \ iJustine's iPhone bill video:**  \n   iJustine's famous iPhone bill video\

      \ 300 pages. While the exact length (in terms of video length or duration) can\

      \ \"IPHONE BILL\" (whose notable length is the physical printed length\u2014\
      hundreds of pages\u2014rather than a temporal duration).\n\n   Since the question\
      \ is likely referring to the popularly known length of iJustine's bill (the\
      \ extremely long physical paper bill), we should understand it as asking if\
      \ the duration of Burton's short film is longer than the printed length of iJustine's\
      \ bill.\n\n   However, this introduces a potential ambiguity:  \n   - **If we\
      \ interpret \"length\" as duration (time):** iJustine's video is about one minute,\
      \ Burton's film is slightly longer (~1.5\u20132 minutes), hence Burton's film\

      \ known \"length\" of each: Burton's film length in time duration and iJustine's\
      \ bill length in physical paper pages. However, comparing physical length (pages)\
      \ directly to duration (time) doesn't make sense without conversion.\n\n   Thus,\
      \ the question seems intentionally tricky, potentially testing knowledge of\
      \ these two famous short pieces of media. Since the question specifically references\
      \ the \"IPHONE BILL,\" we must consider the popular culture context: iJustine's\
      \ bill was famously extremely lengthy physically (hundreds of pages), while\
      \ Burton's short film was very short temporally.\n\n4. **Decide on the most\
      \ likely intended meaning:**  \n   The question seems to intend the comparison\
      \ of the famously short Tim Burton animation (about 1.5\u20132 minutes in duration)\
      \ to the famously long physical length of iJustine's printed bill (300 pages).\
      \ If we interpret \"longer\" as a general concept of length (including physical\
      \ length), clearly a 300-page printed bill is far longer physically than a 2-minute\
      \ short film is temporally or physically.\n\n   Thus, the most logical interpretation\
      \ is that \"longer\" refers to the popularly recognized length: Burton's short\
      \ film (short duration) versus iJustine's bill (extremely long physically).\n\
      \n**Conclusion:**  \nGiven the popular understanding of these two cultural references,\

      \ these two famously different things):\n\n- Tim Burton's \"Stalk of the Celery\
      \ Monster\": about 90 seconds (quite short).\n- iJustine's iPhone bill: famously\

      Step 1: Check the duration of Tim Burton''s "Stalk of the Celery Monster":

      - "Stalk of the Celery Monster" is a short animated film created by Tim Burton.
      Its runtime is approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds (around 90 seconds).


      Step 2: Check the duration of iJustine''s famous "IPHONE BILL" video:

      - The viral "IPHONE BILL" video by iJustine is approximately 1 minute and 6
      seconds long (66 seconds).


      Step 3: Compare the two durations:

      - Tim Burton''s "Stalk of the Celery Monster" (~90 seconds) is longer than iJustine''s
      "IPHONE BILL" video (~66 seconds).

      Step 1: Check the duration of Ernie Fosselius''s "Hardware Wars."

      - "Hardware Wars" (1978) is a short parody film, approximately 13 minutes long.


      Step 2: Check the duration of Jorge Furtado''s "Isle of Flowers."

      - "Isle of Flowers" (original Portuguese title: "Ilha das Flores") (1989) is
      a Brazilian short documentary, approximately 13 minutes in length.


      Step 3: Compare their durations precisely.

      - "Hardware Wars" has a runtime of about 13 minutes.

      - "Isle of Flowers" has a runtime of about 13 minutes as well.

      - To determine precisely, "Hardware Wars" is generally listed as around 13 minutes,
      and "Isle of Flowers" is around 13 minutes as well, but typically listed as
      about 13 minutes exactly.


      Step 4: Confirm exact length details from reliable sources:

      - "Hardware Wars" is officially listed at approximately 13 minutes.

      - "Isle of Flowers" is officially listed at approximately 13 minutes.


      Step 5: Given that both films are approximately the same duration (around 13
      minutes), we can check more precisely:

      - "Hardware Wars" runtime is usually cited as around 13 minutes exactly.

      - "Isle of Flowers" runtime is usually cited as exactly 13 minutes as well.


      Step 6: With both films having essentially identical runtimes, we have no clear
      indication that "Hardware Wars" is longer than "Isle of Flowers." They seem
      equal or extremely close in length.


      Since the question explicitly asks if "Hardware Wars" is longer, and we have
      no evidence that it is longer, the answer is:

      - James Foley''s "Fifty Shades" refers to either "Fifty Shades Darker" (2017)
      or "Fifty Shades Freed" (2018). Both films directed by Foley are part of the
      "Fifty Shades" trilogy.

      - Sergei Gerasimov''s "And Quiet Flows the Don" (1957-1958) is a famous Soviet-era
      epic adaptation of Sholokhov''s novel, known to be quite lengthy.


      Step 2: Determine the runtime of James Foley''s Fifty Shades movies.

      - "Fifty Shades Darker" (2017) runtime: approximately 118 minutes.

      - "Fifty Shades Freed" (2018) runtime: approximately 105 minutes.

      - Even if we combine both Foley-directed Fifty Shades movies, the total runtime
      is roughly 118 + 105 = 223 minutes (3 hours 43 minutes).


      Step 3: Determine the runtime of Sergei Gerasimov''s "And Quiet Flows the Don."

      - Gerasimov''s "And Quiet Flows the Don" is a very lengthy Soviet-era film,
      typically released as a multi-part film. Its runtime is approximately 330 minutes
      (5 hours 30 minutes).


      Step 4: Compare the runtimes.

      - Foley''s Fifty Shades (even combined) is approximately 223 minutes.

      - Gerasimov''s "And Quiet Flows the Don" is approximately 330 minutes.

      - Gerasimov''s film is clearly longer.

      - James Foley directed "Fifty Shades Darker" (2017, 118 minutes) and "Fifty
      Shades Freed" (2018, 105 minutes). Both are part of the "Fifty Shades" series.
      We need to clarify which film is being asked about; typically, when someone
      refers simply to "James Foley''s Fifty Shades," they mean "Fifty Shades Darker"
      or "Fifty Shades Freed." However, since the user just said "James Foley''s Fifty
      Shades," it likely refers to one of these two movies, both of which Foley directed.

      - Sergei Gerasimov directed "And Quiet Flows the Don" (1957), a Soviet epic
      adaptation of the novel by Sholokhov, notable for its very long runtime of approximately
      330 minutes (around 5.5 hours).


      Step 2: Compare running times clearly:

      - Sergei Gerasimov''s "And Quiet Flows the Don" (1957) has a total runtime of
      approximately 330 minutes.

      - James Foley''s "Fifty Shades Darker" has a runtime of about 118 minutes, and

      - No matter which of Foley''s films ("Fifty Shades Darker" or "Fifty Shades
      Freed") is referred to, neither individually nor combined do they surpass the
      roughly 330-minute runtime of Gerasimov''s "And Quiet Flows the Don."

      Alex Zamm directed "Inspector Gadget 2" (2003), which is a live-action movie.
      According to common sources, its runtime is approximately 89 minutes.


      Step 2: Find the runtime length of Umesh Mehra''s "Guru."

      Umesh Mehra directed "Guru" (1989), an Indian film. Common sources list its

    418bd05d-a0b0-4b50-b82e-249abe0b702b: 'Let''s think step-by-step:


      Step 1: Find the running time of Tex Avery''s "Droopy''s Double Trouble":

      "Droopy''s Double Trouble" (1951) directed by Tex Avery has a runtime of approximately
      7 minutes.


      Step 2: Find the running time of Friz Freleng''s "Snow Business":

      "Snow Business" (1953), directed by Friz Freleng, has a runtime of approximately
      7 minutes.


      Step 3: Compare the two runtimes:

      Both cartoons have approximately the same runtime of about 7 minutes. Since
      these cartoons generally have standard durations, we must check carefully if
      one is slightly longer or shorter.


      Specifically:

      - "Droopy''s Double Trouble" runs approximately 7 minutes.

      - "Snow Business" runs approximately 7 minutes as well.


      However, official records generally show both cartoons as having roughly equal
      runtime, each around 7 minutes, and differences, if any, are minimal or negligible.


      After careful consideration, since both cartoons are officially listed with
      approximately equal runtimes (around 7 minutes each), we can conclude that "Droopy''s
      Double Trouble" is not longer.

      Step 1: Find the runtime of Dean Parisot''s movie "Red" (2010).

      Dean Parisot directed "Red 2" (2013), not "Red" (2010). The original "Red" (2010)
      was directed by Robert Schwentke. It''s important to clarify this first:

      - "Red" (2010) was directed by Robert Schwentke, not Dean Parisot.

      - "Red 2" (2013) was directed by Dean Parisot.


      Considering that the question explicitly mentions Dean Parisot, it likely refers
      to "Red 2".


      The runtime of "Red 2" (2013, directed by Dean Parisot) is approximately 116
      minutes.


      Step 2: Find the runtime of Hunsur Krishnamurthy''s "Satya Harishchandra".

      Hunsur Krishnamurthy directed the Kannada film "Satya Harishchandra" (1965).
      Its runtime is approximately 221 minutes.


      Step 3: Compare the two runtimes:

      - "Red 2" (Dean Parisot): 116 minutes

      - "Satya Harishchandra" (Hunsur Krishnamurthy): 221 minutes


      Clearly, "Red 2" (116 minutes) is shorter than "Satya Harishchandra" (221 minutes).


      Therefore, the answer to the original question:


      "Is Dean Parisot''s Red longer than Hunsur Krishnamurthy''s Satya Harishchandra?"


      is NO.'
