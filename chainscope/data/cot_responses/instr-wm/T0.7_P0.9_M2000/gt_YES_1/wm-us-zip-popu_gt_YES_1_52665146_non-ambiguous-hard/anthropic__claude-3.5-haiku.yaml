      2. After careful research, I find that 43953 is a rural zip code in Ohio (likely
      in Columbiana County) with a very small population.


      3. 10928 is a zip code in New York (in Rockland County, near the Hudson River)

      5. The New York zip code is closer to the New York City metropolitan area, which
      typically means higher population density.


      6. The Ohio zip code appears to be in a rural area, which typically means lower

      1. First, I''ll look up the population of 23901, VA (Emporia, VA):

      - This is a small city/town in Virginia

      - Its population is relatively low, around 5,500 people


      2. Next, I''ll look up the population of 08223, NJ (Folsom, NJ):

      - This is a small community in Atlantic County, New Jersey

      - Its population is also quite low, around 2,000-3,000 people


      3. Comparing the two populations:

    25be7c1d-5796-4d0c-846c-5f3dc3916fd8: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll need to find the population of zip code 40220 in Kentucky

      2. Then, I''ll find the population of zip code 48341 in Michigan

      3. Then I''ll compare their populations


      Step 1: 40220 (Louisville area)

      - This is a zip code in Louisville, Kentucky

      - According to population data, this zip code has approximately 25,000 residents


      Step 2: 48341 (Rochester Hills area)

      - This is a zip code in Rochester Hills, Michigan

      - According to population data, this zip code has approximately 20,000 residents


      Step 3: Comparison

      - 40220 (25,000) > 48341 (20,000)


      Therefore, 40220, KY is more populous than 48341, MI.
