      is located in the state of Washington.

      2. Tomales Bay is located in California, specifically in Marin County.

      3. Washington is north of California.

      4. To determine if Long Lake is east of Tomales Bay, we compare their longitudinal
      positions.

      5. Tomales Bay is located at approximately **longitude -122.9**.

      6. Long Lake (Thurston County, WA) is located at approximately **longitude -122.8**.

      7. Since -122.8 is slightly east of -122.9, Long Lake is indeed east of Tomales
