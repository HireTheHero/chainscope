      Delton, WI, and Glacial Lake Wisconsin, WI, we''ll go through the reasoning
      step by step:


      1. Identify the location of Lake Delton: Lake Delton is a village located in
      central Wisconsin, near the city of Wisconsin Dells.


      2. Understand what Glacial Lake Wisconsin refers to: Glacial Lake Wisconsin
      was a prehistoric glacial lake that existed during the last Ice Age. Today,
      it is no longer a lake but its historical location is generally understood to
      have been in the central part of Wisconsin, roughly in the area that includes
      present-day counties like Adams, Juneau, and parts of others.


      3. Compare the locations: Lake Delton is situated in Sauk County, while the
      historical area of Glacial Lake Wisconsin covered areas more to the north and
      east of Lake Delton.


      Based on this reasoning, Lake Delton is located west of the historical area
      that was once Glacial Lake Wisconsin.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.'

      in the Adirondack Park, located in Essex County, New York. The main peaks are
      Macomb, South Dix (Carson Peak), Grace Peak (formerly East Dix), Hough Peak,
      and Dix Mountain.

      3. **Compare the relative locations**: The Dix Range in the Adirondacks is located
      in northern New York State, whereas Lake Oscawana is in the southeastern part
      of the state. Given that the Adirondacks are generally north of the Hudson Valley,
      the Dix Range would be northwest of Lake Oscawana.

      3. **Determine Relative Positions**: Since both Topock Gorge and Imperial Reservoir
      are along the Colorado River, consider the general flow of the river. The Colorado
      River flows southward from the area of Topock Gorge towards the Imperial Reservoir.


      4. **Directionality**: Since Topock Gorge is upstream and to the north of Imperial

      4. **Geographical Orientation**: Topock Gorge is located upstream on the Colorado
      River from Imperial Reservoir. Since the Colorado River flows southward, Topock
      Gorge is to the north of Imperial Reservoir.


      5. **East vs. West**: Given that the river flows mostly north to south and Topock

      3. **Compare the longitudinal coordinates:** For a definitive answer, we would
      compare the longitudinal coordinates of both lakes. The lake that has a greater
      longitudinal value is situated further east.


      Assuming the Horseshoe Lake in question is the one located near Mount Adams,
      which is southwest of Packwood Lake, we can conclude:


      **YES**, Packwood Lake is located east of Horseshoe Lake.'

      is located east of Lake Norman in North Carolina, we need to consider their
      relative geographical locations.


      1. **Identify the location of Lake Washington, FL:** Lake Washington is situated
      in Brevard County, Florida. Florida is on the southeastern coast of the United
      States.


      2. **Identify the location of Lake Norman, NC:** Lake Norman is located in North
      Carolina, northwest of Charlotte. North Carolina is also on the eastern coast
      of the United States, but further north than Florida.


      3. **Compare the longitudinal positions:** Florida, being further south, generally
      has a more easterly position compared to locations further north in the eastern
      United States. Specifically, Brevard County is on the eastern side of Florida.


      4. **Conclusion:** Given that Florida is generally east of North Carolina, and
      Brevard County is on the eastern side of Florida, it follows that Lake Washington,
      FL is east of Lake Norman, NC.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      Mountains extend through central and western Colorado, and they generally run

      the Sawatch Range, and others.

      north-central part of Colorado. The Southern Rocky Mountains, being a larger
      designation, cover a broader area that includes regions both to the east and
      west of the Park Range.


      Considering this, the Southern Rocky Mountains extend both east and west relative
      to the Park Range.


      Therefore, there is no clear YES or NO answer to the question as it is not strictly
      east or west but spans both directions.'
