      - Lake Delton is in Sauk County, Wisconsin

      - It''s near Wisconsin Dells

      - It''s approximately in south-central Wisconsin


      2) Next, let me identify Glacial Lake Wisconsin''s location:

      - Glacial Lake Wisconsin was a prehistoric lake

      - It covered much of present-day central Wisconsin

      3) Comparing the locations:

      - Lake Delton is in Sauk County

      - The Glacial Lake Wisconsin basin was primarily in counties to the north and
      slightly east of Sauk County

      have been

      - Washington state is roughly aligned with California longitudinally

      - Both states are on the west coast

      1. First, let me locate both lakes in Washington state:

      - Lake Washington is a major lake bordering Seattle on the east side

      - Angle Lake is located in the city of SeaTac


      2. Looking at their relative positions:

      - Lake Washington runs north-south along Seattle''s eastern border

      - Angle Lake is located near SeaTac Airport, west of Lake Washington


      3. Since Angle Lake is west of Lake Washington, that means Lake Washington is
      east of Angle Lake.


      Answer: YES'
    b55fb96f-128e-4688-bcd5-d2229e124d73: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. Lake Washington is a major lake located in western Washington state, adjacent

      2. Angle Lake is located in SeaTac, Washington, which is southwest of Seattle.


      3. When comparing their relative positions:

      - Lake Washington is situated to the east of downtown Seattle

      - Angle Lake is situated to the west of Lake Washington


      4. Therefore, Lake Washington lies EAST of Angle Lake.

      - Long Lake is in Thurston County, Washington state

      - Tomales Bay is in California


      2) Washington state is entirely north of California

      - Thurston County, WA is in western Washington, near Olympia

      - Tomales Bay is on the California coast, north of San Francisco

      - Both locations are near the Pacific coast


      4) Since both locations are on the western edge of their respective states and
      near the Pacific coast, and the Pacific coast runs roughly north-south, they
      are at similar longitudes.

      - South Mountain is part of the Appalachian range in Maryland/Pennsylvania

      - Hemlock Lake is in the Finger Lakes region of New York


      3) Looking at relative positioning:

      - South Mountain is in central Maryland/Pennsylvania

      - Hemlock Lake is in western New York

      - When comparing east-west positioning, Maryland/Pennsylvania locations are
      generally east of western New York locations
