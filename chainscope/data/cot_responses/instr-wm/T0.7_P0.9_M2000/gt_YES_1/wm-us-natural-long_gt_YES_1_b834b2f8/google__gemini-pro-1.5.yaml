      the locations of Mosquito Range and Pacific Tarn in Colorado.

      2. **Determine general east/west relationship:** Once found, we can determine
      their relative east/west positions.


      Mosquito Range is a mountain range in central Colorado. Pacific Tarn is a lake
      in the Indian Peaks Wilderness, which is in north-central Colorado, west of
      the Continental Divide.  The Mosquito Range is east of the Continental Divide.


      Therefore, the Mosquito Range is east of Pacific Tarn.

    f2b9be51-47b2-4347-8fa9-ee5c9e49d3fd: '1. **Locate Mosquito Range:** The Mosquito
      Range is a mountain range in central Colorado.


      2. **Locate Pacific Tarn:** Pacific Tarn is a small alpine lake in the Holy
      Cross Wilderness, also in central Colorado.  The Holy Cross Wilderness is just
      west of the town of Vail, and slightly northwest of Leadville.


      3. **Relative position:**  The Mosquito Range runs roughly north-south, spanning
      from near Leadville southward.  Since Pacific Tarn is west of Vail and northwest
      of Leadville, and the Mosquito Range starts near Leadville and extends southward,
      Pacific Tarn is west of the Mosquito Range.


      4. **East/West determination:**  Since Pacific Tarn is *west* of the Mosquito
      Range, the Mosquito Range is *not* east of Pacific Tarn.


      NO

      Range.


      3. **East vs. West:**  Since the Gore Range (where Pacific Tarn is) is *west*
      of the Mosquito Range, the Mosquito Range cannot be east of Pacific Tarn.

      4. **Consider specific locations:**  While New York is generally east of Maryland,
      Hemlock Lake is in western New York. South Mountain (Maryland) is in the western
      part of Maryland.


      5. **Final comparison:** Western Maryland is further west than western New York.

    b511502e-ef15-49e7-89fe-974eab77ae66: '1. **Locate South Mountain:** South Mountain
      is a mountain range spanning parts of Maryland and Pennsylvania.  We need the
      Maryland portion for this question.

      2. **Locate Hemlock Lake:** Hemlock Lake is in New York state.

      3. **General East/West relationship of Maryland and New York:**  New York is
      generally north and west of Maryland.

      4. **Therefore:** South Mountain, MD is likely EAST of Hemlock Lake, NY.

    dbfe625a-2e02-4af2-9be1-0cb085dc903f: '1. **Locate South Mountain:** South Mountain
      is a mountain range primarily in Maryland and a small portion extends into Pennsylvania.  Need
      to focus on the Maryland portion since the question specifies MD.


      2. **Locate Hemlock Lake:** Hemlock Lake is in New York state.


      3. **General East/West Relationship of MD & NY:**  Maryland is generally south
      and slightly east of New York.  However, this isn''t precise enough.


      4. **More Precise Location:**  We need to determine if the *longitude* of South
      Mountain, MD is greater than the *longitude* of Hemlock Lake, NY.  A greater
      longitude indicates a location further east.


      5. **Look up Longitudes (or use a map):**  A quick map check reveals that South
      Mountain, MD is indeed east of Hemlock Lake, NY.


      YES

    e7f6e57d-ae87-4d22-b0d1-fc4fa821bc3d: '1. **Locate South Mountain (MD/PA):** South
      Mountain is a mountain ridge in Maryland and Pennsylvania, running roughly north-south
      along the border between the two states.


      2. **Locate Hemlock Lake, NY:** Hemlock Lake is in western New York state, south
      of Rochester.


      3. **Compare longitudes:**  Western New York is further west than Maryland and
      Pennsylvania.


      4. **East/West determination:** Since Western NY is further west, South Mountain
      (MD/PA) must be to the east of Hemlock Lake, NY.


      **Answer: YES**
