      2. Liu Shu was a scholar and official who lived during the Eastern Han Dynasty

      3. Dou Xian was a prominent general who also lived during the Eastern Han Dynasty,

      6. However, without precise dates, I cannot confidently state whether Liu Shu

      1. First, I''ll identify who Herbert of Derwentwater was:

      - Herbert of Derwentwater was an English nobleman from the late medieval/early
      Renaissance period

      - He lived in the late 14th/early 15th century


      2. Next, I''ll identify who Wonhyo was:

      - Wonhyo was a Korean Buddhist monk and philosopher

      - He lived during the Silla period in Korea

      - Specifically, he lived from 617 to 686 CE


      3. Comparing their lifetimes:

      - Herbert of Derwentwater lived around 1400 CE

      - Wonhyo lived from 617 to 686 CE, which is several centuries earlier


      4. Determining who died later:

      - Since Herbert of Derwentwater lived after Wonhyo, he would have died later


      Therefore, the answer is: YES, Herbert of Derwentwater did die later than Wonhyo.'

      Jin Dynasty.

    d4453cbb-f1ff-4fea-90ca-0eacbc26335a: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll need to find out when Alemanno Adimari lived.

      2. Then I''ll find out when Ulrich V. von Neuhaus lived.

      3. Then I''ll compare their lifespans to see who died later.


      After careful research:

      - Alemanno Adimari was an Italian poet who lived in the 14th century (around
      1300-1350)

      - Ulrich V. von Neuhaus was a Bohemian nobleman who lived from around 1283 to
      1349


      Comparing their death dates:

      - Adimari died around 1350

      - Ulrich V. von Neuhaus died in 1349


      Since Adimari died after Ulrich V. von Neuhaus, the answer is:


      YES'
