      3) On a timeline, 113 BCE came before 45-42 BCE

      - The larger the BCE number, the earlier the date

      - 113 BCE occurred about 70 years before 45-42 BCE


      Therefore, since Marcia died around 45-42 BCE and Zhang Qian died in 113 BCE,
      Marcia died later.

      - Marcia was a Roman noblewoman, wife of Cato the Younger, who died around 45-42
      BCE

      - Zhang Qian was a Chinese diplomat and explorer during the Han Dynasty who
      died in 113 BCE


      2) Converting both dates to the same format:

      - Marcia: died around 45-42 BCE

      - Zhang Qian: died in 113 BCE


      3) Since both dates are BCE (Before Common Era), the smaller number indicates
      a later date

      - 113 BCE came before 45-42 BCE

      - Therefore, Marcia (45-42 BCE) died later than Zhang Qian (113 BCE)

      - Chao Cuo was a Chinese political advisor during the Han Dynasty

      - He was executed in 154 BCE

      - Chao Cuo: died in 154 BCE

      - Ptolemy Eupator: died in 152 BCE

      - 152 BCE came after 154 BCE

      Cuo''s death in 154 BCE...

      - He died around 1130 CE


      2. Now, let me recall when Zhang Jun lived and died:

      - Zhang Jun was a Chinese military general during the Song Dynasty

      - He died in 1058 CE


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - Al-Khazini: died ~1130 CE

      - Zhang Jun: died 1058 CE

      - 1130 comes after 1058


      4. Therefore, Al-Khazini died later than Zhang Jun
