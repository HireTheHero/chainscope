      3. **Comparing their deaths:** Both figures died roughly around the same time.
      It''s difficult to pinpoint the exact years of death for either, but Peithon''s
      death in 314 BC is more firmly established than the range given for Sun Bin.  Therefore,
      it''s possible Sun Bin died before 314 BC, making Peithon''s death later.

      4. **Comparing the lifespans:**  The overlap in their potential lifespans makes
      it difficult to definitively say who died later.  However, the generally accepted
      later death date for Zengzi (436 BCE) is after the generally accepted later
      death date for Lu Ban (444 BCE).


      Therefore, based on generally accepted dates, YES, Zengzi likely died later
      than Lu Ban.
