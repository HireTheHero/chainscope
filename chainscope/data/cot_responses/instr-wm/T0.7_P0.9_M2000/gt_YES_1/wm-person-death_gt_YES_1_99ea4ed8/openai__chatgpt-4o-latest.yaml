    8b842acd-f9d7-4f16-8789-f971acfa7687: 'First, let''s determine the timeline for
      both historical figures:


      1. **Emperor Hui of Han** (Liu Ying) was the second emperor of the Han dynasty.
      He reigned from 195 BCE until his death in 188 BCE.

      2. **Fan Kuai** was a military general and close supporter of Emperor Gaozu
      (Liu Bang), the founder of the Han dynasty. He was active during the early Han
      period, but his exact death date is not well recorded.


      Now, considering historical context:


      - Fan Kuai was a contemporary of Liu Bang and played a key role in the establishment
      of the Han dynasty.

      - Given that he was already an adult and a military leader during Liu Bang''s
      rise to power, he was likely significantly older than Emperor Hui.

      - Since Emperor Hui died in 188 BCE, Fan Kuai would have had to live beyond
      that year to have died later.

      - Historical records suggest Fan Kuai died before Emperor Hui, likely sometime
      in the early years of the Han dynasty.


      Given this reasoning, the answer is: **NO**.'
