      ### Step 1: Population and Land Area for 77407

      - **Population (estimate)**: Around **80,000** (based on recent data).

      - **Land Area**: Approximately **18-20 square miles**.


      ### Step 2: Population and Land Area for 77003

      - 95655 has a population of around **5,000+**.


      ### Step 2: Gather Land Area Data

      - **95404** covers an area of about **98 square miles**.

      - **95655** covers an area of about **10 square miles**.


      ### Step 3: Calculate Population Density

      - **95404**: \( \frac{40,000}{98} \approx 408 \) people per square mile.

      - **95655**: \( \frac{5,000}{10} = 500 \) people per square mile.


      ### Step 4: Compare Densities

      - 95655 has a higher population density (500 people/sq mi) than 95404 (408 people/sq
      mi).


      ### Conclusion:

      **NO**, 95404 is not more densely populated than 95655.'

      \ follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Find Population and Area Data**  \n\
      \   - ZIP code 95404 covers part of Santa Rosa, a city in Sonoma County. It\
      \ includes both urban and rural areas.  \n   - ZIP code 95655 covers Mather,\
      \ a smaller community in Sacramento County. It is a less densely developed area.\n\
      \n2. **Compare Population Sizes**  \n   - 95404 has a larger population, as\
      \ it includes a significant portion of Santa Rosa.  \n   - 95655 has a smaller\
      \ population since Mather is a relatively small community.\n\n3. **Compare Land\
      \ Area**  \n   - 95404 covers a relatively large area, including parts of both\
      \ Santa Rosa's urban core and surrounding rural areas.  \n   - 95655 covers\
      \ a smaller area, but much of it is suburban or sparsely developed.\n\n4. **Calculate\
      \ Population Density**  \n   - Population density is calculated as **population\
      \ divided by land area**.  \n   - Given that 95404 includes urbanized Santa\
      \ Rosa, its density is expected to be higher than that of 95655, which is more\

      California is more densely populated than ZIP code 80007 in Colorado, we need
      to compare their population densities. Population density is calculated as:


      \[

      \text{Population Density} = \frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Land Area}}

      \]


      ### Step 1: Find Population for Each ZIP Code

      - **95961, CA (Olivehurst area)**: Population is approximately **28,000**.

      - **80007, CO (Arvada area)**: Population is approximately **10,000**.


      ### Step 2: Find Land Area for Each ZIP Code

      - **95961, CA**: Land area is about **56 square miles**.

      - **80007, CO**: Land area is about **20 square miles**.


      ### Step 3: Calculate Population Density

      - **95961, CA**: \( 28,000 \div 56 = 500 \) people per square mile.

      - **80007, CO**: \( 10,000 \div 20 = 500 \) people per square mile.

      Both ZIP codes have approximately the **same** population density.


      Final Answer: **NO** (95961, CA is not more densely populated than 80007, CO).'

      Since Kansas City (64129) is part of a large metro area, it is expected to have\
      \ a higher population density than Laconia (03246), which is more suburban and\
      \ tourist-oriented.\n\n**Final Answer: NO** (03246 is not more densely populated\
