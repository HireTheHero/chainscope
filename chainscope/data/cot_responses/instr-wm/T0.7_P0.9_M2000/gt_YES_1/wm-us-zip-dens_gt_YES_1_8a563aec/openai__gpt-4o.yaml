      **Step 1: Identify the population and land area for each zip code.**


      - **19063, PA**: This zip code covers areas such as Media, Pennsylvania, and
      parts of the surrounding region. It is located in Delaware County, which is
      part of the greater Philadelphia area. This area is generally suburban with
      a relatively high population density compared to rural areas.


      - **84414, UT**: This zip code covers areas such as North Ogden, Utah, and other
      parts of Weber County. North Ogden is located in a more mountainous and less
      densely populated area compared to suburban Philadelphia.


      **Step 2: Calculate or compare the population density of each zip code.**


      - **Population density** is calculated by dividing the total population by the
      land area (in square miles).

    c9bba46c-278d-484d-93fa-e97197613de6: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the population density of each ZIP code. Population density is typically measured
      as the number of people per square mile.


      **Step 1: Identify the areas corresponding to the ZIP codes.**

      - **33322:** This ZIP code is located in the city of Sunrise, Broward County,
      Florida.

      - **98087:** This ZIP code is located in Snohomish County, Washington. It includes
      parts of the city of Lynnwood and other surrounding areas.


      **Step 2: Gather data on population and area size.**

      - For each ZIP code, we need data on the total population and the land area
      in square miles to calculate the population density.


      **Step 3: Calculate the population density.**

      - **Population Density = Total Population / Land Area (square miles)**


      **Step 4: Compare the densities.**

      - Using the calculated population densities for each ZIP code, determine which
      is more densely populated.


      Given that I don''t have real-time access to databases or the internet to fetch
      current statistics, you would typically use a source like the U.S. Census Bureau
      or local government resources to obtain the most accurate and recent data.


      **Conclusion:**

      Based on typical patterns and previous data, urban areas in Florida like Sunrise
      tend to have relatively high population densities compared to more suburban
      or semi-rural areas in Washington. However, to definitively answer YES or NO,
      you would need the exact population and area size figures.

      we need to consider the population density, which is the number of people per
      unit of area.


      **Step 1: Identify the areas and populations of the ZIP codes.**

      - ZIP code 06437 is in Guilford, Connecticut.

      - ZIP code 87144 is in Rio Rancho, New Mexico.


      **Step 2: Research population and area data for each ZIP code.**

      - Guilford, CT (06437) is known to be a suburban area with a moderate population
      size and area.

      - Rio Rancho, NM (87144) is a part of the Albuquerque metropolitan area and
      has been experiencing significant growth, but it also encompasses a large area
      with parts that are less densely populated.


      **Step 3: Compare population densities.**

      - Typically, suburban areas in Connecticut, such as Guilford, tend to have higher
      population densities than areas in the western United States, especially where
      there is a lot of open space or desert, such as parts of Rio Rancho.


      **Conclusion:**

      Based on the typical characteristics of these regions, it is likely that 06437
      in Connecticut is more densely populated than 87144 in New Mexico. Therefore,

      both zip codes.

      2. **Determine land area**: Find the land area (usually in square miles) for
      each zip code.

      3. **Calculate population density**: For each zip code, divide the population
      by the land area to get the population density.


      Once we have these figures, we can compare the densities:


      - **77407, TX**: Suburban area located southwest of Houston, including parts
      of Richmond and Katy. Typically, suburban areas have lower population density
      compared to inner-city areas.

      - **77003, TX**: Located in the eastern part of Houston, this area is more urban
      and includes neighborhoods close to downtown Houston. Urban areas generally
      have higher population densities.


      Considering these typical characteristics and without specific data, 77003,
      TX is likely more densely populated due to its urban setting compared to the
      suburban setting of 77407, TX.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**, 77407, TX is not more densely populated than
      77003, TX.'

    2144a299-61b2-4106-b33e-5e7f8ad46c0f: 'To determine whether 10983, NY is more
      densely populated than 33634, FL, we need to consider the population and land
      area of each ZIP code to calculate their population densities.


      ### Step 1: Identify Population

      - **10983, NY (Tappan, NY):** This is a small community, so its population won''t
      be as high as major urban centers.

      - **33634, FL (Tampa, FL area):** This ZIP code is part of the Tampa metropolitan
      area, suggesting it might have a relatively high population.


      ### Step 2: Identify Land Area

      - **10983, NY:** Typically, areas in New York, especially outside of major cities,
      may have more open land or suburban development.

      - **33634, FL:** Being part of a metro area like Tampa, this region is likely
      to be more urbanized and compact.


      ### Step 3: Calculate Population Density

      - **Population Density Formula:** Population Density = Population / Land Area


      ### Step 4: Compare Densities

      - Generally, suburban areas like 10983, NY may have lower population densities
      compared to urban or metropolitan regions like 33634, FL.


      Based on these considerations, 33634, FL, being part of the Tampa metro area,
      is likely to be more densely populated than 10983, NY, which is a smaller community
      in New York.
