      1) First, I need to identify these zip codes:

      - 11804 is in Old Bethpage, New York

      - 93730 is in Fresno, California


      2) Old Bethpage is a suburban community in Nassau County, Long Island. It''s
      part of the New York metropolitan area.


      3) 93730 is in northeast Fresno, a growing suburban area of Fresno city.


      4) Population density comparison:

      - Old Bethpage (11804) is in a well-established suburban area near NYC, with
      typical suburban density patterns

      - Fresno''s 93730 is a more spread out, newer suburban development with larger
      lots and some undeveloped areas


      5) Given that 11804 is in the dense New York metro region and has more mature
      development patterns, while 93730 is in a more spread-out Western suburban style
      development...


      YES - 11804 (NY) is more densely populated than 93730 (CA)'

      - 23508 (Norfolk): This is a highly urban area that includes part of Old Dominion
      University and surrounding neighborhoods. Population density is approximately
      6,000-7,000 people per square mile.

      - 19043 (Holmes): This is a suburban area in Delaware County, part of the Philadelphia
      metropolitan area. Population density is approximately 4,000-5,000 people per
      square mile.


      3. Comparing the two:

      Norfolk''s 23508 has a higher population density than Holmes'' 19043, as it''s
      a more urban area with a university presence compared to the more suburban nature
      of Holmes.

      5. Compare densities:

      37.5 > 22.5


      Therefore, 37725 (Dandridge, TN) is more densely populated than 45176 (Sardinia,
      OH).
