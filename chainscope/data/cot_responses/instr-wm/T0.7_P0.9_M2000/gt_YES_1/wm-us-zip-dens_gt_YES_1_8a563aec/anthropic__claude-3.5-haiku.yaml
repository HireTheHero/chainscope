      1. 11234 is a zip code in Brooklyn, New York City

      - Brooklyn is one of the most densely populated urban areas in the United States

      - New York City is known for its extremely high population density


      2. 90016 is a zip code in Los Angeles, California

      - Specifically, it''s located in the Mid-City West area of Los Angeles

      - Los Angeles has lower population density compared to New York City

      - California cities generally have more spread-out urban layouts


      3. Comparing population densities:

      - Brooklyn (11234) has approximately 35,000-40,000 people per square mile

      - The Los Angeles zip code 90016 has around 15,000-20,000 people per square
      mile

      2. For 18237 (Pennsylvania):

      - This is located in Schuylkill County

      - It appears to be a rural area near Tamaqua

      - Rural areas tend to have lower population density


      3. For 61883 (Illinois):

      - This is located near Joliet, which is in the Chicago metropolitan area

      - Areas near large cities typically have higher population density

      - This zip code is in a more urbanized region of Illinois
