      of Branford due to the significant longitudinal difference.

      north of it.  A town slightly east and slightly south would still be predominantly
      *east*.

      but given their relative locations within their respective states, it''s very

      Pennsylvania is north of *southern* Illinois, Chicago and its suburbs are in
      the *northern* part of Illinois.

      very likely north of White Mills, Pennsylvania.
