      - Broomes Island, MD is in Maryland, along the western shore of the Chesapeake
      Bay

      - Catlettsburg, KY is in northeastern Kentucky, near the West Virginia border


      2. Looking at their general locations:

      - Maryland is a Mid-Atlantic state

      - Kentucky is more of a southern/central state


      3. Comparing latitudes:

      - Maryland generally lies north of Kentucky

      - Broomes Island, MD is in southern Maryland

      - Catlettsburg, KY is in northern Kentucky

      - Even southern Maryland is still north of northern Kentucky


      4. Therefore, Broomes Island, MD must be north of Catlettsburg, KY


      YES'

      - Greenvale is located in Nassau County, Long Island, NY


      2. On Long Island, Nassau County is west of Suffolk County


      3. Generally on Long Island:

      - Northern locations are closer to Long Island Sound

      - Southern locations are closer to the Atlantic Ocean


      4. Looking at their specific locations:

      - Holtsville is in central Suffolk County

      - Greenvale is in northern Nassau County, close to Long Island Sound


      5. Since Greenvale is positioned along the North Shore and Holtsville is more
      centrally located, Greenvale is further north.


      NO (Holtsville is not located north of Greenvale)'

      1. Let me locate both cities on Long Island, NY:

      - Wyandanch is in Suffolk County

      - Bethpage is in Nassau County


      2. Looking at their relative positions:

      - Wyandanch is located in the western part of Suffolk County

      - Bethpage is located in the eastern part of Nassau County


      3. When looking at their latitude:

      - Wyandanch is slightly south of the middle of Long Island

      - Bethpage is also slightly south of the middle of Long Island

      - They are roughly on the same latitude line

      - If anything, Wyandanch is slightly south of Bethpage


      NO'

      - Lake Clarke Shores is in Palm Beach County

      - It''s located near West Palm Beach


      2. Let me locate Acacia Villas, FL

      - Acacia Villas is also in Palm Beach County

      - It''s also near West Palm Beach


      3. Looking at their relative positions:

      - Lake Clarke Shores is located slightly south of West Palm Beach

      - Acacia Villas is located north of Lake Clarke Shores, closer to West Palm
      Beach


      Therefore: NO, Lake Clarke Shores is NOT located north of Acacia Villas, FL.
      It''s actually south of it.


      Answer: NO'

      - Acacia Villas is also in Palm Beach County

      - It''s also in the West Palm Beach area


      3. Now, I''ll determine their relative positions

      - Lake Clarke Shores is just south of Southern Boulevard

      - Acacia Villas is north of Forest Hill Boulevard

      - Southern Boulevard is north of Forest Hill Boulevard
