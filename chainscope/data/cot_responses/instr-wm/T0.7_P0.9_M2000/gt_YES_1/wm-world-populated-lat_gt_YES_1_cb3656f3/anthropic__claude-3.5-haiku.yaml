    083989e2-2dcb-44f5-8bf3-d8bc598949bd: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Hartford County, Connecticut on a map

      - This county is in the northeastern United States

      - Specifically, it''s in the northeastern part of Connecticut

      - Connecticut is in the northeastern region of the United States


      2. Next, I''ll locate Morrison, Illinois

      - Morrison is a city in northwestern Illinois

      - Illinois is in the midwestern United States


      3. Comparing their geographical positions

      - Hartford County is in the northeast

      - Morrison is in the northwest

      - The northeast is geographically north of the northwest


      4. Therefore, Hartford County, Connecticut IS located north of Morrison, Illinois.

      off the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula.


      3. Argentine Antarctica (Argentinian Antarctic Territory) is located on the
      eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula.


      4. Since Rothera is on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula and Argentine
      Antarctica is on the eastern side, Rothera would be located west of Argentine
      Antarctica.


      5. Being west of Argentine Antarctica means Rothera is NOT north of Argentine
      Antarctica.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'
