      2. **Locate Gamagara Local Municipality:** Gamagara is in the Northern Cape
      Province of South Africa.


      3. **Compare their locations:** Queensland, Australia is in the southern hemisphere,
      considerably east of South Africa.  The Northern Cape Province is in the southern
      portion of Africa.


      4. **North/South Relationship:** While Meadowbrook is at a higher latitude (further
      from the equator) than Gamagara,  "north" refers to a direction, not latitude.  Since
      Australia is east of Africa, Meadowbrook is primarily *east* of Gamagara, not
      north.
