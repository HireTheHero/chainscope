      Island (where Maud Island is) is generally at a more southern latitude than
      Tasmania''s northwest coast (where Arthur River is).

      Princeville, Illinois is located in the northern half of Illinois. Illinois\
      \ is in the Midwest region of the United States. Princeville's latitude is approximately\
      \ 40.9\xB0 N.\n\nStep 2: Let me identify the approximate latitude of Boonton\
      \ Township, New Jersey.\nBoonton Township is located in northern New Jersey.\
      \ New Jersey is on the East Coast of the United States. Boonton Township's latitude\
      \ is approximately 40.9\xB0 N.\n\nStep 3: Compare the latitudes.\nBoth locations\
      \ are at roughly the same latitude (around 40.9\xB0 N). When two locations have\
      \ the same latitude, neither is north of the other - they are at the same northward\
      \ position on the globe.\n\nNO, Princeville, Illinois is not located north of\
      \ Boonton Township, New Jersey. They are at approximately the same latitude."

      Step 1: Identify where Mahis is located.

      Mahis is a town in Jordan, located in the northwestern part of the country.


      Step 2: Identify where Qibya is located.

      Qibya is a Palestinian village in the West Bank.


      Step 3: Compare their geographical positions.

      Jordan is located east of Israel and the West Bank. Within this regional context,
      Mahis in northwestern Jordan would be positioned to the northeast of the West

      Step 2: Now, let me identify where Monbulk is located. Monbulk is a town in
      the Dandenong Ranges, which is east of Melbourne, approximately 40-45 km from
      Melbourne''s CBD.


      Step 3: Looking at their relative positions, Caulfield East is in Melbourne''s
      southeastern suburbs, while Monbulk is further east and south in the Dandenong
      Ranges.


      Step 4: More specifically, Caulfield East is generally northwest of Monbulk.
      This means Monbulk is southeast of Caulfield East.


      Step 5: If Monbulk is southeast of Caulfield East, then Caulfield East must
      be northwest of Monbulk.


      Since "northwest" means Caulfield East is both north and west of Monbulk, the
      answer to whether Caulfield East is north of Monbulk is:


      YES'

      Step 2: Let me identify where Monbulk is located.

      Monbulk is a town located in the Dandenong Ranges, which is east of Melbourne.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      Caulfield East is in the southeastern suburbs of Melbourne proper, while Monbulk
      is further east in the Dandenong Ranges.


      Step 4: Compare their north-south positions.

      Caulfield East is located more to the north compared to Monbulk. Specifically,

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Caulfield East is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

      - Monbulk is a town in Victoria, Australia, located in the Dandenong Ranges.


      Step 2: Determine their general positions.

      - Caulfield East is located in the southeastern suburbs of Melbourne, approximately
      10-12 km from Melbourne''s CBD.

      - Monbulk is located in the Dandenong Ranges, which are east/southeast of Melbourne,
      approximately 40 km from Melbourne''s CBD.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positioning.

      - Caulfield East is closer to Melbourne''s central area, in the inner southeastern
      suburbs.

      - Monbulk is further out in the Dandenong Ranges, which extend to the east and
      southeast of Melbourne.

      - Specifically, Caulfield East is generally northwest of Monbulk. Caulfield
      East is more northerly and westerly compared to Monbulk.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Caulfield East is situated more to the north compared to Monbulk (Monbulk
      is further south in the Dandenong Ranges), Caulfield East is north of Monbulk.


      NO, Caulfield East is not located north of Monbulk. Caulfield East is located
      northwest of Monbulk, but when considering strictly north-south positioning,
      Monbulk is actually north of Caulfield East.


      Wait, I need to verify this. Let me reconsider...


      Checking more carefully: Caulfield East is in Melbourne''s southeastern suburbs,
      while Monbulk is in the Dandenong Ranges to the east. Looking at their exact
      positions, Caulfield East is actually northwest of Monbulk, meaning Caulfield
      East is north of Monbulk.

      Step 2: The Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area refers to the larger urban
      agglomeration that includes the city of Thiruvananthapuram and its surrounding
      suburban areas.


      Step 3: In geographic terms, a city is typically considered to be at the center
      or core of its metropolitan area, with the metropolitan area extending outward
      from the city in multiple directions.


      Step 4: Since Thiruvananthapuram is the core city of the Thiruvananthapuram
      metropolitan area, it cannot be located entirely north of its metropolitan area.
      The metropolitan area would extend north, south, east, and west from the city
      center.


      Step 5: Therefore, Thiruvananthapuram cannot be north of the Thiruvananthapuram
      metropolitan area because it is contained within and forms the central part
      of that metropolitan area.


      NO'

      between Thiruvananthapuram and the Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area.


      Step 1: Thiruvananthapuram (also known as Trivandrum) is a city in Kerala, India.


      Step 2: The Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area refers to the urban agglomeration
      that includes the city of Thiruvananthapuram as its core, along with surrounding
      suburbs and satellite towns.


      Step 3: When considering the geographical relationship between a city and its
      metropolitan area, the city typically serves as the central core of the metropolitan
      area, with the metropolitan area extending outward in multiple directions from
      the city center.


      Step 4: Since Thiruvananthapuram is the core city of the Thiruvananthapuram
      metropolitan area, it cannot be located entirely north of its own metropolitan
      area. The metropolitan area surrounds the city, extending in all directions
      including north, south, east, and west.


      NO - Thiruvananthapuram is not located north of the Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan
      area. It is actually the central part of the metropolitan area.'

      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of both Bhagur and Pusad.

      - Bhagur is a town in Maharashtra, India, located in the Nashik district in
      the northwestern part of Maharashtra.

      - Pusad is a town in Maharashtra, India, located in the Yavatmal district in
      the eastern part of Maharashtra.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Yavatmal district (where Pusad is) is in the eastern part of Maharashtra.

      - When comparing northwest to east in Maharashtra, the northwestern location
      would be north of the eastern location.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - Since Bhagur is in northwestern Maharashtra and Pusad is in eastern Maharashtra,
      Bhagur is located to the north and west of Pusad.

      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of both places.

      - Qabu Shamsiyah (also spelled Qabu Shamsia or Qabu Shamsiya) is a village in
      Syria, located in the northwestern part of the country in Idlib Governorate.

      - Deir Huwayt (also spelled Deir Haweyt or similar variations) is also a village

      Step 2: Determine their precise coordinates.

      Based on geographical data, Qabu Shamsiyah is located south of Deir Huwayt in
      the Idlib region of Syria. Deir Huwayt is positioned more to the north compared
      to Qabu Shamsiyah.


      Step 3: Conclude based on their relative positions.

      Since Qabu Shamsiyah is south of Deir Huwayt (rather than north of it), the

      Bahraich is a city in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, located in northern
      India.


      Step 3: I need to determine their relative positions.

      Nepal is located north of India. Since Meghauli is in southern Nepal and Bahraich
      is in northern India, they are relatively close to the Nepal-India border, but
      Meghauli would still be north of Bahraich due to the geographical positioning
      of the two countries.


      Step 4: Make the final determination based on their latitudes.

      Meghauli, being in Nepal, is at a higher latitude than Bahraich, which is in
      northern India.


      NO


      Wait, I need to verify this. Let me check more carefully.


      Actually, Meghauli is indeed in southern Nepal, and Bahraich is in northern
      India near the Nepal border. Since Nepal is north of India, and these locations
      maintain that same relative positioning, Meghauli is north of Bahraich.


      YES'

      Step 3: Make a determination based on available information.

      - If Beit Yashout is indeed in the Middle East, it would be west of Japan, not
      north of Maibara.

      - However, without confirming the existence and location of Beit Yashout, I
      cannot make a definitive statement.


      Since I cannot verify the existence or location of "Beit Yashout," I cannot
      provide a clear YES or NO answer to whether it is north of Maibara, Shiga.'

      Step 1: Let me identify where Appledore, Torridge is located.

      Appledore is a village in the district of Torridge in Devon, southwest England.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Ticehurst is located.

      Ticehurst is a village in East Sussex, in southeast England.

      to East Sussex. Specifically, Appledore in north Devon is further north than
      Ticehurst in East Sussex.
