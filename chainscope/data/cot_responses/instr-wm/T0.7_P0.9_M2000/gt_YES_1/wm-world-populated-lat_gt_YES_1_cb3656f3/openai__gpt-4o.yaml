      3. **Consider the general latitudinal positions:** North Dakota is part of the
      northern United States and generally falls within a latitude range of approximately
      46 to 49 degrees north. Toretsk, being in eastern Ukraine, is situated at a
      latitude of approximately 48 degrees north.


      4. **Compare the latitudes:** Since Maza, North Dakota, is likely located between
      46 and 49 degrees north, and Toretsk is around 48 degrees north, Maza could
      potentially be at a similar or slightly higher latitude than Toretsk.


      5. **Verify specific latitudes if possible:** For a more precise comparison,
      Maza is located at approximately 48.7 degrees north, while Toretsk is approximately
      48.4 degrees north.


      Based on this analysis, Maza, North Dakota is indeed located north of Toretsk.
