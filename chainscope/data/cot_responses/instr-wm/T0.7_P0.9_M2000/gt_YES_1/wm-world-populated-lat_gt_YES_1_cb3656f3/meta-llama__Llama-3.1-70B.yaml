      \ at similar latitudes, but since Hartford County spans a range that includes\
      \ latitudes slightly north and slightly south of Morrison's latitude, and considering\

      \ approximately 3\xB0 to 4\xB0 south latitude.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on\
      \ the latitudes, Mbulu District in Tanzania and Fernando de Noronha in Brazil\
      \ are at similar latitudes, but since Mbulu District spans a range that includes\
      \ latitudes slightly north and slightly south of Fernando de Noronha's latitude,\
      \ and considering the general geographic area, Mbulu District is not significantly\
      \ north of Fernando de Noronha. However, the question asks for a definitive\
      \ yes or no answer regarding if Mbulu District is located north of Fernando\
      \ de Noronha.\n\nGiven the specific latitudes and considering the question's\
      \ requirement for a clear yes or no answer, and acknowledging that parts of\
      \ Mbulu might be at a similar latitude or slightly north but not the entirety\
      \ of the district being distinctly north, the answer leans towards a negative\
      \ due to the lack of significant northward positioning of the entire district\

      and then compare their positions.


      1. **Identify Azamgarh district''s location**: Azamgarh is a district in the
      state of Uttar Pradesh, India. Uttar Pradesh is a state in the northern part
      of India.


      2. **Identify Gauri Bazar''s location**: Gauri Bazar is a village in the Azamgarh
      district, Uttar Pradesh, India.


      3. **Compare their positions**: Since Gauri Bazar is a village within the Azamgarh
      district, they share the same geographical location. Both are in the Azamgarh
      district, which is in Uttar Pradesh, India.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that both Azamgarh district and Gauri Bazar are in

      the island of Ireland.


      2. **Location of Cookstown**: Cookstown is a town in County Tyrone, Northern
      Ireland, also located on the island of Ireland.


      3. **Comparison**: Both Coagh and Cookstown are in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland.
      This means they are relatively close to each other and both in the northern
      part of the island of Ireland.


      4. **North-South Positioning**: Given that both Coagh and Cookstown are in the
      same county in Northern Ireland, it''s likely that they are at similar latitudes.
      However, to be sure, we would need more precise information about their exact
      locations or a map to determine their relative positions.

      say if Coagh is located north of Cookstown. However, since they are in the same
      county and on the same island, it''s likely that they are at similar latitudes,

      \ States, near the border with Canada.\n   - Toretsk: Toretsk is a city in Donetsk\
      \ Oblast, Ukraine. Ukraine is a country in Eastern Europe.\n\n2. **Determine\
      \ the general geographic positions**:\n   - North Dakota is in the northern\
      \ part of the United States, with a latitude range of approximately 46\xB0N\
      \ to 49\xB0N.\n   - Ukraine is in Eastern Europe, with a latitude range of approximately\
      \ 44\xB0N to 52\xB0N. Toretsk is specifically located at around 48.4\xB0N latitude.\n\
      \n3. **Compare the positions**:\n   - Both locations are in the Northern Hemisphere,\
      \ but their longitudes differ significantly, with North Dakota in the Western\
      \ Hemisphere (around 100\xB0W) and Ukraine in the Eastern Hemisphere (around\

      \ ranges from about 44\xB0N to 52\xB0N, but Toretsk is specifically located\
      \ at around 48.4\xB0N latitude.\n   - **Longitude and General Geographic Position**:\
      \ While both are in the Northern Hemisphere, their longitudes differ significantly,\
      \ with North Dakota in the Western Hemisphere (around 100\xB0W) and Ukraine\
      \ in the Eastern Hemisphere (around 37\xB0E to 41\xB0E for the region of Toretsk).\n\
      \n4. **North-South Positioning**:\n   - Considering the latitudes, Maza, North\
      \ Dakota (being part of the United States) is generally at a higher latitude\
      \ than many parts of Ukraine but can be comparable or slightly higher than Toretsk's\
      \ latitude.\n   - Given the specific latitude of Toretsk (around 48.4\xB0N)\
      \ and considering North Dakota's range (approximately 47\xB0N to 49\xB0N), Maza\
      \ could indeed be north or south of Toretsk depending on its exact latitude.\n\
      \n5. **Conclusion**: Without the exact latitude of Maza, it's difficult to definitively\
      \ say. However, considering typical geographic scales and the fact that both\
      \ locations are in the Northern Hemisphere with Toretsk at 48.4\xB0N, if Maza\
      \ is anywhere in the typical range for North Dakota, it could be slightly north\
      \ or slightly south of Toretsk. But since North Dakota spans a range that could\
      \ place Maza north of Toretsk's latitude, and given the premise of the question,\
      \ we should consider if it's generally possible for Maza to be north of Toretsk\
      \ based on their geographic locations.\n\nGiven these considerations, the answer\
      \ to whether Maza, North Dakota is located north of Toretsk would depend on\
      \ the precise latitude of Maza within North Dakota. However, the question seems\
      \ to ask for a definitive yes or no based on the typical understanding of these\
      \ locations.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{YES}$\n\n"

      north of Deir Huwayt, we need to establish the locations of both places and
      then compare their positions.


      1. **Identify Qabu Shamsiyah''s Location**: Qabu Shamsiyah is a town in Syria.
      Syria is a country located in the Middle East, bordered by Lebanon, Turkey,
      Iraq, Jordan, and Israel.


      2. **Identify Deir Huwayt''s Location**: Deir Huwayt is also a town in Syria,
      but it''s unclear without more context if it''s the same town as Qabu Shamsiyah.
      If it''s a separate town, it would also be in Syria.


      3. **Compare Locations**: If Deir Huwayt is a separate town, and given that
      both towns are in Syria, we can assume they''re in the same general region.
      However, without more specific information about the exact locations of these
      towns within Syria, it''s challenging to determine if one is north of the other.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided, we can''t definitively
      say if Qabu Shamsiyah is located north of Deir Huwayt. The answer could be yes,
      no, or it might be the same location with different names. More specific details
