      3. **Relative Position:** Madura is just off the northeast coast of Java.  Therefore,
      the Madura Strait is east of Java and north of Bali (which is east of Java).
      Since Bali Sea is north of Bali and east of Java, and Madura Strait is further
      north and slightly further east, Madura Strait is indeed north of (a portion
      of) the Bali Sea.


      **Answer: YES**

      '
    fc4f8f73-fa0d-4c1f-8fbb-de8b00fd3617: '1. **Locate Bali Sea:** The Bali Sea is
      located between the islands of Bali to the west, Lombok to the east, Java to
      the south, and Kangean Island to the north.

      2. **Locate Madura Strait:** The Madura Strait is located between the islands
      of Java and Madura.  Madura is just north of East Java.

      3. **Relative Positions:** Since Madura is north of East Java, and the Bali
      Sea is east of East Java and north of *only* the southern portion of Java, the
      Madura Strait is indeed north of the *southern reach* of the Bali Sea, but not
      north of the *entire* Bali Sea.


      Therefore, the answer is partially yes, but overall **NO**.

      2. **Locate Four Mile Lake (Ontario):**  There are several lakes named Four
      Mile Lake in Ontario.  It''s important to determine which one is relevant to
      the question. Given the context of Upper Rideau Lake, it''s likely the Four
      Mile Lake near Westport, Ontario, that''s being referenced. This Four Mile Lake
      is also associated with the Rideau system.


      3. **Determine relative positions:** Consulting a map shows that Upper Rideau
      Lake is south of the Four Mile Lake near Westport.


      Answer: NO

      \ northerly location will have a higher latitude value.\n\n4. **Research Latitudes\
      \ (if you don't know them offhand):**  A quick search shows Upper Rideau Lake\

      which one has a higher latitude.  The lake with the higher latitude is further
      north.


      Using a map or geographic information system, I can determine the locations
      of both lakes.  Upper Rideau Lake is indeed north of Four Mile Lake (Ontario).

      2. **Locate Temescal Mountains:** The Temescal Mountains are located in Riverside

      3. **Compare Locations:** Asia is generally west of North America.  Islamabad
      is significantly further north than Riverside County, California. However, the
      question is whether the Margalla Hills are *north* of the Temescal Mountains.  While
      Islamabad is at a higher latitude, the concept of "north" becomes more complex
      when dealing with locations so far apart due to the curvature of the Earth.  For
      practical purposes, when considering locations on different continents, we generally
      use latitude to define "north".


      4. **Conclusion:** Since Islamabad (Margalla Hills) is at a higher latitude
      than Riverside County (Temescal Mountains), the Margalla Hills are north of
      the Temescal Mountains.

      North America.
