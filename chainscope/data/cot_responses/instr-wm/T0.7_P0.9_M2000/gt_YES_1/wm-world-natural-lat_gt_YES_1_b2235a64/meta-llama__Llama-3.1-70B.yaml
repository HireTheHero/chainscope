    f7f98f81-705a-4bcb-93d4-184fc9a829d2: 'To determine if the Transantarctic Mountains
      are located north of the Thiel Mountains, we need to understand the geographical
      positions of these mountain ranges:


      1. **Identify the Mountain Ranges**: The Transantarctic Mountains are a mountain
      range in Antarctica, while the Thiel Mountains are also located in Antarctica.


      2. **Understand the Geography of Antarctica**: Antarctica is a continent located
      at the southernmost point of the Earth. It is surrounded by the Southern Ocean
      and is characterized by extreme cold and vast ice sheets.


      3. **Consider the Relative Positions**: Since both mountain ranges are located
      in Antarctica, we need to consider their relative positions within the continent.
      The Transantarctic Mountains stretch across the continent, dividing it into
      East Antarctica and West Antarctica. The Thiel Mountains are located in the
      Pensacola Mountains, which are part of the Transantarctic Mountains.


      4. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Antarctica is unique in that it is
      located entirely in the Southern Hemisphere. There is no "north" or "south"
      in the traditional sense since the entire continent is south of the equator.
      Therefore, it''s more appropriate to discuss the relative positions of the mountain
      ranges in terms of their locations within Antarctica rather than using the conventional
      north-south terminology.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since the Thiel Mountains are part of the Transantarctic
      Mountains, they are not located north of the Transantarctic Mountains in the
      traditional sense of north-south orientation. They are part of the same mountain
      range.


      The answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      the islands of Java and Madura in Indonesia. The Bali Sea is a body of water
      located between the islands of Java and Bali in Indonesia.


      2. **Understand the Geography**: Both the Madura Strait and the Bali Sea are
      located within the same region of Indonesia. The Bali Sea is situated to the
      east of the Madura Strait.


      3. **Consider the Relative Positions**: The question asks if the Madura Strait
      is located north of the Bali Sea. However, since both are part of the same geographical
      region and are not directly north-south of each other, we need to consider their
      relative positions.


      4. **Determine the Direction**: If we consider the general direction of the
      Indonesian archipelago, which stretches from west to east, the Madura Strait
      is more to the west, and the Bali Sea is more to the east. This means that the
      Madura Strait is not directly north of the Bali Sea.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations and relative positions
      of the Madura Strait and the Bali Sea, the Madura Strait is not located north
      of the Bali Sea.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

      1. **Identify Ghoubbet-el-Kharab**: Ghoubbet-el-Kharab is a bay located in the
      Gulf of Tadjoura, which is part of the Gulf of Aden in the Horn of Africa. It
      is situated in Djibouti.


      2. **Identify Visayan Sea**: The Visayan Sea is a sea in the Philippines, located
      in the central part of the archipelago. It separates the Visayan Islands from
      the rest of the Philippines.


      3. **Understand Geography**: Djibouti, where Ghoubbet-el-Kharab is located,
      is in East Africa. The Philippines, where the Visayan Sea is located, is in
      Southeast Asia.

      range also in Ireland, located in the county of Wicklow.


      2. **Understand Relative Positions**: Ireland is a relatively small country,

      other. The Wicklow Mountains are located in the east of Ireland, while Lough
      Derg is situated more centrally.


      3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: When considering north-south orientation,
      we need to consider the geographical latitude. The Wicklow Mountains are situated
      at a higher latitude than Lough Derg, indicating that the mountains are indeed
      north of the lake.

      positions on the island. In this case, King Haakon Bay is located on the northwest
      side of South Georgia Island, while King Edward Cove is located on the northeast
      side. Therefore, King Haakon Bay is not strictly north of King Edward Cove in
      terms of global geography.
