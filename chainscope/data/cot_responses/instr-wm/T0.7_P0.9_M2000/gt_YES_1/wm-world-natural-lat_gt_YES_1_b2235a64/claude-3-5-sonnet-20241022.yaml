      - Lost Lake is near Santiam Pass in Linn County, Oregon, USA

      - Loughborough Lake is in Ontario, Canada


      2) Since one lake is in Canada and one is in Oregon:

      1) Great Western Tiers is a mountain range located in northern Tasmania, Australia.


      2) West Coast Range is a mountain range located in western Tasmania, Australia.


      3) Looking at a map of Tasmania:

      - Great Western Tiers runs east-west in the northern part of Tasmania

      - West Coast Range runs north-south along the western coast of Tasmania

      - Great Western Tiers is positioned more northerly than the West Coast Range


      4) Therefore, since Great Western Tiers is situated in a more northern position
      compared to West Coast Range...


      YES'
