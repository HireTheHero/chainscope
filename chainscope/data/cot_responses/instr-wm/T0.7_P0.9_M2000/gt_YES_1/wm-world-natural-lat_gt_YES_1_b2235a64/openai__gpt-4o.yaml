      1. **Transantarctic Mountains**: This is a major mountain range that extends
      across Antarctica, dividing East Antarctica from West Antarctica. It runs from
      the eastern coast near the Ross Sea to the western coast near the Weddell Sea.


      2. **Thiel Mountains**: This is a smaller mountain range located in West Antarctica,
      more specifically within the central part of the continent, south of the Ellsworth
      Mountains.


      Given these locations, the Transantarctic Mountains span a large longitudinal
      range across the continent, while the Thiel Mountains are located more centrally
      and to the south of the Ellsworth Mountains. Therefore, the Transantarctic Mountains,
      being a long range that stretches across the continent and reaching northern
      areas such as near the Ross Sea, are indeed located north of the Thiel Mountains.

      1. **Identify the location of Larne Lough**: Larne Lough is a sea lough located
      on the east coast of County Antrim, Northern Ireland, near the town of Larne.
      It opens into the North Channel.


      2. **Identify the location of Lough Beg**: Lough Beg is a small freshwater lake
      located in Northern Ireland, just to the north of Lough Neagh.


      3. **Compare their relative positions**: Lough Beg is positioned to the west
      of Larne Lough, as Lough Neagh is more inland compared to the coastal Larne
      Lough. To determine the north-south relationship, we look at the latitude: Lough
      Beg is slightly north of Lough Neagh, which is significantly more inland, while
      Larne Lough is closer to the coast.


      By checking their relative geographical positions, Larne Lough is actually south
      of Lough Beg.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.'

      at a latitude of 44 degrees North.

      - Pettit Lake, located in Idaho, is approximately at a latitude of 43.9 degrees

      Jodhpur in the state of Rajasthan, India.


      2. **Identify the Location of Lake Man**: Lake Man, also known as Lac de Man,
      is located in the city of Man in the western part of Ivory Coast, Africa.


      3. **Determine the Relative Positions**: Jodhpur, where Kaylana Lake is located,
      is situated at approximately 26 degrees North latitude. The city of Man, where
      Lake Man is located, is situated at approximately 7 degrees North latitude.


      4. **Comparison**: Since 26 degrees North is greater than 7 degrees North, Kaylana
      Lake is indeed situated north of Lake Man.


      Based on these steps, the answer is: **YES**.'

      Now, considering the geographic positions of these locations:


      - Palawan is to the west of the main islands of the Philippines, and Mount Mantalingajan
      is in the southern part of Palawan.

      - Mindanao is one of the southernmost islands in the Philippines, but Mount
      Balatukan is in its northern region.


      Thus, when comparing the relative north-south positions of these mountains within
      the Philippines:


      - Mount Balatukan, being in the northern part of Mindanao, is generally further
      north compared to Mount Mantalingajan, which is in the southern part of Palawan.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**, Mount Mantalingajan is not located north of
      Mount Balatukan.'
