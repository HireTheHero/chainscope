      in the northeastern part of New York State.


      2. **Locate Riverwood, KY:** Riverwood is a city in Jefferson County, Kentucky,
      which is part of the Louisville metropolitan area in the north-central part
      of Kentucky.


      3. **Determine their relative positions:** New York is generally located to
      the north of Kentucky. Specifically, Rensselaer County, NY, where Averill Park
      is located, is well north of Jefferson County, KY, where Riverwood is located.


      Given these considerations, Averill Park, NY is indeed located north of Riverwood,
      KY.
