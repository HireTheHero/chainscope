      1. **Identify the Locations**: The cities mentioned are East Mountain, TX, and
      Pearlington, MS.


      2. **Understand Geographic Direction**: "North" refers to the direction towards
      the North Pole, or the top of a map. If a location is "north" of another, it
      means it''s further up on a map.


      3. **Consider State Locations**: Texas (TX) is a state in the southern United
      States, while Mississippi (MS) is a state further east and slightly north of
      Texas.


      4. **Specific City Locations**: East Mountain, TX, is located in the northeastern
      part of Texas, while Pearlington, MS, is in the southern part of Mississippi.


      5. **Compare Positions**: Since Texas is generally west of Mississippi, it''s
      unlikely that a city in Texas would be north of a city in Mississippi. Additionally,
      East Mountain is in the northeastern part of Texas, while Pearlington is in
      the southern part of Mississippi.

      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of the United States, Texas
      is generally north of Florida. However, without knowing the exact locations
      of Las Quintas Fronterizas and Ojus, we can''t say for sure if Las Quintas Fronterizas
      is north of Ojus.


      Given the above steps and general knowledge, we can conclude that Las Quintas
      Fronterizas, TX, is likely north of Ojus, FL, but we can''t give a definitive
      answer without more specific information about the locations.


      The answer, based on the general geography of the United States, is: **LIKELY
      YES**.

      1. **Identify the states**: Bremerton is in Washington (WA), and Deadwood is
      in South Dakota (SD).


      2. **General geographical knowledge**: Washington is located in the northwestern
      United States, while South Dakota is in the central part of the country.


      3. **Specific locations within states**: Bremerton is in the western part of
      Washington state, near the coast. Deadwood is in the western part of South Dakota.


      4. **Latitude comparison**: Generally, Washington is at a higher latitude than
      South Dakota, meaning it is farther north. However, the exact latitude of each
      location would give a precise answer.


      5. **Conclusion based on general knowledge**: Without knowing the exact locations
      of Bremerton, WA, and Deadwood, SD, but understanding that Washington is generally
      north of South Dakota, we can infer that Bremerton, WA, is likely north of Deadwood,
      SD, based on state-level geography. However, for a definitive answer, exact
      city latitudes would be needed.


      Given these steps and the general knowledge that Washington is north of South
      Dakota, the answer to whether Bremerton, WA, is located north of Deadwood, SD,
      is likely YES, but remember, this is based on state-level geography rather than
      exact city locations.

      \ States, while Pennsylvania is in the northeastern part of the country.\n\n\
      2. **Consider the general latitude of each state**: Wyoming is generally north\
