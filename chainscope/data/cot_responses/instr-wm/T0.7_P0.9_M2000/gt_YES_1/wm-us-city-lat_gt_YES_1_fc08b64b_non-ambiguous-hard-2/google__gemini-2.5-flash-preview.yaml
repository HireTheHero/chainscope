      3.  **Infer the relative location of places within those states:** Since Virginia
      is generally north of Georgia, a specific location in Virginia (McLean) is likely
      to be north of a specific location in Georgia (Berry College).

      4.  **Confirm with a quick mental check or knowledge:** McLean, VA is in Northern
      Virginia, just outside Washington D.C. Berry College is near Rome, GA, in the
      northwestern part of the state. This confirms the general north-south relationship
      holds for these specific places.


      Therefore, McLean, VA is located north of Berry College, GA.

      asks about East Prospect, PA and Kellyville, OK.

      2.  **Determine the approximate latitude of East Prospect, PA:** Pennsylvania
      is a northern state in the US. East Prospect is in the southern part of central
      PA. Its latitude is roughly around 40 degrees North.

      3.  **Determine the approximate latitude of Kellyville, OK:** Oklahoma is a
      southern state in the US. Kellyville is in the northeastern part of the state.
      Its latitude is roughly around 36 degrees North.

      4.  **Compare the latitudes:** 40 degrees North is a higher number (further
      north) than 36 degrees North.

      5.  **Conclusion:** East Prospect, PA is located at a higher latitude than Kellyville,
      OK, meaning it is further north.

    55a37901-3ead-456b-99a8-f9bc3826608b: '1.  **Identify the locations:** We need
      to compare the locations of East Prospect, PA and Kellyville, OK.

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** Pennsylvania (PA) is in
      the northeastern United States. Oklahoma (OK) is in the south-central United
      States.

      3.  **Determine the general relative position of the states:** Pennsylvania
      is significantly north and east of Oklahoma.

      4.  **Consider the specific cities within the states:** While cities within
      a state can vary in latitude, the states themselves are geographically quite
      separate and the general north-south relationship between PA and OK is very
      strong. It''s highly improbable that a city in Oklahoma would be located north
      of a city in Pennsylvania.

      5.  **Confirm the latitude (optional but helpful):** A quick check confirms
      that East Prospect, PA is around 40.0 degrees North latitude, while Kellyville,
      OK is around 35.9 degrees North latitude. A higher latitude number means further
      north.


      Therefore, East Prospect, PA is located north of Kellyville, OK.


      YES'
    61473bd7-dfd8-4380-b598-6fd6f051b0db: 'Here''s the step-by-step reasoning to answer
      the question:


      1.  **Identify the locations:** The question asks about East Prospect, PA, and
      Kellyville, OK.

      2.  **Determine the states:** East Prospect is in Pennsylvania (PA). Kellyville
      is in Oklahoma (OK).

      3.  **Mentally visualize the relative positions of the states:** Where are Pennsylvania
      and Oklahoma located in the United States relative to each other? Pennsylvania
      is in the northeastern part of the US. Oklahoma is in the south-central part
      of the US.

      4.  **Consider the general latitude:** Because Pennsylvania is in the northeast
      and Oklahoma is in the south-central region, Pennsylvania is generally much
      further north than Oklahoma.

      5.  **Apply this general knowledge to the specific cities:** If the state of
      Pennsylvania is generally north of the state of Oklahoma, then a city within
      Pennsylvania (East Prospect) is highly likely to be north of a city within Oklahoma
      (Kellyville). There are exceptions to this kind of reasoning if the states were
      positioned very differently (e.g., comparing a northern city in a southern state
      to a southern city in a northern state near the border), but in this case, PA
      is clearly and significantly north of OK.

      6.  **Confirm (optional but good practice):** You could quickly check a map
      or search for the latitudes. East Prospect, PA is around 40.0 degrees North
      latitude. Kellyville, OK is around 35.9 degrees North latitude. A higher North
      latitude means further north. 40.0 is greater than 35.9.


      Therefore, East Prospect, PA is located north of Kellyville, OK.


      The answer is clearly YES.

      roughly in the center-north of the United States. California is on the West
      Coast, roughly in the southwest of the United States.

      4.  **Visualize or recall the map:** California is significantly to the west
      of Iowa. More importantly for the north/south comparison, California extends
      much further south than Iowa. Iowa is roughly aligned latitude-wise with states
      like Nebraska, Illinois, and Indiana. California extends from the latitude of
      southern Oregon down to the latitude of northern Mexico.

      5.  **Compare latitudes:** Since California is generally south and west of Iowa,
      it''s highly likely that Florin, CA will be south of Columbus Junction, IA.
      Let''s confirm by roughly placing them on a mental map or looking up their latitudes
      if necessary (though the general state positions are usually sufficient for
      this kind of question). Columbus Junction, IA is around 41.3 degrees North.
      Florin, CA is around 38.5 degrees North.
