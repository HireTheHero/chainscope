      To answer this, we need to understand the locations of both cities. Talco, TX
      is located in the north central part of the state of Texas, while Timber Pines,
      FL is located in the south central part of the state of Florida.


      Now, let''s consider the regions of Texas and Florida. Texas is located in the
      south central part of the United States, while Florida is located in the south
      eastern part of the United States.


      Therefore, Talco, TX is located in the north central part of Texas, while Timber

      of West Virginia.

      **

      **Step 3:** Nebraska and West Virginia are two separate states, and they are
      not adjacent.

      **

      **Therefore, the answer is NO.**

      **

      **Explanation:**

      **

      **Chadron, NE is located in the northern part of the state of Nebraska. Falling
      Waters, WV is located in the northern part of the state of West Virginia. Both
      of these cities are located in the northern regions of their respective states.
      However, Nebraska and West Virginia are two separate states, and they are not
      adjacent. Therefore, Chadron, NE cannot be located north of Falling Waters,
      WV.**

    2cbd2849-34bb-4f68-9f78-267c29038c91: 'The first step is to understand the concept
      of "north" and "south". North is the direction opposite to the direction of
      the sun''s movement, and south is the direction opposite to that. So if you''re
      in the northern hemisphere, the north direction is to the right of you, and
      the south direction is to the left.

      The second step is to understand the concept of "states" and "counties". States
      are the largest political divisions in the United States, and counties are smaller
      divisions within states.

      So if you''re in Stirling, NJ, and you want to know if it''s located north of
      Salt Creek, CO, you''d have to determine the location of Stirling, NJ in relation
      to Salt Creek, CO, and then use that information to determine if Stirling is
      located north of Salt Creek.

      The third step is to use a map to visualize the location of Stirling, NJ in
      relation to Salt Creek, CO. You can use a map of the United States, or a map
      of New Jersey, to determine where Stirling is located in relation to Salt Creek,
      CO.

      Once you''ve determined the location of Stirling, NJ, you can then determine
      if it''s located north of Salt Creek, CO by comparing the location of Stirling,
      NJ to the location of Salt Creek, CO on the map. If Stirling is located north
      of Salt Creek, then the answer is yes, and if Stirling is located south of Salt
      Creek, then the answer is no.

      So in conclusion, the answer to the question is yes, Stirling, NJ is located
