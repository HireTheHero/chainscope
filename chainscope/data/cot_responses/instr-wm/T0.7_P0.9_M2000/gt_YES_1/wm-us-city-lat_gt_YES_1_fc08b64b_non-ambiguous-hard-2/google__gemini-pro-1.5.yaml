    41122657-f078-4adc-93ce-389629ba58eb: '1. **Locate Stantonsburg, NC:** Stantonsburg
      is in North Carolina, a state on the east coast of the US.

      2. **Locate Notasulga, AL:** Notasulga is in Alabama, a state in the southeastern
      US.

      3. **Compare latitudes:**  North Carolina is generally north of Alabama.

      4. **Consider exceptions:** While it''s generally true that NC is north of AL,
      it''s possible for a city in southern NC to be south of a city in northern AL.  However,
      this is less likely.


      Since North Carolina is significantly north of Alabama, it is very likely Stantonsburg
      is north of Notasulga.


      YES

    48e4e007-acff-4e9d-9003-134c2cad78f7: '1. **Stantonsburg, NC''s location:** North
      Carolina is generally north of Alabama.  Therefore, Stantonsburg is likely north
      of Notasulga.


      2. **Notasulga, AL''s location:**  While Alabama is south of North Carolina,
      it''s possible, though unlikely, that Notasulga is in the very northernmost
      part of Alabama, and Stantonsburg is in the very southernmost part of North
      Carolina, making Notasulga slightly north.  However, this is less probable given
      the general location of the states.


      3. **Confirmation (optional):** A quick map check confirms that Stantonsburg,
      NC is significantly north of Notasulga, AL.

      2. **Notasulga, AL:** Alabama is a state in the southeastern US, west of Georgia.

      3. **General Location:** North Carolina is generally north of Alabama.

      4. **Specific Locations Needed?:**  While NC is generally north of AL, cities
      in southern NC *could* be south of cities in northern AL.  However, Notasulga
      is fairly central in Alabama.  Stantonsburg is in the eastern half of NC.

      5. **Conclusion:**  Given the general locations of the states and the lack of
      extreme north/south placement of the cities within their states, it''s highly
      likely Stantonsburg, NC is north of Notasulga, AL.

      of La Plata,  eastern Pennsylvania stretches fairly south, and Maryland has
      some western areas that stretch north.  However, East Bangor is quite far north

      to being further north or south, in this case comparing a western state with
      an eastern state makes it highly likely Pine Haven is North of North Belle Vernon.
