      of Pulau Indah, we need to identify the geographical locations of both places.


      1. **Identify Pulau Indah**: Pulau Indah is an island located in Malaysia, near

      2. **Identify Ghasm**: Ghasm is a lesser-known location and is not widely recognized
      in geographical databases. It is important to establish its coordinates or relative
      location to Pulau Indah.


      3. **Determine Relative Positions**: If we can find the location of Ghasm, we
      can then compare its latitude and longitude to that of Pulau Indah. If Ghasm
      has a higher latitude than Pulau Indah, it is to the north; if it has a lower
      latitude, it is to the south.


      Since the location of Ghasm is not well-documented in common geographical references,
      it is difficult to accurately determine its position relative to Pulau Indah
      without specific data.


      Based on the lack of information about Ghasm, I cannot definitively conclude

      2. **Locate Charodinsky District**: Charodinsky District is not a widely recognized

      - Ranau is in Malaysia (southern hemisphere).


      Since Bhagalpur is located in India and Ranau is in Malaysia, Bhagalpur is significantly
      north of Ranau.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.'
    c91a1d52-4b8a-434e-ba83-a8d0449e0454: 'To determine if Bhagalpur division is located
      north of Ranau District, we need to establish the geographic locations of both
      places.


      1. **Bhagalpur Division**: This is a division in the state of Bihar, India,
      situated in the eastern part of the country. Bhagalpur is known for its historical
      significance and is located near the Ganges River.


      2. **Ranau District**: This is a district located in the state of Sabah, Malaysia.
      It is situated in the northern part of the island of Borneo.


      Now, we compare the two locations:


      - Bhagalpur is in India, while Ranau is in Malaysia.

      - Given that they are in different countries, we need to consider their relative
      positions on the globe.


      When we look at the map, India (including Bhagalpur) is located to the northwest
      of Malaysia (including Ranau). Therefore, Bhagalpur cannot be north of Ranau;
      it is actually to the northwest.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:


      **NO**.'

      Given that Bhagalpur division is in India and Ranau District is in Malaysia,

      1. **Identify Amethi District**: Amethi is a district in the state of Uttar
      Pradesh, India. It is situated in the northern part of the country.


      2. **Identify Bitterley**: Bitterley is a small village located in England,
      specifically in the county of Shropshire.


      3. **Geographical Comparison**: We now need to compare the locations of Bitterley
      and Amethi. Amethi is in India, and Bitterley is in England, which are in different
      countries and separated by a significant distance.


      4. **North-South Positioning**: Since Bitterley is located in England and Amethi
      is in India, it does not make sense to consider whether one is north of the
      other in the traditional geographical sense, as they are in different regions
      of the world.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question "Is Bitterley located north
      of Amethi district?" is:


      **NO**.'

      while Amethi (in India) is also in the northern hemisphere but significantly
      farther south.


      4. **Conclusion on Location**: Since Bitterley is located in England and Amethi
      is located in India, they are in different countries and continents. However,
      if we strictly consider their latitudinal positions, Bitterley is located at
      a higher latitude compared to Amethi, which means Bitterley is indeed to the

      3. **Determine their relative locations**: Quetta is situated in South Asia,
      while Cheb is in Europe. Due to the vast distance and the geographical separation
      between these two regions, we cannot directly compare their north-south positions.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Cheb District is in a different continent than Quetta
      District, it is not relevant to determine if one is north of the other in a
      traditional sense.


      Thus, the answer to whether Cheb District is located north of Quetta District
      is:


      NO.'
