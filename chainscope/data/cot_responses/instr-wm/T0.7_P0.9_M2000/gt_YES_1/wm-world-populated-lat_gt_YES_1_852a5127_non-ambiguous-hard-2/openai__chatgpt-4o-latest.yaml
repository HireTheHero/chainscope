      \ north of San Isidro, Para\xF1aque, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1.\
      \ **Identify Barlanark**: Barlanark is a district located in the city of Glasgow,\
      \ which is in Scotland, United Kingdom. This places it in the Northern Hemisphere\
      \ and in Europe.\n\n2. **Identify San Isidro, Para\xF1aque**: San Isidro is\
      \ a barangay (neighborhood) in Para\xF1aque City, which is part of Metro Manila\
      \ in the Philippines. The Philippines is located in Southeast Asia, also in\
      \ the Northern Hemisphere but much closer to the equator compared to the UK.\n\
      \n3. **Compare Geographic Locations**:\n   - Glasgow, Scotland (Barlanark) is\

      \ (San Isidro) is located at a latitude of approximately 14.47\xB0 N.\n\n4.\
      \ **Determine Relative Position**: Since 55.86\xB0 N (Barlanark) is significantly\
