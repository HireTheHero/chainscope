    8f1ee0f1-7abb-47a7-b16c-7d983278b6de: 'Okay, let''s break this down:


      1.  **Locate Bayview, Northern Territory:** Bayview is a suburb of Darwin, which
      is the capital city of the Northern Territory. Darwin is located on the northern
      coast of Australia.


      2.  **Locate Wattle Range Council:** Wattle Range Council is a local government
      area in the Limestone Coast region of South Australia. This is in the southeastern
      part of South Australia.


      3.  **Compare their latitudes/general positions:** The Northern Territory is,
      as its name suggests, in the northern part of Australia. South Australia is,
      as its name suggests, in the southern part of Australia. Therefore, any location
      in the Northern Territory will generally be north of any location in South Australia.


      4.  **Conclusion:** Since Bayview is in the Northern Territory and Wattle Range
      Council is in South Australia, Bayview is north of Wattle Range Council.
