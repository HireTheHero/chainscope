      Pennsylvania is clearly to the north of North Carolina.


      4.  **Consider if there''s any unusual geographical quirk that would place a
      specific point in northern North Carolina *north* of a specific point in southern
      Pennsylvania:** While states aren''t perfect rectangles, the general north-south
      relationship holds true for the vast majority of locations within them. Indiana,
      PA is in the western-central part of Pennsylvania, and Boiling Springs, NC is
      in the western part of North Carolina. There''s no significant curvature or
      extreme southern/northern extension of either state that would reverse their
      relative latitudinal positions in this specific comparison.


      Therefore, a location in Pennsylvania will be north of a location in North Carolina.

      3.  **Compare their general locations:** Maine is a state directly to the north
      of Rhode Island (though Massachusetts is in between). Bangor, ME is in the central
      part of Maine. Smithfield, RI is in the northern part of Rhode Island.

      4.  **Determine relative latitude:** Since Maine is generally north of Rhode
      Island, and Bangor is further north within Maine than Smithfield is within Rhode
      Island, Husson University will be at a higher latitude (further north) than
      Bryant University.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      **YES**'

      determine if the University of Scranton, PA is located north of Old Dominion
      University (ODU) in Norfolk, VA.


      **Step 1: Locate University of Scranton, PA.**

      Scranton, Pennsylvania is in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania.


      **Step 2: Locate Old Dominion University (ODU), VA.**

      Old Dominion University is located in Norfolk, Virginia. Norfolk is in the southeastern
      part of Virginia, on the coast.


      **Step 3: Compare Latitudes.**

      To determine if one location is "north" of another, we primarily look at latitude.
      A higher latitude (a larger positive number for locations in the Northern Hemisphere)
      means it''s further north.


      *   **Scranton, PA:** Approximately 41.40 degrees North latitude.

      *   **Norfolk, VA (ODU):** Approximately 36.88 degrees North latitude.


      **Step 4: Conclusion based on Latitude.**

      Since 41.40 is a larger number than 36.88, Scranton, PA, is at a higher (more
      northerly) latitude than Norfolk, VA.

      1. **Locate Harding University, AR:** Harding University is in Searcy, Arkansas.

      2. **Locate Alcorn State University, MS:** Alcorn State University is near Lorman,
      Mississippi.


      Now, let''s compare their general geographical positions:


      *   **Searcy, AR:** Is in the central part of Arkansas.

      *   **Lorman, MS:** Is in the southwestern part of Mississippi, fairly close
      to the Mississippi River and the Louisiana border.


      If you visualize a map, Arkansas is directly north of Louisiana. Mississippi
      is to the east of Louisiana. Lorman, MS is quite far south in Mississippi. Searcy,
      AR is in the middle of Arkansas.


      Therefore, Searcy, AR is clearly further north than Lorman, MS.
