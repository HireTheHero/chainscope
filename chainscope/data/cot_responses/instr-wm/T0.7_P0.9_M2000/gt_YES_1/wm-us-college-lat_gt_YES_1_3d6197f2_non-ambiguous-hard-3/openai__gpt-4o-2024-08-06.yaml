      \ at a latitude of 44.9\xB0 N.\n   - Cedar Falls, Iowa, is approximately at\
      \ a latitude of 42.5\xB0 N.\n\n3. **Compare the latitudes:**\n   - Since 44.9\xB0\
      \ N (Wausau) is greater than 42.5\xB0 N (Cedar Falls), Wausau is indeed north\
      \ of Cedar Falls.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is YES."
