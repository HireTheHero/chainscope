      \ for both.\n\n\n**Determining Latitude Coordinates**\n\nI've successfully identified\
      \ the locations of both institutions: Thomas More University in Crestview Hills,\
      \ KY (approximately 39.0\xB0 N) and the former Southern Polytechnic State University,\
      \ now KSU-Marietta, in Marietta, GA (approximately 33.9\xB0 N). Comparing these,\
      \ the initial calculations indicate Thomas More is indeed further north. My\

      \ latitude confirms my conclusion: 39.0\xB0 N is indeed greater than 33.9\xB0\
      \ N, making Thomas More University geographically further north. The conclusion\
      \ is clear: YES, Thomas More University is north of Southern Polytechnic State\
      \ University.\n\n\n</think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  First,\
      \ we need to locate Thomas More University. A quick search shows it is in Crestview\

      \ This university merged with Kennesaw State University in 2015, and its former\
      \ campus is in Marietta, Georgia.\n3.  Finally, we compare the locations. The\
      \ state of Kentucky is located geographically north of the state of Georgia.\

      \ I determined Muncie's latitude to be approximately 40.19\xB0 N, and Owensboro's\
      \ to be 37.77\xB0 N. Because 40.19\xB0 N is higher, I've concluded that Muncie\
      \ is north of Owensboro. Therefore, Ball State is north of Western Kentucky-Owensboro.\
      \ The definitive answer is yes.\n\n\n</think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\
      \n1.  **Identify the location of Ball State University:** Ball State University\
      \ is located in Muncie, Indiana.\n2.  **Identify the location of Western Kentucky\
      \ University-Owensboro:** This campus is located in Owensboro, Kentucky.\n3.\
      \  **Determine the relative geographic positions:** We need to compare the latitude\
      \ of Muncie, Indiana, with the latitude of Owensboro, Kentucky.\n4.  **Find\
      \ the latitudes:**\n    *   The latitude of Muncie, IN, is approximately 40.19\xB0\
      \ N.\n    *   The latitude of Owensboro, KY, is approximately 37.77\xB0 N.\n\
      5.  **Compare the latitudes:** A higher latitude number in the Northern Hemisphere\
      \ means a location is farther north. Since 40.19\xB0 is greater than 37.77\xB0\
      , Muncie, Indiana, is north of Owensboro, Kentucky.\n\nTherefore, Ball State\
      \ University is located north of Western Kentucky University-Owensboro.\n\n\

      longitude of Portland and West Haven, obtained from a reliable source, to determine
      the north/south relationship. My next step will involve visualizing these locations
      on a map.



      **Assessing State Locations**


      I''ve moved from just finding the cities to a higher-level comparison. My focus
      shifted to the states. Realizing that the state locations are key, I''m now
      focusing on confirming their relative positions. My prior knowledge of the New
      England states confirmed Maine''s northern positioning relative to Connecticut.
      This allows me to confidently state the conclusion.



      **Developing a Logical Flow**


      I''ve broken down the problem into manageable steps. I am now outlining each
      step, starting with identifying the institutions'' locations (Portland, Maine,
      and West Haven, Connecticut). My current task is ensuring the logic of each
      step is clear and defensible, including using a series of location comparisons
      to logically lead the reader to the conclusion.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Step 1:** Find the location of the Institute for Doctoral Studies in the
      Visual Arts, ME. The administrative headquarters for this institution are located
      in Portland, Maine.

      2.  **Step 2:** Find the location of the University of New Haven, CT. This university
      is located in West Haven, Connecticut.

      3.  **Step 3:** Compare the two locations. The state of Maine is geographically
      located to the northeast of the state of Connecticut. Therefore, Portland, Maine
      is north of West Haven, Connecticut.

      I''ve zeroed in on the core of the query. My next step is to break it down.
      I''ll need to find the precise latitude and longitude for both IDSVA and the
      University of New Haven. Once I have those coordinates, I can compare them directly
      to determine relative geographic positions.



      **Determining Coordinates**


      I''ve successfully pinpointed the address for IDSVA: 97A Exchange Street, Portland,
      ME. Next, I''ll use a mapping service to obtain the precise latitude and longitude.
      Once those coordinates are locked in, I''ll tackle the University of New Haven,
      employing the same strategy to find its geographical data. I''m confident I
      can wrap this up efficiently.



      **Analyzing Latitude and Longitude**


      I''ve already dug up the locations, and I''m looking into how to present the
      data logically. My next step involves comparing the coordinates. I plan to retrieve
      the latitude and longitude values for both locations and then compare them.
      I believe I can determine the geographic relationship effectively and communicate
      it clearly, confirming my initial assessment.



      **Formulating a Clear Response**


      I''ve outlined the steps and now I''m synthesizing the rationale, ensuring it''s
      easy to follow. I''ll present the answer in a concise, step-by-step format to
      justify my conclusion. I''m also including latitude comparisons to reinforce
      my answer with factual data to confirm that Portland is north of West Haven.



      **Summarizing the Rationale**


      I''ve streamlined my approach by boiling it down to essential steps for the
      response. I''m working to structure the answer logically, from defining the
      question and breaking it down to identifying locations in each state. The framework
      is now complete, and I''ll provide the final answer along with the crucial comparison.

      2.  **Identify the location of the second institution:** The University of New
      Haven is located in West Haven, Connecticut.

      3.  **Compare the locations:** The state of Maine is geographically located
      entirely north of the state of Connecticut. Therefore, Portland, Maine, is north
      of West Haven, Connecticut.

      I''m currently focused on defining the geographic locations. First, I need to
      pinpoint the exact coordinates of Central Methodist University in Missouri.
      Once I have that, I''ll move on to establishing the location of Arkansas State
      University Paragould in Arkansas.



      **Determining Geographic Relationships**


      I''ve made significant progress! I''ve broken down the problem: identifying
      the core question, and breaking down the problem into smaller steps. First I''ve
      worked to locate Central Methodist University and Arkansas State University,
      and I''ve found their approximate latitudes. Now, I''m comparing those latitudes.



      **Concluding the Analysis**


      I''ve completed the analysis, and my reasoning is refined. I''ve concluded that
      Central Methodist University in Fayette, MO, is geographically north of Arkansas
      State University Paragould. My thinking involved pinpointing the locations,
      comparing their latitudes, and concluding Missouri is north of Arkansas. I simplified
      the logic for a more intuitive answer. The final answer will clearly present
      this conclusion.



      **Analyzing the Solution**


      The reasoning is refined and a simpler, more intuitive logic is now used. I
      determined that because Missouri is entirely north of Arkansas, any location
      in Missouri is geographically north of any location in Arkansas. This simplifies
      the solution, eliminating the need for specific latitude comparisons. The final
      answer will clearly present this conclusion.

      1.  First, we identify the location of Central Methodist University. Its main
      campus is in Fayette, Missouri.

      2.  Next, we identify the location of Arkansas State University Paragould. It
      is in Paragould, Arkansas.

      3.  We then compare the geographical locations of the two states. The state
      of Missouri is located entirely north of the state of Arkansas.

      4.  Therefore, Fayette, Missouri, is geographically north of Paragould, Arkansas.

      I've zeroed in on the core question: Is Wisconsin-Marathon County north of Northern\
      \ Iowa? I'm now breaking down the task by deconstructing the locations geographically.\
      \ This involves mapping and understanding the relative positioning.\n\n\n**Analyzing\
      \ Latitude Coordinates**\n\nI've pinpointed the exact cities for each university:\
      \ Wausau, Wisconsin, and Cedar Falls, Iowa. I've also identified their respective\
      \ latitudes, roughly 44.96\xB0 N and 42.51\xB0 N. This data confirms that Wausau,\
      \ and by extension, UW-Marathon County, is indeed further north than Cedar Falls\
      \ and the University of Northern Iowa. Therefore, the answer is clear.\n\n\n\
      **Formulating a Logical Argument**\n\nI've assembled the pieces, meticulously\
      \ checking the latitude data for Wausau and Cedar Falls. The comparison is complete,\
      \ and the evidence points definitively to Wausau's northern position. I'm now\
      \ crafting a clear, concise step-by-step argument to support the \"yes\" answer.\n\
      \n\n</think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the location\
      \ of the first university:** The University of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon County\
      \ is located in Wausau, Wisconsin.\n2.  **Identify the location of the second\
      \ university:** The University of Northern Iowa is located in Cedar Falls, Iowa.\n\
      3.  **Compare the latitudes of the two cities:** Wausau, WI is at a latitude\
      \ of approximately 44.96\xB0 N. Cedar Falls, IA is at a latitude of approximately\
      \ 42.51\xB0 N.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since a higher latitude number indicates\
      \ a more northerly position, Wausau, WI is north of Cedar Falls, IA.\n\nYES"
