      College (NWTC):** NWTC is in Wisconsin, specifically the northeastern part of
      the state, bordering Lake Michigan''s western shore.


      2. **Locate Lake Michigan College (LMC):** LMC is in Michigan, specifically
      the southwestern part of the state, bordering Lake Michigan''s eastern shore.


      3. **Relative positions:** Wisconsin is west of Michigan.  Therefore, anything
      in eastern Wisconsin is still south of anything in western Michigan.


      4. **Conclusion:** NWTC is south of LMC, not north.

    14cb38f2-3a47-4b8a-b2d7-6206a25d3b11: '1. **Locate Northeast Wisconsin Technical
      College (NWTC):**  NWTC is in Wisconsin, likely in the northeastern part of
      the state.


      2. **Locate Lake Michigan College (LMC):** LMC is in Michigan, likely near Lake
      Michigan.  Specifically, it''s in Benton Harbor, in the southwest corner of
      the state.


      3. **Visualize Lake Michigan:** Lake Michigan sits between Wisconsin and Michigan.


      4. **Relative Positions:**  Northeast Wisconsin is, as the name suggests, north
      and east. Southwest Michigan is, as its name implies, south and west. Anything
      in northeast Wisconsin would be north of anything in southwest Michigan.


      5. **Conclusion:**  NWTC is north of LMC.

      College (NWTC):**  NWTC is in Wisconsin, specifically the northeastern part
      of the state, as its name suggests.  This places it on the western side of Lake
      Michigan.


      2. **Locate Lake Michigan College (LMC):** LMC is in Michigan, on the shores
      of Lake Michigan.  Since Michigan is east of Wisconsin, and the college is named
      after the lake, it''s safe to assume it''s on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan.


      3. **Determine relative positions:** NWTC is west of Lake Michigan, and LMC
      is east of Lake Michigan.

      Michigan is east of Lake Michigan.


      3. **Relative Positions:** Since Wisconsin is *west* of Lake Michigan and Michigan
      is *east* of Lake Michigan, NWTC must be south (and west) of LMC.

      2. **Locate Lake Michigan College (LMC):** LMC is in Michigan, on the east side
      of Lake Michigan.


      3. **Relative Positions:** Wisconsin is west of Michigan, and therefore NWTC
      is west of LMC.  North and south are irrelevant in this case as the question
      is about which is *north* of the other.  Since NWTC is west of LMC, it cannot
      be north of it.

      College (NWTC):**  NWTC is in Wisconsin, as the name suggests, specifically
      the northeast part of the state.  This puts it on the western side/shore of

      2. **Locate Lake Michigan College (LMC):** LMC is in Michigan, on the eastern
      side/shore of Lake Michigan.


      3. **Relative Positions:** Since Wisconsin is west of Lake Michigan and Michigan
      is east of it, NWTC (west) must be *south* of LMC (east) to be on the same latitude.  Being
      further north would put NWTC in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and we know
      it''s in Wisconsin.
