      NO


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me verify this more carefully:


      Wisconsin is indeed north of Indiana. Milwaukee (where Wisconsin Lutheran College
      is located) is in the southeastern part of Wisconsin, and Huntington (where
      Huntington University is located) is in the northeastern part of Indiana.


      Since Wisconsin is entirely north of Indiana geographically, any point in Wisconsin
      would be north of any point in Indiana.


      Therefore, Wisconsin Lutheran College is north of Huntington University.

      - Norfolk is in the southeastern part of Virginia, near the coast

      - This further increases the north-south distance between them


      Since Pennsylvania is north of Virginia, and Scranton is in northern PA while
      Norfolk is in southern VA, the University of Scranton is definitely located
      north of Old Dominion University.

      - Maine is located north of Connecticut in the United States

      - Portland, ME is in southern Maine

      - West Haven, CT is in southern Connecticut


      Step 3: Compare their specific locations.

      - Even though both are in the southern parts of their respective states, Maine
      itself is entirely north of Connecticut on the map of the United States.

      - Therefore, Portland, ME (where IDSVA is located) is north of West Haven, CT
      (where University of New Haven is located)

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts (IDSVA) is in Maine (ME)

      - University of New Haven is in Connecticut (CT)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of Maine and Connecticut.

      - Maine is located in the northeastern United States

      - Connecticut is also in the northeastern United States, but south of Maine

      - Maine borders New Hampshire to its south, and New Hampshire borders Connecticut
      to its north


      Step 3: Confirm the north-south relationship.

      - Maine is definitively north of Connecticut on a map of the United States

      - Therefore, any institution in Maine would be north of any institution in Connecticut


      Since IDSVA is in Maine and University of New Haven is in Connecticut, and Maine
      is north of Connecticut, the Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts
      is located north of University of New Haven.

      - Oklahoma State University-Oklahoma City is in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma

      - McMurry University is in Abilene, Texas


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these cities.

      - Oklahoma is a state that is directly north of Texas

      - Oklahoma City is in central Oklahoma

      - Abilene, Texas is in west-central Texas


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a north-south axis.

      - Since Oklahoma borders Texas to the north, cities in Oklahoma will generally
      be north of cities in Texas
