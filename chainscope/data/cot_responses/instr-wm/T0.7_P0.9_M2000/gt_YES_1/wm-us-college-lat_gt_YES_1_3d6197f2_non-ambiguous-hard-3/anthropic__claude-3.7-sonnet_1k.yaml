      to determine the relative geographic locations of Calvin University in Michigan
      and Wittenberg University in Ohio.


      Step 1: Determine where Calvin University is located in Michigan.

      Calvin University is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan.


      Step 2: Determine where Wittenberg University is located in Ohio.

      Wittenberg University is located in Springfield, Ohio.


      Step 3: Determine the relative north-south positioning of these cities.

      Grand Rapids, MI is in the western part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula, which
      is generally in the northern part of the Midwest.

      Springfield, OH is in western Ohio, which is south of Michigan.


      Looking at a mental map of the United States, Michigan is entirely north of
      Ohio. The entire state of Michigan is north of Ohio, so any city in Michigan
      (including Grand Rapids) would be north of any city in Ohio (including Springfield).</think>I
      need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Calvin University is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan

      - Wittenberg University is located in Springfield, Ohio


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Michigan and Ohio.

      Michigan is positioned entirely north of Ohio. The southern border of Michigan
      connects with the northern border of Ohio.


      Step 3: Compare the specific cities.

      Grand Rapids, MI (where Calvin is located) is well within Michigan''s territory.

      Springfield, OH (where Wittenberg is located) is in the western part of Ohio.


      Since Michigan is geographically north of Ohio, and Calvin University is in
      Michigan while Wittenberg University is in Ohio, Calvin University must be north
      of Wittenberg University.

      I''ll need to think about the geographical locations of Wisconsin and Indiana
      states, and then more specifically the locations of these colleges within their
      states.


      First, let''s consider the states:

      - Wisconsin is located north of Indiana in the United States. Wisconsin borders
      the upper part of Lake Michigan, while Indiana is further south, bordering the
      lower part of Lake Michigan.


      Now, let''s think about the specific locations of these colleges:

      - Wisconsin Lutheran College is in Wisconsin, likely in or near Milwaukee

      - Huntington University is in Indiana, probably in a city called Huntington


      Since Wisconsin is entirely north of Indiana on the map, any location in Wisconsin
      would be north of any location in Indiana. Therefore, Wisconsin Lutheran College
      would be north of Huntington University.


      Let me double-check this reasoning: Even if Wisconsin Lutheran College were

      northernmost part of Indiana, Wisconsin Lutheran College would still be north
      of Huntington University because Wisconsin is entirely north of Indiana.</think>I

      Wisconsin is located north of Indiana in the US Midwest. Wisconsin borders the
      upper part of Lake Michigan, while Indiana is further south, bordering the lower
      part of Lake Michigan.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations of these colleges within their states.

      Wisconsin Lutheran College is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

      Huntington University is located in Huntington, Indiana.

      their geographic locations.


      First, I know that Washington state is entirely north of California on the west
      coast of the United States. Washington borders Oregon to its south, and Oregon
      borders California to its south.


      Saint Martin''s University is in Washington state, so it must be north of any

      - Washington borders Oregon to its south, and Oregon borders California to its
      south


      Step 3: Even though Cal Poly Humboldt is in northern California (Humboldt County),
      it''s still within California state boundaries.


      Step 4: Since any location in Washington state is north of any location in California,
      Saint Martin''s University must be north of Cal Poly Humboldt.

      Carolina. I''ll break this down by finding the approximate locations of both
      universities and comparing their latitudes.


      First, let me check the locations:


      1. Widener University, DE: Wait, I need to check this information. Widener University
      is actually in Chester, Pennsylvania, not Delaware. There may be a branch campus
      in Delaware, but the main campus is in Pennsylvania.


      2. University of North Carolina Wilmington is in Wilmington, North Carolina.


      Let me think about the geographical positions of these locations:

      - Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina

      - Chester, PA is in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania

      - Wilmington, NC is in the southeastern part of North Carolina, on the coast


      Given these locations, a university in Pennsylvania (or even Delaware, which
      is also north of North Carolina) would be north of a university in North Carolina.


      So Widener University (whether in PA or a branch in DE) would be located north
      of UNC Wilmington.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic
      locations of both universities and compare their positions on a north-south
      axis.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Widener University has its main campus in Chester, Pennsylvania (though there
      is a Widener University School of Law in Delaware)

      - University of North Carolina Wilmington is located in Wilmington, North Carolina


      Step 2: Consider the north-south positioning of these states.

      - Pennsylvania and Delaware are both in the Mid-Atlantic region of the US

      - North Carolina is in the Southeast region

      - On a map of the United States, both Pennsylvania and Delaware are positioned
      north of North Carolina


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations within their states.

      - Even considering the southernmost point of Delaware or Pennsylvania, it would
      still be north of the northernmost point of North Carolina

      - Wilmington, NC is in the southeastern part of North Carolina, near the coast


      YES - Widener University (whether referring to the main campus in PA or the
      law school in DE) is located north of the University of North Carolina Wilmington.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Andrews University is in Michigan (MI)

      - Bethel University is in Tennessee (TN)


      Step 2: Find more specific locations

      Andrews University is in Berrien Springs, Michigan, which is in the southwestern
      part of Michigan.

      Bethel University is in McKenzie, Tennessee, which is in the northwestern part
      of Tennessee.


      Step 3: Compare latitudes

      Michigan is generally north of Tennessee in the United States. Michigan is in
      the northern part of the US while Tennessee is more in the southern region.


      Even though Andrews University is in the southern part of Michigan, and Bethel

      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - Michigan is in the northern United States, bordering Canada

      - Tennessee is in the southern United States, significantly south of Michigan


      Step 3: Even though I need to consider the specific locations within each state:

      - Andrews University is in Berrien Springs, in southwest Michigan

      - Bethel University is in McKenzie, in northwest Tennessee


      Step 4: Compare latitudes.

      - Even the southernmost points of Michigan are generally north of the northernmost
      points of Tennessee

      - The entire state of Michigan lies north of Tennessee on a map


      YES, Andrews University in Michigan is located north of Bethel University in

      1. Determine the location of Thomas More University in Kentucky

      2. Determine the location of Southern Polytechnic State University in Georgia

      3. Compare their geographical positions to see if Thomas More is north of Southern
      Polytechnic


      Thomas More University is located in Crestview Hills, Kentucky, which is in
      the northern part of Kentucky, near Cincinnati, Ohio.


      Southern Polytechnic State University (which is now part of Kennesaw State University)
      was located in Marietta, Georgia, which is in the northern part of Georgia,
      near Atlanta.


      Geographically:

      - Kentucky is generally north of Georgia

      - Crestview Hills, KY is in the northernmost part of Kentucky

      - Marietta, GA is in the northern part of Georgia, but Georgia as a whole is
      south of Kentucky


      Since Kentucky is north of Georgia, and Thomas More is in northern Kentucky
      while Southern Polytechnic was in northern Georgia, Thomas More University is
      indeed north of Southern Polytechnic State University.</think>I need to determine
      the relative geographic positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Thomas More University is located in Crestview Hills, Kentucky, which is in
      the northern part of Kentucky near Cincinnati, Ohio.

      - Southern Polytechnic State University (now part of Kennesaw State University)
      was located in Marietta, Georgia, which is in the northern part of Georgia near
      Atlanta.


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      - Kentucky is entirely north of Georgia on the map of the United States.

      - Crestview Hills is in the northernmost part of Kentucky.

      - Marietta is in northern Georgia, but even northern Georgia is south of Kentucky.


      Step 3: Make the determination.

      Since Kentucky is north of Georgia, and Thomas More University is in northern
      Kentucky while Southern Polytechnic State University was in northern Georgia,
      Thomas More University is definitely north of Southern Polytechnic State University.

      First, let me establish where these universities are located:


      Thomas More University is in Kentucky (KY), likely in northern Kentucky based
      on my knowledge.

      Southern Polytechnic State University is in Georgia (GA), which is south of
      Kentucky.


      To be more specific:

      - Thomas More University is located in Crestview Hills, Kentucky, which is in
      the northern part of Kentucky near Cincinnati, Ohio.

      - Southern Polytechnic State University (now part of Kennesaw State University)
      was located in Marietta, Georgia, which is in the northern part of Georgia near
      Atlanta.


      Since Kentucky is north of Georgia geographically in the United States, and

      Georgia, Thomas More University would be north of Southern Polytechnic State
      University.</think># Is Thomas More University, KY located north of Southern

      1) Thomas More University is located in Crestview Hills, Kentucky (KY)

      2) Southern Polytechnic State University (now part of Kennesaw State University)
      was located in Marietta, Georgia (GA)

      3) Kentucky is a state that borders Ohio to the north and Tennessee to the south

      4) Georgia is a state that borders Tennessee to the north and Florida to the
      south

      5) Geographically, Kentucky is entirely north of Georgia on the US map

      6) Therefore, any location in Kentucky (including Thomas More University) would
      be north of any location in Georgia (including Southern Polytechnic State University)

      to determine the locations of both universities and compare their positions
      on a north-south axis.


      Step 1: Identify where University of Wisconsin-Marinette is located.

      University of Wisconsin-Marinette is in Marinette, Wisconsin, which is in the
      northeastern part of Wisconsin near the border with Michigan''s Upper Peninsula.


      Step 2: Identify where Benedictine University is located.

      Benedictine University is in Lisle, Illinois, which is a suburb of Chicago in
      the northeastern part of Illinois.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Wisconsin is generally north of Illinois. Specifically, Marinette, WI is located
      in the northern part of Wisconsin, near the Michigan border. It''s quite far
      north in the state.


      Lisle, IL (where Benedictine University is) is in northeastern Illinois near
      Chicago, which is in the northern part of Illinois but still south of Wisconsin.


      Given that Wisconsin is north of Illinois, and Marinette is in the northern
      part of Wisconsin, while Lisle is in the northern part of Illinois, University
      of Wisconsin-Marinette would be significantly north of Benedictine University.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions
      of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of Wisconsin-Marinette is located in Marinette, Wisconsin, which
      is in the northeastern part of Wisconsin near the Michigan border.

      - Benedictine University is located in Lisle, Illinois, which is a western suburb
      of Chicago in the northeastern part of Illinois.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on a north-south axis.

      - Wisconsin is entirely north of Illinois geographically.

      - Marinette is in the northern part of Wisconsin, near the border with Michigan''s
      Upper Peninsula.

      - Lisle is in the northern part of Illinois, but since Illinois is south of
      Wisconsin, Lisle must be south of Marinette.


      Step 3: Reach a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Marinette, WI is in Wisconsin (which is north of Illinois) and specifically
      in the northern part of Wisconsin, while Benedictine University is in northern
      Illinois, University of Wisconsin-Marinette must be located north of Benedictine
      University.

      State University in Indiana is located north of Western Kentucky University-Owensboro
      in Kentucky.


      First, let me identify the locations of both universities:


      1. Ball State University is located in Muncie, Indiana.

      2. Western Kentucky University-Owensboro is located in Owensboro, Kentucky.


      Now I need to determine their relative positions north/south of each other.


      Indiana is generally north of Kentucky, as Kentucky borders Indiana to the south.
      So generally speaking, locations in Indiana tend to be north of locations in
      Kentucky.


      More specifically:

      - Muncie, IN (Ball State) is in the eastern central part of Indiana

      - Owensboro, KY (WKU-Owensboro) is in the northwestern part of Kentucky


      Since Indiana is north of Kentucky, and Muncie is not in the extreme southern
      part of Indiana, while Owensboro is not in the extreme northern part of Kentucky,
      Ball State University should be north of Western Kentucky University-Owensboro.</think>#
      Comparing the Locations of Ball State University and Western Kentucky University-Owensboro


      To determine if Ball State University is north of Western Kentucky University-Owensboro,
      I''ll look at their geographic locations:


      1. Ball State University is located in Muncie, Indiana

      2. Western Kentucky University-Owensboro is located in Owensboro, Kentucky


      Looking at the geography of these states:

      - Indiana is directly north of Kentucky

      - Muncie, IN is in the east-central part of Indiana

      - Owensboro, KY is in the northwestern part of Kentucky along the Ohio River


      Even though Owensboro is in the northern part of Kentucky, the entire state
      of Kentucky lies south of central Indiana where Muncie is located. The state
      boundary between Indiana and Kentucky follows the Ohio River, with Kentucky
      entirely south of this line.


      Therefore, Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana is indeed located north
      of Western Kentucky University-Owensboro in Kentucky.

      (near St. Louis).


      Given the general geography of the United States, Cedar Rapids, Iowa would be
      north of Belleville, Illinois. Iowa is directly north of Missouri, and Illinois
      is east of Iowa and north of Missouri. Belleville is in the southern part of
      Illinois near the Missouri border, while Cedar Rapids is in Iowa, which is entirely

      First, let me consider the states:

      - Arkansas State University-Newport is in Arkansas (AR)

      - University of New Orleans is in Louisiana (LA)


      In terms of US geography, Arkansas is generally north of Louisiana. Arkansas
      borders the northern part of Louisiana.


      Now, let''s be more specific about the cities:

      - Newport is in Arkansas

      - New Orleans is in Louisiana, specifically in the southern part of Louisiana
      near the Gulf of Mexico


      Given that Arkansas is north of Louisiana, and New Orleans is in the southern
      part of Louisiana (one of the southernmost cities in Louisiana), it''s very
      likely that Newport, Arkansas is north of New Orleans, Louisiana.


      To be even more precise, Newport, AR is in the northeastern part of Arkansas.
      New Orleans is in the southeastern part of Louisiana. This further confirms
      that Newport, AR is north of New Orleans, LA.


      Therefore, Arkansas State University-Newport, AR is located north of University
      of New Orleans, LA.</think>I''ll think about this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Arkansas State University-Newport is in Newport, Arkansas (AR)

      - University of New Orleans is in New Orleans, Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Arkansas is located directly north of Louisiana in the United States


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities within these states.

      - Newport is in the northeastern part of Arkansas

      - New Orleans is in the southeastern part of Louisiana, near the Gulf of Mexico
      (very southern)


      Step 4: Compare their relative positions.

      - Since Arkansas is north of Louisiana, and New Orleans is in the southern part
      of Louisiana, Newport, Arkansas must be north of New Orleans, Louisiana.


      YES, Arkansas State University-Newport, AR is located north of University of

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Arkansas State University-Newport is in Newport, Arkansas (AR)

      - University of New Orleans is in New Orleans, Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      Arkansas is a state that borders Louisiana to the north. In the US, when looking
      at a map, Arkansas is positioned above (north of) Louisiana.


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      - Newport is a city in northeastern Arkansas

      - New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana, near the Gulf of Mexico


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Given that Arkansas as a whole is north of Louisiana, and Newport is in Arkansas
      while New Orleans is in Louisiana, it follows that Arkansas State University-Newport
      would be north of the University of New Orleans.</think>I''ll think step by

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Arkansas and Louisiana.

      - Arkansas is a state that sits directly north of Louisiana

      - On a US map, Arkansas is positioned above Louisiana


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      - Newport is in northeastern Arkansas

      - New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana, near the Gulf Coast


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these facts.

      Since Arkansas is entirely north of Louisiana, and Newport is in Arkansas while
      New Orleans is in Louisiana, Arkansas State University-Newport must be north
      of the University of New Orleans.

      To answer this, I need to know the approximate locations of these universities:


      Grand View University is located in Des Moines, Iowa.

      Washburn University is located in Topeka, Kansas.


      Now I need to determine their relative north-south positions. In the United

      Topeka, Kansas is in the northeastern part of Kansas.


      Even though Topeka is in the northern part of Kansas, the entire state of Kansas
      is south of Iowa. So a city in Iowa (Des Moines) would be north of a city in

      - Iowa is directly north of Missouri

      - Kansas is west of Missouri

      - On a US map, Iowa is positioned entirely north of Kansas


      Step 3: Compare the specific cities.

      - Des Moines, Iowa is in the central part of Iowa

      - Topeka, Kansas is in the northeastern part of Kansas

      - Even though Topeka is in the northern part of Kansas, it is still south of

      1. Maine (ME) is a state in the northeastern United States, bordering Canada.
      It''s the northernmost state in New England.


      2. Rhode Island (RI) is also in New England, but it''s located south of Maine.

      Step 1: Identify the states'' locations.

      - Maine (ME) is located in the northeastern United States, and is the northernmost
      state in New England.

      - Rhode Island (RI) is also in New England, but is positioned significantly
      south of Maine.


      Step 2: Consider the universities'' locations within their states.

      - Husson University is located in Bangor, Maine.

      - Bryant University is located in Smithfield, Rhode Island.


      Step 3: Compare the overall north-south positioning.

      Since Maine as a whole is north of Rhode Island, and the specific locations
      of these universities within their respective states don''t change this relationship,
      Husson University is indeed north of Bryant University.

    fb9cb030-642e-49ac-b59e-ff1dff1ee126: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the geographical locations of Granite State College in New Hampshire
      (NH) and Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey (NJ), and then determine
      which one is located further north.


      First, let me identify the approximate locations:


      1. Granite State College is in New Hampshire, which is a state in the northeastern
      United States. New Hampshire is one of the New England states, located north
      of Massachusetts.


      2. Stevens Institute of Technology is in New Jersey, which is a state in the
      mid-Atlantic region of the United States. New Jersey is south of New York.


      In terms of the geographical layout of the northeastern United States, going
      from north to south, we typically have:

      - Maine

      - New Hampshire/Vermont

      - Massachusetts/New York

      - Connecticut/Rhode Island

      - New Jersey/Pennsylvania


      So generally speaking, New Hampshire is located north of New Jersey. Therefore,
      Granite State College in NH would be located north of Stevens Institute of Technology
      in NJ.


      Let me confirm this by thinking about their specific locations within their
      respective states:

      - Granite State College has its main campus in Concord, NH (though it has multiple
      locations)

      - Stevens Institute of Technology is in Hoboken, NJ


      Both are in their respective states, so the state-level comparison holds. New
      Hampshire is definitely north of New Jersey.</think># Is Granite State College,
      NH located north of Stevens Institute of Technology, NJ?


      I''ll solve this by determining the relative locations of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' locations.

      - New Hampshire (NH) is located in the northeastern United States, specifically
      in the New England region.

      - New Jersey (NJ) is located in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare the geographical positions of these states.

      - New Hampshire is located significantly north of New Jersey.

      - New Hampshire borders Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Quebec (Canada).

      - New Jersey borders New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations of the institutions.

      - Granite State College is located in New Hampshire (specifically with campuses
      in Concord and other NH locations).

      - Stevens Institute of Technology is in Hoboken, New Jersey.


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      - Since New Hampshire is entirely north of New Jersey on the map of the United
      States, any location in New Hampshire would be north of any location in New
      Jersey.


      YES, Granite State College in NH is located north of Stevens Institute of Technology
      in NJ.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of Scranton is located in Scranton, Pennsylvania (PA)

      - Old Dominion University is located in Norfolk, Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Pennsylvania and
      Virginia.

      Pennsylvania is a northern state compared to Virginia on the US map. Pennsylvania
      shares its southern border with Maryland and West Virginia, while Virginia is
      south of those states.


      Step 3: Look at the specific locations within their states.

      - Scranton is in northeastern Pennsylvania

      - Norfolk (where Old Dominion University is located) is in southeastern Virginia


      Step 4: Compare latitudes.

      Since Pennsylvania is entirely north of Virginia, and Scranton is in the northern
      part of Pennsylvania while Norfolk is in the southern part of Virginia, the
      University of Scranton is definitively north of Old Dominion University.

      - Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts is in Maine (ME)

      - University of New Haven is in Connecticut (CT)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between Maine and Connecticut.

      Maine is located in the northernmost part of New England, while Connecticut
      is in southern New England. On a map of the United States, Maine is positioned
      above (north of) Connecticut.


      Step 3: Draw the conclusion based on the states'' relative positions.

      Since the Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts is in Maine, and

      To answer this, I need to consider the relative geographic positions of these
      two locations.


      Step 1: Determine the location of Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual
      Arts in Maine (ME).

      Maine is a state in the northeastern United States, at the very top of New England.


      Step 2: Determine the location of University of New Haven in Connecticut (CT).

      Connecticut is also in New England, but it''s south of Maine. Connecticut is
      generally south of Massachusetts, which is south of New Hampshire, which is
      south of Maine.


      Step 3: Compare the north-south positions.

      In the United States, Maine is the northernmost state in New England, while

      4) In terms of north-south positioning, Maine is always north of Connecticut
      on a map.


      5) Therefore, any institution in Maine (including the Institute for Doctoral

      1. East Central University is in Oklahoma (OK)

      Generally speaking, Oklahoma is north of Texas. But let me think more specifically
      about these universities.


      East Central University is in Ada, Oklahoma. Ada is located in the south-central
      part of Oklahoma.


      Texas A&M University-San Antonio is in San Antonio, Texas. San Antonio is in
      the south-central part of Texas, not far from the border with Mexico.


      Since Oklahoma is directly north of Texas, and Ada, OK is in the southern part
      of Oklahoma, while San Antonio, TX is in the southern part of Texas, it''s almost
      certain that East Central University is located north of Texas A&M University-San
      Antonio.


      To be thorough, let me mentally picture the map. Oklahoma''s southern border
      touches Texas''s northern border. Any location in Oklahoma would be north of
      a location in south-central Texas.</think>To answer this question, I need to
      determine the relative locations of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - East Central University is located in Ada, Oklahoma

      - Texas A&M University-San Antonio is located in San Antonio, Texas


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Oklahoma and Texas.

      - Oklahoma is directly north of Texas (Oklahoma shares its southern border with
      Texas''s northern border)


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Ada, Oklahoma is in the south-central part of Oklahoma

      - San Antonio, Texas is in the south-central part of Texas, relatively far south
      in the state


      Step 4: Compare the locations.

      - Even though Ada is in southern Oklahoma, any location in Oklahoma is still
      north of San Antonio, Texas, which is quite far south in Texas


      Therefore, East Central University in Oklahoma is indeed north of Texas A&M
      University-San Antonio.

      1. East Central University is located in Oklahoma (OK).

      2. Texas A&M University-San Antonio is located in Texas (TX).


      Now I need to determine their relative positions:


      Oklahoma is a state that''s located directly north of Texas on the US map. So
      generally speaking, locations in Oklahoma are north of locations in Texas.


      More specifically:

      - Oklahoma is directly north of Texas on the US map

      - Oklahoma shares its southern border with the northern part of Texas


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Ada, Oklahoma is in the south-central part of Oklahoma

      - San Antonio, Texas is in the southern part of Texas, well below the Oklahoma
      border


      Step 4: Compare their relative positions.

      - Even though Ada is in the southern part of Oklahoma, it is still north of

      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Oklahoma is a state that is entirely north of Texas. Oklahoma borders Texas

      2. Determine which one is further north by comparing their latitudes

      3. Answer YES if Franklin Pierce University is north of the Liechtenstein Institute,
      or NO if it''s not


      First, let''s identify the locations:


      Franklin Pierce University is located in Rindge, New Hampshire (NH).


      The Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination appears to be located at Princeton
      University in Princeton, New Jersey (NJ).


      Now I need to compare their latitudes:

      - New Hampshire is a state in the northeastern United States, part of New England

      - New Jersey is a state on the east coast, south of New York and north of Delaware


      Geographically, New Hampshire is north of New Jersey. This is a general geographic
      fact about US states. New Hampshire shares a border with Canada, while New Jersey
      is several states south of the Canadian border.


      Therefore, Franklin Pierce University in NH would be north of the Liechtenstein
      Institute in NJ.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions

      Franklin Pierce University is located in Rindge, New Hampshire (NH).

      The Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination is located at Princeton University
      in Princeton, New Jersey (NJ).


      Step 2: Compare the geographic positions of New Hampshire and New Jersey.

      New Hampshire is in the northeastern United States, part of the New England
      region.

      New Jersey is also on the east coast, but is located south of New York and significantly
      south of New Hampshire.


      Step 3: Consider their positions on a map.

      New Hampshire borders Canada to the north, while New Jersey is several states
      south of the Canadian border.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since New Hampshire is north of New Jersey on the map of the United States,
      Franklin Pierce University in NH is located north of the Liechtenstein Institute
      in NJ.

      Let me think about the geographic locations:

      - Kentucky (KY) is a state in the upper South/lower Midwest of the United States

      - Georgia (GA) is a state in the Southeast of the United States

      - Generally speaking, Kentucky is north of Georgia


      To be more specific:

      - Morehead, KY would be in eastern Kentucky

      - Columbus, GA would be in western Georgia, near the Alabama border


      So in terms of north-south positioning, Kentucky is definitely north of Georgia.
      Morehead State University in Kentucky would be north of Columbus Technical College
      in Georgia.


      So the answer should be YES.</think>To determine if Morehead State University
      in Kentucky is located north of Columbus Technical College in Georgia, I need
      to consider the geographic locations of these two states and institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Kentucky is located in the upper South/lower Midwest region of the United States,
      while Georgia is in the Southeast region. On a map, Kentucky is positioned north
      of Georgia.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      Morehead State University is in Morehead, which is in eastern Kentucky.

      Columbus Technical College is in Columbus, which is in west-central Georgia
      near the Alabama border.


      Step 3: Compare the north-south positioning.

      Even accounting for specific locations within their states, any location in
      Kentucky (including Morehead) would be significantly north of any location in
      Georgia (including Columbus).


      YES, Morehead State University in Kentucky is located north of Columbus Technical
      College in Georgia.'

      ## Step 2: Compare their geographical positions

      - New York is a northern state on the US East Coast

      - North Carolina is a southern state on the US East Coast

      - On a north-south axis, New York is significantly north of North Carolina


      ## Step 3: Verify relative positions

      - All locations in New York state are geographically north of all locations

      \ let me try to place these specific colleges:\n\nNortheast Wisconsin Technical\
      \ College is likely in the northeastern part of Wisconsin, perhaps near Green\
      \ Bay.\n\nLake Michigan College, being named after Lake Michigan, is likely\
      \ near the lake in Michigan. Based on the name, it's probably in the western\

      \ in their respective states these colleges would be.\n\nSince NWTC is in \"\
      Northeast Wisconsin,\" it's in the northern half of Wisconsin. Lake Michigan\
      \ College is likely in the lower peninsula of Michigan (the \"mitten\" part),\

      \ Wisconsin Technical College (WI) is located north of Lake Michigan College\

      \ is primarily located in Green Bay, Wisconsin, in the northeastern part of\
      \ the state.\n\nStep 2: Locate Lake Michigan College\nLake Michigan College\
      \ is located in Benton Harbor, Michigan, which is in the southwestern corner\

      \ Wisconsin is located roughly at 44.5\xB0 N latitude.\nBenton Harbor, Michigan\
      \ is located roughly at 42.1\xB0 N latitude.\n\nStep 4: Make the comparison\n\
