      1. First, let''s locate South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center

      - This is located in South Dakota, which is in the northern part of the central
      United States


      2. Next, let''s locate Angelo State University

      - This is located in San Angelo, Texas, which is in the southwestern part of
      the United States


      3. Comparing their geographical locations:

      - South Dakota is north of Texas

      - More specifically, South Dakota is northeast of Texas

      - Angelo State University is in west-central Texas


      4. So the question is: Is the South Dakota location east of the Texas location?

      - Since South Dakota is northeast of Texas, it is indeed east of Angelo State
      University


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
