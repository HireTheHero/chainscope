      - Bassani''s entire lifespan is after La Grange''s lifespan

      - Bassani died in 1716, which is much later than La Grange''s death in 1402


      5. Answering the specific question:

      - Did Giovanni Battista Bassani die at a later date than Jean de La Grange?

      - Yes, he did


      Answer: YES'
