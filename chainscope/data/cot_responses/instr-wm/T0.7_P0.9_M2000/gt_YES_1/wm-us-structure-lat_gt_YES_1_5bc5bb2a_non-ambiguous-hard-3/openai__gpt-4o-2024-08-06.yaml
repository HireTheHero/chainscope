      1. Identify the location of Swift Reservoir: Swift Reservoir is located in the
      state of Washington. More specifically, it is in southwestern Washington, near
      the southern part of the state.


      2. Identify the location of Carson Mansion: Carson Mansion is located in Eureka,
      California, which is in the northern part of California along the coast.


      3. Compare the latitudes of the two locations: Washington is generally north
      of California. Swift Reservoir, being in southwestern Washington, is indeed
      located at a latitude that is north of Eureka, California, where Carson Mansion
