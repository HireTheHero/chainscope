      Griffy Lake is north of the Arnold Engineering Development Complex.


      NO WAIT - I should be more precise. While Indiana is generally north of Tennessee,
      I need to verify the specific locations within these states.


      Griffy Lake is located in Bloomington, Indiana, in the southern part of the
      state.

      The Arnold Engineering Development Complex is located in Tullahoma, Tennessee,
      in the southern part of that state.


      Even though Griffy Lake is in southern Indiana, Indiana''s southern border is
      still north of Tennessee''s northern border. Therefore, any location in Indiana,
      including Griffy Lake, would be north of any location in Tennessee, including
      the Arnold Engineering Development Complex.

      Carolina (NC).

      - Pennsylvania is a northern state, located in the Mid-Atlantic/Northeastern
      United States.

      - North Carolina is a southern state, located in the Southeastern United States.

      - Generally, Pennsylvania is located north of North Carolina.

      Step 3: While there could theoretically be exceptions if the reservoir and lake
      were at extreme opposite ends of their respective states, this is not the case
      here. The north-south orientation of the states is significant enough that any
      body of water in Pennsylvania would be north of any body of water in North Carolina.

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Vermont and New York.

      Vermont is located east of New York state. However, the question is asking about
      north/south positioning, not east/west.


      Step 3: Determine more specific locations.

      Lake Rescue is in southern Vermont, in Windsor County.

      Edison Theatre could refer to multiple theaters, but considering major Edison
      Theatres in NY, they would typically be in or near New York City in the southeastern
      part of New York state.

      Southern Vermont (where Lake Rescue is located) is still generally north of
      New York City and its surrounding areas where Edison Theatre would likely be
      located.


      Based on this reasoning, Lake Rescue in Vermont is likely located north of Edison

      - The Paramount Theater is in Charlottesville, which is in central Virginia

      - The Blumenthal Performing Arts Center is in Charlotte, North Carolina

      - Virginia borders North Carolina to the north

      Nebraska is directly north of Kansas in the United States. The Nebraska-South
      Dakota border (where Gavins Point Dam is located) is in the northern part of
      Nebraska, which is significantly north of any point in Kansas, including Manhattan
