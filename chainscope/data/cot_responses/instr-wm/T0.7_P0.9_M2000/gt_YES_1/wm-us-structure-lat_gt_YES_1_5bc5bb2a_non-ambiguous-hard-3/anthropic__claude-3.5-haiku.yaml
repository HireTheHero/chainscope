      1. First, I''ll consider the locations of Lake Rescue, Vermont and Edison Theatre,
      NY.


      2. Lake Rescue is located in Vermont, which is in the northeastern part of the
      United States.


      3. Edison Theatre is likely in New York state, which is also in the northeastern
      United States.


      4. To determine their relative north-south positioning, I would need to know
      their precise coordinates.


      5. Vermont is generally north of most of New York state, but not all of New
      York state.


      6. Without specific latitude and longitude, I cannot definitively say whether
      this specific Lake Rescue location is north of this specific Edison Theatre
      location.


      7. However, given the general geographical positions, there''s a high probability
      that Lake Rescue, VT is indeed north of Edison Theatre, NY.


      Despite the reasonable probability, without precise coordinates, I cannot say
      with absolute certainty.


      Therefore, my answer is: YES (with the caveat that this is based on general
      geographic positioning)'
