      Oregon, we need to consider the geographic locations of both places.


      Step 1: Identify the location of St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral.

      - St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral is located in Seattle, Washington.

      - Seattle is in the state of Washington, in the northwestern United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of the Aladdin Theater.

      - The Aladdin Theater is located in Portland, Oregon.

      - Portland is in the state of Oregon, which is directly south of Washington.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes of the two cities.

      - Seattle is located at approximately 47.6 degrees North latitude.

      - Portland is located at approximately 45.5 degrees North latitude.


      Step 4: Since 47.6 > 45.5, Seattle is farther north than Portland.


      Therefore, St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle is located north of the
      Aladdin Theater in Portland.
