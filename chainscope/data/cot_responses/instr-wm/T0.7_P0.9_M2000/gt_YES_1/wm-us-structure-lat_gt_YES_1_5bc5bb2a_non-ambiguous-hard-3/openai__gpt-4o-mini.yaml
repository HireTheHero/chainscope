      locations of both places:


      1. **Locate Ashokan Reservoir, NY**: The Ashokan Reservoir is situated in the
      Catskill Mountains region of New York. It is located in Ulster County, which
      is in the southeastern part of the state.

      - Las Vegas, Nevada is situated to the northeast of San Diego, California.

      - When we think about the cardinal directions, if Las Vegas is to the northeast

      be located north of any structure in South Dakota, assuming they are along a
      similar longitudinal line.
