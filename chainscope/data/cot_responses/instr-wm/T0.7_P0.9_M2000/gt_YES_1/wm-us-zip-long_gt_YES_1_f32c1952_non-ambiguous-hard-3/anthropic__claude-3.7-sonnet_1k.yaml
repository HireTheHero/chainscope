      1. 21220, MD is a zip code in Maryland (MD).

      2. 62521, IL is a zip code in Illinois (IL).


      Let me think about the geographical positions of these states in the US:

      - Maryland is on the East Coast of the United States.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region.


      In terms of relative positions, Maryland is east of Illinois on a map of the
      United States. The eastern states like Maryland are closer to the Atlantic Ocean,
      while Midwest states like Illinois are more inland.


      So generally, any location in Maryland would be east of any location in Illinois.
      Therefore, zip code 21220 in Maryland should be east of zip code 62521 in Illinois.</think>I''ll

      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Maryland is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Maryland is significantly east of Illinois on the US map

      - The entire state of Maryland is east of the entire state of Illinois


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 21220 is in Maryland and 62521 is in Illinois, the Maryland zip code
      must be east of the Illinois zip code.


      YES, 21220, MD is located east of 62521, IL.'

      1. I need to determine the relative geographical positions of two zip codes:
      06250, CT (Connecticut) and 17970, PA (Pennsylvania).


      2. First, I need to understand the general geographical relationship between
      Connecticut and Pennsylvania. Connecticut is located in the northeastern United
      States, while Pennsylvania is also in the northeastern US but more toward the
      mid-Atlantic region.


      3. Connecticut is generally east of Pennsylvania. The entire state of Connecticut
      is located east of Pennsylvania.


      4. Since 06250 is in Connecticut (CT) and 17970 is in Pennsylvania (PA), and
      Connecticut is east of Pennsylvania, it follows that 06250, CT is east of 17970,
      PA.


      5. To be completely precise, I should note that zip codes near borders could
      sometimes create exceptions, but in this case, these zip codes are not near
      the CT-PA border. Connecticut and Pennsylvania don''t even share a border (New
      York state is between them), so any CT zip code would be east of any PA zip
      code.</think>I need to determine if one zip code is east of another by examining

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 06250 is in Connecticut (CT)

      - 17970 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Connecticut is located in New England, in the northeastern United States.

      Pennsylvania is located southwest of Connecticut.


      Step 3: Consider state positions.

      Connecticut is entirely east of Pennsylvania. In fact, they don''t even share
      a border - New York state sits between them.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 06250 is in Connecticut, and 17970 is in Pennsylvania, and Connecticut
      is east of Pennsylvania, the zip code in Connecticut must be east of the zip

      determine if the location with zip code 06250 in Connecticut (CT) is east of
      the location with zip code 17970 in Pennsylvania (PA).


      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - Connecticut (CT) is a state in the northeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is also in the northeastern United States

      - Generally speaking, Connecticut is east of Pennsylvania, as Connecticut is
      on the coast while Pennsylvania is more inland


      To be more precise, I should consider the specific locations:

      - Zip code 06250 is in Connecticut (CT)

      - Zip code 17970 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      In the United States, states that are on the East Coast tend to be east of states
      that are more inland. Connecticut is on the East Coast, while Pennsylvania is
      somewhat inland but still in the eastern part of the country.


      Since Connecticut is generally east of Pennsylvania, it''s very likely that
      any location in Connecticut would be east of any location in Pennsylvania. There
      could be exceptions if we''re looking at locations on the far western edge of
      Connecticut compared to locations on the far eastern edge of Pennsylvania, but
      this is unlikely.</think># Is 06250, CT located east of 17970, PA?


      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the states: 06250 is in Connecticut (CT) and 17970
      is in Pennsylvania (PA).


      2) Looking at the geography of the northeastern United States, Connecticut is
      located on the Atlantic coast, while Pennsylvania is more inland.


      3) Connecticut is positioned entirely east of Pennsylvania in terms of the general
      geographic arrangement of these states.


      4) Specifically, zip code 06250 appears to be in eastern Connecticut (North
      Windham area), while 17970 is in eastern Pennsylvania (Schuylkill County area).


      5) Even though both are in the eastern portions of their respective states,
      any location in Connecticut will still be east of any location in Pennsylvania
      due to the overall geographic positioning of these states.


      YES, 06250, CT is located east of 17970, PA.'

      In the United States, states are generally arranged with the eastern states
      on the Atlantic coast and western states on the Pacific coast. Going from east
      to west:

      - The East Coast includes states like Maine, New York, Georgia, etc.

      - The Midwest includes states like Oklahoma, Kansas, etc.


      Georgia (GA) is located on the East Coast of the United States, while Oklahoma
      (OK) is in the central part of the country (often considered part of the Midwest
      or South Central region).


      Geographically, Georgia is significantly east of Oklahoma. If we imagine a map
      of the US, Georgia would be towards the right (east) and Oklahoma would be more
      towards the middle or left-middle (west) of the country.

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions
      of these zip codes.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) 30534 is a zip code in Georgia (GA), which is a state on the southeastern
      Atlantic coast of the United States.


      2) 73142 is a zip code in Oklahoma (OK), which is a state in the south-central
      region of the United States.


      3) When looking at a US map, Georgia is positioned significantly to the east
      of Oklahoma. Georgia borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east, while Oklahoma
      is located in the interior of the country.


      4) All locations in Georgia, including zip code 30534, are east of all locations

      codes.


      70065 appears to be in the New Orleans area of Louisiana, which is in the southeastern
      part of the state.

      77008 appears to be in the Houston area of Texas, which is in the southeastern
      part of that state.


      Given the general geography of the United States, locations in Louisiana (especially
      in the New Orleans area) are east of locations in Texas (including Houston).
      This is because Louisiana is directly east of Texas in the US map.


      So 70065, LA should be east of 77008, TX.</think>To determine if 70065, LA is
      located east of 77008, TX, I need to identify these locations and compare their
      positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 70065 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA)

      - 77008 is a zip code in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of Texas and Louisiana.

      Louisiana is located directly east of Texas on the US map.


      Step 3: Get more specific about these zip codes.

      - 70065 is in the Greater New Orleans area of Louisiana

      - 77008 is in the Houston area of Texas


      Step 4: Compare their specific locations.

      The New Orleans area is in southeastern Louisiana, while Houston is in southeastern
      Texas. Even though both are in the southeastern portions of their respective
      states, Louisiana itself is east of Texas.


      YES, 70065, LA is located east of 77008, TX.'

      if the zip code 70065 in Louisiana is located east of zip code 77008 in Texas.


      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west)


      First, let''s consider the general geography of Louisiana (LA) and Texas (TX):

      - Louisiana is located to the east of Texas in the United States

      - Texas is west of Louisiana


      Now for the specific zip codes:

      - 70065 is in Louisiana (LA)

      - 77008 is in Texas (TX)


      Since Louisiana is east of Texas, and these zip codes are in their respective
      states, 70065 (LA) would be east of 77008 (TX).


      However, I should be a bit careful here because zip codes don''t perfectly follow
      state boundaries, and some areas might have unusual geographic arrangements.
      But in this case, since we''re comparing zip codes from different states that
      are clearly separated geographically (Louisiana is definitely east of Texas),
      the answer should be straightforward.</think>I need to determine if 70065, LA
      is east of 77008, TX by analyzing their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states these zip codes belong to.

      - 70065 is in Louisiana (LA)

      - 77008 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Louisiana is located directly east of Texas on the US map. The entire state
      of Louisiana is positioned to the east of Texas.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific zip codes.

      Since 70065 is in Louisiana and 77008 is in Texas, and Louisiana is east of
      Texas, it follows that 70065 (LA) must be east of 77008 (TX).


      YES'

      1. 70065 is in Louisiana (LA)

      2. 77008 is in Texas (TX)


      Let me think about the general geographic relationship between Louisiana and
      Texas:

      - Louisiana is located to the east of Texas on the US map

      - 70065 is in LA, which appears to be in the southeastern part of Louisiana
      (near New Orleans area)

      - 77008 is in TX, likely in the eastern part of Texas (possibly Houston area)


      Even if 77008 is in eastern Texas and 70065 is in western Louisiana, the general
      geography of the states would still put the Louisiana zip code east of the Texas
      zip code, because Louisiana as a whole is east of Texas.</think>I need to determine
      if zip code 70065 in Louisiana is east of zip code 77008 in Texas.

      - 70065 is in Louisiana (LA)

      - 77008 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Louisiana borders Texas on its eastern side

      - In other words, Louisiana is located to the east of Texas


      Step 3: Verify the specific zip codes.

      - 70065 is in Kenner, Louisiana (in the New Orleans metropolitan area)

      - 77008 is in Houston, Texas


      Step 4: Even though these are specific areas within their states, the general
      geographic relationship holds. Since Louisiana is east of Texas, and these zip
      codes are in their respective states, the Louisiana zip code (70065) is east
      of the Texas zip code (77008).

      12010 in New York is located east of zip code 60087 in Illinois.


      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - New York (NY) is a state in the northeastern United States

      - Illinois (IL) is a state in the midwestern United States

      - Generally speaking, New York is east of Illinois on a map of the United States


      Since the zip code 12010 is in New York, and the zip code 60087 is in Illinois,
      and New York is east of Illinois, it follows that 12010, NY is east of 60087,
      IL.


      So the answer is YES.</think>To determine if 12010, NY is east of 60087, IL,
      I need to consider the geographical positions of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 12010 is in New York (NY)

      - 60087 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of these states on the US map.

      - New York is located in the northeastern part of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the midwestern part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - New York is positioned to the east of Illinois on the US map

      - All of New York state is east of all of Illinois state


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 12010 is in NY and 60087 is in IL, the zip code in NY would be east
      of the zip code in IL, regardless of their specific locations within their respective
      states.

      To be more precise about these specific zip codes:

      - 35749 is a zip code in Alabama

      - 73505 is a zip code in Oklahoma


      Since all of Alabama is east of all of Oklahoma, any zip code in Alabama (including

      70647 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA).


      In general, Florida is located to the east of Louisiana in the United States.
      Florida is on the southeastern coast of the US, while Louisiana is on the Gulf
      Coast, west of Florida.


      So just based on the states, 32095, FL would be east of 70647, LA. But let me
      think about this more carefully.


      US zip codes are generally organized so that lower numbers are in the east/northeast
      and higher numbers are in the west/southwest. The first digit of the zip code
      roughly indicates the region:

      0-1: Northeast

      2-3: South and Southeast

      4-5: Midwest

      6-7: Central and South Central

      8-9: West


      So, 32095 starts with 3, indicating it''s in the Southeast (Florida).

      70647 starts with 7, indicating it''s in the Central/South Central region (Louisiana).


      Based on both the state locations and the zip code system, 32095, FL is indeed
      east of 70647, LA.</think>I need to determine if 32095, FL is located east of
      70647, LA by finding their relative positions on the map.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 32095 is in Florida (FL)

      - 70647 is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - Florida is located on the southeastern coast of the United States

      - Louisiana is located on the Gulf Coast, west of Florida


      Step 3: Consider the zip code patterns.

      - US zip codes are roughly organized by region, with lower numbers in the east/northeast

      - Zip codes starting with 3 (like 32095) are in the Southeast region

      - Zip codes starting with 7 (like 70647) are in the Central/South Central region


      Step 4: Compare the locations.

      Since Florida is east of Louisiana on the US map, and this is reinforced by
      the zip code numbering system (3-series being east of 7-series), 32095, FL must
      be east of 70647, LA.

      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - 70712, LA is a zip code in Louisiana (LA)

      - 77388, TX is a zip code in Texas (TX)


      Now, I need to think about the geographic relationship between these states.
      In the United States:

      - Louisiana is located east of Texas (Texas is to the west of Louisiana)


      If we look at a map of the US, Texas shares its eastern border with Louisiana.
      So any location in Louisiana will be east of Texas.

      if the location with zip code 70712 in Louisiana (LA) is east of the location
      with zip code 77388 in Texas (TX).


      To answer this, I need to understand the geographic relationship between these
      two zip codes. In the United States, states are positioned in a fixed way relative
      to each other. Texas is located west of Louisiana - Louisiana borders Texas
      on Texas''s eastern border.


      So generally speaking, locations in Louisiana tend to be east of locations in
      Texas. However, I should be careful because both states have irregular shapes
      and some parts of Louisiana could potentially be west of some parts of Texas.


      Looking at the zip codes specifically:

      - 70712 is in Louisiana (LA)

      - 77388 is in Texas (TX)


      The general pattern of US zip codes is that they increase as you go from east
      to west. Lower numbers tend to be in the eastern US, and higher numbers in the
      western US. Given that 70712 is a lower number than 77388, this also suggests
      that 70712 is east of 77388.


      Additionally, I know that Louisiana is directly east of Texas in the United
      States. So a location in Louisiana would generally be east of a location in
      Texas.


      Based on these considerations, I believe that 70712, LA is indeed east of 77388,
      TX.</think># Is 70712, LA located east of 77388, TX?

      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship

      Louisiana is located directly east of Texas on the US map. The entire state
      of Louisiana is east of most of Texas.


      ## Step 3: Analyze the zip codes

      While zip codes aren''t perfectly sequential by geography, these particular
      codes follow the general pattern. The first digit of zip codes generally increases
      as you move west across the US. The 7xxxx codes cover the south-central region,
      with lower numbers in the eastern part of that region.


      ## Step 4: Reach a conclusion

      Since Louisiana is east of Texas, and these specific zip codes align with the
      standard geographic distribution (70xxx for Louisiana is east of 77xxx for Texas),
      the location with zip code 70712 in LA is indeed east of the location with zip
      code 77388 in TX.

      Generally speaking, Louisiana is east of Texas, as Louisiana borders Texas on
      Texas''s eastern border. But I need to check the specific locations to be sure.


      Zip code 70712 is in Louisiana, likely in the western part of the state since
      LA zip codes generally start with 70 or 71.

      Zip code 77388 is in Texas, likely in the eastern part of the state since TX
      zip codes can range from 75-79 in the eastern portion.


      Since Louisiana is directly east of Texas, and these zip codes are both relatively
      close to the border regions of their respective states (based on their numbering),
      it''s very likely that 70712, LA is east of 77388, TX.


      The general orientation of these states makes this almost certainly correct
      - Louisiana is positioned to the east of Texas on the map of the United States.</think>#
      Is 70712, LA located east of 77388, TX?


      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to understand the general geographic relationship between Louisiana
      (LA) and Texas (TX).

      2) Texas is located west of Louisiana - they share a border, with Louisiana
      being to the east of Texas.

      3) Zip code 70712 is in Louisiana.

      4) Zip code 77388 is in Texas.

      5) Since Louisiana is east of Texas, a location in Louisiana (70712) would generally
      be east of a location in Texas (77388).


      Without looking at the specific locations within each state, I can determine
      that based on the overall state positions, 70712 in Louisiana would be east
      of 77388 in Texas.

      Let me identify the locations:

      - 75025 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      - 88240 is a zip code in New Mexico (NM)


      To determine if 75025, TX is east of 88240, NM, I need to think about the relative
      positions of these states and the specific locations within them.


      Generally speaking:

      - Texas is east of New Mexico (NM borders TX on TX''s western side)

      - However, I need to be more specific about these particular zip codes


      75025 appears to be in the Dallas area of Texas, which is in the northeastern
      part of Texas.

      88240 appears to be in Hobbs, New Mexico, which is in the southeastern part
      of New Mexico, near the border with Texas.


      Since Texas is east of New Mexico, and 75025 is in Texas while 88240 is in New
      Mexico, it''s likely that 75025 is east of 88240. But let me think about their
      specific locations to be sure.


      The Dallas area (where 75025 is located) is in northeastern Texas, while Hobbs,
      NM (where 88240 is located) is in southeastern New Mexico, right at the border
      with Texas. Even though Hobbs is at the eastern edge of New Mexico, Dallas is
      still further east since it''s well into Texas.

      Is 75025, TX located east of 88240, NM?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 75025 is in Texas (TX)

      - 88240 is in New Mexico (NM)


      ## Step 2: Consider the states'' positions

      New Mexico is located west of Texas. Texas shares its western border with New
      Mexico.


      ## Step 3: Locate the specific zip codes

      - 75025 is in Plano, part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex in north-central/northeastern
      Texas

      - 88240 is in Hobbs, in southeastern New Mexico near the Texas border


      ## Step 4: Compare the positions

      Even though Hobbs (88240) is in eastern New Mexico, it''s still west of Plano
      (75025). All of New Mexico is west of the Dallas-Fort Worth area of Texas.


      Therefore, 75025, TX is indeed located east of 88240, NM.

      To solve this, I''ll need to:

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their longitudes (east-west positions)


      Let me reason through this geographically:


      75025 is a zip code in Texas (TX). Texas is located in the south-central part
      of the United States.

      88240 is a zip code in New Mexico (NM). New Mexico is located in the southwestern

      The United States is organized geographically so that states in the eastern

      Let me break this down:

      1. 70444 is in Louisiana (LA)

      2. 79762 is in Texas (TX)


      In general, Louisiana is east of Texas in the United States. But I should verify
      the specific locations of these zip codes.


      Looking at the general structure of US zip codes:

      - Zip codes starting with 7 are generally in the south-central region

      - The first digit usually goes from east (lower numbers) to west (higher numbers)

      - Within that, Louisiana zip codes typically start with 70-71

      - Texas zip codes typically range from 75-79, with west Texas having higher
      numbers


      Since 70444 starts with 70 (Louisiana) and 79762 starts with 79 (likely west
      Texas), this supports that the Louisiana zip code is east of the Texas one.


      In fact, 79762 appears to be in western Texas (the higher number in the Texas
      range), which would definitely be west of Louisiana.


      So based on the zip code patterns and the general geographical relationship

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 70444 is in Louisiana (LA)

      - 79762 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      Louisiana is located to the east of Texas on the US map.


      Step 3: Look at the specific zip codes.

      US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to be in the
      eastern parts of the country and higher numbers in the western parts.


      Step 4: Analyze the specific zip codes.

      - 70444 is in the Louisiana zip code range (70xxx-71xxx)

      - 79762 is in the western Texas zip code range (79xxx)


      Step 5: Make the comparison.

      Not only is Louisiana generally east of Texas, but this specific Louisiana zip
      code (70444) would be east of this western Texas zip code (79762).

      Virginia is located east of 40175, Kentucky.


      To solve this problem, I''ll need to determine where these zip codes are located
      geographically.


      First, I know that Virginia (VA) is on the east coast of the United States,
      while Kentucky (KY) is an inland state that''s west of Virginia.


      Generally speaking, Virginia is east of Kentucky. The entire state of Virginia
      is east of the entire state of Kentucky. This is because Virginia borders the
      Atlantic Ocean on the east, while Kentucky is a landlocked state in the central/eastern
      United States.


      Since 23664 is in Virginia and 40175 is in Kentucky, it''s very likely that
      23664, VA is east of 40175, KY simply based on the states they''re in.


      To be absolutely certain, I would need to know the exact locations of these
      specific zip codes, but given the geography of the United States, any location
      in Virginia will be east of any location in Kentucky.</think>I''ll solve this
      step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the states where these zip codes are located.

      - 23664 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 40175 is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Virginia is located on the eastern coast of the United States, bordering the
      Atlantic Ocean.

      Kentucky is an inland state positioned to the west of Virginia.


      Step 3: Compare the general east-west relationship.

      The entire state of Virginia lies east of Kentucky. The states share no borders,
      with West Virginia and/or Tennessee positioned between them.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since any location in Virginia must be east of any location in Kentucky based
      on their relative positions in the United States, zip code 23664 in VA must
      be east of zip code 40175 in KY.

      Let''s break this down:

      1. 76008 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      2. 85735 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ)


      To determine which is more east, I need to think about the relative positions
      of Texas and Arizona in the United States.


      The United States is organized roughly with:

      - East Coast states on the right (eastern) side

      - West Coast states on the left (western) side


      Arizona (AZ) is in the southwestern part of the United States, bordering California
      to its west and New Mexico to its east.


      Texas (TX) is in the south-central part of the United States, bordering New
      Mexico to its west and Louisiana to its east.


      Looking at the map of the United States, Texas is definitely east of Arizona.
      So in general, locations in Texas would be east of locations in Arizona.


      Therefore, 76008, TX would be east of 85735, AZ.</think>To determine if 76008,
      TX is located east of 85735, AZ, I need to consider the geographical positions
      of these states and their zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 76008 is in Texas (TX)

      - 85735 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states in the US.

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Arizona borders California (to its west) and New Mexico (to its east)

      - Texas borders New Mexico (to its west) and Louisiana (to its east)

      - On a map of the United States, Texas is positioned to the east of Arizona


      Step 4: Since the zip codes are within these states, and Texas is east of Arizona,

      whether the zip code 76008 in Texas is located east of the zip code 85735 in
      Arizona.


      To answer this, I need to consider the relative geographic positions of these
      zip codes, or more generally, the relative positions of Texas and Arizona within
      the United States.


      The United States is laid out such that:

      - The East Coast is on the Atlantic Ocean

      - The West Coast is on the Pacific Ocean

      - Generally, states are numbered from east to west in their zip codes


      Looking at the two zip codes:

      - 76008 is in Texas (TX)

      - 85735 is in Arizona (AZ)


      In terms of the general geographic layout of the US, Texas is located east of
      Arizona. Arizona borders California (which is on the west coast), while Texas
      is more centrally located and extends toward the Gulf of Mexico in the southeast.


      So generally speaking, any location in Texas would be east of any location in
      Arizona. The zip codes themselves (76xxx vs 85xxx) don''t necessarily indicate
      east-west positioning directly, as zip code allocation isn''t purely geographical
      in that sense.

      - 76008 is in Texas (TX)

      - 85735 is in Arizona (AZ)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      The United States is generally laid out with the east coast at the Atlantic

      - Arizona is in the southwestern US, bordering California

      - Texas is located to the east of Arizona

      by step:


      1) I need to determine if zip code 76008 in Texas is east of zip code 85735
      in Arizona.


      2) The United States is organized geographically such that states in the west
      have higher zip codes than states in the east. Arizona (AZ) is located in the
      southwestern United States, while Texas (TX) is in the south-central United
      States.


      3) Texas is east of Arizona. Looking at a map of the United States, Arizona
      borders California to its west and New Mexico to its east. Texas is east of
      New Mexico. So geographically, Texas is east of Arizona.


      4) The zip codes themselves (76008 vs 85735) follow the general pattern where
      Arizona''s zip code starts with 85, which is higher than Texas''s 76, which
      aligns with the west-to-east pattern where western states have higher zip codes.


      5) Therefore, 76008, TX would be east of 85735, AZ.</think># Is 76008, TX located
      east of 85735, AZ?


      I''ll solve this step by step:


      1) First, I need to determine the relative geographic positions of Texas and
      Arizona.


      2) In the United States, Arizona (AZ) is located in the southwestern part of
      the country, while Texas (TX) is in the south-central region.


      3) Geographically, Texas is positioned to the east of Arizona. They are not
      adjacent states (New Mexico is between them), but Texas is definitely east of
      Arizona.


      4) The zip code numbers themselves also follow a general west-to-east pattern,
      with western states having higher first digits than eastern states. Arizona
      zip codes start with 8, while Texas zip codes start with 7, which supports this
      geographic relationship.


      5) Therefore, zip code 76008 in Texas is indeed east of zip code 85735 in Arizona.

      to determine if zip code 24201 in Virginia (VA) is located east of zip code
      42431 in Kentucky (KY).


      First, let''s think about the geographic locations of Virginia and Kentucky
      within the United States:

      - Virginia is located on the eastern coast of the United States

      - Kentucky is located inland, west of Virginia


      Generally speaking, Virginia is east of Kentucky. However, I need to be careful
      because some parts of states can have different relative positions due to irregular
      state borders.


      Let me think specifically about these zip codes:

      - 24201 is in VA, likely in the western part of Virginia since it''s a lower
      zip code number (generally eastern US has lower zip codes)

      - 42431 is in KY, probably in the eastern part of Kentucky since it''s a higher
      zip code


      Even though 24201 is in western Virginia, Virginia as a whole is east of Kentucky.
      So unless this is a very unusual case with a Virginia exclave or some geographic
      anomaly, the Virginia zip code should be east of the Kentucky zip code.


      Based on my knowledge of US geography, zip code 24201 in VA is very likely east
      of zip code 42431 in KY.</think># Is 24201, VA located east of 42431, KY?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states'' positions

      Virginia (VA) is located on the east coast of the United States, while Kentucky
      (KY) is an inland state that borders Virginia to the west. Generally, Virginia
      is east of Kentucky.


      ## Step 2: Check the specific zip codes

      - 24201 is in Virginia, likely in the western part of the state (based on zip
      code patterns)

      - 42431 is in Kentucky, probably in the eastern part of the state


      ## Step 3: Make the determination

      Even if 24201 is in western Virginia and 42431 is in eastern Kentucky, the overall
      geographic relationship remains consistent - Virginia is east of Kentucky. There
      are no geographic anomalies that would place this Virginia zip code west of
      the Kentucky one.

      east of 42431, KY, I need to:


      1. Figure out where these zip codes are located in their respective states

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west) to each other


      First, let''s think about the general geography of Virginia (VA) and Kentucky
      (KY). Virginia is on the east coast of the United States, while Kentucky is
      more inland. Generally speaking, Virginia is east of Kentucky.


      However, we need to be more precise about these specific zip codes, as states
      have irregular shapes and some parts of one state might not be directly east/west
      of another.


      24201 is a zip code in Virginia. Without specific data, I''ll have to reason
      based on general knowledge that zip codes in Virginia are mostly in the eastern
      part of the United States.


      42431 is a zip code in Kentucky. Kentucky is west of Virginia in general.


      Based on the general positions of these states, it''s very likely that 24201,
      VA is east of 42431, KY. Virginia lies east of Kentucky on a map of the United
      States.


      However, I should note that there''s a small possibility that these specific
      zip codes could be in unusual positions (e.g., if 24201 is in the far western
      part of Virginia and 42431 is in the far eastern part of Kentucky). But the
      most reasonable conclusion is that the Virginia zip code is east of the Kentucky
      zip code.</think># Is 24201, VA located east of 42431, KY?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 24201 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 42431 is in Kentucky (KY)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      Virginia is located on the east coast of the US, while Kentucky is an inland
      state that borders Virginia to the west. In general, Virginia is east of Kentucky.


      ## Step 3: Consider any potential exceptions

      While states have irregular shapes, Virginia is consistently east of Kentucky
      across their entire border. Even the westernmost parts of Virginia are still
      east of Kentucky.


      ## Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      Since 24201 is in Virginia and 42431 is in Kentucky, and Virginia is east of
      Kentucky, it follows that 24201, VA is east of 42431, KY.

      east of 42431, KY, I need to figure out where these zip codes are located geographically,
      and then determine their relative positions (east/west).


      First, let''s identify where these zip codes are:

      - 24201, VA is a zip code in Virginia

      - 42431, KY is a zip code in Kentucky


      Now, I need to think about the geographic relationship between these states.
      Virginia is located on the eastern coast of the United States, while Kentucky
      is more inland. Generally speaking, Virginia is east of Kentucky.


      However, since zip codes can be for specific areas within states, I need to
      consider their specific locations. Virginia extends westward and borders Kentucky,
      so some parts of Virginia could potentially be west of some parts of Kentucky.


      For these specific zip codes:

      - 24201 is in Bristol, VA, which is in the southwestern part of Virginia, near
      the border with Tennessee

      - 42431 is in Greenville, KY, which is in the western part of Kentucky


      Given the general geography of the United States, even though 24201 is in southwestern
      Virginia, Virginia overall is east of Kentucky. Bristol, VA (24201) would still
      be east of Greenville, KY (42431) because Kentucky is entirely west of Virginia.</think>#
      Is 24201, VA located east of 42431, KY?


      I''ll need to determine the geographic locations of these zip codes and compare
      their east-west positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 24201 is a zip code in Bristol, Virginia, located in the southwestern part
      of Virginia.

      - 42431 is a zip code in Greenville, Kentucky, located in the western part of
      Kentucky.


      Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      Virginia is located on the eastern coast, while Kentucky is an inland state
      west of Virginia. Virginia and Kentucky share a border, with Virginia being
      east of Kentucky.


      Step 3: Examine the specific locations within their states.

      Even though 24201 is in the southwestern part of Virginia (near the Tennessee
      border), it''s still east of western Kentucky where 42431 is located. Looking
      at a map, all of Virginia, including its westernmost parts, is generally east

      1. Zip code 19043 starts with "1", which indicates it''s in the eastern region
      of the US

      2. Zip code 45371 starts with "4", which indicates it''s further west than regions
      that start with "1"


      Additionally, I know that Pennsylvania (PA) is generally east of Ohio (OH) on
      the US map.


      Based on both the zip code numbering pattern and the geographical positions

      - Ohio borders Pennsylvania on its eastern border


      Step 3: Look at the zip code patterns.

      - Zip codes in the U.S. generally follow a pattern where lower numbers in the
      first digit correspond to more eastern locations

      1) 19043 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      2) 45371 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      In the United States, Pennsylvania is located east of Ohio. Pennsylvania borders
      Ohio on Ohio''s eastern border. So generally, locations in Pennsylvania are

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Mississippi is located on the Gulf Coast in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is located southwest of Mississippi


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-east axis.

      - The entire state of Mississippi lies east of Texas

      The United States has a general geographic layout where:

      - Eastern states are on the right side of the map

      - Western states are on the left side of the map


      West Virginia (WV) is an eastern state, located in the Appalachian region.

      Kansas (KS) is a midwestern state, located in the central part of the United
      States.


      Geographically, West Virginia is significantly east of Kansas. In terms of longitude,
      West Virginia is closer to the Atlantic Ocean, while Kansas is more in the middle
      of the country.


      So without even looking up the specific coordinates of these zip codes, I can
      determine that any location in West Virginia (including 26041) would be east
      of any location in Kansas (including 66220).</think># Is 26041, WV located east

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 26041 is in West Virginia (WV)

      - 66220 is in Kansas (KS)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - West Virginia is located in the eastern part of the United States, in the
      Appalachian region

      - Kansas is located in the central United States, in the Midwest region


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis

      - States in the eastern United States (like West Virginia) are east of states
      in the central United States (like Kansas)

      - The entire state of West Virginia is east of the entire state of Kansas


      Therefore, 26041, WV is definitely located east of 66220, KS.

      - 66220, KS: This is a zip code in Kansas (KS)


      Now I need to think about the relative east-west positions of these states in
      the US.


      The United States is arranged such that states on the East Coast (like Maine,
      New York, etc.) are the easternmost, and states on the West Coast (like California,
      Oregon, etc.) are the westernmost.


      West Virginia (WV) is located in the eastern part of the United States, specifically
      in the Appalachian region.


      Kansas (KS) is located in the central part of the United States, in the Midwest

      Geographically, West Virginia is significantly east of Kansas on a map of the
      United States.

      3) Looking at the geographic layout of the United States, West Virginia is located
      in the eastern part of the country, in the Appalachian region

      4) Kansas is located in the central United States, in the Midwest region

      5) On a west-to-east orientation, Kansas is significantly west of West Virginia


      Since any location in West Virginia (including zip code 26041) would be east

      I''ll break this down:

      1. First, I need to identify the locations of these two zip codes.

      2. Then I''ll determine their relative positions (east/west).


      10457 is a zip code in New York (NY). Specifically, it''s in the Bronx, which
      is in New York City, in the eastern part of New York state.


      43207 is a zip code in Ohio (OH). It''s likely in or near Columbus, which is
      in the central part of Ohio.


      Geographically in the United States:

      - New York is east of Ohio

      - The entire state of New York is east of the entire state of Ohio


      Since 10457 is in New York (Bronx) and 43207 is in Ohio (Columbus area), and
      New York is east of Ohio, therefore 10457, NY is east of 43207, OH.</think>#
      Is 10457, NY located east of 43207, OH?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 10457 is a zip code in New York (NY), specifically in the Bronx, which is
      part of New York City in the eastern part of New York state.

      - 43207 is a zip code in Ohio (OH), likely in or near Columbus, which is in
      the central part of Ohio.


      ## Step 2: Compare their geographic positions

      - Looking at a map of the United States, New York state is located east of Ohio
      state.

      - All locations in New York, including the Bronx (10457), are east of all locations
      in Ohio, including Columbus area (43207).


      ## Step 3: Draw conclusion

      Since the Bronx in New York is definitely east of any location in Ohio, zip
      code 10457 must be east of zip code 43207.


      YES'

      To solve this:

      1. First, I need to think about the general geographic locations of New York
      (NY) and Ohio (OH) in the United States.

      2. New York is on the east coast of the US, while Ohio is in the Midwest region.

      3. Generally speaking, New York is east of Ohio.

      - Zip code 10457 is in New York (likely in New York City/Bronx area)

      - Zip code 43207 is in Ohio (likely in the Columbus area)


      Given the general geography of the United States, locations in New York are
      almost always east of locations in Ohio. This is because Ohio is in the Midwest
      while New York is on the East Coast.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest, west of New York


      Step 3: More specifically, zip code 10457 is in the Bronx area of New York City,
      in the eastern part of New York state.


      Step 4: Zip code 43207 is in the Columbus area of Ohio.


      Step 5: Since all of New York state is east of all of Ohio state, and these
      specific zip codes don''t change that relationship, 10457 in NY must be east
      of 43207 in OH.

      Virginia (VA) is located on the east coast of the United States, while Kentucky
      (KY) is more inland and west of Virginia. In general, locations in Virginia
      tend to be east of locations in Kentucky.


      Let me think more specifically about these zip codes:

      - 24486 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      - 40109 is a zip code in Kentucky (KY)


      Since Virginia is generally east of Kentucky on a map of the United States,
      it''s very likely that 24486, VA is east of 40109, KY.

      - 24486 is in Virginia (VA)

      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      Virginia is located on the east coast of the United States, while Kentucky is

      Looking at a US map, Virginia is positioned to the east of Kentucky. The border
      of Virginia doesn''t overlap or extend west of Kentucky at any point.


      ## Step 4: Conclude based on state positions

      Since all of Virginia lies east of Kentucky, any zip code in Virginia (including

      24486 is a zip code in Virginia (VA).

      40109 is a zip code in Kentucky (KY).


      Geographically speaking:

      - Virginia is on the east coast of the United States

      - Kentucky is more inland, west of Virginia


      Looking at the map of the United States, Virginia is generally east of Kentucky.
      Virginia borders the Atlantic Ocean on its east, while Kentucky is landlocked
      and positioned to the west of Virginia.


      So generally speaking, locations in Virginia tend to be east of locations in
      Kentucky. This would suggest that 24486, VA is indeed east of 40109, KY.


      However, I should note that without the exact coordinates of these specific
      zip codes, I''m making this judgment based on the general geographical relationship
      between the two states. The eastern part of Kentucky could potentially be east
      of the westernmost parts of Virginia, but this is unlikely given the overall
      shape and position of these states.</think>I need to determine if a zip code

      Virginia is located on the East Coast of the United States, while Kentucky is
      an inland state to the west of Virginia.


      Step 2: Look at the general orientation of these states.

      Kentucky''s eastern border connects with Virginia''s western border. All of
      Virginia lies to the east of Kentucky.


      Step 3: Even without knowing the exact coordinates of these specific zip codes,
      I can determine their relative positions based on their states.

      Since 24486 is in Virginia and 40109 is in Kentucky, and Virginia is entirely
      east of Kentucky, the Virginia zip code must be east of the Kentucky zip code.

      of the zip code 49453 in Michigan (MI).


      First, I need to consider the geographical positions of these states:

      - New Hampshire (NH) is located in the northeastern United States, on the East
      Coast.

      - Michigan (MI) is located in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Generally, states on the East Coast like New Hampshire are east of Midwestern
      states like Michigan. The United States generally follows a west-to-east orientation
      where the West Coast is on the west, the Midwest is in the middle, and the East
      Coast is on the east.


      So based on the states alone, NH would be east of MI. The specific zip codes
      wouldn''t change this geographical relationship, as all locations in New Hampshire
      would be east of all locations in Michigan.


      Therefore, 03784, NH is located east of 49453, MI.</think>I need to determine
      whether the zip code 03784 in New Hampshire (NH) is located east of the zip
      code 49453 in Michigan (MI).


      Step 1: Identify the geographical locations of the states.

      - New Hampshire (NH) is located in the northeastern United States, on the East
      Coast.

      - Michigan (MI) is located in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 2: Determine the directional relationship between these states.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, New Hampshire is positioned to
      the east of Michigan.

      - All locations in New Hampshire are east of all locations in Michigan, regardless
      of the specific zip codes within each state.


      Step 3: Apply this relationship to the specific zip codes.

      - Since zip code 03784 is in New Hampshire, and zip code 49453 is in Michigan,
      the directional relationship follows that of their respective states.

      23702 in Virginia is located east of zip code 28607 in North Carolina.


      To solve this, I''ll need to:

      1. Identify the approximate locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their east-west positions


      First, let''s think about the general geography:

      - Virginia (VA) is generally northeast of North Carolina (NC)

      - Eastern parts of both states touch the Atlantic Ocean

      - Western parts of both states are more inland/mountainous


      For zip code 23702 in VA:

      This appears to be in the Portsmouth area, which is in the southeastern part
      of Virginia, near the coast in the Hampton Roads region.


      For zip code 28607 in NC:

      This appears to be around Boone, NC, which is in the western part of North Carolina
      in the Appalachian Mountains.


      Since 23702 (Portsmouth, VA) is near the Atlantic coast in eastern Virginia,

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 23702 is a zip code in Portsmouth, Virginia, which is located in the southeastern
      part of Virginia in the Hampton Roads region, near the Atlantic coast.

      - 28607 is a zip code in Boone, North Carolina, which is located in the western
      part of North Carolina in the Appalachian Mountains.


      ## Step 2: Compare east-west positions

      - Portsmouth, VA (23702) is in the coastal region of Virginia, very close to
      the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Boone, NC (28607) is in the mountainous western region of North Carolina,
      far from the coast.

      - On a map, locations in the eastern parts of states are closer to the Atlantic
      Ocean, while western parts are farther inland.


      ## Step 3: Draw conclusion

      Since Portsmouth (23702) is near Virginia''s coast and Boone (28607) is in western
      North Carolina in the mountains, the Virginia location is significantly east
      of the North Carolina location.

      First, let me identify where these zip codes are located:

      - 07871 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 15057 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      In the United States, New Jersey is generally located east of Pennsylvania.
      Pennsylvania borders New Jersey on its eastern border, and New Jersey is on
      the Atlantic coast.


      Since 07871 is in New Jersey and 15057 is in Pennsylvania, it''s likely that
      07871 is east of 15057. However, let me think about potential exceptions:


      If 07871 is in western New Jersey and 15057 is in eastern Pennsylvania, they
      could be relatively close to each other. But even in this case, the New Jersey
      location would still be east of the Pennsylvania location because of the states''
      geographical arrangement.


      So based on the general geography of these states, 07871, NJ is east of 15057,
      PA.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 07871 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 15057 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      - Pennsylvania is located west of New Jersey

      - New Jersey borders Pennsylvania on the east


      Step 3: Consider zip code patterns

      - NJ zip codes generally begin with 07-08

      - PA zip codes often begin with 15-19

      - The lower numbers in NJ (07xxx) are in the eastern part of the US compared
      to the higher numbers in PA (15xxx)


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on geography

      Since New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania, and these zip codes follow the standard
      postal code pattern, 07871 (NJ) would be located east of 15057 (PA).


      YES'
    d9127cd8-7116-4b74-be2c-b0d7eae4e3dd: '<think>To solve this problem, I need to
      determine if zip code 07871 in New Jersey is located east of zip code 15057
      in Pennsylvania.


      In the United States, generally:

      1. The first digit of the zip code indicates a large geographic region, with
      lower numbers in the east and higher numbers in the west.

      2. So generally, zip codes starting with 0 are more easterly than those starting
      with 1.


      07871 starts with 0, which typically covers New England and parts of the Northeast.

      15057 starts with 1, which typically covers parts of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic.


      Additionally, New Jersey (NJ) is generally east of Pennsylvania (PA) since NJ
      is on the Atlantic coast while PA is inland.


      So based on both the zip code patterns and the general geography of the states:

      - 07871, NJ should be east of 15057, PA.


      Let me verify this reasoning:

      - New Jersey is definitively east of Pennsylvania on the map

      - Zip codes starting with 0 are in the easternmost region of the US

      - Zip codes starting with 1 are in the region just west of the 0-region


      So yes, 07871, NJ is indeed east of 15057, PA.</think># Is 07871, NJ located
      east of 15057, PA?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Understand the zip code system

      In the US zip code system, the first digit generally indicates geographic regions
      from east to west, with lower numbers being further east.

      - 07871 starts with 0, which covers the easternmost region (primarily New England
      and some Mid-Atlantic areas)

      - 15057 starts with 1, which covers areas west of the 0-region


      ## Step 2: Consider state locations

      - New Jersey (NJ) is located on the Atlantic coast

      - Pennsylvania (PA) borders New Jersey to its west


      ## Step 3: Combine this information

      Since 07871 is in New Jersey (which is east of Pennsylvania) and has a first
      digit (0) that indicates an easterly location compared to 15057''s first digit
      (1), zip code 07871, NJ is east of 15057, PA.

      First, I''ll try to identify the locations:

      - 07640 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 17202 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Since these are neighboring states, I need to think about their relative geographic
      positions. In the United States, New Jersey is located to the east of Pennsylvania.
      Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey.


      The general geography of these states:

      - New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast

      - Pennsylvania is inland, bordering New Jersey on its eastern side


      Given this general state geography, a location in New Jersey (07640) would typically
      be east of a location in Pennsylvania (17202).


      To be even more precise, I would need to know the exact towns/cities these zip
      codes represent, but the state-level geography is usually sufficient for an
      east/west determination between these two states.</think>To determine if 07640,

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 07640 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 17202 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between the states.

      New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast, while Pennsylvania is inland. New
      Jersey borders Pennsylvania on Pennsylvania''s eastern side.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level geography to the zip codes.

      Since New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania, locations in New Jersey (including
      07640) are generally east of locations in Pennsylvania (including 17202).


      Step 4: Verify this isn''t an unusual case.

      These zip codes aren''t in unusual border areas that might contradict the general
      state positions - 07640 is in Bergen County in northeastern NJ, while 17202
      is in south-central PA.

      Let me think about US geography:

      - New Jersey (NJ) is on the east coast of the US

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is west of New Jersey


      Generally, zip codes in NJ will be east of zip codes in PA, since the entire

      - 07640 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 17202 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Generally speaking, New Jersey is located east of Pennsylvania on the US map.
      Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey, with New Jersey being on the Atlantic coast.


      However, I should be careful because zip codes near state borders might not
      perfectly follow the general state-to-state relationship. Let me think about
      these specific zip codes:


      - 07640 appears to be in northeastern New Jersey, likely in Bergen County based
      on the zip code pattern

      - 17202 appears to be in south-central Pennsylvania


      The general geography of the eastern United States places all of New Jersey
      east of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania doesn''t wrap around New Jersey in any way,
      and the border between the states runs roughly north-south, with PA to the west

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      New Jersey lies entirely to the east of Pennsylvania. The border between PA
      and NJ runs roughly north-south, with Pennsylvania to the west and New Jersey
      to the east.


      Step 3: Consider if there could be exceptions

      Even though zip codes don''t always follow a perfect west-to-east numbering
      pattern, the state boundary relationship is clear. Since these zip codes are

      Step 4: Draw conclusion

      Since 07640 is in NJ and 17202 is in PA, and NJ is east of PA, then 07640 must

      First, let''s identify what states these zip codes are in:

      - 07640 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 17202 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Looking at the geographical arrangement of these states:

      - Pennsylvania is located west of New Jersey

      - New Jersey borders Pennsylvania on its western side

      - New Jersey''s eastern border is the Atlantic Ocean


      The numbering of these zip codes doesn''t change this fundamental east-west
      relationship between the states. All of New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania in
      terms of longitude.


      Therefore, 07640, NJ is indeed located east of 17202, PA.


      YES'

      07640 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ).

      17202 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA).


      Generally speaking, New Jersey is located east of Pennsylvania, as Pennsylvania
      is inland while New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast. However, I should verify
      this for these specific zip codes.


      07640 appears to be the zip code for Harrington Park, NJ, which is in Bergen
      County in northeastern New Jersey, close to the New York state border and not
      far from the Atlantic Ocean.


      17202 appears to be in the Chambersburg area of Pennsylvania, which is in the
      south-central part of Pennsylvania, fairly close to the Maryland border.


      Given these locations, and knowing the general geography of the US eastern seaboard,
      07640 in northeastern NJ would indeed be east of 17202 in south-central PA.</think>I
      need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the zip codes.

      - 07640 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 17202 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between NJ and PA.

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast

      - Pennsylvania is located inland, west of New Jersey


      Step 3: Check if there are any unusual geographic arrangements.

      - Even though some parts of states can have complex boundaries, the zip code
      07640 (Harrington Park) is in Bergen County in northeastern NJ, far from the
      PA border

      - 17202 (Chambersburg area) is in south-central Pennsylvania

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 19032, PA: This is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 61801, IL: This is a zip code in Illinois (IL)


      The United States is organized with states generally laid out from west to east.
      Illinois (IL) is in the Midwest, while Pennsylvania (PA) is on the East Coast.


      Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is east of Illinois. But to be more precise
      about these specific zip codes:


      19032 appears to be a zip code in the eastern part of Pennsylvania

      61801 appears to be a zip code in Illinois (likely Urbana, which is in eastern
      Illinois)


      Even though 61801 might be in eastern Illinois, all of Pennsylvania is east
      of all of Illinois geographically. The easternmost point of Illinois is still
      west of the westernmost point of Pennsylvania.


      So a zip code in Pennsylvania (19032, PA) would definitely be east of a zip

      - 61801 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic locations of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - The entire state of Pennsylvania lies east of Illinois

      - Even the westernmost point of PA is east of the easternmost point of IL

      - Therefore any zip code in PA (including 19032) must be east of any zip code

      First, I''ll identify what these zip codes correspond to:

      - 19032, PA: This is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 61801, IL: This is a zip code in Illinois (IL)


      Now, I need to recall the relative positions of these states on the US map.
      The United States generally runs with the East Coast on the right (east) and
      the West Coast on the left (west).


      Pennsylvania (PA) is located on the east coast of the United States, while Illinois
      (IL) is located in the Midwest.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Pennsylvania is in the eastern part of the US

      - Illinois is in the middle of the US, west of Pennsylvania


      So geographically, Pennsylvania is east of Illinois. Since 19032 is in Pennsylvania
      and 61801 is in Illinois, it follows that 19032, PA is east of 61801, IL.</think>#
      Is 19032, PA located east of 61801, IL?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic locations of these

      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) The zip code 19032 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      2) The zip code 61801 is in Illinois (IL)

      3) On a US map, Pennsylvania is located on the eastern side of the United States

      4) Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      5) Pennsylvania is east of Illinois on the map

      6) Therefore, any location in Pennsylvania (including 19032) would be east of
      any location in Illinois (including 61801)


      ## Answer: YES

      1) 19032, PA refers to a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      2) 61801, IL refers to a zip code in Illinois (IL)


      To determine if one location is east of another in the United States, I need
      to consider their geographical positions.


      The United States is organized roughly so that:

      - Eastern states are on the Atlantic coast

      - Western states are on the Pacific coast

      - States in the middle are between them


      Pennsylvania (PA) is located in the eastern part of the United States, bordering
      the Atlantic Ocean.

      Illinois (IL) is located in the Midwest region of the United States, much further
      inland from the Atlantic.


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Pennsylvania is clearly east of Illinois.
      Pennsylvania is part of the original 13 colonies on the east coast, while Illinois
      is in the Midwest region.


      Since 19032 is in Pennsylvania and 61801 is in Illinois, the Pennsylvania zip
      code must be east of the Illinois zip code.</think>I need to determine the relative
      east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 19032 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 61801 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical positions of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is located on the eastern side of the United States, part of
      the Mid-Atlantic region near the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region, much further inland from the Atlantic
      coast.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, Pennsylvania is clearly east of
      Illinois.

      - All locations in Pennsylvania are east of all locations in Illinois.


      Since 19032 is in Pennsylvania and 61801 is in Illinois, and Pennsylvania is
      east of Illinois, the Pennsylvania zip code must be east of the Illinois zip
      code.

      19032, PA - This is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      61801, IL - This is a zip code in Illinois (IL)


      The United States is organized such that states in the eastern part of the country

      codes.


      Pennsylvania is located on the east coast of the United States, while Illinois
      is in the Midwest region.


      Looking at their geographic positions:

      - Pennsylvania is definitely east of Illinois

      - Since 19032 is in Pennsylvania and 61801 is in Illinois, 19032 would be east
      of 61801


      So the answer should be YES.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west

      Step 1: Identify the states for each zip code.

      - 19032 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Pennsylvania is significantly east of Illinois on the US map

      - All locations in Pennsylvania are east of all locations in Illinois

      To solve this, I need to:

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west)


      First, let''s consider the states:

      - PA (Pennsylvania) is located in the eastern part of the United States

      - IL (Illinois) is located in the midwest/central part of the United States


      Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is east of Illinois. On a map of the US, Pennsylvania
      is closer to the Atlantic coast, while Illinois is closer to the center of the
      country.


      Since 19032 is in Pennsylvania and 61801 is in Illinois, and Pennsylvania is

      - 19032 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Pennsylvania is located on the eastern side of the United States, bordering
      the Atlantic Ocean.

      Illinois is located in the Midwest region, much further inland from the Atlantic
      coast.


      Step 3: Consider the general arrangement of states.

      On a map of the United States, Pennsylvania is positioned to the east of Illinois.
      All of Pennsylvania is east of all of Illinois.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific ZIP codes.

      Since 19032 is in Pennsylvania and 61801 is in Illinois, and Pennsylvania is
      entirely east of Illinois, it follows that 19032, PA must be east of 61801,

    15eaca29-74ad-470d-a8b2-8d4585dc5c5e: '<think>To solve this problem, I need to
      determine the relative geographical positions of two zip codes:

      1. 29405, SC (South Carolina)

      2. 30354, GA (Georgia)


      I need to figure out if the first zip code is east of the second one.


      Let me think about the geography of the US East Coast:

      - South Carolina (SC) is located on the Atlantic coast

      - Georgia (GA) is also on the Atlantic coast, but south of South Carolina

      - Generally, the Atlantic coastline in this region runs approximately northeast
      to southwest


      So South Carolina is north of Georgia. But the question asks about east vs.
      west, not north vs. south.


      Let''s think about zip codes:

      - US zip codes generally increase as you go from east to west

      - Lower zip codes tend to be in the eastern parts of the country

      - The first digit of zip codes indicates the general region (1-3 for east coast)


      In this case, we have:

      - 29405 (South Carolina) - starts with 2

      - 30354 (Georgia) - starts with 3


      Since 29405 < 30354, and considering the general pattern of zip codes, this
      suggests that 29405 is more easterly than 30354.


      However, I need to be careful here because zip codes don''t perfectly align
      with longitude. Let me refine my thinking.


      Actually, the numbering of zip codes starts in the Northeast and generally increases
      as you go South and West. So the lower number (29405) being in South Carolina
      and the higher number (30354) being in Georgia is consistent with the general
      pattern.


      Looking at the geography more specifically:

      - South Carolina is generally east of Georgia, as Georgia is somewhat "below"
      South Carolina and extending further west

      - However, parts of Georgia do extend eastward to the Atlantic coast


      To be more precise, I need to consider the specific locations:

      - 29405 is in the Charleston area of South Carolina, which is on the Atlantic
      coast

      - 30354 is in the Atlanta area of Georgia, which is inland


      Charleston (29405) is definitely east of Atlanta (30354). Charleston is on the
      coast while Atlanta is inland Georgia.</think># Is 29405, SC located east of
      30354, GA?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these zip codes by identifying
      their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 29405 is a zip code in South Carolina, specifically in the Charleston area.

      - 30354 is a zip code in Georgia, in the Atlanta area.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions.

      - Charleston, SC is located on the Atlantic coast in eastern South Carolina.

      29405 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)

      30354 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)


      South Carolina is generally located to the east of Georgia on the US map. Georgia
      is directly west of South Carolina.


      29405 appears to be in the Charleston area of South Carolina, which is on the
      Atlantic coast.

      30354 appears to be in the Atlanta area of Georgia, which is in the northern
      part of Georgia and inland.

      side of the state near the Atlantic coast.

      - 30354 is in the Atlanta area of Georgia, which is in the northern part of
      Georgia and more inland.


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      - Since South Carolina is east of Georgia, and specifically Charleston (29405)
      is east of Atlanta (30354), the first zip code is east of the second one.

      is located east of 15468, PA. Let me work through this step by step.


      First, I need to understand what these zip codes correspond to in terms of geographic
      locations:

      - 07440 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 15468 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Now, I need to think about the geographic relationship between New Jersey and
      Pennsylvania. In the United States:

      - Pennsylvania is located west of New Jersey

      - New Jersey is located east of Pennsylvania


      This is a general geographic fact about these two states. New Jersey borders
      the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side, while Pennsylvania is an inland state
      that borders New Jersey on its western border.


      Since 07440 is in New Jersey and 15468 is in Pennsylvania, and New Jersey is
      east of Pennsylvania, it follows that 07440, NJ is east of 15468, PA.</think>To
      determine if 07440, NJ is located east of 15468, PA, I need to analyze the geographic
      relationship between these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these zip codes are located.

      - 07440 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 15468 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is located inland, directly west of New Jersey

      - New Jersey shares its western border with Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 07440 is in New Jersey and 15468 is in Pennsylvania, and all of New
      Jersey is east of Pennsylvania, it follows that 07440, NJ must be east of 15468,
      PA.


      YES'
    7c86fade-0999-4aa0-961a-7c35e3f2e00e: '<think>I need to determine if zip code
      07440 in New Jersey is located east of zip code 15468 in Pennsylvania.


      In the United States, zip codes generally follow a pattern where codes in the
      eastern parts of the country have lower numbers than those in the western parts.
      The first digit of the zip code typically indicates a general region, with 0
      being the northeastern states and higher numbers moving westward.


      So here we have:

      - 07440 in NJ (starts with 0, which is the Northeast region)

      - 15468 in PA (starts with 1, which is generally the Mid-Atlantic/eastern region)


      Since 07440 starts with 0 and 15468 starts with 1, and lower numbers are generally
      more eastern, this suggests that 07440 NJ is east of 15468 PA.


      Also, geographically, New Jersey is located east of Pennsylvania on a map. Most
      of NJ is east of most of PA. However, I should be careful because zip codes
      don''t always follow perfect geographic patterns, and parts of states can have
      unusual arrangements.


      But in this case, the zip code numbering convention and the general geographic
      relationship between NJ and PA align. New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania, and
      the lower zip code number (07xxx vs 15xxx) confirms this pattern.</think>To
      determine if 07440, NJ is located east of 15468, PA, I''ll think about this
      geographically:


      Step 1: Let me consider the states first. New Jersey (NJ) is located on the
      Atlantic coast, while Pennsylvania (PA) is inland and borders NJ on its western
      side. This means that generally, locations in NJ are east of locations in PA.


      Step 2: Looking at the zip codes, I can also confirm this pattern. In the US
      zip code system, lower numbers tend to be assigned to the eastern parts of the
      country, while higher numbers are assigned to western regions. The first digit
      "0" in 07440 indicates the Northeast region (including NJ), while "1" in 15468
      indicates areas slightly west of that (including PA).


      Step 3: The specific zip code 07440 is in northern New Jersey (Riverdale/Pompton
      Lakes area), while 15468 is in southwestern Pennsylvania. The geographic relationship
      holds true for these specific locations as well.


      YES, 07440, NJ is located east of 15468, PA.'

      east of 15468, PA, I need to determine the geographical locations of these zip
      codes.


      First, let me think about the general geography of New Jersey (NJ) and Pennsylvania
      (PA). New Jersey is located east of Pennsylvania on the US map.


      Now, looking at the specific zip codes:

      - 07440 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 15468 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Since all of New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania (with the exception of some
      small areas where the Delaware River creates an irregular border), it''s generally
      true that any location in New Jersey would be east of any location in Pennsylvania.


      So without knowing the exact locations of these specific zip codes, I can say
      with high confidence that 07440, NJ is east of 15468, PA simply based on the
      state locations.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 07440 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 15468 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast, while Pennsylvania is an inland
      state. New Jersey is positioned entirely to the east of Pennsylvania on the
      map of the United States.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code patterns.

      The lower zip code numbers in the northeast (like 07xxx) generally correspond
      to areas closer to the east coast, while higher numbers (like 15xxx) tend to
      be further inland/west.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on state boundaries.

      Since 07440 is in NJ and 15468 is in PA, and NJ is east of PA, the location
      in NJ must be east of the location in PA.

      \ (starting with 9)\n- The numbering generally increases as you move west across\

    717cd925-8557-4a52-9f27-e74b7aaf417f: '<think>To determine if 53209, WI (Wisconsin)
      is east of 55904, MN (Minnesota), I need to think about the geographic locations
      of these zip codes.


      First, let''s consider the states:

      - 53209 is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - 55904 is in Minnesota (MN)


      Generally, Wisconsin is located east of Minnesota. Minnesota borders Wisconsin
      on Wisconsin''s western border.


      Looking at US zip code patterns:

      - Minnesota zip codes generally start with 550-567

      - Wisconsin zip codes generally start with 530-549


      The fact that the Wisconsin zip code (53209) has a lower number than the Minnesota
      zip code (55904) aligns with the general west-to-east pattern of zip codes in
      the US, where numbers tend to get higher as you move west.


      So geographically, a zip code in Wisconsin would generally be east of a zip
      code in Minnesota, since Wisconsin as a state is east of Minnesota.</think>#
      Is 53209, WI located east of 55904, MN?


      I need to determine the relative locations of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 53209 is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - 55904 is in Minnesota (MN)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      Minnesota and Wisconsin are neighboring states, with Minnesota located to the
      west of Wisconsin. Wisconsin shares its western border with Minnesota.


      ## Step 3: Confirm with zip code patterns

      US zip codes generally follow patterns that align with geographic locations.
      The lower numbers of Wisconsin zip codes (starting with 53) compared to Minnesota
      zip codes (starting with 55) also support the west-to-east progression.


      ## Conclusion

      YES, 53209, WI is located east of 55904, MN.'

      relative east-west position of two US zip codes.


      Let me break down the information:

      1. 53209 is in Wisconsin (WI)

      2. 55904 is in Minnesota (MN)


      I need to determine if the Wisconsin zip code is east of the Minnesota zip code.


      Geographically, Wisconsin is located east of Minnesota in the United States.
      Minnesota borders Wisconsin on Wisconsin''s western side.


      Since zip codes are generally assigned geographically, it''s very likely that
      any location in Wisconsin would be east of any location in Minnesota, especially
      when we''re comparing zip codes that don''t appear to be from unusual border
      areas.


      Let me verify this reasoning:

      - Minnesota is located directly west of Wisconsin

      - 53209 is in Wisconsin (specifically in the Milwaukee area)

      - 55904 is in Minnesota (specifically in Rochester)

      - Milwaukee is in eastern Wisconsin

      - Rochester is in southeastern Minnesota


      So yes, 53209 in Wisconsin would be east of 55904 in Minnesota.</think># Is
      53209, WI located east of 55904, MN?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the geographical relationship between

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 53209 is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - 55904 is in Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic relationship between these states

      Minnesota is located directly west of Wisconsin. The two states share a border,
      with Wisconsin to the east of Minnesota.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations

      - 53209 is in the Milwaukee area of Wisconsin (eastern part of the state)

      - 55904 is in Rochester, Minnesota (southeastern part of Minnesota)


      Step 4: Determine relative position

      Since Minnesota is west of Wisconsin, and these zip codes are in their respective
      states, 53209 (WI) must be east of 55904 (MN).

      Let me think about the geography of the United States. Massachusetts is located
      in the northeastern part of the US, on the Atlantic coast. Pennsylvania is also
      in the northeastern US, but it''s more inland and southwest of Massachusetts.


      In the US, states that are on the Atlantic coast from north to south are: Maine,

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west)


      01604 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA).

      18704 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA).


      Let me think about the geography of the US East Coast:

      - Massachusetts is located in New England, in the northeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is located southwest of Massachusetts


      Looking at the map of the US from west to east, we have:

      - Pennsylvania is more westward

      - Massachusetts is more eastward


      Since Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania, a zip code in Massachusetts would
      be east of a zip code in Pennsylvania.


      Therefore, 01604, MA is located east of 18704, PA.</think>I need to determine
      the relative geographical positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 01604 is in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 18704 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States (New England region),
      while Pennsylvania is located in the Mid-Atlantic region.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Massachusetts is positioned to the east
      of Pennsylvania. The entire state of Massachusetts lies east of Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Since the zip codes are in their respective states, the relative positions

      1) I need to determine where 10598, NY and 44627, OH are located relative to
      each other, specifically whether the NY zip code is east of the OH zip code.


      2) First, I''ll recall some geographic facts:

      - New York (NY) is generally east of Ohio (OH) in the United States

      - The eastern states are generally numbered with lower zip codes, while western
      states have higher numbers


      3) Specifically for these zip codes:

      - 10598 is a zip code in New York

      - 44627 is a zip code in Ohio


      4) Since New York is east of Ohio geographically, and this follows the general
      pattern of zip codes (lower numbers in the east), it''s very likely that 10598,
      NY is east of 44627, OH.


      So based on the geographic relationship between New York and Ohio, I can conclude
      that 10598, NY is indeed east of 44627, OH.</think>To determine if 10598, NY
      is located east of 44627, OH, I''ll think step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 10598 is in New York (NY)

      - 44627 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic relationship between these states.

      - On a map of the United States, New York is located to the east of Ohio.

      - Ohio borders Lake Erie to the north, Pennsylvania to the east, and West Virginia
      and Kentucky to the south.

      - New York is located east of Pennsylvania, which is east of Ohio.


      Step 3: Consider specific locations within states.

      - While specific zip codes within states could potentially change this relationship,
      the general east-west relationship between New York and Ohio is significant
      enough that any zip code in NY would be east of any zip code in OH.


      Step 4: Draw conclusion based on geographic knowledge.

      - Since New York state is entirely east of Ohio state, 10598, NY must be east
      of 44627, OH.


      YES'

      1. Identify the locations of both zip codes

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west)


      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - New York (NY) is on the East Coast

      - Ohio (OH) is in the Midwest


      Generally, New York is east of Ohio. The entire state of New York is east of
      the entire state of Ohio.


      So 10598, NY should be east of 44627, OH simply based on the states they''re
      in. Let''s double-check our logic:


      United States geography from east to west generally goes:

      - East Coast (including New York)

      - Mid-Atlantic

      - Midwest (including Ohio)

      - etc.


      So New York zip codes are indeed east of Ohio zip codes. Since 10598 is in NY
      and 44627 is in OH, the NY zip code must be east of the OH zip code.</think>#
      Is 10598, NY located east of 44627, OH?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes by looking

      - 10598 is in New York (NY)

      - 44627 is in Ohio (OH)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geography of the United States

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region

      - When looking at a map of the US, New York is positioned to the east of Ohio


      ## Step 3: Determine relative position

      Since New York state is entirely east of Ohio state, any location in New York
      (including zip code 10598) must be east of any location in Ohio (including zip
      code 44627).

      1. We have ZIP code 10598, which is in New York (NY)

      2. We have ZIP code 44627, which is in Ohio (OH)

      3. I need to determine if the NY location is east of the OH location


      The United States is arranged such that:

      - Eastern states like New York are on the east coast

      - Midwestern states like Ohio are more centrally located but still in the eastern
      half of the country


      Geographically, New York is generally east of Ohio on the map of the United
      States. New York borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east, while Ohio is more
      inland.


      So generally speaking, locations in New York state would be east of locations
      in Ohio. This is because Ohio is west of New York on the US map.


      Therefore, ZIP code 10598 in NY would be east of ZIP code 44627 in OH.</think>To

      Step 1: Consider the general geographic relationship between New York and Ohio.

      New York is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while Ohio
      is in the Midwest region.


      Step 2: Compare the relative positions of these states.

      Ohio lies to the west of New York. When looking at a US map, Ohio is positioned
      to the left (west) of New York.


      Step 3: Consider if there could be any unusual situations.

      Even accounting for unusual shapes of state borders, all of New York state is
      east of all of Ohio state. There are no portions of Ohio that extend east of
      any part of New York.


      Step 4: Since 10598 is in NY and 44627 is in OH, the geographic relationship
      between these specific zip codes follows the relationship between their states.

      let me think about the geographic locations.


      New York is a state on the east coast of the United States, while Ohio is in
      the Midwest. Geographically, New York is east of Ohio.

      - 43160 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Think about the geographic locations of Virginia and Ohio within the
      United States.

      - Virginia is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is in the Midwest, but more specifically, it''s located west of Virginia


      Step 3: Since Virginia is east of Ohio, and the zip codes 22150 and 43160 are

      - 22150 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      - 43160 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Virginia and Ohio.

      - Virginia is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region

      - Virginia is positioned east of Ohio on the map


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on state positions.

      to determine if zip code 22150 in Virginia is located east of zip code 43160
      in Ohio.


      I''ll approach this geographically:


      1. First, let''s think about the states. Virginia (VA) is located on the East
      Coast of the United States, while Ohio (OH) is located in the Midwest.


      2. Generally speaking, Virginia is east of Ohio. The entire state of Virginia
      is positioned to the east of Ohio on a map of the United States.


      3. Zip codes within these states would generally follow this same relationship.
      Zip code 22150 in VA would be somewhere in Virginia, and zip code 43160 in OH
      would be somewhere in Ohio.


      4. Since Virginia is east of Ohio, it follows that a location in Virginia (22150)
      would be east of a location in Ohio (43160).


      So yes, 22150, VA is located east of 43160, OH.</think># Is 22150, VA located
      east of 43160, OH?


      To determine this, I need to analyze the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 22150 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 43160 is in Ohio (OH)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      Virginia is located on the East Coast of the United States, while Ohio is in
      the Midwest region. Looking at a US map, Virginia is positioned entirely east
      of Ohio.


      ## Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific zip codes

      Since Virginia as a whole is east of Ohio, and these zip codes are within their
      respective states, zip code 22150 in VA must be east of zip code 43160 in OH.


      ## Conclusion

      YES, 22150, VA is located east of 43160, OH.'

      1) I need to determine if zip code 28403 in North Carolina is east of zip code
      29388 in South Carolina.


      2) To determine this, I need to know the geographical locations of these zip
      codes.


      3) 28403 is in Wilmington, North Carolina, which is a coastal city on the Atlantic
      Ocean in the eastern part of North Carolina.


      4) 29388 is in Woodruff, South Carolina, which is in the upstate region of South
      Carolina, in the northwestern part of the state.


      5) North Carolina and South Carolina are neighboring states, with North Carolina
      being north of South Carolina. However, the question is about east-west positioning.


      6) Since Wilmington, NC is on the Atlantic coast (eastern edge of NC), and Woodruff,
      SC is in the northwestern part of SC (far from the coast), it''s clear that
      28403 (Wilmington, NC) is east of 29388 (Woodruff, SC).</think>I''ll solve this
      step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 28403 is in Wilmington, North Carolina

      - 29388 is in Woodruff, South Carolina


      Step 2: Consider their geographical positions.

      - Wilmington (28403) is a coastal city on the Atlantic Ocean in eastern North
      Carolina

      - Woodruff (29388) is located in the upstate region of South Carolina, in the
      northwestern part of the state


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Coastal locations like Wilmington are on the eastern edge of the United States

      - Upstate/northwestern South Carolina is considerably more inland and westward


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on this information.

      - Since Wilmington is on the Atlantic coast and Woodruff is in the inland northwestern
      part of South Carolina, 28403 (NC) is clearly east of 29388 (SC)


      YES'
    7e64912d-8448-478a-b006-d233d6ea0033: '<think>This question is asking about the
      relative east-west positions of two zip codes:

      - 28403, which is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 29388, which is in South Carolina (SC)


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to know their approximate geographic
      locations.


      Generally, US zip codes follow some patterns where lower numbers tend to be
      in the eastern US and higher numbers in the western US. However, this is a very
      rough pattern and isn''t reliable for comparing nearby states.


      North Carolina and South Carolina are adjacent states on the US east coast,
      with North Carolina being north of South Carolina. But that doesn''t directly
      tell us about the east-west relationship.


      Let me try to recall the approximate locations:

      - 28403 is likely in the eastern part of North Carolina, possibly near Wilmington
      which is on the coast

      - 29388 is likely in the western or central part of South Carolina


      The Atlantic coast forms a diagonal line where the coastline runs roughly northeast
      to southwest. This means that eastern North Carolina is generally east of western
      South Carolina.


      If 28403 is near the NC coast (which is likely given the first three digits
      starting with 28), and 29388 is further inland in SC, then yes, 28403 would
      be east of 29388.


      Let me be more specific about these zip codes:

      - 28403 appears to be a zip code for Wilmington, NC, which is on the Atlantic
      coast

      - 29388 appears to be in the Spartanburg area of SC, which is in the northwestern
      part of the state near the Appalachian mountains


      So yes, 28403 (Wilmington, NC) would be significantly east of 29388 (Spartanburg
      area, SC).</think>To determine if one zip code is east of another, I need to
      find their locations and compare their longitudes (east-west positions).


      Step 1: Identify the specific locations of these zip codes.

      - 28403 is a zip code in Wilmington, North Carolina, which is on the Atlantic
      coast.

      - 29388 is a zip code in the Spartanburg area of South Carolina, which is in
      the northwestern part of that state near the Appalachian Mountains.


      Step 2: Consider the geography of North Carolina and South Carolina.

      - While North Carolina is north of South Carolina, that doesn''t automatically
      tell us about east-west positioning.

      - The Atlantic coastline in this region runs northeast to southwest.

      - Wilmington, NC is on the coast, while Spartanburg, SC is far inland.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Coastal locations in this region are farther east than inland locations.

      - Wilmington (28403) is on the Atlantic coast, which places it very far east.

      - Spartanburg (29388) is in the northwestern part of SC, placing it much further
      west.


      YES, 28403 in North Carolina is located east of 29388 in South Carolina.'

      Looking at a US map, Alabama is definitely east of Texas. The entire state of
      Alabama lies to the east of Texas, with Mississippi in between them.


      So if 36107 is in Alabama and 76001 is in Texas, then 36107 must be east of
      76001.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 36107 is in Alabama (AL)

      - 76001 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these states.

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - On a US map, Alabama is entirely east of Texas

      - Texas borders the Gulf of Mexico on the southeast, but Alabama is still further
      east

      - The states of Louisiana and Mississippi lie between Texas and Alabama


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since 36107 is in Alabama, and 76001 is in Texas, and Alabama is east of Texas,
      it follows that 36107, AL is east of 76001, TX.

      - 36107 is in Alabama (AL)

      - 76001 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Alabama is located in the southeastern United States, while Texas is in the
      south-central United States. On a map of the US, Alabama is positioned to the
      east of Texas.


      Step 3: Consider if there are any exceptions for these specific zip codes.

      While specific zip codes within states can sometimes be positioned differently
      than the general state-to-state relationship, this is not the case here. All
      of Alabama, including zip code 36107, is east of all of Texas, including zip
      code 76001.


      YES, 36107, AL is located east of 76001, TX.'

      to determine if the zip code 36107 in Alabama (AL) is located east of the zip
      code 76001 in Texas (TX).


      Since the US follows a general west-to-east orientation with longitude, I need
      to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      First, let''s consider the general locations:

      - Alabama (AL) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas (TX) is located in the south-central United States


      Generally speaking, Alabama is east of Texas on a map of the United States.
      Texas borders the Gulf of Mexico on its southeast border, while Alabama is several
      states to the east, also bordering the Gulf of Mexico.


      So based on general state locations, it would appear that 36107, AL is east
      of 76001, TX. But to be certain, I should think about the specific zip codes.


      Zip code 36107 is likely in or near Montgomery, Alabama, which is in the central
      part of Alabama.

      Zip code 76001 is likely in or near Arlington, Texas, which is in the northeastern
      part of Texas.


      Even though 76001 is in the eastern part of Texas, and 36107 is not on the extreme
      eastern edge of Alabama, the entire state of Alabama is still significantly
      east of Texas. There are entire states between them (like Louisiana and Mississippi).


      So indeed, 36107, AL is east of 76001, TX.</think># Is 36107, AL located east
      of 76001, TX?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 36107 is in Alabama (AL)

      - 76001 is in Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States

      - Moving from Texas to Alabama, you travel eastward

      - Several states (like Louisiana and Mississippi) lie between Texas and Alabama


      ## Step 3: Consider specific zip code locations

      - 36107 is in Montgomery, Alabama (central Alabama)

      - 76001 is in Arlington, Texas (northeastern Texas)


      ## Step 4: Compare positions

      Even though 76001 is in northeastern Texas (the eastern part of the state),
      the entire state of Alabama lies east of Texas. The westernmost point of Alabama
      is still east of the easternmost point of Texas.


      Therefore: YES, 36107, AL is located east of 76001, TX.'

    df707790-4fe4-4037-8b32-465dca90b45c: '<think>This question is asking me to determine
      if a zip code in NY (11361) is located east of a zip code in IN (46567). To
      answer this, I need to think about the geographical locations.


      First, let''s identify the states:

      - 11361 is in New York (NY)

      - 46567 is in Indiana (IN)


      In the United States, New York is located on the east coast, while Indiana is
      in the Midwest. Generally speaking, states on the east coast are east of states
      in the Midwest.


      New York is east of Indiana. Therefore, locations in New York would generally
      be east of locations in Indiana.


      So, 11361, NY should be located east of 46567, IN.</think>To determine if 11361,
      NY is located east of 46567, IN, I need to consider the geographic positions
      of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 11361 is in New York (NY)

      - 46567 is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      New York is located on the East Coast of the United States, while Indiana is
      in the Midwest region.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      The easternmost point of Indiana is still west of the westernmost point of New
      York. In other words, the entire state of New York lies east of the entire state
      of Indiana.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 11361 is in New York and 46567 is in Indiana, and all of New York is east
      of all of Indiana, the zip code 11361 must be east of zip code 46567.


      YES'

      east of 46567, IN, I need to figure out where these zip codes are located geographically.


      11361 is a zip code in New York (NY). New York is on the east coast of the United
      States.

      46567 is a zip code in Indiana (IN). Indiana is in the Midwest region of the
      United States.


      Geographically, the United States is arranged such that states on the east coast
      (like New York) are east of midwestern states (like Indiana).


      So based on the general geographic arrangement of US states, New York is east
      of Indiana, which means that 11361, NY would be east of 46567, IN.</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 11361 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 46567 is a zip code in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on the map.

      - All of New York state is east of Indiana

      - Therefore, any zip code in NY would be east of any zip code in IN


      Since 11361, NY is in New York, and 46567, IN is in Indiana, and New York is
      east of Indiana, the answer is:


      YES'

      Since the United States generally follows a west-to-east orientation in terms
      of geography, I need to determine the relative positions of these two states:


      1. Illinois (IL) is a midwestern state

      2. Pennsylvania (PA) is an eastern state


      In terms of the general geographical orientation of the US, Pennsylvania is
      east of Illinois.


      To be more specific, we could also consider that:

      - Illinois is located roughly in the middle of the country

      - Pennsylvania is located on the eastern side of the country, bordering the

      3. Compare their locations (in the US, east = lower longitude number)


      First, let''s consider the geography of the United States:

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is in the eastern part of the US

      - Illinois (IL) is in the midwestern part of the US


      Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is east of Illinois. But to be certain, I should
      check the specific zip codes.


      For 18240, PA:

      This appears to be a valid zip code in Pennsylvania, which is in the eastern
      United States.


      For 61611, IL:

      This appears to be a valid zip code in Illinois, which is in the midwest United

      - Pennsylvania borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east

      - Illinois is much further inland, west of Pennsylvania

      - All of Pennsylvania is east of all of Illinois


      Step 4: Since these zip codes are in their respective states, the geographic

      To answer this, I need to use my knowledge of US geography. In the United States:

      - Illinois (IL) is in the Midwest region

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is in the Northeast region


      In terms of east-west positioning, Pennsylvania is located east of Illinois.
      The entire state of Pennsylvania is east of the entire state of Illinois.

      - 61611, IL: This is a zip code in Illinois (IL)


      To determine which is east of the other, I need to consider the geographic positions

      - Midwest: Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, etc.

      - And then continuing westward to the West Coast


      Pennsylvania is an eastern state, located on the eastern side of the US.

      Illinois is a midwestern state, located more centrally in the US.


      Geographically, Pennsylvania is east of Illinois. The eastern edge of Illinois

      Pennsylvania''s western border is still east of Illinois''s eastern border.
      The entire state of Pennsylvania lies east of Illinois, with Ohio in between

      First, let''s recall the geography of the United States:

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is located in the eastern part of the United States

      - Illinois (IL) is located in the midwestern part of the United States


      In terms of east-west geography, Pennsylvania is clearly east of Illinois. The
      entire state of Pennsylvania is east of the entire state of Illinois.


      Since 18240 is in Pennsylvania and 61611 is in Illinois, and Pennsylvania is

      step.


      First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It''s asking whether
      the location with zip code 18240 in Pennsylvania (PA) is located east of the
      location with zip code 61611 in Illinois (IL).


      To determine this, I need to know the relative positions of Pennsylvania and
      Illinois within the United States.


      The United States is organized such that:

      - States on the East Coast include Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode
      Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, etc.

      - States in the Midwest include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin,
      etc.

      - Pennsylvania is on the East Coast, though slightly inland from the Atlantic
      Ocean.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest.


      Geographically, Pennsylvania is located east of Illinois. This is a general
      fact about US geography - Pennsylvania is an eastern state while Illinois is
      more in the middle of the country.


      So, based on the states alone, a location in Pennsylvania would be east of a
      location in Illinois.</think># Determining if 18240, PA is east of 61611, IL


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes based on their
      states.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 18240 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 61611 is in Illinois (IL)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Pennsylvania is located on the eastern side of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      ## Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      The United States is arranged such that states progressively go from east to
      west. Pennsylvania is significantly east of Illinois on the US map.


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Since Pennsylvania is east of Illinois geographically, any location in Pennsylvania
      (including zip code 18240) would be east of any location in Illinois (including
      zip code 61611).

      east of 88048, NM, I need to figure out where these zip codes are located and
      compare their east-west positions.


      First, let me identify where these zip codes are:

      - 75604 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      - 88048 is a zip code in New Mexico (NM)


      Now, I need to think about the general geographic position of Texas relative
      to New Mexico. In the United States:

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern part of the country

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the country, and is east of
      New Mexico


      Generally, Texas is east of New Mexico. But I need to check if these specific
      zip codes maintain this relationship, as zip codes near borders could potentially
      break this pattern.


      Given that:

      - 75604 appears to be in the typical TX numbering range (75xxx)

      - 88048 appears to be in the typical NM numbering range (88xxx)


      And since Texas is generally east of New Mexico, it''s very likely that 75604,
      TX is indeed east of 88048, NM.</think>I need to determine the relative positions
      of these two zip codes by examining their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 75604 is in Texas (TX)

      - 88048 is in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic relationship between these states

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Texas shares its western border with New Mexico, meaning Texas is east of
      New Mexico


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes

      - US zip codes are generally organized regionally

      - These zip codes (75604 and 88048) are in their respective standard state ranges

      - There''s no indication these are unusual border cases that would contradict
      the standard state relationship


      Since Texas is east of New Mexico, and these zip codes are within their standard
      state territories, 75604 (TX) is east of 88048 (NM).

      75604 is a zip code in Texas (TX).

      88048 is a zip code in New Mexico (NM).


      First, let me think about the general geography of the United States. Texas
      is located in the south-central part of the US, while New Mexico is in the southwestern
      US. Generally speaking, Texas is east of New Mexico.


      But I need to be more specific about these particular zip codes.


      75604 appears to be in the eastern part of Texas, likely near Longview.

      88048 appears to be in the southern part of New Mexico, possibly near Las Cruces
      or Santa Teresa.


      Since Texas is generally east of New Mexico, and 75604 is in eastern Texas,
      while 88048 is in southern New Mexico, it''s very likely that 75604, TX is indeed
      east of 88048, NM.


      To be certain, I would need to know the exact longitudes, but based on the general
      geography of these states, 75604, TX should be east of 88048, NM.</think># Step-by-Step
      Reasoning


      To determine if 75604, TX is located east of 88048, NM, I need to consider their
      geographic positions:


      1) First, I''ll consider the states: Texas is located east of New Mexico in
      the United States.


      2) Zip code 75604 is in Texas, specifically in the eastern part of Texas (Longview
      area).


      3) Zip code 88048 is in New Mexico, in the southern part of the state (likely
      in or near Sunland Park).


      4) Looking at the general geography, even the westernmost parts of Texas are
      typically east of the easternmost parts of New Mexico.


      5) Since 75604 is in eastern Texas and 88048 is in southern New Mexico, the
      distance between them is substantial, with 75604 being much further east.


      Based on this geographical analysis, 75604, TX is definitely located east of
      88048, NM.

      step.


      1) I need to figure out where 75604, TX and 88048, NM are located relative to
      each other.


      2) First, let me think about the general geography of Texas (TX) and New Mexico
      (NM). Texas is located east of New Mexico in the United States.


      3) Now let''s think about zip codes. In the US zip code system, the first 3
      digits of a 5-digit zip code generally indicate a regional area. Lower numbers
      tend to be in the eastern US, with higher numbers as you move west.


      4) 75604 is in Texas with a first 3 digits of 756, while 88048 is in New Mexico
      with first 3 digits of 880.


      5) The 756xx zip codes are in eastern Texas, while the 880xx zip codes are in
      southern New Mexico.


      6) Since Texas is east of New Mexico, and considering the general pattern of
      zip codes, 75604, TX should be east of 88048, NM.</think>To determine if 75604,
      TX is east of 88048, NM, I need to understand the relative positions of these
      locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' positions.

      Texas (TX) is located east of New Mexico (NM) in the United States.


      Step 2: Examine the zip code patterns.

      In the U.S. postal system, zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower
      numbers tend to be assigned to the eastern parts of the country, while higher
      numbers are assigned to western areas.


      Step 3: Compare the zip codes.

      75604 (TX) has a significantly lower number than 88048 (NM).


      Step 4: Confirm with geographic knowledge.

      75604 is in eastern Texas (likely in the Longview area), while 88048 is in southern
      New Mexico (likely in the Sunland Park area).


      Since Texas is east of New Mexico, and specifically 75604 is in the eastern
      part of Texas, while 88048 is in New Mexico, the Texas location is definitely
      east of the New Mexico location.

      Since Georgia as a state is east of Texas, and these zip codes are within their
      respective states, it follows that 30342, GA would be east of 75033, TX.


      To be even more certain, I could consider the longitude of these locations,
      as east-west position is determined by longitude (with more eastern locations
      having higher longitude values). But based on the general geography of the United
      States, I''m confident that any location in Georgia would be east of any location
      in Texas.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 30342 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)

      - 75033 is a zip code in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of Georgia and Texas.

      - Georgia is located on the southeastern coast of the United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Georgia is significantly east of Texas on the U.S. map

      - All Georgia zip codes are east of all Texas zip codes because of the states''
      relative positions


      Step 4: Conclude based on these states'' positions.

      - Since 30342 is in Georgia, and 75033 is in Texas, and Georgia is east of Texas,
      then 30342 must be east of 75033


      YES'

      located east of 75033, TX, I need to find the geographical locations of these
      zip codes and compare their longitudes.


      30342 is a zip code in Georgia (GA). Georgia is located in the southeastern
      United States.

      75033 is a zip code in Texas (TX). Texas is located in the south-central United
      States.


      Generally speaking, Georgia is east of Texas on a map of the United States.
      This is because the continental US has Texas on the western side and Georgia
      more toward the eastern seaboard.


      To be more precise:

      - Locations in the eastern US have lower longitude values than locations in
      the western US

      - East = lower longitude values

      - West = higher longitude values


      Georgia (30342) should have a lower longitude value than Texas (75033), which
      would mean Georgia is east of Texas.


      Let me confirm my general knowledge:

      - Georgia is indeed in the southeastern US, bordering the Atlantic Ocean

      - Texas is indeed in the south-central US, extending to the Gulf of Mexico


      Based on this geographical knowledge, 30342, GA would be east of 75033, TX.</think>#
      Is 30342, GA located east of 75033, TX?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 30342 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 75033 is in Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, along the Atlantic coast

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States, far more westward than
      Georgia


      ## Step 3: Apply geographic knowledge of US regions

      - On a map of the United States, Georgia is significantly east of Texas

      - All of Georgia lies east of all of Texas


      ## Step 4: Compare specific zip codes

      - Since 30342 is in Georgia and 75033 is in Texas, the Georgia zip code must
      be east of the Texas zip code

      - The specific locations within their respective states don''t change this east-west
      relationship

      2. To determine if one is east of the other, I need to compare their longitude
      coordinates. Lower longitude values are further east in the United States.


      3. Generally speaking, North Carolina is located on the eastern coast of the
      United States, while Alabama is more inland and to the west of North Carolina.


      4. In terms of states, North Carolina is east of Alabama. North Carolina borders
      the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side, while Alabama is several states away
      from the Atlantic coast.


      5. Since zip code 28457 is in North Carolina and zip code 35954 is in Alabama,
      and North Carolina is generally east of Alabama, it''s likely that 28457, NC
      is east of 35954, AL.


      Let me double-check this general knowledge: North Carolina is indeed east of
      Alabama. Looking at a map of the United States, Alabama is in the southeastern
      part of the country, but North Carolina is even further east, directly bordering
      the Atlantic Ocean.


      So, 28457, NC should be east of 35954, AL based on the general geographic positions
      of these states.</think># Is 28457, NC located east of 35954, AL?


      I need to determine the relative locations of these two zip codes by examining
      their states'' positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 28457 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 35954 is in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - North Carolina is located on the eastern coast of the United States, bordering
      the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Alabama is located inland in the southeastern United States, west of North
      Carolina.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Alabama is west of North Carolina.

      - Therefore, any location in North Carolina would be east of any location in
      Alabama.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 28457 is in North Carolina and 35954 is in Alabama, the first zip code
      must be east of the second.

      1) The question is asking if the location with zip code 02790 in Massachusetts

      2) To determine this, I need to know the relative positions of these locations.


      3) In the United States, Massachusetts is a state on the East Coast, while Ohio
      is in the Midwest.


      4) Geographically, Massachusetts is east of Ohio.


      5) Since 02790 is in Massachusetts and 44030 is in Ohio, it follows that 02790,
      MA is east of 44030, OH.


      Let me verify this with my knowledge of US geography: Massachusetts is definitely

      - 44030 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states

      Massachusetts is located on the East Coast of the United States, while Ohio

      The westernmost point of Massachusetts is still east of the easternmost point
      of Ohio.


      Step 4: Draw conclusion

    13e9a9a0-2609-457f-ae60-ba322df7aca6: '<think>This question is asking me to compare
      the geographic locations of two zip codes: 19363, PA and 26330, WV. Specifically,
      I need to determine if 19363, PA is located east of 26330, WV.


      In the United States, zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers
      tend to be in the eastern part of the country, and higher numbers tend to be
      in the western part. However, this is not a perfect rule, so I should think
      about the states themselves.


      Pennsylvania (PA) is located east of West Virginia (WV) on the US map. Pennsylvania
      borders the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side (via the Delaware River to Delaware
      Bay), while West Virginia is a landlocked state that is west of Pennsylvania.


      Given that:

      1. PA is east of WV

      2. The zip code 19363 is in PA

      3. The zip code 26330 is in WV


      It''s very likely that 19363, PA is east of 26330, WV.


      Additionally, the first digit of zip codes in the US generally indicates a geographic
      region:

      - 0 and 1: Northeast

      - 2 and 3: South and parts of the East Coast

      - 4 and 5: Midwest and Plains

      - 6: South Central

      - 7: South Central and Mountain

      - 8: Mountain and Northwest

      - 9: West Coast and Pacific


      So 19363 (starting with 1) suggests Northeast, while 26330 (starting with 2)
      suggests South or East Coast. This doesn''t definitively tell us which is more
      easterly, but combined with the state information, it strengthens the conclusion.</think>#
      Is 19363, PA located east of 26330, WV?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes
      by examining their states and zip code patterns.


      ## Step 1: Analyze the states

      Pennsylvania (PA) is located east of West Virginia (WV) on the US map. Pennsylvania
      borders the Atlantic Ocean (via the Delaware River to Delaware Bay), while West
      Virginia is landlocked and situated to the west of Pennsylvania.


      ## Step 2: Consider zip code patterns

      In the US zip code system, lower numbers generally (but not always) indicate
      more eastern locations. The first digits provide geographic regions:

      - Zip codes starting with 1 (like 19363) typically refer to the Northeast region

      - Zip codes starting with 2 (like 26330) typically refer to the mid-Atlantic
      region


      ## Step 3: Combine the information

      Since Pennsylvania is east of West Virginia, and the zip code patterns support
      this east-west relationship (19xxx vs 26xxx), I can conclude that 19363, PA
      is indeed east of 26330, WV.


      YES'

      step:


      1) I need to determine if 19363, PA (Pennsylvania) is east of 26330, WV (West
      Virginia).


      2) To answer this, I need to know the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      3) In the United States, Pennsylvania is located east of West Virginia. Pennsylvania
      borders West Virginia on West Virginia''s eastern side.


      4) Generally, zip codes in the eastern United States tend to be lower in number
      as you move east (though this isn''t perfectly consistent).


      5) 19363 is a lower number than 26330, which is consistent with the general
      pattern of lower zip codes being further east.


      6) Given that PA is east of WV geographically, and that the specific zip code
      numbers align with the general pattern (lower number in PA, higher in WV), it''s
      very likely that 19363, PA is east of 26330, WV.</think>I need to determine
      if zip code 19363 in Pennsylvania is east of zip code 26330 in West Virginia.

      Virginia''s eastern side.


      Step 2: Look at the zip code patterns. In the US postal system, zip codes generally
      follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to be in the eastern parts of the
      country, while higher numbers tend to be in the western parts.


      Step 3: Compare the zip codes. 19363 (PA) is a lower number than 26330 (WV),
      which aligns with the general east-to-west pattern of zip codes.


      Step 4: Put these facts together. Since Pennsylvania is east of West Virginia
      geographically, and the specific zip code 19363 in PA has a lower number than
      26330 in WV (consistent with the east-to-west pattern), zip code 19363 is east
      of zip code 26330.

      WV (West Virginia).


      To answer this, I need to:

      1. Recall the general geographic positioning of Pennsylvania and West Virginia

      2. More specifically, determine the relative east-west positioning of these
      specific zip codes


      Pennsylvania is generally located east of West Virginia on the US map. Pennsylvania
      borders the Atlantic coast (via Delaware Bay), while West Virginia is more inland.


      Zip code 19363 is in Pennsylvania (PA), and zip code 26330 is in West Virginia
      (WV).


      Since Pennsylvania is east of West Virginia, it''s likely that 19363, PA is
      east of 26330, WV. However, I should be careful because states have irregular
      shapes, and certain parts of one state might extend past parts of another state.


      In this case, though, I''m confident that all of Pennsylvania is east of most
      of West Virginia. The eastern border of West Virginia does not extend past the
      western border of Pennsylvania.</think># Is 19363, PA located east of 26330,
      WV?


      Let me think about this step by step:


      1) First, I need to consider the general geographic positions of Pennsylvania
      (PA) and West Virginia (WV).


      2) Pennsylvania is located to the east of West Virginia on the US map. Pennsylvania
      borders the Atlantic coast (via Delaware Bay), while West Virginia is more inland.


      3) ZIP code 19363 is in Pennsylvania, likely in the southeastern part of the
      state.


      4) ZIP code 26330 is in West Virginia, which lies to the west of Pennsylvania.


      5) Even accounting for the irregular shapes of these states, Pennsylvania is
      positioned entirely east of West Virginia on the map.


      Therefore, YES, 19363, PA is located east of 26330, WV.'

      if a location in Colorado (CO) with zip code 80487 is east of a location in
      Utah (UT) with zip code 84056.


      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Think about the general geography of Colorado and Utah

      2. Consider the relative positions of these two states

      3. Determine if the specific location in CO is east of the specific location
      in UT


      First, let''s recall the geography of these states. Utah is west of Colorado
      - they share a border, with Colorado being directly east of Utah.


      Since 80487 is in Colorado and 84056 is in Utah, and Colorado is east of Utah,
      it''s highly likely that 80487, CO is east of 84056, UT.


      However, I should be careful because sometimes locations near borders could
      have unusual relative positions. But given that these are full zip codes in
      their respective states, and Colorado is entirely east of Utah (they share a
      straight north-south border), any location in Colorado would be east of any
      location in Utah.</think>I need to determine if a location in Colorado with
      zip code 80487 is east of a location in Utah with zip code 84056.


      Step 1: Consider the geographic relationship between Colorado and Utah.

      Utah and Colorado share a border, with Colorado positioned directly east of
      Utah. The border between them runs north-south.


      Step 2: Think about the zip code locations.

      Since 80487 is in Colorado (CO) and 84056 is in Utah (UT), and given that all
      of Colorado is east of all of Utah due to their shared border orientation, any
      location in Colorado would be east of any location in Utah.


      Step 3: Draw the conclusion.

      Because 80487 is in Colorado, and Colorado is entirely east of Utah, this location
      must be east of 84056, which is in Utah.

      (Colorado) is located east of 84056, UT (Utah).


      First, let''s consider the geographical relationship between Colorado and Utah.
      Colorado is directly east of Utah in the United States. The entire state of
      Colorado is east of the entire state of Utah.


      So any location in Colorado should be east of any location in Utah. Since 80487
      is in Colorado (CO) and 84056 is in Utah (UT), we can conclude that 80487, CO
      is east of 84056, UT.


      Let me double-check this reasoning:

      - 80487 is a zip code in Colorado

      - Since all of Colorado is east of Utah, any zip code in Colorado would be east
      of any zip code in Utah

      - 80487 being in Colorado means it must be east of 84056 which is in Utah

      First, let''s identify what states these zip codes are in:

      - 80487, CO: This is in Colorado (CO)

      - 84056, UT: This is in Utah (UT)


      Now I need to think about the relative positions of these states. In the United
      States:

      - Utah is located directly west of Colorado

      - Colorado is located directly east of Utah


      Since these zip codes are in their respective states (80487 in Colorado and
      84056 in Utah), and Colorado is east of Utah, we can conclude that 80487, CO
      would be east of 84056, UT.


      To be more precise, I should note that while there might be some irregularities
      in zip code boundaries, the question is about states that share a border with
      a clear east-west relationship. Since 80487 is in Colorado and 84056 is in Utah,
      the east-west relationship of the states would apply to these zip codes as well.</think>I

      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Colorado and Utah share a border, with Colorado located directly east of Utah.
      This is a well-established geographic fact - Utah is west of Colorado on the
      US map.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the zip codes.

      Since 80487 is in Colorado and 84056 is in Utah, the zip code in Colorado would
      be east of the zip code in Utah, following the same geographic relationship
      as their respective states.


      YES, 80487, CO is located east of 84056, UT.'

      Geographically, Colorado is located east of Utah. These two states share a border,

      Now, let''s consider the specific zip codes:

      - 80487 is a zip code in Colorado

      - 84056 is a zip code in Utah


      Since Colorado is east of Utah, and these zip codes are in their respective
      states, it''s very likely that 80487, CO is east of 84056, UT.


      However, I should note that zip codes near state borders could potentially create
      exceptions to this general rule. But given that these are standard zip codes
      for their respective states (CO zip codes typically start with 8, and UT zip
      codes typically start with 84), the general geographic relationship between

      Utah and Colorado share a border, with Utah positioned directly to the west
      of Colorado.


      Step 3: Determine if the specific zip codes follow this same east-west relationship.

      The zip code 80487 is within Colorado, while 84056 is within Utah. Since these
      are standard zip codes for their respective states (not unusual border exceptions),
      they follow the same geographical relationship as their states.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on this geographical knowledge.

      - New York is on the Atlantic coast

      - Ohio is inland, bordering Pennsylvania to its east and Lake Erie to its north


      Since New York is east of Ohio geographically, zip codes in New York would generally
      be east of zip codes in Ohio.


      Therefore, 10162, NY would be located east of 44095, OH.</think>To determine
      if 10162, NY is located east of 44095, OH, I need to consider the geographic
      positions of New York and Ohio.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 10162 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 44095 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest, west of New York


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      On a map of the United States, New York is positioned to the east of Ohio. The
      entire state of New York lies east of Ohio.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      Since New York is entirely east of Ohio, any zip code in New York (including
      10162) would be east of any zip code in Ohio (including 44095).

      40219 in Kentucky (KY) is located east of zip code 62207 in Illinois (IL).


      First, let me think about the geographic positions of these states:

      - Kentucky (KY) is located east of Illinois (IL) in the United States.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest, while Kentucky is considered part of the South
      or sometimes the Midwest/Southeast border.


      Since we''re comparing specific zip codes rather than the entire states, I should
      be a bit more careful. But generally speaking, almost all of Kentucky is east
      of almost all of Illinois due to their relative positions.


      40219 is a zip code in Louisville, Kentucky, which is in the northern part of
      Kentucky, close to the Indiana border.

      62207 appears to be in East St. Louis, Illinois, which is in the southwestern
      part of Illinois.


      Given that Kentucky is east of Illinois, and the specific locations of these
      zip codes don''t change that relationship (Louisville is still east of East
      St. Louis), I can conclude that 40219, KY is located east of 62207, IL.</think>#
      Is 40219, KY located east of 62207, IL?


      To answer this question, I need to think about the geographic locations of these
      zip codes and their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 40219 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 62207 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the US

      - Kentucky is located to the southeast of Illinois

      - Generally, Kentucky is east of Illinois


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - 40219 is in the Louisville area of Kentucky

      - 62207 is in the East St. Louis area of Illinois, in the southwestern part
      of the state

      - Even considering these specific locations, the Louisville area is still east
      of the East St. Louis area


      Therefore, based on the geographic positions of these states and zip codes,
      40219, KY is indeed located east of 62207, IL.


      YES'
    833e33f5-6802-4217-afc8-fa918f25d682: '<think>I need to determine if 40219, KY
      (Kentucky) is located east of 62207, IL (Illinois).


      To answer this, I need to know the relative geographic positions of these zip
      codes, or more generally, the relative positions of Kentucky and Illinois.


      In the US, Kentucky is located east of Illinois. Illinois borders Kentucky along
      Kentucky''s northwest border. Kentucky is generally southeast of Illinois.


      So generally speaking, locations in Kentucky tend to be east of locations in
      Illinois. However, I need to be careful because specific zip codes near the
      border could have different relative positions.


      Let me think about the specific zip codes:

      - 40219 is in Kentucky

      - 62207 is in Illinois


      Since these are specific zip codes, I should consider their precise locations.
      However, without looking at a map, I can make a reasonable judgment based on
      the general positions of the states.


      Given that Kentucky is east of Illinois, and these zip codes don''t appear to
      be in unusual border areas (based on my knowledge of US zip code distributions),
      it''s reasonable to conclude that 40219, KY is east of 62207, IL.</think>To

      - 40219 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 62207 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      Illinois is located to the west of Kentucky. The Mississippi River forms part
      of the western boundary of Kentucky, with Illinois on the opposite side.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes

      40219 is in Louisville, in north-central Kentucky

      62207 is in East St. Louis, in southwestern Illinois


      Step 4: Analyze their relative positions

      Since Illinois is west of Kentucky, and these particular zip codes aren''t in
      unusual border areas that would reverse this relationship, 40219 (Louisville,
      KY) is indeed east of 62207 (East St. Louis, IL).

      KY (Kentucky) is located east of 62207, IL (Illinois).


      To solve this, I''ll need to think about the geographic positions of these states
      and the specific zip codes.


      First, let me consider the states:

      - KY (Kentucky) is generally east of IL (Illinois). Kentucky borders Illinois
      along Illinois'' southeastern border.


      Now for the specific zip codes:

      - 40219 is a zip code in Kentucky, likely in or near Louisville (which is in
      the northern part of KY)

      - 62207 is a zip code in Illinois


      In the US, states that are further east generally have lower zip codes, but
      this isn''t a perfect rule, especially when comparing across state boundaries.
      So I can''t rely on the zip code numbers themselves to determine east-west positioning.


      Since Kentucky as a whole is east of Illinois, and these specific zip codes
      don''t change that general geographic relationship, I can conclude that 40219,
      KY is east of 62207, IL.</think># Is 40219, KY located east of 62207, IL?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 40219 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 62207 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Kentucky is located in the Southeast/East-Central region

      - Looking at a US map, Kentucky is positioned to the east of Illinois


      Step 3: Confirm that the specific zip codes don''t contradict the general state
      positioning.

      - 40219 is in Louisville, Kentucky (in the north-central part of Kentucky)

      - 62207 is in East St. Louis, Illinois (in the southwestern part of Illinois)

      - Even accounting for these specific locations within their states, the Kentucky
      zip code remains east of the Illinois zip code


      YES, 40219, KY is located east of 62207, IL.'

      Kansas (KS) is located in the central part of the United States, in what''s
      often called the Midwest.


      Geographically speaking, West Virginia is indeed east of Kansas. If we were
      to look at a map of the United States, West Virginia would be significantly
      to the right (east) of Kansas.


      So the answer should be YES - 25701, WV is located east of 66217, KS.</think>To
      determine if 25701, WV is east of 66217, KS, I need to consider the geographic
      locations of West Virginia and Kansas.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 25701 is in West Virginia (WV)

      - 66217 is in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of these states in the US.

      - West Virginia is located in the eastern part of the United States, in the
      Appalachian region

      - Kansas is located in the central part of the United States, in the Midwest
      region

      To be even more specific:

      - Georgia is on the Atlantic coast in the southeast

      - Arkansas is inland, west of the Mississippi River


      Since Georgia is entirely east of Arkansas, any zip code in Georgia (including
      30346) would be east of any zip code in Arkansas (including 72207).


      Therefore, 30346, GA is indeed east of 72207, AR.</think>I''ll solve this step
      by step:


      Step 1: Let me identify the states these zip codes are in.

      - 30346 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 72207 is in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: I need to determine the relative geographical positions of these states.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States, west of the Mississippi
      River.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning.

      - Georgia is significantly east of Arkansas on the US map.

      - All of Georgia is geographically east of all of Arkansas.


      Step 4: Since zip code 30346 is in Georgia and zip code 72207 is in Arkansas,
      and Georgia is entirely east of Arkansas, the Georgia zip code must be east
      of the Arkansas zip code.

      1) I need to determine if the zip code 31636 in Georgia (GA) is located east
      of the zip code 70062 in Louisiana (LA).


      2) To do this, I need to know the relative geographic positions of these locations.
      In the United States, states that are further east have lower longitude values,
      and states that are further west have higher longitude values.


      3) Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States, on the Atlantic
      coast.


      4) Louisiana (LA) is located in the southern United States, along the Gulf of
      Mexico, west of Georgia.


      5) In general, Georgia is east of Louisiana in terms of geographic position.


      6) Since 31636 is in Georgia and 70062 is in Louisiana, and Georgia is east
      of Louisiana, it would follow that 31636, GA is east of 70062, LA.


      Let me verify this general understanding with my knowledge of US geography:
      Georgia borders the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side, while Louisiana is several
      states to the west. Moving from Louisiana to Georgia, you would be traveling
      eastward. This confirms my reasoning.</think>To determine if 31636, GA is located

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 31636 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 70062 is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, along the Atlantic coast.

      Louisiana is located in the south-central United States, along the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      In the United States, states further east have lower longitude values than states
      further west.

      Georgia is positioned significantly east of Louisiana. In fact, Louisiana is
      several states west of Georgia (Mississippi and Alabama lie between them).


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 31636 is in Georgia and 70062 is in Louisiana, and Georgia is east of
      Louisiana, it follows that 31636, GA is east of 70062, LA.

      To answer this, I need to think about the relative geographic positions of these
      two locations.


      First, let''s recall the general geography of the United States:

      - Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States, along the Atlantic
      coast

      - Louisiana (LA) is located in the south-central United States, along the Gulf
      of Mexico


      In terms of east-west positioning, Georgia is generally east of Louisiana. If
      we look at a map of the United States, Louisiana is to the west of Georgia.


      31636 is a zip code in Georgia, and 70062 is a zip code in Louisiana. Since
      Georgia is east of Louisiana, we can conclude that 31636, GA is located east
      of 70062, LA.</think>I need to determine if a Georgia zip code is east of a
      Louisiana zip code by considering their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean.

      Louisiana (LA) is located in the south-central United States, along the Gulf
      of Mexico.


      Step 2: Determine east-west relationship.

      On a U.S. map, Georgia is positioned to the east of Louisiana. The entire state
      of Georgia is east of the entire state of Louisiana.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      Since 31636 is in Georgia and 70062 is in Louisiana, the zip code in Georgia
      must be east of the zip code in Louisiana, because their respective states maintain
      this east-west relationship.

      if a location with zip code 45449 in Ohio (OH) is located east of a location
      with zip code 63109 in Missouri (MO).


      To solve this, I need to know the relative geographical positions of these zip
      codes or at least their states.


      Let''s think about the geography of the United States:

      - Ohio (OH) is in the eastern part of the Midwest region

      - Missouri (MO) is in the central part of the Midwest region


      In terms of east-west positioning, Ohio is generally east of Missouri. The entire
      state of Ohio lies east of the entire state of Missouri.


      So without even needing to know the specific locations of these zip codes within
      their states, I can determine that any location in Ohio (including 45449) would
      be east of any location in Missouri (including 63109).


      Therefore, 45449, OH is located east of 63109, MO.</think>I need to determine

      Step 1: Identify the states in question.

      - 45449 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 63109 is in Missouri (MO)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      Ohio is located in the eastern part of the Midwest region of the United States,
      while Missouri is located in the central/western part of the Midwest.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Ohio is entirely east of Missouri. The
      western border of Ohio is still east of the eastern border of Missouri.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since any point in Ohio must be east of any point in Missouri (due to their
      relative positions), zip code 45449 in OH must be east of zip code 63109 in
      MO.

      To solve this problem, I need to:

      1. Determine the geographical location (coordinates) of 28512, NC

      2. Determine the geographical location (coordinates) of 29067, SC

      3. Compare their east-west positions (longitude)


      In the US, lower zip codes within the same first digit generally tend to be
      more eastern, but this isn''t reliable across state lines and different first
      digits. I need to look at the actual locations.


      Zip code 28512 is in North Carolina. North Carolina is generally north of South
      Carolina.

      Zip code 29067 is in South Carolina.


      The first digits are 2 for both, but 28xxx vs 29xxx suggests 28512 might be
      more eastern, as lower zip codes in the same first-digit region tend to be more
      eastern. However, I need to be more specific about these exact locations.


      I know that North Carolina''s coast is on the Atlantic Ocean, and zip codes
      in eastern NC tend to be in the 285xx range.

      South Carolina is also a coastal state, but the 290xx range could be inland.


      Based on my knowledge of US geography, NC zip code 28512 is likely in the eastern
      coastal region of North Carolina, while SC zip code 29067 is likely in a more
      central or western part of South Carolina. If that''s the case, then 28512,

      Let me analyze the locations of these zip codes step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify where these zip codes are located geographically.


      2) Zip code 28512 is in North Carolina. The "285xx" range in NC typically covers
      the eastern coastal region of the state, including areas like Carteret County
      and the Atlantic coastline.


      3) Zip code 29067 is in South Carolina. The "290xx" range in SC generally covers
      central areas of South Carolina, typically inland from the coast.


      4) Looking at the relative positions: North Carolina and South Carolina share
      a border, with NC to the north of SC. However, for the eastern/western positioning,
      I need to consider the specific zip codes.


      5) The eastern parts of North Carolina (where 28512 is likely located) extend
      further east than most of South Carolina.


      6) Zip code 28512 is likely near the Atlantic coast of NC, while 29067 is in
      a more central or western part of SC.


      Based on this analysis of US postal geography, YES, 28512, NC is located east
      of 29067, SC.'
    9db2efc8-ff87-46cc-b9c3-a191e7c40aea: '<think>Let me reason through this step
      by step.


      1) The question is asking whether the location with ZIP code 28512 in North
      Carolina (NC) is east of the location with ZIP code 29067 in South Carolina
      (SC).


      2) To determine this, I need to find the approximate locations of these ZIP
      codes.


      3) US ZIP codes generally follow a pattern where codes increase as you go from
      east to west, with the lowest numbers in the northeast and the highest in the
      northwest. However, there are many exceptions to this pattern, especially within
      states, so I can''t rely solely on the numbers.


      4) Generally, North Carolina is north of South Carolina. But that doesn''t tell
      us about east-west positioning.


      5) The first digits of the ZIP codes (2 in both cases) indicate they''re in
      the same general region (mid-Atlantic states).


      6) 28xxx is a North Carolina prefix, while 29xxx is a South Carolina prefix.


      7) Within the eastern states, lower ZIP code numbers tend to be more eastern
      than higher ones.


      8) So ZIP code 28512 (NC) likely represents a location east of ZIP code 29067
      (SC).


      Let me confirm this logic: North Carolina and South Carolina both have coastlines
      on the Atlantic Ocean (eastern border). ZIP codes in the US generally increase
      from east to west. So a lower ZIP code (28512) in NC is likely to be more eastern
      than a higher ZIP code (29067) in SC.</think># Is 28512, NC located east of
      29067, SC?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two ZIP codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 28512 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 29067 is in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider ZIP code patterns.

      In the US postal system, ZIP codes generally follow patterns where lower numbers
      tend to be further east within a region. The first digit "2" indicates both
      are in the same general region (mid-Atlantic).


      Step 3: Compare the specific codes.

      - 28xxx series covers North Carolina

      - 29xxx series covers South Carolina

      - Within this system, 28512 (being a lower number than 29067) suggests it''s
      more eastward


      Step 4: Check geographical context.

      North Carolina''s eastern portions include the Outer Banks and coastal areas
      that extend further east than any part of South Carolina.


      Step 5: ZIP code 28512 corresponds to Atlantic, NC, which is in the eastern
      coastal region of North Carolina, while 29067 is an inland South Carolina ZIP
      code.

    f5cdb634-3588-4aab-a46b-206877450f46: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the geographic locations of these two zip codes and compare them.


      28512 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      29067 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to find their approximate longitudes.
      In the US, lower longitude values represent points further east (since longitude
      decreases as you move east in the US).


      Let me think about what I know about NC and SC geography:

      - North Carolina and South Carolina are adjacent states on the US east coast

      - Generally, North Carolina is north of South Carolina

      - However, the question is asking about east/west positioning, not north/south


      Let me consider the specific zip codes:

      - 28512 in NC - This appears to be in eastern North Carolina

      - 29067 in SC - This appears to be somewhere in central/eastern South Carolina


      Based on the general pattern of zip codes in the US, the first three digits
      (285 vs 290) suggest that 28512 is likely east of 29067, as lower numbers in
      the first three digits often (but not always) indicate locations further east
      within this region.


      I believe 28512 (NC) is likely in the coastal region of North Carolina, which
      would place it east of most of South Carolina, including 29067.</think># Reasoning
      about whether 28512, NC is east of 29067, SC


      I need to determine the geographic locations of these two ZIP codes and compare
      their east-west positioning.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 28512 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 29067 is in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider ZIP code geography.

      ZIP codes in the eastern United States generally follow a pattern where lower
      numbers tend to be further east. The 285xx series in NC is typically assigned
      to eastern/coastal regions of North Carolina, while the 290xx series in SC is
      typically assigned to central/inland areas of South Carolina.


      Step 3: Examine state geography.

      North Carolina''s eastern border includes the Atlantic coastline, and some of
      its easternmost ZIP codes are on the Outer Banks and coastal regions. South
      Carolina is generally southwest of North Carolina.


      Step 4: Compare the specific ZIP codes.

      28512 (NC) is in the Atlantic coastal region of North Carolina (specifically
      around the Cape Lookout/Harkers Island area), while 29067 (SC) is located inland
      in South Carolina.


      YES, 28512, NC is located east of 29067, SC.'

      if the ZIP code 85396 in Arizona (AZ) is located east of ZIP code 91780 in California
      (CA).


      I need to recall the geography of the United States. In the US, California is
      on the west coast, and Arizona is to the east of California. So generally, locations
      in Arizona will be east of locations in California.


      More specifically:

      - ZIP code 85396 is in Arizona (AZ)

      - ZIP code 91780 is in California (CA)


      Since Arizona is east of California, it follows that 85396, AZ would be east
      of 91780, CA.


      So the answer is YES.</think>To determine if 85396, AZ is located east of 91780,
      CA, I need to consider the geographic relationship between these states and
      their ZIP codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 85396 is in Arizona (AZ)

      - 91780 is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic relationship between these states.

      California is located on the west coast of the United States, while Arizona
      borders California on the east. This means that Arizona is generally east of
      California.


      Step 3: Consider if there might be any exceptions based on the specific ZIP
      codes.

      While some states have complex boundaries, the relationship between California
      and Arizona is straightforward - Arizona is entirely east of California. No
      part of Arizona extends west of any part of California.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on state positions.

      Since 85396 is in Arizona and 91780 is in California, and Arizona is east of
      California, the Arizona ZIP code must be east of the California ZIP code.


      NO

      east of 91780, CA, I need to use my knowledge of US geography and the zip code
      system.


      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - 85396 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ)

      - 91780 is a zip code in California (CA)


      In general, in the US zip code system:

      - Lower numbers tend to be in the eastern part of the country

      - Higher numbers tend to be in the western part of the country


      Specifically:

      - Zip codes starting with 8 are typically in the Mountain Time Zone states (including
      Arizona)

      - Zip codes starting with 9 are typically in the Pacific Time Zone states (including
      California)


      Arizona is generally east of California in the United States. California is
      on the west coast, while Arizona is one state inland to the east.


      Since 85396 is in Arizona and 91780 is in California, and Arizona is east of
      California, then 85396, AZ would be east of 91780, CA.</think>I''ll solve this
      step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 85396 is in Arizona (AZ)

      - 91780 is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona borders California and is located to the east of California


      Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 85396 is in Arizona, and 91780 is in California, the Arizona zip code
      must be east of the California zip code


      Therefore, based on the geographic positions of these states, 85396, AZ is located
      east of 91780, CA.


      YES'

      the zip code 85396, AZ (Arizona) is located east of zip code 91780, CA (California).


      To determine this, I need to think about the geographic relationship between
      Arizona and California. In the United States:

      - California is on the west coast

      - Arizona is directly east of California


      So generally speaking, locations in Arizona are east of locations in California.
      But let''s be more specific about these zip codes.


      85396 is a zip code in Arizona. Based on the state''s position, it would be
      east of California.

      91780 is a zip code in California.


      Since Arizona is east of California, and 85396 is in Arizona while 91780 is
      in California, it follows that 85396, AZ is east of 91780, CA.</think>To determine
      if 85396, AZ is located east of 91780, CA, I need to consider the geographic
      positions of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 85396 is in Arizona (AZ)

      - 91780 is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona borders California to the east


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - Since 85396 is in Arizona, and 91780 is in California

      - And Arizona is positioned east of California


      Therefore, 85396, AZ is located east of 91780, CA.


      YES'
    a9c31d21-145b-4412-86af-0f6db23990fd: '<think>To determine whether 85396, AZ is
      east of 91780, CA, I need to understand the geographic positions of these zip
      codes.


      In the US, zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the
      east and higher numbers are in the west. The first digit of zip codes ranges
      from 0 (Northeast) to 9 (West Coast).


      Looking at these zip codes:

      - 85396 begins with 8, which typically corresponds to Arizona and parts of the
      Southwest

      - 91780 begins with 9, which typically corresponds to California and other West
      Coast states


      Since Arizona (AZ) is to the east of California (CA), and this aligns with the
      zip code patterns (8 is less than 9, suggesting more eastern location), 85396
      in Arizona should be east of 91780 in California.


      Let me verify this understanding by recalling that Arizona is indeed to the
      east of California in the US geography. California is on the Pacific coast,
      while Arizona is one state inland from California and to the east.</think>I
      need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes by examining
      their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 85396 is in Arizona (AZ)

      - 91780 is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic relationship between these states

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona borders California to the east


      Step 3: Determine the relative position

      - Since Arizona is positioned to the east of California, any location in Arizona
      (including zip code 85396) would be east of any location in California (including
      zip code 91780)


      NO.

      YES, 85396, AZ is located east of 91780, CA.'
    b256f3b7-1e36-40aa-ab26-45b96f9496c6: '<think>I need to determine if the ZIP code
      85396 in Arizona is located east of the ZIP code 91780 in California.


      In the United States, ZIP codes generally follow a pattern where codes increase
      as you move from east to west. This is because the first digit of ZIP codes
      starts with 0 in the Northeast (like Maine, New Hampshire) and increases as
      you move west, with 9 being the West Coast (California, Washington, Oregon,
      etc.).


      So looking at the first digits:

      - 85396 starts with 8 (Arizona)

      - 91780 starts with 9 (California)


      Since 8 comes before 9, and ZIP codes generally increase from east to west,
      this would suggest that 85396 (Arizona) is east of 91780 (California).


      This aligns with the general geography of the United States, as Arizona is indeed
      east of California.</think># Is 85396, AZ located east of 91780, CA?

      ## Step 1: Consider the geography of Arizona and California

      Arizona (AZ) is located east of California (CA) in the United States. This is
      a general geographic fact - California is on the west coast, while Arizona is
      inland to the east of California.


      ## Step 2: Verify with ZIP code patterns

      ZIP codes in the US have some geographical patterns. The first digit of ZIP
      codes generally increases as you move west across the country:

      - ZIP code 85396 is in Arizona (starts with 8)

      - ZIP code 91780 is in California (starts with 9)


      While the first digits might seem to contradict the geography (since 9 > 8),
      the ZIP code system doesn''t perfectly follow west-to-east ordering at this
      level of detail. The state-level geography is more relevant here.


      ## Step 3: Conclusion

      Since Arizona is geographically east of California, ZIP code 85396 in AZ is
      east of ZIP code 91780 in CA.

      - The entire New England region (including New Hampshire) lies to the east of
      the Midwest region (including Michigan)

      - Looking at a US map, New Hampshire is significantly east of Michigan


      Step 4: Confirm zip code locations.

      - Since these zip codes are within their respective states, they follow the

      Let me recall the geography of the United States:

      - New Hampshire (NH) is located in the northeastern part of the United States,
      specifically in the New England region.

      - Michigan (MI) is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States.


      In terms of east-west positioning, New Hampshire is located on the East Coast,
      while Michigan is more inland and to the west of New Hampshire.


      Since US geography follows the convention that east is toward the Atlantic Ocean
      and west is toward the Pacific Ocean, New Hampshire is east of Michigan.


      Therefore, zip code 03303 in NH would be east of zip code 49337 in MI.</think>To

      03303 is a zip code in New Hampshire (NH).

      49337 is a zip code in Michigan (MI).


      In the United States, states on the East Coast are more eastern than states
      in the Midwest. New Hampshire is a state in the northeastern United States,
      specifically in the New England region, which is on the East Coast. Michigan
      is a Midwestern state, located in the Great Lakes region.


      Given the geography of the United States, New Hampshire is definitely located
      east of Michigan. So any location in New Hampshire would be east of any location
      in Michigan.


      Therefore, 03303, NH is located east of 49337, MI.</think>I need to determine
      the geographic relationship between these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 03303 is a zip code in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 49337 is a zip code in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New Hampshire is located in the northeastern United States (New England region)

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 3: Compare their positions on the east-west axis.

      - New Hampshire is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Michigan is significantly west of New Hampshire


      Step 4: Make my determination.

      Since all of New Hampshire is east of all of Michigan on a map of the United
      States, any zip code in NH (including 03303) would be east of any zip code in
      MI (including 49337).

      3. Compare their relative positions east/west


      Pennsylvania (PA) is a state in the eastern United States, while Indiana (IN)

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is located in the northeastern part of the United States.

      - Indiana (IN) is located in the midwestern part of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare the relative positions of Pennsylvania and Indiana.

      Pennsylvania is generally east of Indiana. The entire state of Pennsylvania

      US zip codes generally follow a pattern where the first digit represents a broad
      region, with lower numbers in the east and higher numbers in the west.


      85013 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ).

      92672 is a zip code in California (CA).


      Looking at the first digits:

      - 8 for Arizona

      - 9 for California


      Since California is on the west coast of the US and Arizona is inland to the
      east of California, Arizona would be east of California.


      To verify: California borders the Pacific Ocean on the west, and Arizona borders
      California on the east. So any location in Arizona would be east of any location
      in California.


      Therefore, 85013, AZ is east of 92672, CA.</think># Is 85013, AZ located east
      of 92672, CA?


      To determine this, I need to consider the geographic positions of Arizona and

      1) California (CA) is located on the west coast of the United States

      2) Arizona (AZ) is located inland, bordering California''s eastern edge

      3) All of Arizona is east of California geographically

      4) Therefore, any zip code in Arizona (including 85013) would be east of any
      zip code in California (including 92672)


      YES, 85013, AZ is located east of 92672, CA.'

      In the United States, zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers

      this is a very rough pattern with many exceptions, so I shouldn''t rely on just
      the numbers.


      What I do know more reliably:

      - Arizona (AZ) is east of California (CA)

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona borders California to the east


      Since 85013 is in Arizona and 92672 is in California, and Arizona is east of
      California, it follows that 85013, AZ is east of 92672, CA.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona borders California to the east


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the zip codes.

      - Since 85013 is in Arizona, and Arizona is east of California

      - And 92672 is in California

      - Therefore, 85013 (AZ) must be east of 92672 (CA)

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 79838 is in Texas (TX)

      - 85621 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, while Texas is in the
      south-central United States. On a west-to-east orientation, Arizona is west
      of Texas.


      Step 3: Check if this general state relationship applies to these specific zip
      codes

      The zip code 79838 is in western Texas, while 85621 is in southern Arizona.
      Even the westernmost parts of Texas are still east of Arizona.


      Step 4: Verify with zip code patterns

      US zip codes generally increase from east to west in their first digits. The
      "7" prefix of the Texas zip code versus the "8" prefix of the Arizona zip code
      supports that the Texas location is east of the Arizona location.


      YES, 79838, TX is located east of 85621, AZ.'
    29b4a723-dedd-49e8-bcd4-1dabed42f686: '<think>This question is asking about the
      relative locations of two zip codes. Let me break it down:


      1. 79838 is a zip code in TX (Texas)

      2. 85621 is a zip code in AZ (Arizona)


      The question is asking whether the Texas zip code is east of the Arizona zip
      code.


      To answer this, I need to think about the geographic locations of Texas and
      Arizona in the United States:


      - Arizona is in the southwestern part of the United States

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the United States


      Geographically, Texas is located east of Arizona. The entire state of Texas
      is east of the entire state of Arizona.


      Therefore, any zip code in Texas (including 79838) would be east of any zip
      code in Arizona (including 85621).


      So the answer should be YES, 79838, TX is located east of 85621, AZ.</think>To
      determine if 79838, TX is located east of 85621, AZ, I need to consider the
      geographic positions of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these zip codes are located.

      - 79838 is in Texas (TX)

      - 85621 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship.

      - Arizona borders California to its west and New Mexico to its east

      - Texas is located east of New Mexico

      - Therefore, Texas is east of Arizona


      Step 4: Apply this state-level geographic relationship to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 79838 is in Texas and 85621 is in Arizona, and Texas is east of Arizona,
      it follows that 79838, TX is east of 85621, AZ


      YES'

      zip code 79838, TX is located east of the zip code 85621, AZ.


      To solve this, I need to determine the relative positions of Texas (TX) and
      Arizona (AZ) on a US map.


      Looking at a US map:

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States


      Specifically, Arizona is west of Texas. The entire state of Texas is east of
      the entire state of Arizona.


      Since 79838 is in Texas and 85621 is in Arizona, and Texas is east of Arizona,
      it follows that 79838, TX is located east of 85621, AZ.</think>I''ll solve this
      step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 79838 is in Texas (TX)

      - 85621 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographical positions of these states.

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - On a map of the United States, Arizona is positioned to the west of Texas

      - The entire state of Texas lies east of Arizona


      Step 4: Make the conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      - Since 79838 is in Texas, and 85621 is in Arizona, and Texas is east of Arizona,
      it follows that 79838, TX must be east of 85621, AZ


      YES'

      east of 85621, AZ, I need to think about the relative locations of these zip
      codes.


      Let me first think about the states:

      - TX is Texas, which is located in the south-central part of the United States

      - AZ is Arizona, which is located in the southwestern part of the United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, Texas is generally east of Arizona. The entire
      state of Arizona is west of Texas.


      Now, let''s consider the specific zip codes:

      - 79838 is in Texas

      - 85621 is in Arizona


      Since Texas is east of Arizona, and these zip codes are in their respective
      states, it''s reasonable to conclude that 79838, TX is located east of 85621,
      AZ.


      However, I should be careful because some states have unusual shapes, and border
      areas could potentially break this pattern. But given that Arizona and Texas
      don''t share a border (New Mexico is between them), and Arizona is entirely
      west of Texas, the conclusion should hold.</think>I need to determine the relative
      east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 79838 is in Texas (TX)

      - 85621 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Arizona is entirely west of Texas (with New Mexico in between)


      Step 3: Analyze the specific zip codes.

      - Since these zip codes are in their respective states, they follow the same
      east-west relationship as their states

      - All locations in Texas are east of all locations in Arizona


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      - Since 79838 is in Texas, and 85621 is in Arizona, and Texas is east of Arizona,
      the zip code 79838 must be east of 85621


      YES'
    646a2e59-2d37-479f-b7bb-ca624f7571ff: '<think>I need to determine if the location
      with zip code 79838 in Texas is east of the location with zip code 85621 in
      Arizona.


      In the US, zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to
      be in the eastern part of the country, and higher numbers tend to be in the
      western part. The first digit of the zip code generally divides the country
      into regions from east (1) to west (9).


      Looking at these two zip codes:

      - 79838 (TX): This starts with 7, which typically covers Texas and parts of
      neighboring states

      - 85621 (AZ): This starts with 8, which typically covers Arizona and other western
      states


      Based on the first digits, 7 (Texas) would generally be east of 8 (Arizona),
      since the numbering increases as you go west.


      Also, I know from general US geography that Texas is indeed east of Arizona
      - Texas borders New Mexico, which borders Arizona. So Texas is one state east
      of Arizona.</think>To determine if 79838, TX is east of 85621, AZ, I need to
      consider the geographical positions of these locations.


      Step 1: Let me recall the relative positions of Texas and Arizona. Texas is
      located in the south-central part of the United States, while Arizona is in
      the southwestern part of the country.


      Step 2: In terms of east-west positioning, Arizona lies to the west of New Mexico,
      and Texas lies to the east of New Mexico. This means that Texas is east of Arizona.


      Step 3: While specific zip codes within states could theoretically have unusual
      relative positions, in this case we''re comparing zip codes in two different
      states whose entire territories maintain this east-west relationship.


      Step 4: Therefore, any location in Texas (including 79838) would be east of
      any location in Arizona (including 85621).

      85621 starts with 8, which typically covers parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado,
      Wyoming, etc.


      Based on the first digit alone, 7 is east of 8, suggesting that 79838, TX might
      be east of 85621, AZ.


      But let''s be more precise. Texas is generally east of Arizona. Arizona borders
      California on the west and New Mexico on the east. Texas is east of New Mexico.
      So geographically, Texas is east of Arizona.


      So, 79838, TX is indeed east of 85621, AZ.</think>I need to determine the relative
      geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 79838 is in Texas (TX)

      - 85621 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, bordering California
      to the west and New Mexico to the east.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States, east of New Mexico.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      - Since Texas is east of New Mexico, and New Mexico is east of Arizona, we can
      conclude that Texas is east of Arizona.

      - Therefore, any location in Texas (including zip code 79838) would be east
      of any location in Arizona (including zip code 85621).

      - New Mexico

      - Texas

      - Louisiana

      - Mississippi

      - Alabama

      3) There are actually no states between Arizona and Texas (they share a border
      with New Mexico in between).


      4) Since TX is east of AZ geographically, zip codes in Texas will generally
      be east of zip codes in Arizona.


      5) Therefore, zip code 79838 in Texas would be located east of zip code 85621

      east of 97239, OR, I need to:


      1. Identify where these zip codes are located geographically

      2. Determine their east-west relationship


      First, let me think about these states. Washington (WA) is north of Oregon (OR),
      but that doesn''t automatically tell us the east-west relationship.


      For US zip codes:

      - First digit: Generally corresponds to a geographic region

      - 9xxxx typically refers to the west coast (WA, OR, CA, etc.)

      - 9xxxx vs 9xxxx doesn''t immediately tell us the east-west relationship


      Looking at the specific numbers:

      - 99324 is in Washington state

      - 97239 is in Oregon state


      Generally, in the US postal code system, as the first three digits increase
      within a first-digit region, you generally move from east to west. So:

      - 993xx would typically be east of 972xx within the same general region


      Washington state is mostly north of Oregon, but parts of eastern Washington
      are northeast of Oregon. Given that 99xxx is likely in eastern Washington (higher
      numbers within the 9xxxx region), and 972xx would be in western/central Oregon,
      99324 is likely east of 97239.</think>I need to determine the east-west relationship

      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 99324 is in Washington state (WA)

      - 97239 is in Oregon state (OR)


      Step 2: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      In the US zip code system, the first three digits generally indicate geographic
      regions. Within the Pacific Northwest (9xxxx codes):

      - Higher numbers in the 9xxxx range typically indicate more eastern locations

      - 993xx (eastern Washington) would be east of 972xx (western/central Oregon)


      Step 3: Verify the specific locations.

      - 99324 corresponds to Waitsburg, WA, which is in the southeastern part of Washington

      - 97239 corresponds to Portland, OR, which is in the northwestern part of Oregon


      Step 4: Compare the locations.

      Waitsburg, WA (99324) is indeed located east of Portland, OR (97239). If you
      look at a map, eastern Washington is east of western Oregon.

    c3eed50b-7ab1-4af6-995d-d60e1ce61a7b: '<think>Let''s break this down step by step:


      1. We have two US zip codes: 99324 in Washington (WA) state and 97239 in Oregon
      (OR) state.

      2. The question asks whether 99324, WA is located east of 97239, OR.


      To answer this, I need to determine the geographical locations of these zip
      codes.


      Washington state is generally north of Oregon. However, the eastern part of
      Washington borders the eastern part of Oregon, so we need to check the specific
      locations.


      Zip code 99324 in WA would be in eastern Washington, as Washington zip codes
      generally increase from west to east, with 98xxx in western Washington and 99xxx
      in eastern Washington.


      Zip code 97239 in OR would be in western Oregon, as Oregon zip codes generally
      increase from west to east, with 97xxx in western Oregon and higher numbers
      in eastern Oregon.


      Given that 99324 is in eastern Washington and 97239 is in western Oregon, it''s
      very likely that 99324, WA is located east of 97239, OR.


      To be more precise:

      - 99324 is in eastern Washington, likely in the southeastern part of the state

      - 97239 is in western Oregon, likely in the Portland area


      Since western Oregon is west of eastern Washington, 99324, WA is east of 97239,
      OR.</think>I need to determine the relative locations of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the general location patterns of zip codes in WA and OR.

      - Washington zip codes typically start with 98xxx in the west and 99xxx in the
      east

      - Oregon zip codes typically start with 97xxx in the west and increase eastward


      Step 2: Analyze the specific zip codes.

      - 99324 is in Washington with a 993xx prefix, indicating it''s in eastern Washington

      - 97239 is in Oregon with a 972xx prefix, indicating it''s in western Oregon
      (likely Portland area)


      Step 3: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Washington is north of Oregon

      - Eastern Washington borders eastern Oregon

      - Western Oregon (especially the Portland area) is far west of eastern Washington


      Step 4: Determine relative east-west positioning.

      - Since 99324 is in eastern Washington and 97239 is in western Oregon, the Washington
      zip code must be east of the Oregon zip code


      YES'

      What I know for sure is:

      1. 05602 is a zip code in Vermont (VT)

      2. 48624 is a zip code in Michigan (MI)


      In terms of geography:

      - Vermont is located in the northeastern United States, specifically in New
      England

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Looking at their positions on a map, Vermont is definitely located east of Michigan.
      Vermont borders New Hampshire and New York, while Michigan is much further west,

      - 05602 is in Vermont (VT)

      - 48624 is in Michigan (MI)


      ## Step 2: Recall the geographical positions of these states

      - Vermont is located in the northeastern United States (New England region)

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      ## Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      Vermont is positioned along the eastern seaboard of the United States, while
      Michigan is further inland and westward. On a map of the United States, Vermont
      is clearly east of Michigan.


      ## Conclusion

      YES, 05602, VT is located east of 48624, MI.'

      To answer this, I need to understand the geographic locations of these zip codes:


      1. 05602 is in Vermont (VT), which is a state in the northeastern United States.

      2. 48624 is in Michigan (MI), which is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region.


      Geographically speaking, the United States is arranged such that states on the
      east coast (like Vermont) are east of midwestern states (like Michigan). Vermont
      is definitely east of Michigan on a map of the United States.

      To solve this, I need to know the relative positions of Vermont and Michigan
      within the United States.


      The United States is organized roughly with:

      - Eastern states along the Atlantic Ocean

      - Western states along the Pacific Ocean

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region

      - Vermont is in the Northeast region


      Vermont (VT) is one of the New England states in the northeastern corner of
      the United States, bordering Canada and New York, with the Atlantic Ocean not
      far to the east.


      Michigan (MI) is in the Great Lakes region of the Midwest, significantly west
      of Vermont.


      Since the continental United States generally follows a west-to-east orientation
      from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and Vermont is in the Northeast while Michigan
      is in the Midwest, Vermont would be east of Michigan.


      Therefore, a zip code in Vermont (05602) would be east of a zip code in Michigan
      (48624).</think># Is 05602, VT located east of 48624, MI?


      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) 05602 is a ZIP code in Vermont (VT)

      2) 48624 is a ZIP code in Michigan (MI)

      3) To determine which is farther east, I need to consider the geographic positions
      of these states

      4) Vermont is located in the northeastern United States, bordering New Hampshire
      and New York

      5) Michigan is located in the Great Lakes region of the Midwest

      6) On a map of the United States, Vermont is positioned significantly east of
      Michigan

      7) All Vermont ZIP codes are east of all Michigan ZIP codes due to their respective
      state locations


      Therefore, 05602, VT is indeed located east of 48624, MI.

      have lower zip codes, and zip codes increase as you move west. However, this
      isn''t a perfect rule for determining relative positions, so I need to think
      about the actual geographical positions of Vermont and Michigan.


      3. Vermont (VT) is a state located in the northeastern United States, specifically

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Vermont is located in the northeastern part of the United States (New England
      region).

      Michigan is located in the Great Lakes region of the Midwest.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Vermont is clearly positioned to the
      east of Michigan. The entire state of Vermont lies east of the entire state
      of Michigan.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      Since Vermont is entirely east of Michigan, any zip code in Vermont (including

      - TN (Tennessee) is an inland state, west of NC


      Generally speaking, locations in NC would be east of locations in TN because
      NC is east of TN on the US map. However, I should verify this for the specific
      zip codes.


      Zip code 27705 is in NC, likely in the central or eastern part of North Carolina.

      Zip code 37341 is in TN, likely in the eastern part of Tennessee since the first
      digit "3" typically refers to southeastern states.


      Even if 27705 is in western NC and 37341 is in eastern TN, NC''s western border
      is still east of TN''s eastern border because NC is entirely east of TN.


      Therefore, 27705, NC is east of 37341, TN.</think># Is 27705, NC located east
      of 37341, TN?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes by considering
      their states'' geographic locations.


      ## Step-by-Step Analysis:

      1. Zip code 27705 is in North Carolina (NC)

      2. Zip code 37341 is in Tennessee (TN)

      3. Looking at a map of the United States, North Carolina is located on the Atlantic
      coast

      4. Tennessee is an inland state that borders North Carolina on its western side

      5. This means Tennessee is positioned to the west of North Carolina

      6. Therefore, any location in North Carolina (including 27705) would be east
      of any location in Tennessee (including 37341)


      ## Conclusion:

      YES, 27705, NC is located east of 37341, TN.'

      to determine if the US zip code 27705 in North Carolina (NC) is located east
      of the US zip code 37341 in Tennessee (TN).


      In the United States, generally:

      - States further east have lower numbers in their first digit of zip codes

      - States further west have higher numbers in their first digit of zip codes


      Let''s look at the first digits:

      - 27705 (NC) starts with 2

      - 37341 (TN) starts with 3


      Based on the first digit, 27705 (NC) with a "2" would be further east than 37341
      (TN) with a "3".


      Additionally, geographically, North Carolina is located to the east of Tennessee
      on the US map. North Carolina is on the Atlantic coast, while Tennessee is an

      In the US, states are organized geographically, and Utah is generally east of
      California. California is on the west coast of the United States, while Utah
      is an interior western state that borders California''s eastern neighbor, Nevada.


      Let''s verify this by considering the general geographic positions:

      - California (CA) is on the Pacific coast, the westernmost part of the continental
      US

      - Utah (UT) is located to the east of Nevada, which is east of California

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Utah is an inland state that lies to the east of California (with Nevada in
      between)


      Step 3: Verify if the specific zip codes change this general east-west relationship.

      - All of Utah is east of all of California geographically

      - No matter where in these states the specific zip codes are located, the east-west
      relationship remains the same


      Step 4: Conclude based on the geographic facts.

      - Illinois (IL) is generally east of Iowa (IA). The Mississippi River forms
      the border between these two states, with Iowa on the west side and Illinois
      on the east side.

      - So in general, locations in Illinois tend to be east of locations in Iowa.


      Now, let''s think about the specific zip codes:

      - 60137 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 50703 is in Iowa (IA)


      Since Illinois is east of Iowa, and these zip codes are in their respective
      states, it''s most likely that 60137, IL is indeed east of 50703, IA.


      To be even more specific:

      - 60137 appears to be in the northeastern part of Illinois (based on the zip
      code numbering)

      - 50703 appears to be in Iowa


      So the answer is most likely YES.</think>I''ll work through this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the states these zip codes are in.

      - 60137 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 50703 is in Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Iowa and Illinois share a border along the Mississippi River

      - Iowa is located west of Illinois

      - The Mississippi River forms the natural boundary between these states, with
      Iowa on the west side and Illinois on the east side


      Step 3: Apply this state-level geography to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 60137 is in Illinois and 50703 is in Iowa

      - And Illinois is east of Iowa

      - Therefore, 60137, IL must be east of 50703, IA


      YES'

      locations of two zip codes - 60137 in Illinois (IL) and 50703 in Iowa (IA).


      First, let me recall the general geography of these states:

      - Illinois (IL) is located east of Iowa (IA). Illinois borders Iowa on Iowa''s
      eastern side.

      - This means that generally, locations in Illinois are east of locations in
      Iowa.


      Now for the specific zip codes:

      - 60137 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 50703 is in Iowa (IA)


      Since Illinois is east of Iowa, and 60137 is in Illinois while 50703 is in Iowa,

      - Iowa is located directly west of Illinois

      - Illinois shares Iowa''s eastern border


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the zip codes.

      - Since 60137 is in Illinois, and 50703 is in Iowa

      - And Illinois is east of Iowa

      - Therefore, any location in Illinois (including 60137) would be east of any

      to determine the geographical locations of these two zip codes and then figure
      out if one is east of the other.


      60137, IL is a zip code in Illinois.

      50703, IA is a zip code in Iowa.


      Geographically, Illinois is located east of Iowa in the United States. The Mississippi
      River forms much of the border between these two states, with Iowa on the west
      side of the river and Illinois on the east side.


      Since 60137 is in Illinois (IL) and 50703 is in Iowa (IA), and Illinois is east
      of Iowa, then 60137 should be east of 50703.


      To be extra careful, I should check if these are valid zip codes and confirm
      their locations:


      60137 appears to be a zip code for Glen Ellyn, Illinois, which is in the Chicago
      metropolitan area in the northeastern part of Illinois.


      50703 appears to be a zip code for Waterloo, Iowa, which is in the northeastern
      part of Iowa.


      Given that Illinois is east of Iowa, and these specific locations follow that
      general geographical relationship, I can conclude that 60137, IL (Glen Ellyn,
      Illinois) is indeed east of 50703, IA (Waterloo, Iowa).</think>I''ll work through
      this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 60137 is a zip code in Glen Ellyn, Illinois (IL)

      - 50703 is a zip code in Waterloo, Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Illinois and Iowa.

      - Iowa and Illinois are neighboring states

      - The Mississippi River forms much of the border between them

      - Iowa is positioned to the west of Illinois on a US map


      Step 3: Check the specific locations within their states.

      - Glen Ellyn, IL is in the northeastern part of Illinois (Chicago suburban area)

      - Waterloo, IA is in northeastern Iowa

      - Even though both are in the northeastern parts of their respective states,
      the states'' positions relative to each other determine their east-west relationship


      Step 4: Make the determination based on state positions.

      - Since Illinois is east of Iowa, locations in Illinois (including 60137) are
      east of locations in Iowa (including 50703)

      - 32579 is in Florida (FL)

      - 77362 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: General geographic knowledge about states

      Florida is located in the southeastern United States, on the Gulf of Mexico
      and the Atlantic Ocean.

      Texas is located in the south-central United States, also bordering the Gulf
      of Mexico.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Florida is generally east of Texas. The entire
      state of Florida is east of the entire state of Texas.


      So any location in Florida would be east of any location in Texas. Therefore,
      32579, FL would be east of 77362, TX.</think>I''ll solve this step-by-step:

      Step 2: Determine the relative east-west positioning of these states.

      Florida is located in the southeastern United States, while Texas is in the
      south-central United States. Looking at a map of the US, the entire state of
      Florida lies to the east of Texas.


      Step 3: Consider if there could be any exceptions.

      Since Florida is completely east of Texas geographically, any location in Florida

      2. Determine the approximate geographic location of 77362, TX

      3. Compare the relative east-west positions of these locations


      Step 1: Let''s think about 32579, FL.

      Florida is on the east coast of the United States, specifically in the southeastern
      part of the country. The zip code 32579 is likely in the Florida panhandle (the
      northwestern part of Florida) based on the numbering.


      Step 2: Let''s think about 77362, TX.

      Texas is in the south-central part of the United States, west of Florida. The
      zip code 77362 is somewhere in Texas.


      Step 3: Compare locations.

      In general, all of Florida is east of all of Texas. This is because the United
      States has Florida on the east side and Texas more centrally located and to
      the west of Florida.


      So even if 32579 is in the western part of Florida (the panhandle) and 77362
      is in the eastern part of Texas, Florida would still be east of Texas.</think>#

      Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, I need to understand the geographic positions of these zip codes.


      2) Zip code 32579 is in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United States.
      Florida zip codes generally begin with 32-34, with 32xxx codes typically in
      the northern/panhandle region.


      3) Zip code 77362 is in Texas (TX), which is in the south-central United States.
      Texas zip codes beginning with 77xxx are typically in the eastern part of Texas.

      To figure this out, I need to:

      1. Identify the approximate locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their relative east-west positions (longitude)


      Generally speaking, Florida is east of Texas, but I should verify the specific
      zip codes.


      For context:

      - Florida is on the southeastern coast of the United States

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the United States

      - Areas with lower longitudes (more negative numbers in the Western Hemisphere)
      are further west


      Since Florida is generally east of Texas, and these zip codes appear to be in
      their respective states (32579, FL and 77362, TX), it''s very likely that 32579,
      FL is east of 77362, TX.


      Florida''s western border with Alabama is still significantly east of most of

      Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, I need to understand the general geographic relationship between Florida
      (FL) and Texas (TX).


      2) Florida is located in the southeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean on its east coast and the Gulf of Mexico on its west coast.


      3) Texas is located in the south-central United States, west of Florida.


      4) All of Florida, including its westernmost panhandle region, is east of Texas.

      - 32579 is in Florida (FL)

      - 77362 is in Texas (TX)


      In general, Florida is located east of Texas in the United States. Florida is
      on the southeastern coast of the US, while Texas is in the south-central part

      To be more precise about these specific zip codes:

      - Florida zip codes generally start with 32-34

      - Texas zip codes generally start with 75-79


      The specific zip code 32579 appears to be in the Florida panhandle region, which
      is the northwestern part of Florida.

      The specific zip code 77362 appears to be in eastern Texas.


      Even though 32579 is in the western part of Florida (the panhandle), Florida
      as a whole is still east of Texas. The easternmost part of Texas is still west
      of the westernmost part of Florida.

      Texas. Florida is located in the southeastern United States, while Texas is
      in the south-central region.


      2) On a west-to-east basis, the entire state of Florida lies east of Texas.
      Even the Florida panhandle (the westernmost part of Florida) is still east of
      the easternmost part of Texas.


      3) The zip code 32579 is located in the Florida panhandle region (likely in

      if one US zip code (85132, AZ) is located east of another zip code (90021, CA).


      Let me approach this geographically:


      1. 85132 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ)

      2. 90021 is a zip code in California (CA)


      Geographically, Arizona is located east of California. The US states from west
      to east on the Pacific coast are: California, then Arizona, then New Mexico,
      etc.


      California is on the Pacific coast, while Arizona is inland to the east of California.
      So generally speaking, locations in Arizona are east of locations in California.


      Therefore, 85132, AZ would be east of 90021, CA.</think>To determine if 85132,
      AZ is east of 90021, CA, I need to think about the geographic positions of these
      zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 85132 is in Arizona (AZ)

      - 90021 is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona borders California to the east


      Step 3: Check if there are any exceptions to consider.

      - While specific zip codes within states could sometimes create unusual patterns,
      the states themselves have a clear east-west relationship

      - Arizona is entirely east of California on the map

      - All Arizona zip codes are east of California


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on the geographic positions.

      Since Arizona is east of California, and 85132 is in Arizona while 90021 is
      in California, 85132 is east of 90021.

      2) To determine which is further east, I need to consider the geographic relationship
      between these states and possibly the specific locations within these states.


      3) Generally, Arizona is located east of California. California is on the west
      coast of the United States, while Arizona is inland and to the east of California.


      4) The zip code system in the US broadly (though not perfectly) follows a west-to-east
      pattern, with lower numbers in the northeast and higher numbers in the west.
      However, this pattern isn''t perfectly consistent across all regions.


      5) The zip codes 85132 (AZ) and 90021 (CA) follow this general pattern - California
      zip codes often start with 9, while Arizona often starts with 8, which generally
      supports that Arizona is east of California.


      6) Since Arizona as a state is east of California, and these zip codes are in

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona borders California to the east


      Step 3: Verify the specific zip code locations

      - While zip codes don''t perfectly align with longitude, the general state relationship
      holds true for these specific zip codes

      - 85132 is in Arizona, which means it must be east of any location in California

      - 90021 is in Los Angeles, California, which is west of all of Arizona

      the relative geographical positions of two US zip codes.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 85132 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ)

      - 90021 is a zip code in California (CA)


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to consider their relative
      positions on a map. In the US, longitude coordinates determine east-west positioning,
      with more easterly locations having higher longitude values.


      Generally speaking, Arizona is located east of California in the United States.
      Arizona borders California on California''s eastern border.


      Since 85132 is in Arizona and 90021 is in California, it''s highly likely that
      85132 is east of 90021. But let me think about potential exceptions:


      The western part of Arizona could potentially be at a similar longitude to the
      eastern part of California. However, 85132 is likely not in the extreme western
      part of Arizona, and 90021 (being in Los Angeles) is not in the eastern part
      of California.


      So based on the general geography of the US states, 85132, AZ should be east
      of 90021, CA.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 85132 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ)

      - 90021 is a zip code in California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between these states.

      Arizona is located directly east of California on the US map. The entire state
      of Arizona is east of California.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      90021 is in Los Angeles, which is in southern California.

      85132 is in Florence, Arizona, which is in central Arizona.


      Step 4: Apply geographical knowledge.

      Since Arizona is entirely east of California, any location in Arizona (including
      85132) must be east of any location in California (including 90021).

      east of 90021, CA, I need to find their relative positions.


      US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the eastern
      parts of the US and higher numbers are in the western parts. So just from the
      zip codes alone (85132 vs 90021), 85132 would likely be east of 90021 since
      it has a lower number.


      But let me think more carefully about this. The first digit of zip codes divides
      the US into regions:

      - 0-1: Northeast

      - 2-3: Mid-Atlantic and Southeast

      - 4-5: Midwest/Great Lakes

      - 6-7: Central/South

      - 8: Mountain States

      - 9: West Coast and Pacific


      So 85132 (starting with 8) is in the Mountain States region, which includes
      Arizona.

      90021 (starting with 9) is in the West Coast region, which includes California.


      The Mountain States region is east of the West Coast region.


      So 85132, AZ is east of 90021, CA.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 85132 is in Arizona (AZ)

      - 90021 is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Arizona is located directly east of California in the United States.

      - California borders the Pacific Ocean on the west, while Arizona is inland.


      Step 3: Verify with zip code patterns.

      - US zip codes follow a general west-to-east pattern, with lower numbers typically
      being further east.

      - Zip codes starting with "8" (like 85132) are in the Mountain time zone region.

      - Zip codes starting with "9" (like 90021) are in the Pacific time zone region.

      - The Mountain time zone is east of the Pacific time zone.

      two zip codes.


      First, let me identify the states:

      - 51250 is in Iowa (IA)

      - 82609 is in Wyoming (WY)


      In the United States, the general pattern is that states in the eastern part
      of the country have lower zip code first digits, and western states have higher
      first digits.


      Iowa is in the Midwest region of the United States, while Wyoming is in the
      Mountain West region. Geographically, Iowa is east of Wyoming.


      To be more precise:

      - Zip codes starting with 5 are generally in the central Midwest region

      - Zip codes starting with 8 are generally in the Mountain West region


      Since Iowa (51250) is east of Wyoming (82609), and this aligns with the zip
      code numbering pattern where lower numbers are generally more eastern, I can
      conclude that 51250, IA is east of 82609, WY.</think>I''ll solve this step by

      Step 1: Identify the states in question.

      - 51250 is in Iowa (IA)

      - 82609 is in Wyoming (WY)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Wyoming is
      located in the Mountain West region.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      Looking at a US map, Iowa is significantly east of Wyoming. Iowa borders the
      Mississippi River on its eastern edge, while Wyoming is several states to the
      west.


      Step 4: Confirm with zip code patterns.

      US zip codes generally follow a pattern where eastern regions have lower first
      digits and western regions have higher first digits. The "5" prefix of the Iowa
      zip code versus the "8" prefix of the Wyoming zip code supports this eastern
      positioning.

      Let me think about US geography:

      - IA refers to Iowa, which is a state in the Midwest region of the United States

      - WY refers to Wyoming, which is a state in the Western United States


      In terms of geographic position, Iowa is located east of Wyoming. The continental
      United States generally follows a pattern where lower numbers in the first digit
      of zip codes correspond to eastern states, while higher numbers correspond to
      western states.


      51250 starts with 5, which corresponds to the Midwest region including Iowa.

      82609 starts with 8, which corresponds to the western states including Wyoming.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Wyoming is
      in the Western United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Iowa is positioned significantly east
      of Wyoming. The entire state of Iowa is east of the entire state of Wyoming,
      with several states potentially between them (like Nebraska).


      Step 4: Verify with zip code patterns.

      US zip codes are somewhat organized geographically, with lower first digits

      First, let me recall the geography of the United States. The US states are arranged
      such that coastal states on the Atlantic Ocean are in the east, and as you move
      westward, you reach the interior states and eventually the Pacific coastal states.


      New Jersey (NJ) is located on the Atlantic coast of the United States, in the

      In terms of cardinal directions, states on the Atlantic coast like New Jersey
      are east of Midwestern states like Indiana.


      So geographically speaking, New Jersey is east of Indiana.


      Now, the specific zip codes won''t change this relationship. ZIP code 08221

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States, away from the
      coast


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      - The United States is arranged such that states along the Atlantic Ocean (like
      New Jersey) are in the east

      - Midwestern states like Indiana are located west of the Atlantic coastal states

      - Therefore, New Jersey is east of Indiana


      Step 4: Confirm zip code locations

      east of 46222, IN, I need to find the relative geographical positions of these
      two zip codes.


      First, I know that:

      - 08221 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 46222 is a zip code in Indiana (IN)


      In the United States, states on the east coast are generally east of states
      in the Midwest. New Jersey is on the east coast, while Indiana is in the Midwest.


      The specific zip code 08221 is in New Jersey, which is on the Atlantic coast
      of the United States. New Jersey is one of the easternmost states in the country.


      The specific zip code 46222 is in Indiana, which is in the Midwest region of
      the United States, significantly west of New Jersey.


      Based on the general geography of the United States, New Jersey is east of Indiana.
      Therefore, a zip code in New Jersey would be east of a zip code in Indiana.</think>I
      need to determine the relative geographical positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 08221 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 46222 is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast in the eastern United States, while
      Indiana is located in the Midwest region.


      Step 3: Determine the relative east-west positioning.

      The United States generally follows a pattern where lower first digits in zip
      codes correspond to eastern states, while higher first digits correspond to
      western states. New Jersey zip codes typically start with 0, while Indiana zip
      codes start with 4, which supports the general understanding that NJ is east
      of IN.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      New Jersey is definitely east of Indiana on the map of the United States. Therefore,
      zip code 08221 in NJ is east of zip code 46222 in IN.

      I know that:

      - 72114 is in Arkansas (AR)

      - 73025 is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Generally speaking, Arkansas is located east of Oklahoma in the United States.
      The states border each other, with Oklahoma to the west of Arkansas.


      ZIP code 72114 is in Arkansas, which means it''s likely in the eastern state
      of the two.

      ZIP code 73025 is in Oklahoma, which means it''s likely in the western state

      Step 3: Consider if there could be exceptions based on irregular state borders.

      While state borders can be irregular, the AR-OK border is relatively straight
      and follows a north-south line. There are no major instances where Oklahoma
      extends east of Arkansas.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion about the zip codes based on their states.

      First, let''s consider the basic geography: Arkansas is located to the east
      of Oklahoma. The two states share a border, with Oklahoma on the west and Arkansas
      on the east.


      Now, let''s think about the zip codes:

      - 72114 is in Arkansas (AR)

      - 73025 is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Since Arkansas is east of Oklahoma, and these zip codes are in their respective
      states, it''s likely that 72114, AR is east of 73025, OK.

      Now, let''s look at the specific zip codes:

      - 72114 is in Arkansas (AR)

      - 73025 is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Since Arkansas is east of Oklahoma, and these zip codes are in their respective

      However, I should be careful because zip codes near state borders could have
      positions that don''t match the general state positioning. But the numbers here
      (72xxx vs 73xxx) suggest these aren''t border cases, as zip codes are generally

      solve this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the states: 18037 is in Pennsylvania (PA) and 44116
      is in Ohio (OH).


      2) Looking at the geographic relationship between these states: Pennsylvania
      is located directly east of Ohio on the US map. The two states share a border
      with Ohio to the west and Pennsylvania to the east.


      3) Since zip codes within each state follow the general geographic location
      of their states, a zip code in Pennsylvania would be east of a zip code in Ohio.


      4) Therefore, 18037, PA is located east of 44116, OH.

      of 44116, OH, I need to know the geographical locations of these zip codes.


      First, let''s identify these locations:

      - 18037 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 44116 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      In the United States, Pennsylvania is located east of Ohio. PA borders OH on
      OH''s eastern border. So in general, locations in PA are east of locations in
      OH.


      Since 18037 is in PA and 44116 is in OH, we can generally say that 18037, PA
      is east of 44116, OH.


      Let me double-check this reasoning. The question is asking about specific zip
      codes, not just the states. However, since Pennsylvania is directly east of
      Ohio (they share a border with PA on OH''s east), any location in PA would be
      east of any location in OH.


      So yes, 18037, PA is located east of 44116, OH.</think>I need to determine the
      relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 18037 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 44116 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Pennsylvania is located directly east of Ohio. These two states share a border,
      with Pennsylvania on Ohio''s eastern side.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the zip codes.

      Since 18037 is in Pennsylvania and 44116 is in Ohio, and Pennsylvania is east
      of Ohio, it follows that 18037, PA must be east of 44116, OH.


      YES'

      3) 44116 is in Ohio (OH)

      4) Pennsylvania is located east of Ohio in the United States

      5) So generally, locations in PA are east of locations in OH


      However, I should double-check this specific case. Since zip codes don''t perfectly
      align with east-west geography (they can zigzag), I need to be careful.


      Pennsylvania is definitely east of Ohio on the US map. PA borders OH on OH''s
      eastern side. All of PA is east of OH, so any location in PA would be east of
      any location in OH.


      So a zip code in PA (18037) would be east of a zip code in OH (44116).</think>I
      need to determine the relative geographical positions of these two zip codes.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Pennsylvania is located directly east of Ohio. The entire state of Pennsylvania
      is east of Ohio, as they share a border with Ohio to the west of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions of the zip codes.

      Since 18037 is in Pennsylvania and 44116 is in Ohio, and Pennsylvania is entirely
      east of Ohio, it follows that any location in Pennsylvania (including 18037)
      must be east of any location in Ohio (including 44116).


      YES, 18037, PA is located east of 44116, OH.'

      Zip code 18037 is in Pennsylvania (PA).

      Zip code 44116 is in Ohio (OH).


      First, I need to consider the general geographic positions of Pennsylvania and
      Ohio. Pennsylvania is east of Ohio. Pennsylvania borders Ohio on Ohio''s eastern
      side.


      Since 18037 is in Pennsylvania and 44116 is in Ohio, generally speaking, a location
      in Pennsylvania would be east of a location in Ohio.


      However, I should be careful because ZIP codes near state borders could be exceptions
      to this general rule. Let me consider if these specific ZIP codes might be in
      unusual locations that would change the answer.


      18037 appears to be a ZIP code in eastern Pennsylvania, while 44116 appears
      to be in northeastern Ohio. Given the shapes of these states, even locations

      PA located east of 44116, OH?


      To determine this, I need to analyze the geographic positions of these zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states

      Pennsylvania (PA) and Ohio (OH) are neighboring states, with Pennsylvania located
      directly east of Ohio.


      ## Step 2: Examine the zip code patterns

      - Zip codes in the 180xx range are in eastern Pennsylvania

      - Zip codes in the 441xx range are in northeastern Ohio


      ## Step 3: Analyze relative positions

      Even though these zip codes might not be at the exact centers of their respective
      states, the overall geographic arrangement of these states means that any location
      in Pennsylvania would be east of any location in Ohio, as Pennsylvania borders
      Ohio''s eastern side.

      In the United States, states that are on the east coast or closer to the east
      coast are generally east of states that are more inland or toward the west.


      New York (NY) is located on the east coast of the United States, while Michigan
      (MI) is located in the Midwest region. Geographically, New York is east of Michigan.


      The specific zip codes (12196 for NY and 48069 for MI) don''t change this geographical

      2) New York state is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while
      Michigan is in the Midwest region.


      3) When comparing states, New York is positioned east of Michigan on the map.


      4) ZIP code 12196 is in New York state, which would place it in the eastern

      What I know for certain:

      - New York (NY) is on the east coast of the United States

      - Michigan (MI) is in the Midwest region


      Geographically, New York state is located east of Michigan state. On a map of

      To determine which is east of the other, I need to consider their geographic
      positions. In the United States:

      - North Carolina is on the east coast

      - Mississippi is in the southeastern region, but west of North Carolina


      Generally speaking, North Carolina is east of Mississippi on a map of the United
      States. The eastern states like North Carolina are closer to the Atlantic Ocean,
      while Mississippi is closer to the central part of the country, bordering the
      Mississippi River.


      So based on the states these zip codes are in, 27604 in NC would be east of
      38611 in MS.</think>To determine if 27604, NC is east of 38611, MS, I need to

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 27604 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 38611 is in Mississippi (MS)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - North Carolina is located on the Atlantic coast in the eastern United States

      - Mississippi is located in the south-central United States, bordering the Mississippi
      River


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Mississippi is west of North Carolina

      - North Carolina is east of Mississippi


      Step 4: Since the zip codes are in these respective states, 27604 (NC) must
      be east of 38611 (MS).

      relative east-west positioning of two US zip codes:

      1. 27604 in North Carolina (NC)

      2. 38611 in Mississippi (MS)


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to compare their longitudes.
      In the US, lower longitude numbers are further east, and higher longitude numbers
      are further west.


      North Carolina (NC) is on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while Mississippi
      (MS) is further inland, closer to the central part of the country. Generally
      speaking, NC is east of MS.


      But to be more precise about these specific zip codes:

      - 27604 is a zip code in Raleigh, North Carolina

      - 38611 is a zip code in Mississippi


      Based on US geography, North Carolina is definitely east of Mississippi. North
      Carolina borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast, while Mississippi is
      much further west, bordering the Mississippi River.


      So yes, 27604, NC would be located east of 38611, MS.</think>I need to determine

      Step 1: Let me consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      North Carolina (NC) is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States,
      bordering the Atlantic Ocean.

      Mississippi (MS) is located in the southern United States, much further inland
      and west of North Carolina.


      Step 2: Looking at relative positions on a map of the United States:

      - North Carolina is positioned on the East Coast

      - Mississippi is positioned near the Mississippi River, significantly west of
      North Carolina


      Step 3: All zip codes in North Carolina (including 27604, which is in the Raleigh
      area) are east of all zip codes in Mississippi (including 38611).


      YES, 27604, NC is located east of 38611, MS.'

      - North Carolina is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Mississippi is located in the Deep South, much further west than North Carolina


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      North Carolina sits significantly east of Mississippi on the US map. Mississippi
      borders the Mississippi River in the central part of the country, while North
      Carolina borders the Atlantic Ocean.

      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to think about the general
      locations of these states in the US.


      Connecticut (CT) is one of the states in the northeastern United States, specifically
      in New England.

      Indiana (IN) is a state in the Midwestern United States.


      Looking at the map of the US, states in the East Coast (like Connecticut) are
      east of the Midwestern states (like Indiana). So Connecticut is east of Indiana.


      Since 06770 is in Connecticut and 46617 is in Indiana, it follows that 06770,
      CT is east of 46617, IN.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 06770 is in Connecticut (CT)

      - 46617 is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these states

      - Connecticut is located on the East Coast of the United States, in the New
      England region

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions

      - Connecticut is significantly east of Indiana on the US map

      - All locations in Connecticut will be east of locations in Indiana


      Step 4: Make the conclusion

      - Since 06770 is in Connecticut, and 46617 is in Indiana, the Connecticut zip
      code must be east of the Indiana zip code

      First, I need to identify where each ZIP code is located:

      - 32603, FL is in Florida

      - 77045, TX is in Texas


      Now I need to determine their relative positions east to west. The United States

      Coast is on the Pacific Ocean. Florida is on the East Coast, while Texas is
      more central/southern but definitely west of Florida.


      Generally speaking, Florida is east of Texas. But to be more precise:

      - Texas ZIP codes typically start with 75-79


      The fact that 32603 is in Florida and 77045 is in Texas confirms the general

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States, extending
      to the Gulf of Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Florida is entirely east of Texas on the U.S. map

      - All of Florida is further east than any part of Texas


      Therefore, any location in Florida (including zip code 32603) would be east

      (Florida) is located east of 77045, TX (Texas).


      To answer this, I''ll need to understand the relative geographical positions
      of these two zip codes.


      First, let''s consider the broader geography:

      - Florida is on the southeastern part of the United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the United States, bordering the Gulf
      of Mexico


      In terms of east-west positioning, Florida is generally east of Texas on a map
      of the United States.


      To be more precise about these specific zip codes:

      - 32603 is in Florida (FL)

      - 77045 is in Texas (TX)


      Since Florida is east of Texas, and these zip codes are in their respective
      states, it follows that 32603, FL is east of 77045, TX.</think>To determine
      if 32603, FL is located east of 77045, TX, I need to analyze the geographic
      positions of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 32603 is in Florida (FL)

      - 77045 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning

      - Florida is positioned entirely east of Texas on the US map

      - The entire state of Florida has a more eastern longitude than eastern Texas


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      - Since 32603 is in Florida and 77045 is in Texas, the Florida zip code must
      be east of the Texas zip code


      Therefore, 32603, FL is definitely located east of 77045, TX.

      east of 15062, PA, I need to:


      1. Find the location (coordinates) of 10993, NY

      2. Find the location (coordinates) of 15062, PA

      3. Compare their longitudes - if the NY location has a smaller longitude value,
      it''s east of the PA location (in the US, smaller longitude = further east)


      Let me reason through this:


      - 10993 is a ZIP code in New York state (NY)

      - 15062 is a ZIP code in Pennsylvania state (PA)


      Geographically:

      - New York state is generally east of Pennsylvania

      - New York is on the east coast, while Pennsylvania is more inland


      So based on the general geography of US states, New York is east of Pennsylvania.
      However, I need to be careful because ZIP codes near state borders could potentially
      violate this general rule.


      However, 10993 is likely in the main part of New York, and 15062 is likely in
      the main part of Pennsylvania, not in the elongated northwestern part of PA
      that extends to Lake Erie.

      I need to determine the relative positions of these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states

      New York (NY) is located east of Pennsylvania (PA) on the US map. NY is on the
      East Coast, while PA is more inland.


      ## Step 2: Check specific ZIP code locations

      - 10993 is in New York, likely in the southeastern part of the state

      - 15062 is in Pennsylvania, likely in the western part of the state


      ## Step 3: Consider relative positions

      ZIP codes starting with "109" are typically in the New York City metropolitan
      area in eastern NY, while ZIP codes starting with "150" are typically in western
      Pennsylvania (near Pittsburgh).


      ## Step 4: Compare longitudes

      Given the standard organization of ZIP codes, 10993 (NY) would be significantly
      east of 15062 (PA), as it follows the general east-west relationship between
      these states.

      First, I need to identify the locations:

      - 10993, NY (a zip code in New York state)

      - 15062, PA (a zip code in Pennsylvania state)


      To determine which is further east, I need to compare their relative positions.


      Generally speaking, New York is east of Pennsylvania on a US map. However, since
      we''re dealing with specific zip codes, I should check their exact locations.


      The first digits of US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers
      are in the eastern US and higher numbers are in the western US. Looking at these:

      - 10993 (starts with 1)

      - 15062 (starts with 1)


      Both start with 1, but 10xxx is typically further east than 15xxx.


      New York zip codes that start with 10 are typically in the southeastern part
      of New York state (New York City area and surroundings).


      Pennsylvania zip codes that start with 15 are typically in the western part
      of Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh area).


      Since New York is already east of Pennsylvania, and we''re comparing what appears

      that 10993, NY is east of 15062, PA.</think># Determining if 10993, NY is east
      of 15062, PA


      I''ll solve this step-by-step:


      1) First, I need to understand the general geography of US zip codes. Zip codes
      generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to be in the eastern part
      of the United States, and higher numbers tend to be in the western part.


      2) Looking at the first digits: 10xxx zip codes are in New York state, specifically
      in the southeastern portion (New York City area and surroundings), while 15xxx
      zip codes are in western Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh area).


      3) Geographically, New York state is east of Pennsylvania on the US map.


      4) More specifically, the 10xxx zip code range (southeastern NY) is east of
      the 15xxx zip code range (western PA).


      5) Therefore, 10993 in New York would be east of 15062 in Pennsylvania.

      1. Identify which states SC and AR correspond to

      2. Find the relative positions of these states

      3. Specifically check if SC is east of AR


      SC stands for South Carolina, which is located on the east coast of the United
      States.

      AR stands for Arkansas, which is located more centrally in the southern United
      States.


      In terms of geography, South Carolina is indeed east of Arkansas. The United
      States generally has states arranged where lower numbers in zip codes correspond
      to the eastern part of the country, and higher numbers correspond to the western
      part. The first digit of the zip code often indicates the general region.


      29072 starts with "2", which typically covers eastern states.

      72023 starts with "7", which typically covers central-southern states.

      - South Carolina is located on the east coast of the United States

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - South Carolina is significantly east of Arkansas on the map of the United
      States

      - South Carolina borders the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side

      - Arkansas is several states away from the Atlantic coast, located west of states

    425d6ac8-c2f1-4972-9fb6-f21281f24a1b: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine if zip code 32129 in Florida is located east of zip code 77012
      in Texas.


      First, let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Florida is located in the southeastern part of the United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States

      - Generally, Florida is east of Texas


      Now, I need to consider the specific zip codes:

      - 32129 is in Florida (FL)

      - 77012 is in Texas (TX)


      Since Florida is east of Texas, it''s very likely that any location in Florida
      would be east of any location in Texas. The continental United States is arranged
      such that Texas is west of Florida.


      Therefore, zip code 32129 in Florida should be east of zip code 77012 in Texas.</think>I
      need to determine if 32129, FL is east of 77012, TX by considering their geographic
      locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Florida is located in the southeastern United States, while Texas is in the
      south-central United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west relationship between these states.

      On a map of the United States, Florida is positioned to the east of Texas. The
      entire state of Florida lies east of Texas.


      Step 3: Analyze if specific zip codes could change this relationship.

      Since both zip codes are within their respective states and no part of Florida
      extends west of any part of Texas, the general state relationship applies to
      these specific zip codes.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Since Florida is entirely east of Texas, any location in Florida (including
      32129) must be east of any location in Texas (including 77012).

      To solve this, I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      First, let me consider the general geographic relationship between Mississippi
      and Texas. Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States, while Texas
      is in the south-central part of the US. In general, Mississippi is east of Texas.


      But to be more precise about these specific zip codes:


      39367 is a zip code in Mississippi. Without knowing the exact location, I can
      say it''s somewhere in Mississippi.

      75150 is a zip code in Texas. Without knowing the exact location, I can say
      it''s somewhere in Texas.


      Since Mississippi is entirely east of Texas (the eastern border of Texas doesn''t

      Michigan.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip
      codes based on their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 01430 is in Massachusetts (MA)

      Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these states.

      - Massachusetts is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Massachusetts is positioned significantly east of Michigan on the U.S. map

      - The entire state of Massachusetts lies east of Michigan


      Step 4: Make my conclusion.

      Since the zip code 01430 is in Massachusetts, and the zip code 48085 is in Michigan,
      and Massachusetts is east of Michigan, then 01430, MA must be east of 48085,

      To determine which is east of the other, I need to consider their relative geographic
      positions. The United States generally has lower zip codes in the east and higher
      zip codes in the west, but there are many exceptions to this pattern, so I shouldn''t

      What I do know for certain:

      - Massachusetts (MA) is located on the east coast of the United States

      - Michigan (MI) is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      whether 01430, MA (Massachusetts) is located east of 48085, MI (Michigan).


      To answer this, I need to reason about the relative positions of these locations
      based on their zip codes. Since the question is about east/west positions, I
      need to determine which location is further east.


      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - Massachusetts (MA) is located in the northeastern United States, on the east
      coast

      - Michigan (MI) is located in the midwest/Great Lakes region, which is west
      of the northeastern states


      Given the basic geography of the US, any location in Massachusetts would be
      east of any location in Michigan. This is because Massachusetts is on the Atlantic
      coast, while Michigan is in the interior of the country, near the Great Lakes.


      So a zip code in MA (01430) would be east of a zip code in MI (48085).</think>I
      need to determine if 01430, MA is located east of 48085, MI by comparing their
      geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 01430 is in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 48085 is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Massachusetts is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United
      States

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest region, specifically around the Great Lakes
      area


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on the east-west axis.

      - Massachusetts is positioned along the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Michigan is positioned much further west in the continental United States


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these relative positions.

      Massachusetts is significantly east of Michigan. Therefore, any location in
      Massachusetts (including zip code 01430) would be east of any location in Michigan
      (including zip code 48085).

      The United States is organized such that states in the eastern part of the country
      are generally east of states in the central and western parts. Georgia is located
      in the southeastern United States, while Texas is in the south-central United

      Looking at their relative positions on a map:

      - Georgia is on the Atlantic coast in the southeast

      - Texas is much further west, bordering the Gulf of Mexico but extending far
      inland


      In terms of longitude (east-west position), Georgia is definitely east of Texas.

      States on the eastern seaboard (like Georgia) are east of inland states (like
      Texas).

      The entire state of Georgia is east of the entire state of Texas.


      Step 3: Verify the specific zip codes.

      While specific zip codes within states can have varying positions, no part of
      Georgia extends west of any part of Texas. The easternmost point of Texas is
      still west of the westernmost point of Georgia.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Since 31210 is in Georgia and 76114 is in Texas, and Georgia is entirely east

      step by step.


      1. We have two zip codes: 31210 in Georgia (GA) and 76114 in Texas (TX).

      2. We need to determine if 31210, GA is located east of 76114, TX.


      To determine this, I need to know the general geographic positions of these
      states and then more specifically these zip codes.


      Generally speaking:

      - Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States.

      - Texas (TX) is located in the south-central United States.


      Geographically, Georgia is east of Texas on a US map. In fact, Georgia is several
      states east of Texas (typically Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama are between
      them).


      Now, let''s check the specific zip codes:

      - 31210 is likely in or near Macon, Georgia.

      - 76114 is likely in or near Fort Worth, Texas.


      Since Georgia as a whole is east of Texas, and these specific locations don''t
      change that fundamental geographic relationship (they''re not on extreme edges
      that would reverse the normal state relationship), I can conclude that 31210,
      GA is indeed east of 76114, TX.</think>I need to determine the relative locations
      of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their positions.

      Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States, while Texas (TX)
      is in the south-central United States.


      Step 2: Compare the general east-west relationship of these states.

      On a U.S. map, Georgia is positioned to the east of Texas. In fact, several
      states (Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama) lie between Texas and Georgia.


      Step 3: Check if the specific zip codes change this relationship.

      31210 is in Macon, Georgia, which is relatively central in the state.

      76114 is in Fort Worth, Texas, which is in the northern part of Texas.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Georgia is entirely east of Texas, any location in Georgia (including
      31210) must be east of any location in Texas (including 76114).

      codes and compare their east-west positioning.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 31210 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 76114 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, along the Atlantic coast

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States, west of Georgia


      Step 3: Compare their positions

      - On a map of the United States, Georgia is positioned to the east of Texas

      - All locations in Georgia are east of most locations in Texas (especially central
      and western Texas)

      - Zip code 76114 is in the Fort Worth area of Texas, which is not on the eastern
      edge of Texas


      Therefore, 31210 in Georgia is indeed east of 76114 in Texas.

      \ zip code is east of the Texas zip code.\n\nFrom general knowledge of US geography,\
      \ Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, while Texas is in the\

      \ Georgia is indeed east of Texas.\n\nTo be more specific about these particular\

      07092 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ).

      44012 is a zip code in Ohio (OH).


      Now I need to think about their relative positions:


      1. The United States generally has states arranged from west to east as you
      move from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean.

      2. Ohio is in the Midwest region of the United States.

      3. New Jersey is on the East Coast of the United States.

      4. States on the East Coast (like New Jersey) are east of Midwestern states
      (like Ohio).


      Since New Jersey is on the East Coast and Ohio is in the Midwest, New Jersey
      is east of Ohio. Therefore, zip code 07092 in NJ would be east of zip code 44012
      in OH.</think>I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 07092 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 44012 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east basis.

      - The United States generally runs from west (Pacific Ocean) to east (Atlantic
      Ocean)

      - New Jersey borders the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side

      - Ohio is inland and lies west of New Jersey


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since New Jersey is east of Ohio on the US map, any location in New Jersey
      (including 07092) would be east of any location in Ohio (including 44012)

      To solve this problem, I need to use my knowledge of US geography. In the United
      States, states are positioned such that:

      - New Jersey (NJ) is on the east coast of the United States

      - Ohio (OH) is in the Midwest region, inland from the east coast


      Looking at the relative positions of these two states on a map:

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast in the eastern United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region, inland from the east coast


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Ohio is positioned west of New Jersey

      - All of New Jersey is east of all of Ohio on a map of the United States


      Step 4: Make a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      - Since 07092 is in New Jersey and 44012 is in Ohio, the New Jersey zip code
      must be east of the Ohio zip code

      by step:


      1. We need to determine if 11704, NY is east of 45439, OH.

      2. First, I need to identify the general locations of these zip codes.

      3. 11704 is in New York (NY) state, and 45439 is in Ohio (OH) state.


      The United States geography generally has:

      - New York state is on the eastern seaboard of the US

      - Ohio is in the Midwest, west of New York


      Looking at their positions on a map:

      - New York is definitely east of Ohio

      - Therefore, any location in New York would be east of any location in Ohio


      Since 11704 is in New York, and 45439 is in Ohio, we can conclude that 11704,
      NY is located east of 45439, OH.</think># Is 11704, NY located east of 45439,
      OH?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 11704 is in New York (NY)

      - 45439 is in Ohio (OH)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states

      - New York is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region

      - Geographically, New York is east of Ohio on the US map


      ## Step 3: Apply this relationship to the specific ZIP codes

      Since these ZIP codes are in their respective states, the geographical relationship
      between the states applies to them as well.


      Therefore, 11704, NY is located east of 45439, OH.


      YES'

      is located east of 45439, OH.


      To do this, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative positions east/west of each other


      11704 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      45439 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      Geographically in the United States:

      - New York is located on the East Coast

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest


      When comparing east-west positions in the US, states on the East Coast (like
      New York) are east of Midwestern states (like Ohio).


      Therefore, New York is east of Ohio, which means 11704, NY would be east of
      45439, OH.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the states for each zip code.

      - 11704 is in New York (NY)

      - 45439 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, New York is positioned to the
      east of Ohio

      - The entire state of New York lies east of Ohio


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 11704 is in NY and 45439 is in OH, the geographical relationship between
      the states applies to these zip codes as well


      YES, 11704, NY is located east of 45439, OH.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 11704 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 45439 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of New York and Ohio.

      The United States is laid out such that states on the east coast (like New York)
      are generally east of states in the Midwest (like Ohio). New York is on the
      Atlantic coast, while Ohio is an inland state that doesn''t touch the Atlantic
      Ocean.


      Step 3: Confirm the specific locations.

      The zip code 11704 appears to be for Babylon, Long Island, which is indeed in
      eastern New York.

      The zip code 45439 appears to be for an area in Dayton, Ohio, which is in western
      Ohio.


      So geographically, New York is east of Ohio, and specifically, Babylon, NY (11704)
      would be east of Dayton, OH (45439).</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 11704 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 45439 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      New York is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while Ohio
      is in the Midwest region.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Looking at a map of the United States, New York is positioned to the east of
      Ohio. All of New York state, including any location with a NY zip code, would
      be east of locations in Ohio.


      Step 4: Confirm the specific zip codes.

      11704 appears to be in the Babylon area of Long Island, NY, which is in the
      eastern part of New York.

      45439 is in the Dayton area of Ohio, which is in the western part of Ohio.


      YES, 11704, NY is located east of 45439, OH.'

      if 45342, OH (Ohio) is located east of 61614, IL (Illinois).


      To answer this question, I need to consider the geographic positions of these
      states and zip codes.


      First, let''s consider the states:

      - OH is Ohio, which is located in the eastern part of the Midwest region

      - IL is Illinois, which is located in the central part of the Midwest region


      Geographically, Ohio is east of Illinois. The entire state of Ohio is east of
      the entire state of Illinois.


      Now, specific zip codes within these states could potentially change this relationship,
      but since the states themselves have a clear east-west relationship (Ohio being
      east of Illinois), and the zip codes are within their respective states, the
      zip code in Ohio (45342) must be east of the zip code in Illinois (61614).


      Therefore, 45342, OH is located east of 61614, IL.</think>I need to determine
      if a zip code in Ohio is east of a zip code in Illinois.


      Step 1: Let me identify the states.

      - 45342 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 61614 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Ohio and Illinois are both Midwestern states, but Ohio is positioned entirely
      east of Illinois. The eastern border of Illinois doesn''t extend as far east
      as any part of Ohio.


      Step 3: Consider if specific zip codes could change this relationship.

      Since the entire state of Ohio is east of the entire state of Illinois, any
      location in Ohio (including zip code 45342) must be east of any location in
      Illinois (including zip code 61614). The specific zip codes don''t change the
      east-west relationship established by their states.


      YES, 45342, OH is located east of 61614, IL.'

      to:

      1. Identify which states OH and IL are

      2. Find the approximate locations of these zip codes

      3. Determine which one is east of the other


      Step 1: OH is Ohio, and IL is Illinois.


      Step 2: Let me consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Ohio is located in the eastern part of the Midwest region of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States, west of Ohio


      So generally, Ohio is east of Illinois. The states border is such that Illinois
      is to the west of Ohio.


      Since 45342 is in Ohio (OH) and 61614 is in Illinois (IL), and Ohio is east
      of Illinois, then 45342, OH should be east of 61614, IL.

      Ohio is located in the eastern part of the Midwest United States, while Illinois
      is located in the central Midwest. Importantly, Ohio is positioned east of Illinois
      on the map.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the zip codes.

      Since these zip codes are in their respective states, and Ohio is east of Illinois,
      it follows that 45342 (in Ohio) is east of 61614 (in Illinois).

      to determine the relative geographical positions of these two zip codes.


      08028 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ).

      45204 is a zip code in Ohio (OH).


      In the United States, states are positioned as follows:

      - New Jersey is on the East Coast

      - Ohio is in the Midwest, east of the Mississippi River but west of New Jersey


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - New Jersey is significantly east of Ohio

      - Ohio is located in the interior of the country, while New Jersey borders the
      Atlantic Ocean


      Therefore, any location in New Jersey (including zip code 08028) would be east
      of any location in Ohio (including zip code 45204).</think>I need to determine
      whether 08028, NJ is east of 45204, OH by looking at their geographical positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 08028 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 45204 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region, inland from the Atlantic Coast


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis

      - New Jersey is significantly east of Ohio

      - The entire state of New Jersey lies east of Ohio


      Step 4: Conclude about the specific zip codes

      - Since 08028 is in New Jersey and 45204 is in Ohio, and New Jersey is east
      of Ohio, it follows that 08028, NJ is east of 45204, OH

      When looking at a map of the United States, New Jersey is positioned to the
      east of Ohio. The entire state of New Jersey lies east of the entire state of
      Ohio.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 08028 is in New Jersey and 45204 is in Ohio, and New Jersey is east of
      Ohio, it follows that zip code 08028, NJ is east of zip code 45204, OH.

      \nIn the US, states generally follow a west-to-east pattern, with states on\
      \ the west coast (like California) being westernmost, and states on the east\
      \ coast being easternmost. \n\nNew Jersey is on the east coast, while Pennsylvania\
      \ is just west of New Jersey. In general, NJ is east of PA.\n\nHowever, I need\
      \ to be careful because specific zip codes near state borders might not follow\
      \ the general state orientation. Let me think about these specific zip codes:\n\
      \n- 07 prefix typically indicates northern New Jersey\n- 15 prefix typically\
      \ indicates western Pennsylvania (around Pittsburgh)\n\nWestern PA is definitely\
      \ west of northern NJ. So a zip code in northern NJ (07432) should be east of\
      \ a zip code in western PA (15139).\n\nSo I believe the NJ zip code is east\
      \ of the PA zip code.</think>To determine if 07432, NJ is located east of 15139,\
      \ PA, I need to understand the geographical relationship between these zip codes.\n\
      \nStep 1: Identify the locations.\n- 07432 is a zip code for Fair Lawn or Midland\
      \ Park area in northern New Jersey\n- 15139 is a zip code in the Pittsburgh\
      \ area in western Pennsylvania\n\nStep 2: Consider the geographical relationship\
      \ between Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\n- New Jersey lies on the Atlantic coast\n\
      - Pennsylvania is inland and generally west of New Jersey\n\nStep 3: Consider\
      \ the specific locations of these zip codes.\n- 07432 is in northern New Jersey,\
      \ in the eastern part of the state\n- 15139 is in western Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh\
      \ region)\n- Western Pennsylvania is definitely west of northern New Jersey\n\
      \nStep 4: Draw a conclusion based on the east-west relationship.\nSince New\
      \ Jersey is east of Pennsylvania on the map, and these specific zip codes maintain\
      \ that relationship (with 07432 being in northern NJ and 15139 being in western\
      \ PA), the NJ location is east of the PA location.\n\nYES, 07432, NJ is located\
      \ east of 15139, PA."

      07432 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ).

      15139 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA).


      Generally speaking, New Jersey is located east of Pennsylvania on the US map.
      Pennsylvania borders New Jersey on its eastern side, and New Jersey is on the
      Atlantic coast.


      Looking at the specific zip codes:

      - 07432 appears to be in northern New Jersey

      - 15139 appears to be in western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh


      The entire state of New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania, so any location in New
      Jersey would be east of any location in Pennsylvania.


      Therefore, 07432, NJ is indeed located east of 15139, PA.</think>I need to determine
      the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 07432 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 15139 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      New Jersey is located entirely to the east of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania and
      New Jersey share a border, with Pennsylvania to the west and New Jersey to the
      east. New Jersey borders the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      07432 is in northern New Jersey (likely in Bergen County).

      15139 is in western Pennsylvania (likely in the Pittsburgh area).


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since all of New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania, and these zip codes are in
      their respective states, 07432 NJ must be east of 15139 PA.

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Geographically, the eastern United States starts at the Atlantic Ocean and extends
      westward. The Midwest region, including Indiana, is west of the east coast states.


      Washington, DC is located along the eastern seaboard, while Indiana is located
      more centrally in the country, to the west of DC.


      So, 20032 in DC would be located east of 46203 in Indiana.</think>I need to
      determine the relative positions of these two zip codes on the US map.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 20032 is a zip code in Washington, DC (District of Columbia)

      - 46203 is a zip code in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Determine their geographic positions.

      - Washington, DC is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - The Midwest (including Indiana) is west of the eastern seaboard states

      - Washington, DC is significantly farther east than any part of Indiana

      - On a map of the US, DC is to the right (east) of Indiana


      Therefore, 20032 in DC is indeed east of 46203 in Indiana.

      if a location in New Jersey is east of a location in Ohio by analyzing their
      geographical positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 07052 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 43952 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region, west of New Jersey

      - All of New Jersey lies east of all of Ohio


      Step 3: Make the conclusion

      Since New Jersey is entirely east of Ohio on a map of the United States, any
      location in New Jersey (including 07052) must be east of any location in Ohio
      (including 43952).

      \ US.\n\nFirst, let me identify the locations:\n- 07052 is in New Jersey (NJ)\n\
      - 43952 is in Ohio (OH)\n\nGenerally speaking, New Jersey is on the eastern\

      First, let me identify the states:

      - 10927 is in New York (NY)

      - 46016 is in Indiana (IN)


      Geographically, in the United States:

      - New York is in the northeastern part of the country

      - Indiana is in the midwestern part of the country


      In terms of east-west positioning, New York is generally east of Indiana. The
      entire state of New York is east of the entire state of Indiana.


      So if we''re just comparing states, New York is east of Indiana. But let''s
      be more precise and think about the specific zip codes.


      Since zip codes in the US are generally organized geographically (though not
      perfectly), and since NY is entirely east of IN, it''s very likely that any

      New York is located in the northeastern United States, while Indiana is located

      On a map of the United States, New York is entirely east of Indiana. The westernmost

      of Indiana. Looking at a map of the United States, Indiana is clearly west of
      New York.


      Since 10927 is a zip code in New York (NY) and 46016 is a zip code in Indiana
      (IN), the first zip code would be east of the second zip code.</think>To determine
      if 10927, NY is located east of 46016, IN, I need to analyze the geographic
      locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 10927 is in New York (NY)

      - 46016 is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Indiana is located in the midwestern United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - On a U.S. map, New York is positioned to the east of Indiana

      - All of New York state lies east of all of Indiana state


      Step 4: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - Since the entire state of New York is east of the entire state of Indiana,
      any zip code in NY would be east of any zip code in IN


      YES, 10927, NY is located east of 46016, IN.'

      To solve this, I''ll need to think about the geographic locations of these zip
      codes or states.


      First, I know that:

      - 48219 is in Michigan (MI)

      - 68152 is in Nebraska (NE)


      In the United States, Michigan is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region,
      while Nebraska is in the Great Plains/Midwest region.


      Geographically speaking, Michigan is located east of Nebraska. Michigan is bordered
      by the Great Lakes on its eastern side and extends to the center of the country,
      while Nebraska is located in the central part of the country, west of Michigan.


      If we look at a map of the US, we''d see that Michigan is definitely east of
      Nebraska. This means that generally, zip codes in Michigan would be east of
      zip codes in Nebraska.


      So based on the state locations, 48219 in Michigan should be east of 68152 in
      Nebraska.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic

      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states

      Michigan is located in the Great Lakes region in the eastern part of the Midwest,
      while Nebraska is located in the Great Plains region in the central United States.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on the map

      Looking at the US map, Michigan is positioned significantly east of Nebraska.
      Michigan is near the eastern portion of the country bordering the Great Lakes,
      while Nebraska is in the middle of the country.


      Step 4: Make the conclusion

      Since Michigan is east of Nebraska, zip code 48219 in MI is located east of

      Michigan is in the Great Lakes region in the eastern part of the US.

      Nebraska is in the Great Plains region in the central part of the US.


      Looking at a US map, Michigan is definitely east of Nebraska. Michigan borders

      - All of Michigan is east of all of Nebraska


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      - Since 48219 is in Michigan and 68152 is in Nebraska, the Michigan zip code
      must be east of the Nebraska zip code

      negative) longitude value in the Western Hemisphere is located further west.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 48219 is a zip code in Michigan (MI)

      - 68152 is a zip code in Nebraska (NE)


      In general, Michigan is in the eastern part of the United States, while Nebraska

      Michigan is significantly further east than Nebraska. The entire state of Michigan
      lies east of Nebraska.


      Step 4: Apply this knowledge to the specific zip codes.

      Since 48219 is in Michigan and 68152 is in Nebraska, and Michigan is east of

      3) Then I need to determine if 06379, CT is east of 18218, PA


      For U.S. geography, states on the east coast generally follow a north-south
      arrangement. Connecticut (CT) is located in New England in the northeast, while
      Pennsylvania (PA) is in the Mid-Atlantic region.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Connecticut is located east of Pennsylvania.
      Connecticut borders the Atlantic Ocean, while Pennsylvania is more inland.


      So in general, any location in Connecticut would be east of any location in

      the relative east-west positioning of two zip codes:

      1. 06379, CT (Connecticut)

      2. 18218, PA (Pennsylvania)


      To answer this, I need to consider the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      First, let me consider the general geographic relationship between Connecticut
      and Pennsylvania. Connecticut is located in New England in the northeastern
      United States, while Pennsylvania is located in the Mid-Atlantic region. Generally
      speaking, Connecticut is east of Pennsylvania.


      To be more specific:

      - Connecticut is bordered by New York to the west, Massachusetts to the north,
      and Rhode Island to the east

      - Pennsylvania is bordered by Ohio to the west, New York to the north, New Jersey
      to the east, and several other states


      So in general, Connecticut (CT) is east of Pennsylvania (PA). However, I should
      verify the specific zip codes to be certain.


      Zip code 06379 is in Connecticut, and the "06" prefix is consistent with Connecticut
      zip codes.

      Zip code 18218 is in Pennsylvania, and the "18" prefix is consistent with Pennsylvania
      zip codes.


      Since Connecticut as a state is east of Pennsylvania, and these zip codes are
      within their respective states, it''s very likely that 06379, CT is east of
      18218, PA.</think># Is 06379, CT located east of 18218, PA?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positioning
      of these two zip codes.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) 06379 is a zip code in Connecticut (CT)

      2) 18218 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      3) Connecticut is a state in the northeastern United States

      4) Pennsylvania is a state in the mid-Atlantic region

      5) Geographically, Connecticut is located entirely to the east of Pennsylvania

      6) The entire state of Connecticut has a more easterly longitude than the eastern
      border of Pennsylvania

      7) Therefore, any location in Connecticut (including zip code 06379) must be
      east of any location in Pennsylvania (including zip code 18218)

      06379 in Connecticut (CT) is located east of ZIP code 18218 in Pennsylvania

      In the United States, locations in the eastern part of the country generally
      have lower ZIP codes than locations in the western part. However, this is not
      perfectly consistent across all states, so I need to consider the specific states
      involved.


      Connecticut (CT) is located on the east coast of the US, while Pennsylvania
      (PA) is west of Connecticut. In general, locations in Connecticut will be east
      of locations in Pennsylvania.


      To confirm this geographic relationship:

      - Connecticut is one of the New England states on the Atlantic coast

      - Pennsylvania is inland, west of New Jersey and southwest of New York

      - Connecticut is definitely east of Pennsylvania

      Connecticut is located on the east coast of the United States, while Pennsylvania
      is inland and west of Connecticut. The entire state of Connecticut lies east
      of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Verify if this relationship holds for these specific ZIP codes.

      Since 06379 is in Connecticut and 18218 is in Pennsylvania, and Connecticut
      is entirely east of Pennsylvania, the location represented by ZIP code 06379

      11783 is a zip code in New York state (NY). New York is generally located in
      the northeastern United States.


      15690 is a zip code in Pennsylvania state (PA). Pennsylvania is also in the
      northeastern United States, but generally west of New York.


      Looking at the geography of the US, New York is typically east of Pennsylvania.
      However, I should be careful because some parts of states can have unusual geographical
      relationships.


      The specific zip code 11783 appears to be in Long Island, NY, which is definitely
      in the eastern part of New York.

      The zip code 15690 appears to be in western Pennsylvania.


      Given this information, 11783 in NY should be east of 15690 in PA, since:

      1. New York is generally east of Pennsylvania

      2. 11783 is in Long Island, which is in the eastern part of New York

      3. 15690 is in western Pennsylvania, which is even further west


      So the answer would be YES.</think>I need to determine the relative positions

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 11783 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 15690 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between NY and PA.

      New York is located to the east of Pennsylvania on the US map.


      Step 3: Look at the specific zip codes.

      - 11783 is a zip code in Long Island, NY, which is in the eastern part of New
      York state

      - 15690 is in western Pennsylvania


      Step 4: Compare the positions.

      Since New York is east of Pennsylvania, and specifically Long Island (11783)

      11783 is a zip code in New York (NY). Based on my knowledge, this is likely
      somewhere on Long Island.

      15690 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA).


      In the United States, New York is generally east of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania
      borders New York to the south (of western NY) and west (of eastern NY). Long

      NY is east of 15690, PA.


      The general geographic fact is that almost all of New York is east of almost
      all of Pennsylvania. There might be some small areas where this isn''t true
      at the border, but zip code 11783 being in the 117xx range suggests it''s in

      2) Zip code 11783 is in New York. Specifically, this is a Long Island zip code
      (Seaford, NY). Long Island is located on the eastern side of New York state.


      3) Zip code 15690 is in Pennsylvania. This is in western Pennsylvania (Slickville,

      \ at the first two digits:\n   - 117xx zip codes are located on Long Island\
      \ in New York\n   - 156xx zip codes are in western Pennsylvania\n\n5) New York\
      \ is generally east of Pennsylvania, and specifically, Long Island (where 11783\
      \ would be located) is in the eastern part of New York.\n\n6) Western Pennsylvania\
      \ (where 15690 is located) is in the western part of Pennsylvania.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ 11783, NY is indeed located east of 15690, PA.\n\nYES"
    ed2e8075-4b45-4207-877e-a8d65284cdf0: "<think>This question is asking whether\
      \ a certain zip code in New York (11783) is east of a certain zip code in Pennsylvania\
      \ (15690).\n\nTo solve this, I need to:\n1. Figure out where 11783, NY is located\n\
      2. Figure out where 15690, PA is located\n3. Determine if the NY location is\
      \ east of the PA location\n\nThe United States follows a general pattern where\
      \ locations on the east coast have lower zip codes than those further west.\
      \ However, I shouldn't rely solely on the zip code numbers because the numbering\
      \ system isn't perfectly linear with longitude.\n\nWhat I do know:\n- NY (New\
      \ York) is a state on the east coast\n- PA (Pennsylvania) is also an east coast\
      \ state, but generally west of New York\n\nNew York is generally east of Pennsylvania,\
      \ as New York borders Pennsylvania on Pennsylvania's eastern side. So geographically,\
      \ most places in New York are east of most places in Pennsylvania.\n\nGiven\
      \ that 11783 is in NY and 15690 is in PA, and New York is generally east of\
      \ Pennsylvania, it's likely that 11783, NY is east of 15690, PA. \n\nBut to\
      \ be more precise, I'd need to know the specific locations. Zip codes in the\
      \ 117xx range in NY are typically on Long Island, which is definitely in the\
      \ eastern part of New York. Zip codes in the 156xx range in PA would be in western\
      \ Pennsylvania.</think># Is 11783, NY located east of 15690, PA?\n\nI'll solve\
      \ this step by step:\n\n1) First, I need to identify the locations:\n   - 11783\
      \ is a zip code in New York (NY)\n   - 15690 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)\n\
      \n2) Looking at the geographic relationship between these states:\n   - New\
      \ York is generally located east of Pennsylvania\n   - Pennsylvania shares its\
      \ eastern border with New York\n\n3) More specifically for these zip codes:\n\
      \   - Zip code 11783 is in Seaford, NY on Long Island, which is in the eastern\
      \ part of New York\n   - Zip code 15690 is in Slickville, PA, which is in western\
      \ Pennsylvania\n\n4) Comparing their positions:\n   - Long Island (where 11783\
      \ is located) is significantly east of western Pennsylvania\n   - All of Long\
      \ Island is east of even the easternmost parts of Pennsylvania\n\nYES, 11783,\
      \ NY is located east of 15690, PA."
