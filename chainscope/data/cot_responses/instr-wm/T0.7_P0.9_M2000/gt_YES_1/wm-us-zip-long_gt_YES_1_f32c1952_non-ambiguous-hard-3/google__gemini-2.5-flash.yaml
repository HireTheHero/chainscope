      determine if 30534, GA is located east of 73142, OK.


      **Step 1: Determine the general location of 30534, GA.**

      A quick search reveals that 30534 is a zip code for Cornelia, Georgia. Georgia
      is a state in the Southeastern United States.


      **Step 2: Determine the general location of 73142, OK.**

      A quick search reveals that 73142 is a zip code for Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
      Oklahoma is a state in the South Central United States, west of Arkansas and
      north of Texas.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      To be "east of" another location, a place must have a higher (less negative,
      or closer to 0) longitude than the other.


      *   The approximate longitude for Cornelia, GA (30534) is around -83.5 degrees.

      *   The approximate longitude for Oklahoma City, OK (73142) is around -97.5
      degrees.


      **Step 4: Conclude based on longitude.**

      Since -83.5 is greater than -97.5, Cornelia, GA is located east of Oklahoma
      City, OK.

      19043 is in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is on the East Coast of
      the US. Its longitude generally ranges from about -74 to -80 degrees. Drexel
      Hill is in the eastern part of Pennsylvania. A quick lookup confirms its longitude
      is approximately **-75.3 degrees West**.


      **Step 2: Determine the approximate longitude of 45371, OH.**

      45371 is in Tipp City, Ohio. Ohio is in the Midwest. Its longitude generally
      ranges from about -80 to -84 degrees. Tipp City is in the western part of Ohio.
      A quick lookup confirms its longitude is approximately **-84.2 degrees West**.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      *   19043, PA: -75.3 degrees West

      *   45371, OH: -84.2 degrees West


      On a map, locations with a *smaller* negative longitude (i.e., closer to zero)
      are further East.

      determine if 26041, WV is located east of 66220, KS.


      **Step 1: Understand Zip Code Geography**

      Zip codes are generally assigned in a way that the first digit indicates a broad
      geographic area from East to West. Lower first digits tend to be further East,
      and higher first digits tend to be further West.


      *   **2**6041, WV: The first digit is ''2''. This generally corresponds to the
      Mid-Atlantic region (Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia,
      etc.).

      *   **6**6220, KS: The first digit is ''6''. This generally corresponds to the
      central United States (Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa, etc.).


      Based on this first digit rule, a ''2'' zip code is typically east of a ''6''
      zip code.


      **Step 2: Verify the States'' Relative Positions**

      Let''s confirm the relative geographic positions of West Virginia (WV) and Kansas
      (KS).


      *   West Virginia is an East Coast/Appalachian state.

      *   Kansas is a Midwestern state, located well to the west of West Virginia.


      **Step 3: Conclude Based on Both Pieces of Information**

      Both the zip code''s first digit and the actual geographic location of the states
      confirm that West Virginia is significantly *east* of Kansas. Therefore, any
      location in West Virginia (like 26041) will be east of any location in Kansas
      (like 66220).

      **Step 1: Understand Zip Code Geography**

      US zip codes generally increase from East to West within a state and across
      the country. The first digit of a zip code often indicates a broad geographical
      area in the US.

      *   9xxxx: Pacific


      **Step 2: Locate 26041, WV**

      *   The first digit is ''2''. This places it in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region.

      *   WV (West Virginia) is a state in the Eastern United States.

      *   Specifically, 26041 is in Wellsburg, West Virginia.


      **Step 3: Locate 66220, KS**

      *   The first digit is ''6''. This places it in the Central United States.

      *   KS (Kansas) is a state in the Central United States, west of the Mississippi
      River.

      *   Specifically, 66220 is in Overland Park, Kansas.


      **Step 4: Compare Locations**

      West Virginia is an East Coast/Appalachian state. Kansas is a Midwest/Great
      Plains state, significantly further west.


      Therefore, West Virginia is geographically east of Kansas.

      determine if 07871, NJ is located east of 15057, PA.


      **Step 1: Determine the general location of 07871, NJ.**

      07871 is the ZIP code for Succasunna, New Jersey. Succasunna is in Morris County,
      northern New Jersey.


      **Step 2: Determine the general location of 15057, PA.**

      15057 is the ZIP code for Leechburg, Pennsylvania. Leechburg is in Armstrong
      County, western Pennsylvania, northeast of Pittsburgh.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      To determine if one location is east of another, we need to compare their longitudes.
      A location with a more positive (less negative, closer to 0) longitude is generally
      further east in the Western Hemisphere.


      *   **Approximate Longitude for Succasunna, NJ (07871):** Around -74.6 degrees
      West.

      *   **Approximate Longitude for Leechburg, PA (15057):** Around -79.5 degrees
      West.


      **Step 4: Conclude based on longitude comparison.**

      Since -74.6 is greater than -79.5 (i.e., -74.6 is further to the east on the
      longitude scale), Succasunna, NJ is located east of Leechburg, PA.

      1.  **Understand the question:** We need to determine if a specific Massachusetts

      2.  **Determine the general location of Massachusetts:** Massachusetts is on
      the East Coast of the United States.


      3.  **Determine the general location of Pennsylvania:** Pennsylvania is also
      on the East Coast, but generally to the south and west of Massachusetts.


      4.  **Consider the "East of" relationship:** For something to be "east of" another,
      its longitude must be *smaller* (closer to the Prime Meridian, or further east).


      5.  **Hypothesize based on general geography:** Given that both are East Coast
      states, and PA is generally southwest of MA, it''s highly probable that MA is
      east of PA.


      6.  **Verify with a quick mental map or general knowledge:** If you picture
      the US, MA is clearly to the northeast of PA. Moving from PA to MA, you would
      generally go northeast. Therefore, MA is to the east of PA.


      7.  **Focus on the specific zip codes (and why they don''t change the general
      answer):** While individual zip codes represent smaller areas, the question
      is about the *relative position* of locations within these states. A zip code
      in Massachusetts will always be east of a zip code in Pennsylvania, given their
      overall state positions. The specific numbers (01604 vs. 18704) are irrelevant

    d0c0b539-0536-4c91-9687-3eb650089719: 'This is a trick question, or at least one
      designed to make you overthink.


      Here''s why:


      *   **Zip codes are not coordinates:** You cannot directly compare two zip codes
      to determine if one location is "east" of another. Zip codes are routing codes
      for mail delivery, often following administrative or postal boundaries, not
      strict geographical lines of longitude.

      *   **Zip codes can represent areas:** A single zip code can cover a significant
      geographic area.

      *   **The numbers themselves are arbitrary for geographical comparison:** The
      fact that 10598 is numerically smaller than 44627 tells you nothing about their
      relative east/west positions.


      Therefore, the question cannot be answered with a simple "YES" or "NO" based
      solely on the zip codes themselves. You would need to look up the actual geographical
      locations corresponding to those zip codes (e.g., using a map or a geocoding
      service).


      Since the question asks for a "clear YES or NO answer about US zip codes" and
      the information provided *is* US zip codes, the premise is flawed for a direct
      comparison.


      However, if I am forced to answer "YES" or "NO" based *only* on the provided
      information and the inherent limitations of zip codes for this type of comparison:


      The answer is **NO**, because you cannot determine east/west relationships simply
      by comparing the numerical values of zip codes.'
    da7925dc-62a2-4dd5-9867-377fbeab505d: 'Let''s break this down to determine the
      answer.


      **Step 1: Understand the core of the question.**

      The question is asking about the *relative geographical position* (east/west)
      of two locations identified by their zip codes.


      **Step 2: How are zip codes generally structured geographically in the US?**

      US zip codes generally increase from east to west. Lower numbers tend to be
      in the east, and higher numbers tend to be in the west. This is a very broad
      generalization, but it''s a useful starting point for *comparing* two vastly
      different zip codes.


      **Step 3: Analyze the first zip code (10598, NY).**

      *   The first digit is ''1''.

      *   Zip codes starting with ''0'' and ''1'' are generally located in the northeastern
      United States. New York is indeed in the Northeast.


      **Step 4: Analyze the second zip code (44627, OH).**

      *   The first digit is ''4''.

      *   Zip codes starting with ''4'' are generally located in the Midwest/East
      Central United States. Ohio is in this region.


      **Step 5: Compare the general geographical regions.**

      New York (Northeast, ''1'' prefix) is generally *east* of Ohio (Midwest/East
      Central, ''4'' prefix).


      **Step 6: Confirm with actual locations (optional but helpful for certainty).**

      *   10598 is Chappaqua, New York.

      *   44627 is Dundee, Ohio.

      *   Looking at a map, Chappaqua, NY, is clearly east of Dundee, OH.

    d19957bd-6595-46b1-bf35-86a8f202eea0: 'Let''s break this down step-by-step to
      arrive at the YES/NO answer.


      **Step 1: Understand the nature of zip codes in relation to geography.**

      Zip codes are generally assigned in increasing order from east to west within
      a state, and from east to west across the country. Lower zip codes tend to be
      further east, and higher zip codes further west. However, this is a generalization
      and there are many exceptions, especially when crossing state lines. The *first
      digit* of a zip code is the most reliable indicator of general geographic region
      within the US.


      **Step 2: Locate 36107, AL.**

      *   The first digit is ''3''. This indicates the Southeastern US (AL, FL, GA,
      MS, TN, and parts of KY, NC, SC).

      *   Specifically, 36107 is a zip code in Montgomery, Alabama.


      **Step 3: Locate 76001, TX.**

      *   The first digit is ''7''. This indicates the South Central US (AR, LA, OK,
      TX).

      *   Specifically, 76001 is a zip code in Arlington, Texas (part of the Dallas-Fort
      Worth metroplex).


      **Step 4: Compare their relative positions.**

      *   Alabama (AL) is geographically to the east of Texas (TX).

      *   Even though zip codes increase from east to west *within* a state, the overall
      *first digit* assignment scheme places ''3'' (Southeastern US) generally to
      the east of ''7'' (South Central US).


      **Step 5: Conclude based on the comparison.**

      Since Alabama is east of Texas, and the specific locations (Montgomery, AL and
      Arlington, TX) follow this general rule, 36107, AL is indeed located east of
      76001, TX.

      **Step 1: Understand the Question**

      We need to compare the east/west position of two zip codes.


      **Step 2: Determine Location of 19363, PA**

      *   "PA" stands for Pennsylvania.

      *   19363 is in Chester County, Pennsylvania.

      *   A quick search or map lookup for 19363 shows it''s around Unionville, PA.

      *   Its approximate longitude is around -75.7 degrees.


      **Step 3: Determine Location of 26330, WV**

      *   "WV" stands for West Virginia.

      *   26330 is in Barbour County, West Virginia.

      *   A quick search or map lookup for 26330 shows it''s around Belington, WV.

      *   Its approximate longitude is around -79.9 degrees.


      **Step 4: Compare Longitudes**

      *   Longitudes are measured in degrees east or west of the Prime Meridian (0
      degrees).

      *   In the Western Hemisphere (where the US is), negative longitudes mean west.
      A longitude closer to 0 (less negative) is further east.

      *   -75.7 degrees (PA) vs. -79.9 degrees (WV)


      Since -75.7 is a larger number (less negative) than -79.9, it is further east.


      **Step 5: Formulate the Answer**

      19363, PA is at approximately -75.7 longitude.

      26330, WV is at approximately -79.9 longitude.

      **Step 1: Determine the approximate longitude of each zip code.**


      *   **31636, GA:** This zip code is in Valdosta, Georgia. Georgia is in the
      Eastern Time Zone, and its westernmost parts are around 85 degrees West longitude.
      Valdosta is in south-central Georgia, so its longitude would be somewhere around
      **83-84 degrees West**.

      the Central Time Zone, and its easternmost parts are around 89 degrees West
      longitude. Metairie is just west of New Orleans, so its longitude would be somewhere
      around **90-91 degrees West**.


      **Step 2: Compare the longitudes.**


      *   83-84 degrees West (GA) vs. 90-91 degrees West (LA)


      **Step 3: Relate longitude to east/west position.**

      *increase*.

      *   Conversely, as you move *east*, the longitude numbers (for West longitude)
      *decrease*.


      Therefore, a location with a smaller West longitude number is *east* of a location
      with a larger West longitude number.


      Since 83-84 is less than 90-91, Valdosta, GA is east of Metairie, LA.

      **Step 1: Identify the states.**

      *   85396 is in Arizona (AZ).

      *   91780 is in California (CA).


      **Step 2: Understand the general geographical relationship between California
      and Arizona.**

      Arizona is generally located to the east of California. The entire state of
      Arizona is east of the entire state of California.


      **Step 3: Consider if there are any exceptions for specific zip codes that would
      reverse this general relationship.**

      While zip codes can be very specific, a zip code within a state cannot be geographically
      west of a state that is entirely to its west. In other words, no part of Arizona
      can be west of any part of California.


      **Conclusion:** Since Arizona is geographically east of California, any location

      03303 is a zip code in Concord, New Hampshire. New Hampshire is in the northeastern
      United States.

      **Step 1: Determine the approximate location of 03303, NH.**

      03303 is a zip code for Concord, New Hampshire. New Hampshire is in the northeastern
      United States.


      **Step 2: Determine the approximate location of 49337, MI.**

      49337 is a zip code for Rockford, Michigan. Michigan is in the Great Lakes region
      of the United States.


      **Step 3: Compare their relative longitudes.**

      To be "east of" another location, a place must have a greater (less negative,
      when using western longitudes) longitude value.


      *   New Hampshire (and thus Concord) is generally around 71-72 degrees West
      longitude.

      *   Michigan (and thus Rockford) is generally around 85-86 degrees West longitude.


      On a map, locations with smaller (more negative) West longitudes are *east*
      of locations with larger (less negative) West longitudes.


      Since 71-72 degrees West is a smaller (more easterly) longitude value than 85-86
      degrees West, Concord, NH is indeed east of Rockford, MI.

      be further east.


      *   **18951, PA:** The first digit is ''1''. This broadly indicates a region

      85013, AZ is located east of 92672, CA.


      1.  **Identify the states:** We are comparing a zip code in Arizona (AZ) with
      a zip code in California (CA).


      2.  **Understand relative geographical positions of the states:** California
      is to the west of Arizona. Arizona is to the east of California.


      3.  **Determine the general east/west relationship of the zip codes based on
      their states:** Since 85013 is in Arizona and 92672 is in California, and Arizona
      is east of California, it is highly probable that 85013, AZ is east of 92672,
      CA.


      4.  **Consider exceptions (and why they are unlikely to apply here):** While
      it''s *theoretically* possible for a very western part of Arizona to be west
      of a very eastern part of California, this is extremely rare and usually only
      applies to specific, small, and often mountainous border areas. Zip codes generally
      cover a significant area, and the state-level east-west relationship is dominant.
      The 850xx series for Arizona is generally central-southern Arizona (Phoenix
      area), and the 926xx series for California is generally southern California
      (Orange County area). Given these general locations, the state-level relationship
      holds true.


      5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the general geographical relationship of the states
      Arizona and California, Arizona is east of California.

      \ Zip codes themselves don't directly indicate longitude. However, they correspond\
      \ to physical locations, and those locations have latitudes and longitudes.\
      \ We need to find the approximate longitude for each zip code.\n\n3.  **Find\
      \ the location of 11419, NY:**\n    *   This zip code is for Jamaica, Queens,\
      \ New York City.\n    *   New York City is on the East Coast of the United United\
      \ States.\n    *   Its approximate longitude is around **-73.8\xB0 W**.\n\n\
      4.  **Find the location of 47834, IN:**\n    *   This zip code is for Brazil,\
      \ Indiana.\n    *   Indiana is in the Midwest of the United States.\n    * \
      \  Its approximate longitude is around **-87.1\xB0 W**.\n\n5.  **Compare the\
      \ longitudes:**\n    *   11419, NY: -73.8\xB0 W\n    *   47834, IN: -87.1\xB0\
      \ W\n\n6.  **Interpret longitude for east/west:**\n    *   On a map, as you\
      \ move *east*, the longitude values become *less negative* (or more positive\
      \ if you cross the Prime Meridian, but we're staying in the Western Hemisphere).\n\
      \    *   -73.8\xB0 is a *less negative* number than -87.1\xB0.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\
      \ Since -73.8\xB0 W is to the east of -87.1\xB0 W, 11419, NY is located east\
      \ of 47834, IN.\n\n**YES**"

      answer.


      **Step 1: Understand what "east" means in this context.**

      When comparing two locations, "east" means the location is to the right of the
      other on a standard map, indicating a higher longitude (closer to the Prime
      Meridian from the perspective of the US).


      **Step 2: Find the approximate longitude of 39367, MS.**

      Searching for "39367, MS" reveals it''s Quitman, Mississippi. Its approximate
      longitude is around **-88.7 degrees West**.


      **Step 3: Find the approximate longitude of 75150, TX.**

      Searching for "75150, TX" reveals it''s Palmer, Texas. Its approximate longitude
      is around **-96.5 degrees West**.


      **Step 4: Compare the longitudes.**

      *   -88.7 degrees West (MS)

      *   -96.5 degrees West (TX)


      On a number line, -88.7 is to the right of -96.5. This means -88.7 degrees West
      is geographically further east than -96.5 degrees West.


      Therefore, Quitman, MS (39367) is located east of Palmer, TX (75150).
