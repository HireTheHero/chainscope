      \ 1: Identify the locations of the ZIP codes.**\n\n- ZIP code 21220 is in Maryland,\
      \ specifically in the Middle River area near Baltimore.\n- ZIP code 62521 is\
      \ in Illinois, specifically in the Decatur area.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the\
      \ relative geographic positions of Maryland and Illinois.**\n\n- Maryland is\
      \ located on the east coast of the United States.\n- Illinois is in the Midwest\
      \ region of the United States.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the longitudinal coordinates\
      \ (east-west positioning).**\n\n- Middle River, MD (ZIP 21220) is approximately\
      \ at longitude 76.43\xB0 W.\n- Decatur, IL (ZIP 62521) is approximately at longitude\
      \ 88.94\xB0 W.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the longitudes.**\n\n- A smaller longitude\
      \ (closer to zero or the Prime Meridian) means the location is farther east.\n\
      - 76.43\xB0 W (MD) is less than 88.94\xB0 W (IL), so 21220, MD is indeed farther\

      **Step 3: Compare longitudes.**


      - The longitude of St. Augustine, FL (32095) is approximately -81.4 degrees.

      - The longitude of Lake Charles, LA (70647) is approximately -93.2 degrees.


      Since -81.4 is east of -93.2 (i.e., closer to zero on the map), this confirms
      that 32095, FL is east of 70647, LA.

      New Jersey is located east of ZIP code 17202 in Pennsylvania, we need to follow
      a step-by-step geographic reasoning process.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the ZIP codes.


      - ZIP code 07640 is for Harrington Park, New Jersey.

      - ZIP code 17202 is for Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Understand the relative positions of New Jersey and Pennsylvania.


      - New Jersey is generally east of Pennsylvania.

      - Harrington Park is located in northeastern New Jersey, near the New York border.

      - Chambersburg is located in south-central Pennsylvania, west of Harrisburg.


      Step 3: Compare longitudes to determine "east" vs. "west".


      - Harrington Park (07640) has a longitude of approximately -73.98 degrees.

      - Chambersburg (17202) has a longitude of approximately -77.66 degrees.


      Step 4: Determine which is farther east.


      - A more negative longitude (closer to -80) means farther west.

      - A less negative longitude (closer to -70) means farther east.


      Since -73.98 (Harrington Park) is east of -77.66 (Chambersburg), ZIP code 07640
      is indeed east of 17202.

      of 61611, IL, we need to analyze their geographical locations.


      **Step 1: Identify the locations of the ZIP codes.**


      - **18240** is a ZIP code in Pennsylvania. Specifically, it is located in Lansford,
      PA, which is in eastern Pennsylvania.

      - **61611** is a ZIP code in Illinois. It is located in East Peoria, IL, which
      is in central Illinois.


      **Step 2: Consider the relative positions of Pennsylvania and Illinois.**


      - Pennsylvania is located to the east of Illinois in the United States.

      - Eastern Pennsylvania (where Lansford is located) is significantly further
      east than central Illinois (where East Peoria is located).


      **Step 3: Confirm with longitude (optional but useful for precision).**


      - Lansford, PA (18240) is approximately at longitude **-75.9** degrees.

      - East Peoria, IL (61611) is approximately at longitude **-89.5** degrees.


      Since -75.9 is east of -89.5 (remember: the more negative the longitude, the
      further west), Lansford, PA is indeed east of East Peoria, IL.


      **Final Answer: YES**.'

      \ geographic locations step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the location of ZIP\
      \ code 85621**\n- ZIP code 85621 is located in southern Arizona. \n- It corresponds\
      \ to the city of Nogales, AZ, which is on the US-Mexico border.\n\n**Step 2:\
      \ Identify the location of ZIP code 79838**\n- ZIP code 79838 is located in\
      \ western Texas.\n- It corresponds to the area of Fort Hancock, TX, which is\
      \ also close to the US-Mexico border and east of El Paso.\n\n**Step 3: Compare\
      \ Longitudes**\n- Nogales, AZ (85621) is approximately at longitude 110.9\xB0\
      W.\n- Fort Hancock, TX (79838) is approximately at longitude 105.9\xB0W.\n\n\
      **Step 4: Reasoning**\n- In the Western Hemisphere, a smaller (less negative)\
      \ longitude means a location is farther east.\n- Since 105.9\xB0W (Fort Hancock)\
      \ is less negative than 110.9\xB0W (Nogales), Fort Hancock is east of Nogales.\n\
      \n**Conclusion:**\nYES, 79838, TX is located east of 85621, AZ."

      - ZIP code 46222 corresponds to Indianapolis, Indiana.


      Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of the two locations.

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - Since New Jersey is on the East Coast and Indiana is farther west, ZIP code
      08221 (NJ) is east of ZIP code 46222 (IN).


      Final answer: YES.'

      - Ohio is located to the east of Illinois in the United States. Therefore, in
      general, most places in Ohio will be east of most places in Illinois.


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      - Peoria, IL (61614) is in central Illinois.

      - Miamisburg, OH (45342) is in southwestern Ohio, near the western edge of the
      state, but still east of central Illinois.


      Step 4: Confirm with longitude coordinates (optional but helpful).

      - Peoria, IL (61614) is approximately at longitude -89.62.

      - Miamisburg, OH (45342) is approximately at longitude -84.28.
