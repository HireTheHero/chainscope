    355de0c7-3918-433b-b277-172056e4dbdb: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate 10927 (NY) on a map

      - This zip code is in New York state

      - Specifically, it''s in Rockland County, which is in southeastern New York

      - This is in the eastern part of the United States


      2. Next, locate 46016 (IN) on a map

      - This zip code is in Indiana state

      - Specifically, it''s in Hamilton County, near Indianapolis

      - This is in the midwestern part of the United States


      3. Compare their relative positions

      - New York is east of Indiana

      - So a zip code in New York will be east of a zip code in Indiana


      4. Therefore, 10927 (NY) is indeed east of 46016 (IN)
