      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 70712 is in Louisiana (LA)

      - 77388 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Louisiana and Texas.

      - Louisiana is located directly east of Texas on the US map.

      - Texas shares its eastern border with Louisiana.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - Zip codes in the US generally follow patterns where lower numbers tend to
      be in the eastern parts of the country.

      - 70712 (in LA) has a lower number than 77388 (in TX).

      - However, this general pattern isn''t reliable for comparing zip codes across
      state boundaries.


      Step 4: The definitive factor is the state locations.

      - Since 70712 is in Louisiana, and Louisiana is east of Texas, then 70712 must
      be east of any location in Texas, including 77388.


      NO

      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - Louisiana is located directly east of Texas on the US map.

      - Texas borders Louisiana on Louisiana''s western border.


      Step 3: Looking more specifically at the zip codes:

      - 70712 is in Louisiana, which must be somewhere within the state

      - 77388 is in Texas, which must be somewhere within Texas


      Step 4: Since any point in Louisiana is east of most points in Texas (with some
      possible exceptions for the easternmost parts of Texas compared to the westernmost
      parts of Louisiana), I need to check if these specific zip codes maintain that
      general east-west relationship.


      Step 5: Zip code 70712 is in the central-western part of Louisiana, while 77388
      is in the southeastern part of Texas (Spring, TX, near Houston). Even though
      77388 is in eastern Texas, it''s still west of Louisiana locations.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 29405 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)

      - 30354 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of South Carolina and Georgia.

      - South Carolina is located on the Atlantic coast

      - Georgia is also on the Atlantic coast, but positioned southwest of South Carolina


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code numbers.

      - In the US postal system, zip codes generally follow geographic patterns

      - Lower zip code numbers in this region tend to be more eastern/northeastern

      - 29405 (SC) has a lower number than 30354 (GA)


      Step 4: Verify the specific locations.

      - 29405 is in the Charleston area of South Carolina, on the Atlantic coast

      - 30354 is in the Atlanta area of Georgia, which is inland and west of Charleston


      Since Charleston, SC (29405) is on the Atlantic coast and Atlanta, GA (30354)
      is inland, and South Carolina is generally east of Georgia, the zip code 29405
      in SC is indeed east of zip code 30354 in GA.

      if 01719, MA is east of 49009, MI.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 01719 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 49009 is a zip code in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic locations of these states.

      - Massachusetts is located on the east coast of the United States

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on a west-to-east axis.

      - Massachusetts is significantly further east than Michigan

      - Any location in Massachusetts would be east of any location in Michigan


      Step 4: Verify with knowledge of US geography.

      - Moving from Michigan to Massachusetts requires traveling eastward

      - Massachusetts borders the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side

      - Michigan is west of Massachusetts by several hundred miles


      Therefore, 01719, MA (which is in Massachusetts) is located east of 49009, MI
      (which is in Michigan).

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 53209 is a ZIP code in Wisconsin (WI)

      - 55904 is a ZIP code in Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Wisconsin and Minnesota.

      - Minnesota is located directly west of Wisconsin

      - Wisconsin borders Minnesota on Minnesota''s eastern side


      Step 3: Consider the specific ZIP codes.

      - Since 53209 is in Wisconsin and 55904 is in Minnesota, and Wisconsin is east
      of Minnesota, it follows that 53209, WI would be east of 55904, MN.


      Step 4: Confirm the general pattern of ZIP codes.

      - The first three digits of ZIP codes generally follow a pattern from east to
      west (lower numbers in the east, higher in the west)

      - 532xx (Wisconsin) is a lower number than 559xx (Minnesota), which supports
      the conclusion


      YES, 53209, WI is located east of 55904, MN.'

      Step 2: Consider the relative geographic positions of Wisconsin and Minnesota.

      - Wisconsin is located east of Minnesota in the United States.


      Step 3: To verify more specifically, let me check these particular zip codes:

      - 53209 is in the Milwaukee area of Wisconsin, which is in the eastern part
      of Wisconsin

      - 55904 is in Rochester, Minnesota, which is in the southeastern part of Minnesota

      Step 2: Determine the general geographic relationship between Wisconsin and
      Minnesota.

      - Wisconsin is located east of Minnesota (Minnesota borders Wisconsin on Wisconsin''s
      western side)


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes within their states.

      - 53209 is in Milwaukee County in the eastern part of Wisconsin

      - 55904 is in Rochester, Minnesota, in the southeastern part of Minnesota


      Step 4: Even though these are specific zip codes that might not follow the general
      state relationship perfectly, Milwaukee (53209) is in eastern Wisconsin while
      Rochester (55904) is in southeastern Minnesota. Since Wisconsin as a whole is
      east of Minnesota, and these zip codes don''t reverse this relationship, the
      Wisconsin zip code would be east of the Minnesota one.


      NO

      - 53209 is in the Milwaukee area of Wisconsin (eastern Wisconsin)

      - 55904 is in the Rochester area of Minnesota (southeastern Minnesota)


      Step 4: Even though both are in the southeastern portions of their respective
      states, the state boundary relationship means that Wisconsin locations (including
      53209) will be east of Minnesota locations (including 55904).


      YES, 53209, WI is located east of 55904, MN.'

      east of 62204, IL. Let me think step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 20121 is a ZIP code in Virginia (VA)

      - 62204 is a ZIP code in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Virginia is located on the eastern coast of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - States on the eastern coast (like Virginia) are east of Midwestern states
      (like Illinois)

      - Virginia is significantly east of Illinois on a map of the United States


      Step 4: Make a conclusion about the specific ZIP codes.

      - Since 20121 is in Virginia and 62204 is in Illinois, and Virginia is east
      of Illinois, it follows that 20121, VA is east of 62204, IL

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Missouri and Kansas.

      - Missouri is located directly east of Kansas in the United States.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code patterns.

      - In the US postal system, zip codes generally increase from east to west.

      - 63670 (Missouri) has a lower number than 67218 (Kansas).

      - This lower number is consistent with Missouri being east of Kansas.


      Step 4: Confirm with the state locations.

      - Since 63670 is in Missouri, and Missouri is east of Kansas where 67218 is
      located, the zip code 63670 must be east of 67218.

      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Missouri and Kansas.

      - Missouri is located directly east of Kansas in the United States.


      Step 3: Look at the zip code patterns.

      - US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to be in
      the eastern parts of the country, while higher numbers tend to be in the western
      parts.

      - 63670 (Missouri) has a lower number than 67218 (Kansas), which is consistent

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Missouri is located directly east of Kansas in the United States.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code patterns.

      In the US zip code system, codes generally increase as you move west to east
      across the country. The first digit indicates a broad region, with lower numbers
      typically representing eastern areas and higher numbers representing western
      areas.


      Step 4: Compare the zip codes.

      - 63670 (Missouri) starts with "6"

      - 67218 (Kansas) also starts with "6" but has a higher second digit (7 vs 3)


      Since Missouri is east of Kansas geographically, and the zip code in Missouri
      (63670) has a lower number than the zip code in Kansas (67218), both factors

      - Texas is located east of New Mexico in the United States.

      - New Mexico borders Texas on Texas''s western side.


      Step 3: Consider the ZIP code patterns.

      - Generally, ZIP codes increase as you move west to east across the US.

      - 75604 (TX) has a lower number than 88048 (NM).

      - However, ZIP codes are not perfectly aligned with longitude, as they''re organized
      by postal regions.


      Step 4: Verify the specific locations.

      - 75604 is in the eastern part of Texas (Longview area).

      - 88048 is in the southern part of New Mexico (near the Mexico border).

      - Regardless of the specific locations within their states, any location in
      Texas will be east of any location in New Mexico because Texas is entirely east
      of New Mexico.


      NO.

      - 75604 appears to be in eastern Texas (based on the "756" prefix which typically
      indicates East Texas)

      - 88048 is in New Mexico, and the "880" prefix suggests southern New Mexico


      Step 4: Compare the longitudinal positions.

      - Any location in eastern Texas would be east of any location in New Mexico

      - Texas borders New Mexico on New Mexico''s eastern side


      Since 75604 is in Texas (which is east of New Mexico), and specifically in eastern

      Even though 28457 is in western North Carolina, North Carolina as a whole is
      still east of Alabama. Any point in North Carolina will be east of any point
      in Alabama due to their relative positions on the US map.


      NO


      Wait, I need to be more careful here. Let me reconsider:


      While North Carolina is generally east of Alabama, I need to verify the specific
      locations of these zip codes. Looking at the geographic arrangement, even the
      westernmost parts of North Carolina are still east of the easternmost parts
      of Alabama. The Appalachian Mountains run through western NC, but Alabama is
      entirely west of this range.


      YES'
    59109d35-5cd9-4458-9ea8-6c9f92459659: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: First, I need to determine where these zip codes are located.

      - 28457 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 35954 is in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: Now I need to determine their relative positions on a map of the United
      States.

      - North Carolina is on the eastern coast of the United States

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States, but west of North Carolina


      Step 3: Looking at the geography of these states:

      - Alabama borders the Gulf of Mexico to the south

      - North Carolina borders the Atlantic Ocean to the east

      - Alabama is positioned to the west of North Carolina


      Step 4: Since any location in North Carolina would be east of any location in
      Alabama (as North Carolina is entirely east of Alabama on the US map), zip code
      28457 in NC must be east of zip code 35954 in AL.


      NO


      Wait, I made an error in my conclusion. Let me correct that:


      YES, 28457, NC is located east of 35954, AL.'

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 28457 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 35954 is in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: I need to determine their relative east-west positions. In the US, states
      generally follow this pattern:

      - Alabama is in the southeastern US

      - North Carolina is on the east coast


      Step 3: Looking at a mental map of the US, North Carolina is positioned to the
      east of Alabama. Alabama borders the Gulf of Mexico, while North Carolina borders
      the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 4: While specific zip codes within states could potentially change this
      relationship, the states themselves are far enough apart that any zip code in
      North Carolina would be east of any zip code in Alabama.


      NO - wait, I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me verify this more carefully.


      North Carolina is indeed east of Alabama. Alabama is positioned in the deep
      south, while North Carolina is on the Atlantic coast, several states to the
      east.


      So the correct answer is:


      YES, 28457, NC is located east of 35954, AL.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 19363 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 26330 is a zip code in West Virginia (WV)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Pennsylvania and West Virginia.

      - Pennsylvania is located east of West Virginia in the United States.


      Step 3: Consider more specifically where these zip codes are located.

      - Zip code 19363 appears to be in southeastern Pennsylvania (near the Maryland
      border)

      - Zip code 26330 is in northern West Virginia


      Step 4: Apply the general geographic relationship.

      - Since Pennsylvania is east of West Virginia, and these zip codes follow the
      general geographic arrangement of their states, 19363 PA would be east of 26330
      WV.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 19363 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 26330 is a zip code in West Virginia (WV)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Pennsylvania and West
      Virginia.

      - Pennsylvania is located east of West Virginia (PA borders WV on WV''s eastern
      side)


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      - Lower zip code numbers in the first three digits generally indicate more eastern
      locations

      - 193xx (for PA) is a lower number than 263xx (for WV)

      - This confirms the general east-west relationship, as eastern states typically
      have lower zip codes


      Step 4: Verify specific locations.

      - 19363 is in southeastern Pennsylvania (Oxford area)

      - 26330 is in northern West Virginia

      - Any location in Pennsylvania would be east of northern West Virginia


      Based on this analysis, 19363, PA is indeed located east of 26330, WV.


      NO

      - 62207 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Kentucky is in the East South Central region of the United States

      - Kentucky is generally located east of Illinois


      Step 3: To be more precise, let me consider the specific zip codes.

      - 40219 is in Louisville, Kentucky (in the northern part of Kentucky)

      - 62207 is in East St. Louis, Illinois (in the southwestern part of Illinois)


      Step 4: Verify the relative positions.

      - Even though these are specific locations within their states, the general
      geographic relationship holds: Louisville, KY (40219) is east of East St. Louis,
      IL (62207)

      - Both are along the Ohio River valley, but Kentucky''s position is eastward
      of Illinois


      NO

      - Missouri is in the central/western part of the Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Ohio is located east of Missouri on the US map

      - 28512 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 29067 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of North Carolina and South Carolina.

      - North Carolina is located north of South Carolina

      - Both states are on the Atlantic coast

      - Their state boundary runs roughly east-west


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      - In the US postal system, zip codes generally increase from east to west

      - Lower zip codes tend to be more eastern than higher zip codes in the same
      region


      Step 4: Compare the zip codes.

      - 28512 (NC) has a lower number than 29067 (SC)

      - North Carolina and South Carolina are both on the East Coast

      - North Carolina is generally located north of South Carolina

      - Both states extend from the Appalachian Mountains in the west to the Atlantic
      Ocean in the east


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      - In the US postal system, zip codes generally increase from east to west

      - Both states have an Atlantic coastline

      - North Carolina is generally north of South Carolina

      - For eastern locations, being in NC vs SC doesn''t automatically determine
      east-west positioning


      Step 4: Analyze the specific zip codes.

      - Lower first digits in US zip codes generally (but not always) indicate more
      eastern locations

      - 28512 (NC) has a lower first digit than 29067 (SC)

      Step 2: Understand US zip code geography.

      US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the eastern
      parts of the country, with the first digit representing broad regions (0-1 for
      Northeast, 2-3 for Southeast, etc.)


      Step 3: Compare the specific zip codes.

      - 28512 starts with "285" (part of North Carolina)

      - 29067 starts with "290" (part of South Carolina)


      Step 4: Analyze the geographic relationship.

      Within the Southeast region (where both states are located), North Carolina
      is generally north of South Carolina, not east of it. However, the critical
      point is that lower zip codes in this region tend to be further east.


      Since 28512 has a lower number than 29067, and both are in the Southeast region

      - ZIP codes in the 285xx range are in eastern North Carolina

      - ZIP codes in the 290xx range are in central/eastern South Carolina


      Step 3: Consider the geography of the Carolinas.

      - North Carolina and South Carolina share a border running roughly east-west

      - The Atlantic coastline runs along the eastern edge of both states

      - Generally, lower ZIP code numbers in these states tend to be more eastern


      Step 4: Specifically locate these ZIP codes.

      Carolina

      - 29067 corresponds to Lynchburg, SC, which is in the inland part of eastern

      - 85396 is a ZIP code in Arizona (AZ)

      - 91780 is a ZIP code in California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Arizona is located east of California in the United States.

      - California is on the west coast, while Arizona is inland to the east of California.


      Step 3: Verify that these specific ZIP codes follow the general state positioning.

      - ZIP codes beginning with 853-857 are generally in the Phoenix metropolitan
      area of Arizona.

      - ZIP codes beginning with 917-918 are generally in the Los Angeles area of
      California.

      - These areas maintain the same general east-west relationship as their states.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on the geographical positions.

      - Since Arizona is east of California, and these specific ZIP codes are in their

      Step 3: Check if this general state relationship applies to these specific ZIP
      codes.

      - In the US ZIP code system, the first digit generally indicates a geographic
      region moving from east (lower numbers) to west (higher numbers)

      - 85396 starts with 8, which is for Arizona and some western states

      - 91780 starts with 9, which is typically for California and other west coast
      areas

      - The fact that the Arizona ZIP starts with a lower number than the California
      ZIP is consistent with Arizona being east of California


      Step 4: Confirm based on the states'' relative positions.

      - Since Arizona as a state is east of California, and these ZIP codes are in
      their respective states, 85396 in AZ would be east of 91780 in CA


      NO, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me correct myself:


      The first digits of ZIP codes don''t reliably indicate east-west positioning

      3) In the United States, states are arranged with Arizona in the southwest and
      Texas to the east of Arizona.


      4) Texas is generally east of Arizona on a map of the United States.


      5) Since 79838 is in Texas and 85621 is in Arizona, and Texas is east of Arizona,

      - 85621 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Arizona borders California to its west and New Mexico to its east

      - Texas is east of New Mexico

      - This means Texas is east of Arizona in the United States


      Step 4: Since the zip codes are in their respective states, the relative positioning

      Step 1: Let me identify what these zip codes represent.

      - 79838 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      - 85621 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic locations of Texas and Arizona.

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Generally, Texas is east of Arizona


      Step 3: To be more precise, let me think about the specific locations of these
      zip codes.

      - 79838 appears to be in western Texas (based on the zip code pattern)

      - 85621 appears to be in southern Arizona (based on the zip code pattern)


      Step 4: Even though 79838 is in western Texas, Texas as a whole is east of Arizona.
      Any location in Texas, including its westernmost parts, would be east of locations
      in Arizona.


      NO


      Wait, I need to be more careful. Let me reconsider:


      Step 4 (revised): The question is about specific zip codes, not the states as
      a whole. Western Texas is indeed east of Arizona, including southern Arizona
      where 85621 is located.


      YES'

      2) In the US, zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in
      the eastern parts of the country and higher numbers are in the western parts.


      3) 79838 (TX) has a lower zip code number than 85621 (AZ), which suggests 79838
      is more eastern.


      4) More definitively, Texas is located east of Arizona in the United States.
      The entire state of Texas is east of the entire state of Arizona.


      5) Therefore, any location in Texas (including 79838) would be east of any location
      in Arizona (including 85621).


      NO.


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me correct:


      Texas is indeed east of Arizona, so a Texas zip code would be east of an Arizona
      zip code. The correct answer is:

      Step 2: Recall the general geography of Washington and Oregon.

      - Washington is north of Oregon

      - Both states are on the west coast, with the Pacific Ocean to their west


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      - In the US postal system, zip codes generally increase as you move from east

      Step 3: Analyze the specific zip codes.

      - Washington zip codes generally start with 98 and 99

      - Oregon zip codes generally start with 97

      - Within each state, lower zip code numbers tend to be in western areas, while
      higher numbers tend to be in eastern areas

      1. California is located on the west coast of the United States

      2. Utah is located inland, to the east of California

      3. All of Utah is east of all of California geographically


      Since 84010 is in Utah and 95503 is in California, and Utah is entirely east

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      - 32579 is a zip code in Florida (FL)

      - 77362 is a zip code in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern part of the United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States

      - Generally, Florida is east of Texas


      Step 3: To be more precise, let''s think about the specific locations.

      - Florida zip codes beginning with 32 are typically in the northern part of
      Florida

      - Texas zip codes beginning with 77 are typically in the eastern part of Texas


      Step 4: Even though these are specific areas within their respective states,
      the entire state of Florida is east of the entire state of Texas. The easternmost
      part of Texas is still west of the westernmost part of Florida.


      Therefore, 32579, FL is east of 77362, TX.

      - 32579 is in Florida (FL)

      - 77362 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the relative geographical positions of Florida and Texas.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - On a map of the US, Florida is positioned to the east of Texas


      Step 3: Since zip codes within each state follow geographical patterns, and
      Florida as a whole is east of Texas, a zip code in Florida (32579) would be
      east of a zip code in Texas (77362).


      NO.


      Wait, I need to reconsider. Florida is definitely east of Texas on the US map.

      - 72114 is in Arkansas (AR)

      - 73025 is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      Arkansas is located to the east of Oklahoma. The two states share a border,
      with Oklahoma to the west and Arkansas to the east.


      Step 3: Check if this general state relationship applies to these specific zip
      codes.

      Since 72114 is in Arkansas and 73025 is in Oklahoma, and Arkansas is east of
      Oklahoma, it follows that 72114, AR would be east of 73025, OK.


      Step 4: Verify that these zip codes don''t have unusual locations that would
      contradict the general state relationship.

      The zip code 72114 appears to be in the central part of Arkansas (likely near
      Little Rock), while 73025 appears to be in central Oklahoma. This maintains
      the east-west relationship between the states.


      NO additional information contradicts the standard geographical relationship
      between these states.

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 72114 is in Arkansas (AR)

      - 73025 is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Arkansas and Oklahoma.

      - Arkansas is located directly east of Oklahoma in the United States.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - 72114 is in Arkansas, which is in central Arkansas (Little Rock area)

      - 73025 is in Oklahoma, likely in the central part of Oklahoma


      Step 4: Apply the general geographic relationship.

      - Since Arkansas is east of Oklahoma, and these zip codes appear to be in standard
      locations within their respective states, 72114, AR would be east of 73025,
      OK.


      Step 5: Make a conclusion based on the geographic positions.


      YES, 72114, AR is located east of 73025, OK.'

      - 10993 (NY) would be in New York state

      - 15062 (PA) would be in Pennsylvania state

      - Since New York is east of Pennsylvania, and these zip codes are in their respective

      - 48219 is a zip code in Michigan (MI)

      - 68152 is a zip code in Nebraska (NE)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states in the United States.

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, in the eastern half
      of the continental US

      - Nebraska is located in the Great Plains region, in the central part of the
      continental US


      Step 3: Compare the relative east-west positions.

      - States further east have lower longitude numbers

      - Michigan is significantly east of Nebraska on the US map

      - All of Michigan is east of all of Nebraska


      Step 4: Since zip code 48219 is in Michigan and zip code 68152 is in Nebraska,
