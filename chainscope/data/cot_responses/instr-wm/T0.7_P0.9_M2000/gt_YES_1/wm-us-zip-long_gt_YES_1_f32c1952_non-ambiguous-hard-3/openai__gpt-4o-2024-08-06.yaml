    022cc99a-abe5-4692-856e-1629ae23fd4c: 'To determine if zip code 21220 (Middle
      River, Maryland) is located east of zip code 62521 (Decatur, Illinois), we need
      to compare their longitudinal coordinates.


      1. Understand that longitude lines run north-south and measure how far east
      or west a location is from the Prime Meridian, which is at 0 degrees longitude.


      2. Zip code 21220 is in Middle River, Maryland. Maryland is located on the eastern
      side of the United States, generally having longitudes around 75-79 degrees
      west.


      3. Zip code 62521 is in Decatur, Illinois. Illinois is located more centrally
      in the United States, with longitudes typically around 87-91 degrees west.


      4. Since Maryland''s longitudes (75-79 degrees west) are east of Illinois''
      longitudes (87-91 degrees west), zip code 21220 in Maryland is indeed located
      east of zip code 62521 in Illinois.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
