      2. **Zip code 37341** corresponds to an area in the southeastern part of Tennessee,
      specifically in the region of Dayton.


      Next, we need to look at the general geographic layout of these two states:


      - North Carolina is located to the east of Tennessee.

      - Durham, NC (27705) is positioned toward the eastern part of North Carolina.

      - Dayton, TN (37341) is located in the eastern portion of Tennessee, but still

      in the area of American Fork, which is situated in the central part of the state.


      2. **Location of 95503, CA**: This zip code is in the state of California, specifically
      in the area of Arcata, which is located in the northwestern part of California.


      3. **Geographical Orientation**: To determine if one location is east of the
      other, we need to look at their relative positions on a map. Utah is generally
      east of California, but within California, the northwestern part (where Arcata
      is located) is west of many parts of Utah.


      4. **Comparison**: American Fork, UT (84010) is located east of Arcata, CA (95503)
      when considering the east-west orientation across states.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:


      **YES**.'

      Massachusetts. Massachusetts is located in the northeastern part of the United
      States.


      2. **Locate 48085, MI**: The zip code 48085 corresponds to the area of Troy,
      Michigan. Michigan is located in the Great Lakes region, to the northwest of
      Massachusetts.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: To find out if Lunenburg, MA (01430)
      is east of Troy, MI (48085), we need to consider the positions of Massachusetts
      and Michigan on a map. Massachusetts is generally east of Michigan.
