      than the PA zip code, this further reinforces the eastward position of the CT

      is east of Ohio.


      3. **Consider the possibility of exceptions:** While Pennsylvania is generally
      east of Ohio, the specific zip codes could be close to the border, making the
      eastern zip code in PA actually west of the western zip code in OH.  However,
      19043 (Huntingdon Valley, PA, a suburb of Philadelphia) is significantly further
      east than the border, and 45371 (West Milton, OH) is not particularly close
      to the eastern edge of Ohio.


      4. **Conclusion:**  Given the significant east/west distance between the states
      and the locations of the specific zip codes within their respective states,
      19043, PA is almost certainly east of 45371, OH.

      zip codes increase from west to east within a state.  We need to be careful
      not just to assume because NJ is east of PA that every NJ zip code is east of
      every PA zip code.

      3. **No need for precise coordinates:** Since NJ is considerably further east
      than PA, it is highly likely that even the westernmost NJ zip codes are still
      east of eastern PA zip codes. The difference in longitude between the states
      is large enough that the specific zip codes within the states are less relevant.

      Carolina (SC).


      2. **Consider the zip codes within the states:**  Lower zip codes tend to be
      in the western part of a state, and higher zip codes in the eastern part. 28512
      in NC is a lower zip code for NC, suggesting it''s in the western part of the
      state. 29067 is a relatively low zip code for SC, suggesting it is in the western
