      1.  **Locate Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Nagasaki:** This cathedral is
      in Nagasaki, Japan.

      2.  **Locate Rochor Centre:** Rochor Centre was a building complex in Singapore
      (it has since been demolished, but its location is known).

      \    *   Ayuntamiento de Manila is in Southeast Asia.\n    *   The prominent\
      \ Villa Rothschilds are in Europe.\n\n4.  **Determine the relative latitudinal\
      \ positions:**\n    *   Europe is located significantly north of Southeast Asia\
      \ on the globe.\n    *   For instance, Manila is roughly at 14\xB0 N latitude.\
      \ Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat (France) is roughly at 43\xB0 N latitude.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n\
      \    *   Since the European locations of the Villa Rothschilds have a much higher\
