      1. **Identify the location of Cuartel de Santa Lucia**: This is a historical
      military barracks located within Intramuros, Manila, Philippines. It''s situated
      along Muralla Street, near other landmarks like Fort Santiago.


      2. **Identify the location of St. Martha Catholic Church**: There are several

      of being compared with Cuartel de Santa Lucia, we''re likely referring to the
      one within or near the same area, possibly in the Philippines.


      3. **Check for proximity and relative location**: There is no well-known St.
      Martha Catholic Church located within the Intramuros area or immediately north
      of Cuartel de Santa Lucia. In fact, St. Martha Catholic Church is more commonly
      associated with locations outside of Intramuros, such as in Bulacan or other

      4. **Conclusion based on available geographic data**: If the church is not within
      the same district or is located in an area that is not directly north of Cuartel

      latitudinal coordinates or use a map to see which is further north.


      From available information and mapping, there is no St. Martha Catholic Church
      located immediately north of Cuartel de Santa Lucia in Intramuros or even within
      close proximity. This suggests the church is not located north of it.
