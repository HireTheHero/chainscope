      1. **Location of Arfa Software Technology Park**: Arfa Software Technology Park
      is located in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan.


      2. **Location of Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim**: The Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim
      is located in Seoul, South Korea.


      3. **Comparing Locations**: Lahore, Pakistan, where Arfa Software Technology
      Park is located, is in the northern part of Pakistan. Seoul, South Korea, where
      the Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim is located, is in the northern part of South
      Korea. Pakistan and South Korea are in different regions of the world, so we
      need to consider their positions relative to each other.


      4. **Global Positioning**: Pakistan is generally located to the west of South
      Korea. Therefore, if we consider the geographical positions of Lahore (Pakistan)
      and Seoul (South Korea), Seoul is located to the east of Lahore.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the global positioning of Pakistan and South Korea,
      and the locations of Arfa Software Technology Park (Lahore, Pakistan) and the
      Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim (Seoul, South Korea), Arfa Software Technology Park
      is not located north of the Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Arfa Software Technology Park is located north
      of the Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim is: **NO**'

      down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Tower Gateway DLR station is located in London,
      United Kingdom. St. Mary''s in the Mountains Catholic Church is located in Virginia
      City, Nevada, United States.


      2. **Consider geographical context**: Given that these two locations are in
      different countries, we need to consider their general geographical positions
      relative to each other.


      3. **Specific location comparison**: Without needing the exact coordinates,
      we can infer based on the countries and general geography that Tower Gateway
      DLR station, being in the United Kingdom, would be north of St. Mary''s in the

      1. **Location of Turnham Green tube station**: Turnham Green tube station is
      located in London, United Kingdom. London is situated in the southern part of
      the UK.


      2. **Location of Mirani Dam**: Mirani Dam is located in Sindh, Pakistan. Pakistan

      plant located in the municipality of Calatagan, in the province of Batangas,
      Philippines.


      3. **Comparing Locations**: Carrapatelo Dam is in Portugal, which is in the
      northern hemisphere. Calatagan Solar Farm is in the Philippines, which is also
      in the northern hemisphere but further south than Portugal.


      Given these steps, we can conclude that since Portugal (where Carrapatelo Dam

      Power Station is located north of Windy Hill Wind Farm, let''s follow these
      steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Kindaruma Hydroelectric Power Station is located
      in Kenya, Africa. Windy Hill Wind Farm is located in Victoria, Australia.


      2. **Consider geographical context**: Kenya is located in the eastern part of
      Africa, while Victoria is a state in the southeastern part of Australia.


      3. **Specific location comparison**: Without needing the exact coordinates,
      we can infer based on the continents and general geography that Kenya, being
      in the northern hemisphere, is generally north of Australia, which is in the
      southern hemisphere.

      located north of the Lensic Theater, we need to establish the locations of both
      and then compare their geographical positions.


      1. **Location of 40 Leadenhall Street**: 40 Leadenhall Street is a building
      in London, England, United Kingdom. London is located in the southeastern part
      of England.


      2. **Location of Lensic Theater**: The Lensic Theater is located in Santa Fe,
