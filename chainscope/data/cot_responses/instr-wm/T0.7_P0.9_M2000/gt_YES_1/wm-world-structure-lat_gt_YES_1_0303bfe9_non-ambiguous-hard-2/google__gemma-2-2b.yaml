      southern region. It is a large freshwater lake that is popular for fishing and
      boating.


      3. Compare the locations of the two structures.

      Vlasina Lake is located in the south of Serbia, in the country''s central region.


      4. Based on the comparison, determine if St Mary''s Church is located north

      Based on the comparison, it can be concluded that St Mary''s Church is located
      south of Vlasina Lake.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is NO. St Mary''s Church is located south
