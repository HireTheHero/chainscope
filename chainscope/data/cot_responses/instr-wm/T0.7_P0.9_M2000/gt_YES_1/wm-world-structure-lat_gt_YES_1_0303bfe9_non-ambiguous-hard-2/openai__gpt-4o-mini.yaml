      we can determine that London is generally east and slightly north of Kentucky.


      4. **Establish the north-south relationship**: Since Tooting Broadway is in
      London and Buckhorn Lake is in Kentucky, Tooting Broadway cannot be north of
      Buckhorn Lake because it is positioned to the east.


      Thus, the answer to the question is:

      of Skaill House and 333 North Michigan. Skaill House is situated in the northern
      part of the UK, while 333 North Michigan is in the central part of the United
      States.


      4. **North/South Orientation**: Given that Skaill House is in Scotland (which
      is much further north than Chicago), it is indeed located north of Chicago.


      Thus, after considering the geographical locations of both structures, we can
      conclude:


      **YES**, Skaill House is located north of 333 North Michigan.'

      2. **Location of St. Stephen''s Cathedral, Passau**: Passau is a city located
      in Bavaria, Germany, near the confluence of the Danube, Inn, and Ilz rivers.


      Now, if we look at a map of Europe:


      - Oban is situated in the northern part of the UK.

      - Passau is located further south in Germany.


      By analyzing their latitudinal positions:


      - Oban (St John''s Cathedral) is indeed north of Passau (St. Stephen''s Cathedral).

      2. **Locate Windy Hill Wind Farm**: The Windy Hill Wind Farm is located in the
      United States, in the state of California.


      3. **Determine Relative Positions**: Since the Kindaruma Hydroelectric Power
      Station is in Kenya and the Windy Hill Wind Farm is in California, we are comparing
      two locations on opposite sides of the globe.


      4. **Assess North-South Orientation**: Given that Kenya is situated in East
      Africa and California is on the west coast of the United States, it is clear
      that they are not in the same geographic region. Thus, we cannot directly compare
      the north-south positioning in a meaningful way.


      Based on this analysis, we conclude that the question of whether the Kindaruma
      Hydroelectric Power Station is north of the Windy Hill Wind Farm is not applicable
      since they are located in entirely different countries.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.'
