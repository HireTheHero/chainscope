      need to identify the locations of both places and compare their relative positions.


      1. **Location of Barker Meadow Reservoir**: Barker Meadow Reservoir is located
      in Colorado, United States. It is part of the water supply system for the city
      of Boulder.


      2. **Location of Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall**: This

      USA.


      Now, we need to compare the latitudes of these two locations:


      - The latitude of Skaill House in the Orkney Islands is approximately 59 degrees
      north.

      - The latitude of Chicago, where 333 North Michigan is located, is approximately
      41.9 degrees north.


      Since 59 degrees north (Skaill House) is greater than 41.9 degrees north (333
      North Michigan), Skaill House is indeed located north of 333 North Michigan.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'
