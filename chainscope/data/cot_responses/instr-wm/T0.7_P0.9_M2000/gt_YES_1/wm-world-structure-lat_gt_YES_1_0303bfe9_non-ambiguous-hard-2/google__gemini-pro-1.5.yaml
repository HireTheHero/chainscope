      NO.  The question asks if East Brixton station is *north* of the O''Reilly Theater.
      While London is north of Dublin, the wording implies a more local comparison.
      Within the context of a single city''s geography, the question would be relevant.
      Since they are in different countries, the relative north/south position within
      their respective cities is irrelevant. Using a compass, London is north of Dublin,
      but the question''s implication is about relative position within a city.
