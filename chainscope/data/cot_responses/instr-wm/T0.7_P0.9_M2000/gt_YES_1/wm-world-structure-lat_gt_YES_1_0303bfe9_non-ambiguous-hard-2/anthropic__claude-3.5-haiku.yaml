      1. First, Turnham Green tube station is located in London, United Kingdom. Specifically,
      it is in the western part of London in the borough of Hammersmith and Fulham.


      2. Mirani Dam is located in Queensland, Australia. It is situated on the Pioneer
      River near the town of Mirani.


      3. These two locations are on completely different continents, with thousands

      5. Given that Turnham Green tube station is in the Northern Hemisphere and Mirani
      Dam is in the Southern Hemisphere, Turnham Green tube station is indeed north
      of Mirani Dam.

    e73212cb-4b21-408e-97a2-3f5afcb422d8: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll need to determine the locations of Kindaruma Hydroelectric Power
      Station and Windy Hill Wind Farm.


      2. Kindaruma Hydroelectric Power Station is located in Kenya, specifically in
      the eastern part of the country.


      3. Windy Hill Wind Farm is located in Australia, specifically in Queensland.


      4. These two locations are on different continents, with Kenya being in Africa
      and Australia being in the Southern Hemisphere.


      5. Since they are on different continents, the concept of "north of" becomes
      a global comparison.


      6. Kenya is geographically north of Australia''s latitude.


      7. Therefore, Kindaruma Hydroelectric Power Station is indeed located north
      of Windy Hill Wind Farm.
