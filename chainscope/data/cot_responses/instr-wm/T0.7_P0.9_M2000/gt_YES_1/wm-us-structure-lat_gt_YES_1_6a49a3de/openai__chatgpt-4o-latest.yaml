      \ latitudes.\n\n3. **Check Latitude of Barrow Street Theatre:**\n   - The Barrow\
      \ Street Theatre is at approximately **40.732\xB0N**.\n\n4. **Check Latitude\
      \ of Grant USA Tower, NJ:**\n   - There is no widely known \"Grant USA Tower\"\
      \ in NJ, but assuming it refers to a real location in New Jersey, its latitude\
      \ would likely depend on its specific city.\n   - If it is in Jersey City or\
      \ nearby, its latitude would be around **40.72\xB0N to 40.74\xB0N**.\n\n5. **Compare\
      \ Latitudes:**\n   - If Grant USA Tower is in Jersey City or further north in\
      \ NJ, it could be slightly north or at a similar latitude to Barrow Street Theatre.\n\
      \   - If it is further south in NJ, it would be south of Barrow Street Theatre.\n\
      \n6. **Final Answer:**\n   - Without a precise location for Grant USA Tower,\
      \ it is difficult to be definitive.\n   - However, assuming it is in Jersey\
      \ City or further north, the answer is likely **YES**."
