      \ by step. The goal is to determine whether Glenn Cunningham Lake in Nebraska\
      \ is located north of Betts House at Yale University in Connecticut. Here's\
      \ how I'll approach it:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\nFirst, I need\
      \ to clearly identify the two locations mentioned:\n- **Glenn Cunningham Lake,\
      \ Nebraska**\n- **Betts House, Yale University, Connecticut**\n\n### Step 2:\
      \ Understand the Geography\nTo determine which is further north, I need to know\
      \ the approximate latitudes of these two places. Latitude measures how far north\
      \ or south a location is from the equator.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Latitude\
      \ of Glenn Cunningham Lake, NE\nGlenn Cunningham Lake is located in Omaha, Nebraska.\
      \ Omaha is in the eastern part of Nebraska, near the border with Iowa.\n\n**Latitude\
      \ of Omaha, Nebraska:** Approximately 41.2565\xB0 N.\n\n### Step 4: Find the\
      \ Latitude of Betts House, Yale University, CT\nBetts House is part of Yale\
      \ University, which is located in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\n**Latitude of New\
      \ Haven, Connecticut:** Approximately 41.3083\xB0 N.\n\n### Step 5: Compare\
      \ the Latitudes\nNow, I'll compare the two latitudes:\n- **Glenn Cunningham\
      \ Lake, NE:** 41.2565\xB0 N\n- **Betts House, CT:** 41.3083\xB0 N\n\nSince latitude\
      \ increases as you go north, a higher number means the location is further north.\n\
      \n### Step 6: Determine Which is Further North\nComparing the two:\n- 41.3083\xB0\
      \ N (Betts House, CT) > 41.2565\xB0 N (Glenn Cunningham Lake, NE)\n\nThis means\
      \ Betts House, CT is slightly further north than Glenn Cunningham Lake, NE.\n\
      \n### Step 7: Conclusion\nSince Glenn Cunningham Lake, NE has a lower latitude\
      \ than Betts House, CT, it is **not** located north of Betts House.\n\n**Answer:**\
      \ NO, Glenn Cunningham Lake, NE is located south of Betts House, Yale University,\
      \ CT."
