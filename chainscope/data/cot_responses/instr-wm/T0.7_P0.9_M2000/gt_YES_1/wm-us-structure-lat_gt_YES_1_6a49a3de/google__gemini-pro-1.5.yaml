      the locations of St. Teresa Church (Manhattan) and 1 Pace Plaza, NY.

      2. **Determine Latitude/Longitude or Street Addresses:**  I need to get specific
      addresses or coordinates for both locations.

      3. **Compare the latitudes:** If using coordinates, the location with the higher
      latitude is further north. If using street addresses, I can compare street numbers
      (within the same street or avenue) or cross-streets to determine relative north/south
      positioning.


      Using online search engines, I find:


      * St. Teresa Church is located at 141 Henry Street, New York, NY.

      * 1 Pace Plaza is located at 1 Pace Plaza, New York, NY.  This is near City
      Hall Park.


      Henry Street is further north than the area around City Hall Park.

      of the two locations.  A higher latitude indicates a more northerly position.


      St. Teresa Church is located at 141 Henry Street, New York, NY.

      1 Pace Plaza is located at, well, 1 Pace Plaza, New York, NY.

      3. **Texas vs. Louisiana:** Texas is generally west of Louisiana. Austin is
      significantly west of Lafayette.  While parts of Texas extend north of Louisiana,
      Austin does not.

      4. **North/South Relationship:**  Since Austin is west of Lafayette, the primary
      directional relationship is east/west, rather than north/south.  While Austin
      might have a slightly higher latitude than Lafayette (putting it slightly north),
      the significant difference is longitudinal.

      Church in Los Angeles and Sandals Church in California.  (Note: There are multiple
      Sandals Churches in CA, so I''ll need to figure out which one is implied by
      the question. Proximity to St. Cecilia''s is a reasonable assumption.)

      latitudes. A higher latitude indicates a more northerly position.


      3. **Determine the relationship:** If St. Cecilia''s has a higher latitude than

      We need the specific locations (city/state if needed) to determine their latitude.

      2. **Determine the latitude of each theater:** Latitude determines north/south

      3. **Compare the latitudes:** If the O''Reilly Theater''s latitude is higher

      is NO.


      The O''Reilly Theater is in Pittsburgh, PA.  The Harris Theater is also in Pittsburgh,
      PA.  Therefore, their relative north/south position is likely very close. More
      precise addresses are needed.  However, since the question seems to imply they
      are different locations, one must be slightly north or south of the other.


      Searching for both theaters confirms they are indeed distinct venues in Pittsburgh.
      The O''Reilly is part of the Pittsburgh Public Theater complex in the Cultural
      District, and the Harris is part of the Trust Arts Center complex, also in the
      Cultural District.  Checking their addresses shows the O''Reilly is slightly
      north of the Harris.
