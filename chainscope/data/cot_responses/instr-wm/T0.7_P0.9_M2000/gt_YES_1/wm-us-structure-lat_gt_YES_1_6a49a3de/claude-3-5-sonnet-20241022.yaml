      1) First, let me identify the locations:

      - Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist is located at 55 E. Wacker Drive in
      Chicago, IL

      - James R. Thompson Center is located at 100 W. Randolph Street in Chicago,
      IL


      2) Looking at these addresses:

      - Wacker Drive runs east-west in this area

      - Randolph Street also runs east-west

      - These streets are parallel to each other


      3) Comparing their positions:

      - Wacker Drive is one block north of Randolph Street in downtown Chicago

      - Since Seventeenth Church is on Wacker Drive and Thompson Center is on Randolph
      Street

      - Therefore, Seventeenth Church must be north of the Thompson Center

      - Kentucky is located south of the Ohio River

      - Virginia is north of Kentucky


      3) Therefore, since Green River Lake is in Kentucky, and Kentucky is south of
      Virginia (where Kenner Army Health Clinic is), Green River Lake must be south
      of Kenner Army Health Clinic.
