      Pacis in New York is located north of the Beaver Valley Nuclear Power Station
      in Pennsylvania, we can follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the location of the Basilica of Regina Pacis**: The Basilica of
      Regina Pacis is located in Brooklyn, New York. Brooklyn is part of New York
      City, which is in the southeastern part of the state of New York.


      2. **Identify the location of the Beaver Valley Nuclear Power Station**: The
      Beaver Valley Nuclear Power Station is located near Shippingport, Pennsylvania,
      which is in the western part of Pennsylvania, near the border with Ohio.


      3. **Compare the latitudinal positions**: Brooklyn, NY, is situated at approximately
      40.6 degrees north latitude, while Shippingport, PA, is located at approximately
      40.6 degrees north latitude as well.


      Given these locations, the Basilica of Regina Pacis in Brooklyn, NY, and the
      Beaver Valley Nuclear Power Station near Shippingport, PA, are very close in
      terms of latitude. However, Brooklyn is slightly to the south of Shippingport.


      Thus, the Basilica of Regina Pacis is not located north of the Beaver Valley
      Nuclear Power Station.

      2. Compare their latitudinal coordinates to determine which is further north.


      1. **Grant USA Tower, NJ**: This is a fictional or unclear reference as of my

      in New Jersey. However, for the sake of this exercise, let''s assume it refers

      2. **Barrow Street Theatre, NY**: This is a real theatre located at 27 Barrow
      Street, New York, NY, in the West Village of Manhattan.


      3. **General Geography**: New Jersey is generally located to the west and south
      of New York City. Therefore, unless Grant USA Tower is situated in the extreme
      northern part of New Jersey, it is likely south of Manhattan.

      while Minnesota is in the northern central part of the country. Generally, Minnesota
      is positioned at a higher latitude than Washington.


      Given these considerations, Lake Steilacoom, WA is generally south of most locations

      is located north of BMO Plaza in Indiana, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the Location of Cadle Tabernacle**: Cadle Tabernacle was a historic
      church located in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was situated in the downtown area
      of Indianapolis.


      2. **Identify the Location of BMO Plaza**: BMO Plaza is an office building also
      located in downtown Indianapolis, Indiana.


      3. **Compare Their Locations**: Since both Cadle Tabernacle and BMO Plaza are
      located in downtown Indianapolis, we need to compare their specific locations
      within the downtown area. Historically, Cadle Tabernacle was located at 240
      North New Jersey Street, while BMO Plaza is located at 135 North Pennsylvania
      Street.


      4. **Determine the Relative Position**: Both addresses are in close proximity
      in downtown Indianapolis. Given their street numbers, Cadle Tabernacle at 240
      North New Jersey Street is indeed north of BMO Plaza at 135 North Pennsylvania
      Street.


      Therefore, the answer is YES, Cadle Tabernacle is located north of BMO Plaza.'

      Since 45th Street is numerically higher than 41st Street, the Imperial Theatre
      is located to the north of the Church of Sts. Cyril & Methodius and St. Raphael.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'

      Orthodox Church in Merrillville, Indiana, is located north of Goodspeed Musicals
      in Connecticut, we need to consider the geographic coordinates or relative positions
      of both locations.


      1. **Locate Merrillville, Indiana**: Merrillville is a town in the northern
      part of the state of Indiana. Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United
      States.


      2. **Locate Goodspeed Musicals, Connecticut**: Goodspeed Musicals is located
      in East Haddam, Connecticut, which is in the northeastern United States.


      3. **Compare latitudes**: Typically, locations further north have a higher latitude
      number. Indiana, being in the Midwest, generally has a lower latitude compared
      to Connecticut, which is in the New England region.


      By examining the general geographic layout of the United States, Connecticut
      is north of Indiana. Therefore, Goodspeed Musicals in Connecticut is north of
      Merrillville, Indiana.


      Thus, the answer to the question is: **NO**.'
