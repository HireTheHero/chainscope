      NY is located north of 1 Pace Plaza, NY, we need to establish the geographical
      locations of both.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, let''s identify where each location is. St.
      Teresa Church is located on 141 Henry Street, Manhattan, New York. 1 Pace Plaza
      is located on 1 Pace Plaza, Manhattan, New York.


      2. **Compare Positions**: To compare their positions, we consider their proximity
      to major landmarks or intersections. St. Teresa Church is located in the Lower
      East Side of Manhattan, while 1 Pace Plaza is situated in the Financial District.


      3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Manhattan is a relatively long and
      narrow island, with its northern part generally considered "uptown" and its
      southern part "downtown." Given that St. Teresa Church is in the Lower East
      Side, it''s positioned more to the south, while 1 Pace Plaza, being in the Financial
      District, is more to the south.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations, St. Teresa Church is
      located north of 1 Pace Plaza because the Lower East Side is positioned relatively
      north compared to the Financial District.

      \ where each location is within Manhattan. St. Teresa Church is located in the\
      \ Lower East Side of Manhattan. 1 Pace Plaza is also in Manhattan, but its exact\
      \ location needs to be determined.\n\n2. **Compare Positions**: To compare their\
      \ positions, we consider their proximity to major landmarks or intersections.\
      \ The Lower East Side is a neighborhood in the southeastern part of Manhattan,\
      \ while 1 Pace Plaza could be in various parts of the city.\n\n3. **Determine\
      \ North-South Orientation**: Given that both locations are in Manhattan, the\
      \ determining factor will be their relative positions along the north-south\
      \ axis. Manhattan is a long, narrow island with a grid-like street layout, making\
      \ it easier to determine north-south orientations.\n\n4. **Research**: Without\

      the relative positions of Wheaton Bible Church and Moody Church in Illinois.
      Both are located in the state of Illinois, which means we need to focus on their
      specific locations within the state.


      1. **Identify the Locations**: Wheaton Bible Church is located in Wheaton, IL,
      which is a suburb of Chicago. Moody Church is located in Chicago, IL, specifically
      in the Lincoln Park neighborhood.


      2. **Consider the Relative Positions**: Since both churches are in Illinois,
      we need to look at their positions relative to each other. Chicago is located
      in the northeastern part of Illinois, and Wheaton is a suburb west of Chicago.


      3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: To determine if one location is north
      of another, we look at their positions along the north-south axis. Chicago is
      situated on Lake Michigan, and Wheaton is inland. Since Wheaton is west of Chicago
      and generally west is considered north in the context of the Chicago area, it
      suggests that Wheaton is indeed north of Chicago.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Wheaton is north of Chicago, and both churches
      are in their respective locations, it''s reasonable to conclude that Wheaton
      Bible Church is located north of Moody Church.

      Brooklyn is a borough of New York City, located in the southwestern part of
      Long Island.


      2. **Consider the General Layout of Brooklyn**: Brooklyn is a relatively large
      borough with a diverse layout. It''s important to note that Brooklyn is not

      to major cities or landmarks. Howard, the town near Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir,
      is more centrally located within the state compared to Danville, which is slightly
      further east.


      3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Given that both structures are in
      central Pennsylvania, the determining factor will be their relative positions
      along the north-south axis. Danville is closer to the eastern border of Pennsylvania,
      suggesting that the Basilica is positioned relatively north compared to other
      parts of central Pennsylvania.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations, Foster Joseph Sayers
      Reservoir is south of the Basilica of Saints Cyril and Methodius because the
      Basilica is closer to the eastern border, placing it more to the north in the
      context of central Pennsylvania.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where each church is located.
      The Church of the Guardian Angel is in Manhattan, New York City, specifically
      on 10th Avenue. The New Hope Baptist Church is in Newark, New Jersey, which
      is a city across the Hudson River from New York City.


      2. **Consider Proximity**: Manhattan is a borough of New York City, located

      York. Newark is directly west of New York City, separated by the Hudson River.


      3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: To determine if one location is north
      of another, we need to consider their positions on the north-south axis. Since
      Newark is directly west of Manhattan, it is not significantly north or south
      of Manhattan in terms of latitude.

      is located north of the Cultural Education Center, we need to understand the
      geographical context of both locations.


      1. **Identify Locations**: Both the New York State Capitol and the Cultural
      Education Center are located in Albany, New York.


      2. **Geographical Orientation**: Albany is situated in the eastern part of New
      York State, and within the city, the downtown area is generally considered the
      central part.


      3. **Specific Locations**: The New York State Capitol is located at the corner
      of Washington Avenue and State Street in downtown Albany. The Cultural Education
      Center is located on Madison Avenue, also in downtown Albany.


      4. **Comparison**: Given that both locations are in downtown Albany, which is
      relatively compact, the north-south relationship between them is not significant.
      The orientation of streets in Albany is such that Washington Avenue and State
      Street are not noticeably north or south of Madison Avenue.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since both the New York State Capitol and the Cultural Education
      Center are located in downtown Albany, with no significant north-south separation
      between their specific locations, the answer to whether the New York State Capitol
      is located north of the Cultural Education Center is **NO**'

      The Ziegfeld Theatre (1927) was historically located at 1341 6th Avenue in New
      York City, while the Times Square Church is located at 1657 Broadway.


      2. **Consider Street Grid**: New York City has a grid system, with avenues running
      north-south and streets running east-west. Both 6th Avenue and Broadway are
      avenues, meaning they run north-south.


      3. **Determine Relative Positions**: Since both the Ziegfeld Theatre and the

      in the city of Davenport. Health Education Campus is in Ohio, but without more
      specific information, we can only assume it''s somewhere in the state.


      2. **Consider General US Geography**: Iowa is located in the Midwest region
      of the United States, while Ohio is also in the Midwest but is further east.
      This means that Iowa is generally west of Ohio.


      3. **North-South Orientation**: Generally, locations in the United States are
      considered "north" or "south" based on their latitude. Locations with higher
      latitudes are considered "north," and those with lower latitudes are considered
      "south."


      4. **Specific Locations**: Without more specific information about the Health
      Education Campus in Ohio, we can only make a general assumption based on the
      states'' locations. Iowa''s latitude is generally higher than Ohio''s, meaning
      that locations in Iowa are generally north of locations in Ohio.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographical locations and without more
      specific information about the Health Education Campus, we can conclude that
      Sacred Heart Cathedral (Davenport, Iowa), IA is likely located north of Health

      \ it suggests they are not significantly north-south of each other but rather\
      \ are separated more by longitude (east-west).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on\
      \ the information and focusing strictly on the north-south axis as the question\
      \ implies, the answer would depend on the precise latitudes of these two locations.\

      locations of both.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, let''s identify where each is located. Kendall
      Cogeneration Station is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Improv Asylum is
      also in Massachusetts, but the specific location is not provided. However, since
      the question implies they are both in Massachusetts, we can assume they are
      in relatively close proximity.


      2. **Compare Positions**: Without a specific location for Improv Asylum, we
      can''t make a direct comparison. However, we can use general knowledge about
      Massachusetts to make an educated guess.


      3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Massachusetts is a relatively small
      state in the northeastern United States. Cambridge, where Kendall Cogeneration
      Station is located, is in the eastern part of the state, near Boston. Without

      NY is located north of Brick Presbyterian Church in New York City, we need to
      establish the geographical locations of both buildings.


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, let''s identify where each building is
      located. 257 Central Park West is on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York
      City. The Brick Presbyterian Church is also in Manhattan, New York City, specifically
      at 62 E 92nd St.


      2. **Compare Positions**: To compare their positions, we consider their proximity
      to major landmarks or streets. Central Park West runs along the western edge
      of Central Park, while East 92nd Street is a major street in the Upper East
      Side.


      3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Given that both buildings are in Manhattan,
      we can use the grid system of the city''s streets to determine their north-south
      orientation. Generally, higher street numbers (like 92nd Street) are located
      further north compared to lower street numbers (like 65th Street).


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations, 257 Central Park West
      is south of Brick Presbyterian Church because Brick Presbyterian Church is located
      on 92nd Street, which is a higher street number and thus further north in the
      context of Manhattan.

      locations.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, let''s identify where each lake is located.
      Lake Shelbyville is in central Illinois, specifically in Shelby County. Cagles
      Mill Lake is in west-central Indiana, near the city of Cloverdale.


      2. **Compare Positions**: To compare their positions, we consider their proximity
      to major cities or landmarks. Lake Shelbyville is located in central Illinois,
      while Cagles Mill Lake is in west-central Indiana.


      3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Given that both lakes are in the Midwest,
      the determining factor will be their relative positions along the north-south
      axis. Indiana is generally considered more north than central Illinois, especially
      in the context of the Midwest.

      north of Gibraltar Dam, CA, we need to establish the geographical locations
      of both.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, let''s identify where each location is situated.
      Lake Palmdale is located in the Antelope Valley region of southern California,
      northwest of Los Angeles. Gibraltar Dam is situated in the Santa Barbara County,
      near Santa Barbara, California.


      2. **Compare Positions**: To compare their positions, we consider their proximity

      1520 Sedgwick Avenue is, of course, at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue, Bronx, NY.


      2. **Compare Positions**: To compare their positions, we consider their proximity

      a major thoroughfare in the Bronx. Sedgwick Avenue is also a significant street
      in the area.


      3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: The Bronx, like most urban areas,

      \ **Determine North-South Orientation**: To determine if the Suzanne Roberts\
      \ Theatre is located north of the Sparks Shot Tower, we need to understand the\
      \ relative positions of these two locations within Philadelphia. Since both\
      \ are in Philadelphia, the question becomes whether the Suzanne Roberts Theatre\
      \ is in a northern part of the city compared to the Sparks Shot Tower.\n\n4.\
      \ **Specific Locations**:\n   - Suzanne Roberts Theatre is located at 480 S.\

      \ whether the Suzanne Roberts Theatre is north of the Sparks Shot Tower without\
      \ more specific information or a detailed map. However, based on the general\
      \ layout of Philadelphia and the locations provided, it seems unlikely that\

    f0dc2abf-c03d-46e0-a821-82c007c1d666: 'To determine if the Suzanne Roberts Theatre,
      PA is located north of the Sparks Shot Tower, PA, we need to consider the geographical
      locations of both.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where each structure is
      located. Both the Suzanne Roberts Theatre and the Sparks Shot Tower are located
      in Pennsylvania (PA).


      2. **Compare Positions**: To compare their positions, we consider their proximity
      to major cities or landmarks. The Suzanne Roberts Theatre is in Philadelphia,
      which is in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania. The Sparks Shot Tower is
      also in Philadelphia.


      3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Given that both structures are in
      Philadelphia, the determining factor will be their relative positions along
      the north-south axis within the city. Philadelphia has a grid-like street layout,
      which makes it relatively easy to determine north-south orientation.


      4. **Specific Locations**: The Suzanne Roberts Theatre is at 480 S. Broad Street,
      Philadelphia, PA 19146. The Sparks Shot Tower is at 129-131 Carpenter Street,
      Philadelphia, PA 19147.


      5. **Comparison**: Comparing the addresses, we can see that the Suzanne Roberts
      Theatre is located south of the Sparks Shot Tower. Broad Street is a major north-south
      street in Philadelphia, and Carpenter Street is a few blocks east of it. The
      lower street number (480) for the Suzanne Roberts Theatre indicates it''s south
      of the Sparks Shot Tower (129-131).


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations and specific addresses,
      the Suzanne Roberts Theatre is located south of the Sparks Shot Tower because
      it has a lower street number on Broad Street, which is a major north-south street
      in Philadelphia.


      The final answer is: NO

      west side) are considered "north" and those further inland (the east side) are
      considered "south."


      3. **Determine the specific locations within Los Angeles**: The Immanuel Presbyterian
      Church is located on Wilshire Boulevard, which is on the west side of Los Angeles,
      closer to the ocean. The Mark Taper Forum is part of the Music Center complex,
      located in Downtown Los Angeles, which is more central and eastward compared
      to the Immanuel Presbyterian Church.


      4. **Compare the positions**: Since the Immanuel Presbyterian Church is on the
      west side of Los Angeles, it is generally considered to be north of the Mark
      Taper Forum, which is more centrally located in the city.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general layout of Los Angeles and the specific
      locations of the Immanuel Presbyterian Church and the Mark Taper Forum, the
      Immanuel Presbyterian Church is indeed located north of the Mark Taper Forum.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{YES}$

      \ Mark Taper Forum is also in Los Angeles, California.\n\n2. **Consider specific\
      \ locations within Los Angeles**: Los Angeles is a vast city with different\
      \ neighborhoods and areas. The specific locations of these two structures within\
      \ the city are crucial for determining their relative north-south positions.\n\
      \n3. **Research or assume**: Without specific addresses or locations within\
      \ Los Angeles for both structures, we can either research their exact locations\
      \ or make an assumption based on general knowledge of Los Angeles' layout.\n\
      \n4. **Comparison**: Once we have the locations, we can compare them. In a city\
      \ like Los Angeles, north-south directions can be complex due to the city's\
      \ size and layout. If the church is in a neighborhood or area that is north\
      \ of the Mark Taper Forum's location, then the answer would be yes.\n\n5. **Assumption\

      \ Angeles and the Mark Taper Forum is in a more central or southern part, then\
      \ the answer would likely be yes.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information\
      \ about the exact locations of both structures within Los Angeles in the question,\
      \ a precise answer requires either knowledge of the city's layout and the specific\
      \ locations of both structures or an assumption based on typical locations of\

      \ or NO answer without providing specific addresses or areas, and assuming both\
      \ are in Los Angeles, we must proceed with the information typically available.\n\
      \n**Answer**: Without the exact location of Immanuel Presbyterian Church (Los\
      \ Angeles, California), CA, but knowing that both are in Los Angeles, California,\
      \ and considering the Mark Taper Forum is in the central part of the city, if\
      \ the church is in any of the northern neighborhoods (which is a broad area\
      \ and includes many neighborhoods), it could indeed be north. However, without\
      \ specific details, this becomes a matter of probability rather than certainty.\

    06c5a309-abc6-4417-b043-5a883dd25fc8: 'To answer this question, we need to consider
      the geographical locations of both the Tennessee Performing Arts Center (TPAC)
      and the Downtown Presbyterian Church in Nashville, Tennessee.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, let''s identify the locations of both structures.
      The Tennessee Performing Arts Center (TPAC) is located in downtown Nashville,
      Tennessee. The Downtown Presbyterian Church, as the name suggests, is also located
      in downtown Nashville.


      2. **Determine Relative Positions**: Since both structures are in the same city,
      we need to determine their relative positions within downtown Nashville. Generally,
      in many cities, including Nashville, the downtown area is organized with a grid
      system where streets are named and numbered to provide clear directions.


      3. **Compare Positions**: To compare their positions, we would need to know
      their specific addresses or cross-streets. Without this information, we can''t
      definitively say which structure is north of the other.


      4. **Assumption and Research**: Without specific addresses, we can only assume
      that both structures are in the central part of downtown Nashville. In such
      cases, it''s common for major landmarks and institutions to be relatively close
      to each other. However, without more specific information, it''s difficult to
      say definitively which one is north of the other.


      Given the lack of specific information about the exact locations of both the
      Tennessee Performing Arts Center and the Downtown Presbyterian Church in Nashville,
      Tennessee, it''s challenging to provide a clear YES or NO answer. However, assuming
      they are both in the central part of downtown Nashville, they are likely close
      to each other, making it difficult to determine which is north of the other
      without more specific information.


      The answer is: $\boxed{UNKNOWN}$

      Arts Center (TPAC) in Nashville, TN, is located north of the Downtown Presbyterian
      Church in Nashville, TN, we need to consider their geographical locations within
      the city.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Both the Tennessee Performing Arts Center and
      the Downtown Presbyterian Church are in Nashville, Tennessee. Nashville is situated
      in the north-central part of the state of Tennessee.


      2. **Consider Nashville''s layout**: Nashville has a relatively straightforward
      grid layout, with streets running north-south and avenues running east-west.
      The city is bisected by the Cumberland River, which runs roughly west to east.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: The Tennessee Performing Arts Center
      is located in the central business district of Nashville, near the intersection
      of 5th Avenue North and Deaderick Street. The Downtown Presbyterian Church is
      located at the corner of 5th Avenue North and Church Street, which is just a
      few blocks south of the Tennessee Performing Arts Center.


      4. **Compare north-south orientation**: Given that both locations are on 5th
      Avenue North, which runs north-south, the Tennessee Performing Arts Center is
      indeed located north of the Downtown Presbyterian Church.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on their locations within Nashville''s grid system,
      the Tennessee Performing Arts Center is located north of the Downtown Presbyterian
      Church.


      The final answer is: YES

    2de7cd3e-b78f-4dcd-8808-6448e3d54a75: 'To determine if the Tennessee Performing
      Arts Center (TPAC) is located north of the Downtown Presbyterian Church in Nashville,
      Tennessee, we need to establish the geographical relationship between the two.


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations
      of both TPAC and the Downtown Presbyterian Church in Nashville, TN.


      2. **Understand Nashville''s layout**: Nashville is laid out in a grid pattern,
      with the Cumberland River roughly dividing the city into north and south halves.
      The Downtown Presbyterian Church is located downtown, which is generally south
      of the river.


      3. **Compare locations**: Once we have the specific addresses or areas for both
      locations, we can compare them to determine if TPAC is located north of the
      church. If TPAC is in an area north of the Cumberland River or in a northern
      neighborhood, it would be north of the church.


      4. **Determine north-south orientation**: The question specifically asks if
      TPAC is located north of the church, so we need to focus on the north-south
      axis. If TPAC is in a location that is north of the church''s location, then
      the answer would be yes.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the comparison of their locations and the understanding
      of Nashville''s layout, we can determine if TPAC is located north of the Downtown
      Presbyterian Church.


      Given the lack of specific addresses or areas for both locations in the question,
      a definitive answer requires either knowledge of Nashville''s layout and the
      specific locations of both buildings or an assumption based on typical locations
      of such establishments. However, since the question asks for a definitive YES
      or NO answer without providing specific addresses or areas, and knowing that
      both are in Nashville, Tennessee, we must proceed with the information typically
      available.


      **Answer**: Without the exact locations of both the Tennessee Performing Arts
      Center and the Downtown Presbyterian Church in Nashville, TN, but knowing that
      they are both in the city, and considering the general layout of Nashville,
      it''s challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, assuming that the
      Tennessee Performing Arts Center is located in a central or northern area of
      Nashville, and the Downtown Presbyterian Church is in the downtown area, which
      is generally south of the Cumberland River, it''s possible that the Tennessee
      Performing Arts Center is indeed north of the church.


      But to follow the instruction for a YES/NO answer without further specific information,
      and considering the structure of the question implies a need for geographical
      comparison which isn''t fully provided:

      is at 154 5th Ave N, Nashville, TN 37219.


      2. **Compare the positions**: Since both structures are in the same city and
      have known addresses, we can compare their positions on a map or using a mapping
      tool. By doing so, we can see that the Downtown Presbyterian Church is located
      slightly south of the Tennessee Performing Arts Center.


      3. **Determine the north-south orientation**: Given the comparison of their
      positions on the map, we can conclude that the Tennessee Performing Arts Center
      is not located north of the Downtown Presbyterian Church.

      north of Queen Anne Hotel, CA, we need to identify the locations of both and
      compare their positions.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Belden Place is a narrow alley in the Financial
      District of San Francisco, California. The Queen Anne Hotel is also located
      in San Francisco, California, specifically in the Pacific Heights neighborhood.


      2. **Consider the general layout of San Francisco**: San Francisco is a relatively
      small city geographically, with distinct neighborhoods. The Financial District,
      where Belden Place is located, is generally considered the central business
      district. Pacific Heights, where the Queen Anne Hotel is situated, is a residential
      neighborhood to the northwest of the city center.


      3. **Compare positions**: Given the layout of San Francisco and the relative
      positions of the Financial District and Pacific Heights, Belden Place, being
      in the Financial District, is more centrally located in the city than the Queen
      Anne Hotel, which is in a residential neighborhood.


      4. **Consider north-south orientation**: While Belden Place is more central,
      the question asks specifically about the north-south relationship. To determine
      this, we need to consider the precise locations of both places within the city.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general layout of San Francisco and the relative
      positions of the Financial District and Pacific Heights, Belden Place, being
      more centrally located, is not significantly north or south of the Queen Anne
      Hotel. However, to give a definitive answer to whether it is strictly north,

      to major landmarks or intersections in San Francisco. Belden Place is located
      in the Financial District, near the intersection of Bush and Kearny Streets.
      The Queen Anne Hotel is situated in the Pacific Heights neighborhood, near the
      intersection of Sutter and Octavia Streets.


      3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Given that both locations are in San
      Francisco, the determining factor will be their relative positions along the
      north-south axis. The Financial District, where Belden Place is located, is
      more central and southern in San Francisco. Pacific Heights, where the Queen

      located at 504 N Camden Dr, Beverly Hills, CA 90210. Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St.
      Peter Cathedral in Los Angeles is located at 333 S San Vicente Blvd, Los Angeles,
      CA 90048.


      4. **Comparison**: Both locations are within the Los Angeles metropolitan area.
      Since Beverly Hills is generally west of central Los Angeles, and the cathedral
      is in central Los Angeles, it''s likely that the cathedral is north of the church.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography and the locations of the two
      churches, it''s likely that Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral (Los
      Angeles), CA is located north of All Saints'' Episcopal Church (Beverly Hills,
      California), CA.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, let''s identify where each structure is located.
      The Imperial Theatre is on Broadway in New York City, specifically in the Theater
      District of Manhattan. The Church of Sts. Cyril & Methodius and St. Raphael
      is also in New York City, but it''s not specified where exactly.


      2. **Compare Positions**: To compare their positions, we consider their proximity
      to major landmarks. The Imperial Theatre is in the heart of Manhattan, while
      the church could be anywhere in New York City. Without more specific information
      about the church''s location, it''s challenging to determine its position relative
      to the theatre.


      3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Given that both structures are in
      New York City, the determining factor will be their relative positions along
      the north-south axis. The Theater District is in Midtown Manhattan, which is
      relatively central in the city. Without knowing where the church is, we cannot
      definitively say which structure is more northward.

      PA is located north of the Harris Theater (Pittsburgh), PA, we need to consider
      the geographical locations of both.


      1. **Identify the locations**: The O''Reilly Theater and the Harris Theater
      (Pittsburgh) are both located in Pennsylvania (PA).


      2. **Consider specific cities**: Since both theaters are in the same state,

      The O''Reilly Theater is in Pittsburgh, and the Harris Theater (Pittsburgh)
      is also in Pittsburgh.


      3. **Determine north-south orientation**: Both theaters are in the same city,
      Pittsburgh, which is in the western part of Pennsylvania. Generally, the northern
      parts of a city are considered those above a certain latitude, with the southern
      parts below it. However, since both theaters are in the same city, their relative
      north-south positioning might be more nuanced.


      4. **Compare specific locations**: Without more specific addresses or locations
      within Pittsburgh, it''s challenging to determine their exact north-south relationship.
      However, since they are both in the same city, their north-south orientation
      is likely to be similar or very close.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that both theaters are in the same city, Pittsburgh,
      and without more specific location details, it''s difficult to definitively
      say if the O''Reilly Theater is located north of the Harris Theater (Pittsburgh).

      the geographical locations of both theaters.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, let''s identify where each theater is located.
      The Fitzgerald Theater is in Saint Paul, Minnesota, while the In the Heart of
      the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre is in Minneapolis, Minnesota.


      2. **Consider Proximity**: Since both theaters are in different cities within
      Minnesota, we need to consider their proximity to each other. Saint Paul and
      Minneapolis are twin cities, meaning they are geographically close to each other
      and often considered a single metropolitan area.


      3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Given their close proximity, we need
      to determine their north-south orientation within the metropolitan area. Saint
      Paul is generally considered the easternmost and northernmost of the two cities,
      while Minneapolis is to the west and slightly south.

      in East Haddam, Connecticut, which is in the southern part of the state.


      2. **Compare Positions**: To compare their positions, we consider their proximity
      to major cities or landmarks. Merrillville is near Chicago, Illinois, which
      is one of the northernmost major cities in the Midwest. East Haddam is near
      Hartford, Connecticut, which is relatively central in the Northeast.


      3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Given that both locations are in the
      Midwest and Northeast, respectively, the determining factor will be their relative
      positions along the north-south axis. Chicago''s northern location suggests
      that Merrillville, being near it, is positioned relatively north compared to
      other parts of the Midwest.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations, Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox
      Church in Merrillville, Indiana, is north of Goodspeed Musicals in East Haddam,
      Connecticut, because Merrillville is in the northern part of Indiana, while
      East Haddam is in the southern part of Connecticut.


      The final answer is: YES

      \ in Nevada and Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church is in Maryland, and given\
      \ that Nevada is generally considered \"west\" and Maryland \"east\" with no\
      \ significant north-south difference based on the latitudes provided, the direct\
      \ answer to whether St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV, is located\
      \ **north** of Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church, MD, would be **NO**"
