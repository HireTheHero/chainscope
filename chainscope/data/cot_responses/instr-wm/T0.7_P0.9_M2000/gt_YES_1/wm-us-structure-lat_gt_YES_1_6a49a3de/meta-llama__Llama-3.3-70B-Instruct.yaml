      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to know the exact or relative
      locations of both the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium and the United States Capitol
      in Washington, D.C.


      2. **Geographical Orientation**: Understand the geographical layout of Washington,
      D.C., including its major landmarks and how they relate to each other directionally
      (north, south, east, west).


      3. **Specific Addresses or Landmarks**: Knowing the specific addresses or nearby
      landmarks for both locations can help. The United States Capitol is a central
      landmark in Washington, D.C., located at the eastern end of the National Mall.


      4. **Research or Map Reference**: If specific addresses are not known, consulting
      a map of Washington, D.C. would provide the necessary information to determine
      the relative positions of these two locations.


      Given these steps, let''s apply them:

      - The United States Capitol is located at the eastern end of the National Mall,
      which runs westward towards the Lincoln Memorial.

      - The Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium is located at 1301 Constitution Avenue NW,
      Washington, D.C.


      Considering the layout of Washington, D.C.:

      - Constitution Avenue runs east-west, with the National Mall to its south.

      - The "NW" in the auditorium''s address indicates it is in the northwest quadrant
      of Washington, D.C.


      Given this information, the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium, being on Constitution
      Avenue NW and in the northwest part of the city, would indeed be north of the
      United States Capitol, which is more centrally and southerly located on the
      National Mall.


      Therefore, the answer to whether the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium, D.C. is located
      north of the United States Capitol, D.C. is: **YES**.'

    be112516-dec3-401d-ab13-7abfee9a92ff: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to identify the locations of both the
      Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium and the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C.


      2. **Location of the United States Capitol**: The United States Capitol is located
      at the eastern end of the National Mall, with its address being First Street
      SE, Washington, D.C. It''s situated roughly in the center of the city, but slightly
      towards the east.


      3. **Location of the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium**: The Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium
      is located at 1301 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. This puts it on
      the north side of the National Mall.


      4. **Comparison**: To determine if the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium is north
      of the United States Capitol, we need to compare their relative positions. Given
      that the Capitol is more towards the center of the city and slightly to the
      east, and the Mellon Auditorium is on Constitution Avenue NW, which is to the
      northwest of the Capitol, we can infer their relative positions.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium is located northwest
      of the National Mall and the United States Capitol is more centrally and easternly
      located, the auditorium is indeed north (and slightly west) of the Capitol.


      The final answer is: **YES**'
    c482f43d-c9e9-4261-bd70-c1057cff2653: 'To determine if the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium
      in Washington, D.C. is located north of the United States Capitol in Washington,
      D.C., let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations
      of both the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium and the United States Capitol. The United
      States Capitol is located at the eastern end of the National Mall in Washington,
      D.C.


      2. **Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium Location**: The Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium
      is situated near the White House and is part of the Federal Triangle area in
      Washington, D.C. More precisely, its address is 1301 Constitution Avenue NW,
      which places it west of the National Mall and north of the National Archives.


      3. **Compare Locations Relative to the Capitol**: Given that the United States
      Capitol is at the eastern end of the National Mall, anything west of it along
      the mall or in the surrounding areas could be considered as being to its west
      or northwest, depending on the exact location.


      4. **North-South Orientation**: To determine if the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium
      is north of the Capitol, we need to consider their relative positions in terms
      of north-south orientation. The National Mall runs roughly east-west. The Federal
      Triangle, where the auditorium is located, extends north from the Mall.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the address of the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium (1301
      Constitution Avenue NW) and considering the layout of Washington, D.C., the
      auditorium is indeed located northwest of the United States Capitol. Given the
      context of the question, which asks if it''s north of the Capitol, we interpret
      "north" in a general directional sense, considering the layout of D.C. and the
      fact that the auditorium is northwest, which includes a northern component relative
      to the Capitol''s location.


      The final answer is: YES'
    cfb9d40e-e61e-453f-978d-6ad1e18cbc60: 'To determine if the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium
      in Washington, D.C. is located north of the United States Capitol in Washington,
      D.C., let''s break down the process:


      1. **Identify the locations**: The first step is to identify the precise locations
      of both the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium and the United States Capitol. The Andrew
      W. Mellon Auditorium is located at 1301 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington,
      D.C. The United States Capitol is located at First Street SE, Washington, D.C.


      2. **Understand Washington, D.C.''s layout**: Washington, D.C. is laid out in
      a grid pattern with avenues and streets. Avenues run north-south, and streets
      run east-west. The city is divided into quadrants: Northwest (NW), Northeast
      (NE), Southwest (SW), and Southeast (SE).


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Given that the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium
      is in the NW quadrant and the United States Capitol is in the SE quadrant (though
      it''s centrally located and borders other quadrants), the next step is to understand
      their relative positions. The NW quadrant is generally north of the SE quadrant.


      4. **Consider the specific addresses**: The Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium''s address
      on Constitution Avenue NW places it west and slightly north of the National
      Mall area, where the Capitol is situated. The Capitol''s address on First Street
      SE indicates it''s more towards the eastern part of the city, near the center.


      5. **Conclusion based on location analysis**: Given the general layout of Washington,
      D.C. and the specific locations of these two structures, the Andrew W. Mellon
      Auditorium, being in the NW quadrant and on Constitution Avenue, is indeed located
      north of the United States Capitol, which is more centrally located but in the
      SE quadrant.


      The final answer is: YES'

      \ the addresses provided, the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium, while certainly west,\
      \ is not significantly north of the U.S. Capitol; the difference in their locations\
      \ is more pronounced in the east-west axis than the north-south axis based on\
      \ their addresses.\n\nHowever, without precise locations or a map, the definitive\
      \ answer relies on understanding the grid system and recognizing that Constitution\

      of Christ, Scientist, IL is located north of the James R. Thompson Center, IL,
      let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist and the James R. Thompson Center
      in Illinois.


      2. **Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist Location**: The Seventeenth Church
      of Christ, Scientist is in Chicago, Illinois. Without the exact address, we
      know it''s within the city limits.


      3. **James R. Thompson Center Location**: The James R. Thompson Center is located
      in Chicago, Illinois, specifically at 100 W Randolph St, Chicago, IL 60601.
      This is in the Loop area of downtown Chicago.


      4. **Relative Positions**: To determine if one is north of the other, we need
      their relative positions. Chicago is laid out in a grid pattern with the intersection
      of Madison Street and State Street as the origin (0,0). Addresses increase as
      you move away from this point, with numbers increasing to the north, east, south,
      and west.


      5. **Determine North-South Relationship**: Without the exact address of the
      Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist, it''s challenging to determine its
      precise location relative to the Thompson Center. However, if we consider that
      the Thompson Center is in the downtown area and assuming the church is also
      in a comparable area or further out but still within Chicago, we would need
      the church''s exact address or a description of its location relative to the
      city grid to accurately determine its position north or south of the Thompson
      Center.


      Given the lack of specific information about the church''s location relative
      to the Thompson Center or its exact address, and without additional details
      or a map, it''s not possible to definitively answer the question based solely
      on the information provided.


      However, since the question demands a YES or NO answer and considering typical
      structures'' naming conventions and the fact that both are in Chicago, IL, but
      without specific addresses or a clear indication of their relative positions:

    f6f545ec-e6b9-4684-aa5e-740220471fa4: 'To answer this question, we''ll go through
      the necessary steps of reasoning.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist, in Illinois (IL) and the James
      R. Thompson Center in Illinois.


      2. **Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist, IL**: Without specific details,
      we can assume this church is located in a city within Illinois. Since there
      are multiple Churches of Christ, Scientist, in different cities, we need a specific
      city for precise comparison. However, a well-known location for a Church of
      Christ, Scientist, is in Chicago, IL.


      3. **James R. Thompson Center, IL**: This is located in Chicago, Illinois. It''s
      a well-known building in the Loop district of Chicago.


      4. **Comparison**: Assuming the Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist, is
      in Chicago (as it''s a major city in IL and home to many such churches), we
      then need to compare its location to the James R. Thompson Center.


      5. **Geographical Analysis**: The James R. Thompson Center is situated at 100
      W Randolph St, Chicago, IL 60601. Without the exact address of the Seventeenth
      Church of Christ, Scientist, but knowing it''s in Chicago, we must consider
      the relative positions of these two locations within the city.


      6. **Determine North/South Orientation**: To say one location is north of another,
      it must be positioned to the north on a map. Chicago''s grid system makes this
      relatively straightforward, with addresses increasing as you move north.


      7. **Conclusion**: Without the precise address of the Seventeenth Church of
      Christ, Scientist, in Chicago, IL, but knowing both locations are in Chicago,
      we cannot definitively conclude their relative north-south positions without
      more specific information. However, for the purpose of this exercise and assuming
      a need for a definitive answer based on typical locations within Chicago, one
      might need to research or know the exact address of the church in question to
      provide an accurate YES or NO answer.


      Given the lack of specific address details for the church in this reasoning
      process, the most informed response based on the information provided would
      have to be speculative. However, since the question demands a YES or NO answer
      and considering that both locations could potentially be in Chicago, with many
      Churches of Christ, Scientist, located throughout the city, some of which could
      indeed be north of the James R. Thompson Center, the answer could lean towards
      a speculative yes, depending on the church''s exact location. But, without the
      exact address, this is a reasoned guess rather than a fact-based answer.


      Therefore, based on the need for a YES or NO answer and considering potential
      locations within Chicago, the speculative answer would be: YES.'

    526f5069-0a39-47c0-91bd-d4a26fa7719a: "To answer this question, let's break it\
      \ down into steps:\n\n1. **Identify the locations**: We need to find the locations\
      \ of two structures - Cathedral Basilica of St. James and Our Lady of Lebanon\
      \ Maronite Cathedral, both in Brooklyn, NY.\n\n2. **Cathedral Basilica of St.\
      \ James Location**: The Cathedral Basilica of St. James is located at 2500 Jay\
      \ Street, Brooklyn, NY, but for the sake of comparison, we'll consider its general\
      \ neighborhood or area in Brooklyn.\n\n3. **Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral\
      \ Location**: Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral is located at 113 Remsen\
      \ Street, Brooklyn, NY. Again, for comparison, we consider its neighborhood.\n\
      \n4. **Compare Locations**: To determine if the Cathedral Basilica of St. James\
      \ is north of Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral, we need to understand\
      \ the layout of Brooklyn. Brooklyn is generally laid out in a grid pattern with\
      \ avenues running north-south and streets running east-west. However, the exact\
      \ positioning (north-south) can depend on the specific locations and how the\
      \ grid intersects with the natural geography and older neighborhood layouts.\n\
      \n5. **Brooklyn Neighborhoods and Geography**: Brooklyn's neighborhoods are\
      \ diverse, with some areas having more straightforward grid patterns than others.\
      \ The area around Jay Street (where Cathedral Basilica of St. James is located)\
      \ and Remsen Street (where Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral is located)\
      \ can help determine their relative positions.\n\n6. **Specific Location Comparison**:\n\
      \    - Jay Street, where the Cathedral Basilica of St. James is, is in the vicinity\
      \ of Downtown Brooklyn.\n    - Remsen Street, where Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite\
      \ Cathedral is, is also near Downtown Brooklyn but closer to the Brooklyn Heights\
      \ neighborhood.\n\n7. **North-South Orientation in Brooklyn**: Considering the\
      \ general layout, areas closer to the Brooklyn Bridge and Downtown Brooklyn\
      \ tend to be more south than areas further out in the borough. However, the\
      \ specific north-south relationship between two points in Brooklyn depends on\
      \ their exact locations relative to each other.\n\nGiven these steps and without\
      \ exact GPS coordinates or a detailed map to reference, we can still make an\
      \ educated guess based on typical Brooklyn geography. However, for precise determination:\n\
      - Jay Street is around Downtown Brooklyn.\n- Remsen Street is near Brooklyn\
      \ Heights, which is also somewhat south but slightly northwest of the Downtown\
      \ area, depending on the perspective.\n\nGiven this information and the need\
      \ for precise location data to definitively answer, we would ideally look at\
      \ a map. However, based on the general areas:\n- Downtown Brooklyn (Jay Street)\
      \ is generally south or southwest of Brooklyn Heights (Remsen Street).\n\nConsidering\
      \ the general direction and assuming typical Brooklyn grid patterns, the Cathedral\
      \ Basilica of St. James would likely be south or southwest of Our Lady of Lebanon\
      \ Maronite Cathedral, given their respective neighborhoods. \n\nTherefore, based\

      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know the exact addresses or
      locations of both cathedrals to compare their positions.


      2. **Compare locations**: Once we have the addresses or locations, we compare
      them to determine their relative positions in terms of north-south orientation.


      Given that I don''t have real-time access to specific addresses or maps, I''ll
      rely on general knowledge. However, I can guide you through a hypothetical process:


      - **Cathedral Basilica of St. James (Brooklyn), NY**: Let''s assume its location
      is known.

      - **Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral (Brooklyn), NY**: Similarly, let''s
      assume its location is known.


      Without the specific addresses, we can''t proceed directly to a comparison.
      However, for the purpose of this exercise, let''s consider a hypothetical scenario
      where the locations are known:


      - If the Cathedral Basilica of St. James is at a higher latitude (further north)
      than Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral, the answer would be **YES**.

      - If the Cathedral Basilica of St. James is at a lower latitude (further south)
      than Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral, or at the same latitude, the answer
      would be **NO**.


      Since I don''t have the actual locations or a way to access real-time mapping
      data, I''ll provide a generic answer based on the process rather than actual
      geographical data.


      However, I can suggest how one might find the answer: Look up the addresses
      of both cathedrals and compare their positions on a map. If the Cathedral Basilica
      of St. James is north of Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral, the answer
      is **YES**. Otherwise, it''s **NO**.

      - The Mission Theater and Pub is also located in Portland, Oregon.


      Without specific addresses or coordinates, we can''t directly compare their

      1. **Location of Holy Name Church**: West Roxbury is a neighborhood in Boston,

      the possibility that Triumph Church could be in the southern part of Michigan,
      which would be south of many locations in Massachusetts.


      But since Massachusetts as a whole is generally southeast of Michigan, and without
      specific coordinates or city locations for Triumph Church, the most straightforward
      assumption based on state locations alone would not necessarily place Holy Name
      Church north of Triumph Church without more specific information.


      However, considering typical geographical understandings and the fact that the
      question simplifies to a comparison between two states where one (Massachusetts)

      \ state on the East Coast of the United States.\n   - Triumph Church is located\
      \ in Michigan. Michigan is a state in the Great Lakes region of the United States,\
      \ positioned west of Massachusetts but generally at a similar latitude or slightly\
      \ north, depending on the specific location within each state.\n\n2. **Consider\
      \ Geographic Positions**:\n   - Massachusetts is generally east of Michigan.\
      \ The north-south positioning depends on specific locations within these states.\n\
      \   - However, considering the general geography, parts of Michigan can be north\
      \ of parts of Massachusetts due to their respective latitudes.\n\n3. **Determine\
      \ Relative North-South Position**:\n   - Without exact addresses or coordinates,\

      \ is in Massachusetts and Triumph Church is in Michigan, and without precise\
      \ locations, the question seems to lean towards a comparison based on state-level\
      \ geography rather than exact church locations.\n   - Since Michigan and Massachusetts\
      \ overlap in latitude to some extent, but Michigan extends further north, it's\
      \ possible for parts of Michigan to be north of parts of Massachusetts.\n\n\
      However, the question asks about the specific location of Holy Name Church (West\
      \ Roxbury, Massachusetts) in relation to Triumph Church (Michigan), without\
      \ providing their exact latitudes. Given this, the most straightforward answer\
      \ based on typical geographic comparisons would consider the general positioning\

      2. **Determine the states'' general locations**: Oregon is located in the Pacific
      Northwest region of the United States, which is in the western part of the country.
      Michigan is located in the Great Lakes region, which is more towards the northeastern
      part of the United States but is considered to be in the northern part of the
      Midwest.


      3. **Consider the general north-south alignment**: Oregon is generally south
      of the northern parts of Michigan, given that Michigan extends quite far north,
      especially when considering the Upper Peninsula.


      4. **Specific locations within states**: Fourmile Lake, Oregon, is in the southern
      part of Oregon. Farmington Civic Theatre, Michigan, is in the southeastern part
      of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula, which is not as far north as the Upper Peninsula
      but is still relatively north compared to southern Oregon.

      York City. However, it''s essential to note that there was a relocation. The
      original Ziegfeld Theatre closed in 1966, but a new theater with the same name

      of Times Square, Manhattan.


      3. **Determine the Relative Locations**: To determine if the Ziegfeld Theatre
      is north of Times Square Church, we need to consider the locations mentioned.
      The original Ziegfeld Theatre was at Sixth Avenue, which runs north-south through
      Manhattan, and its address places it somewhat west and slightly north of Times
      Square. The new Ziegfeld Theatre, located at 141 West 54th Street, is definitely
      north of Times Square since 54th Street is north of the main Times Square area,

    42a01dc5-1e5e-4fd7-8e7f-20b942d6071b: 'To answer this question, let''s analyze
      it step by step:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the Duke Energy Center for the Performing Arts and Lake Tahoma. The Duke Energy
      Center for the Performing Arts is located in Raleigh, North Carolina. Lake Tahoma
      is also in North Carolina, specifically near the town of Marion.


      2. **Understand Geographic Relations**: Next, we need to understand the geographic
      relationship between Raleigh (where the Duke Energy Center is located) and Marion
      (near where Lake Tahoma is located). Raleigh is the capital of North Carolina
      and is located in the central part of the state, in the Piedmont region. Marion
      and Lake Tahoma are located in the western part of the state, closer to the
      Blue Ridge Mountains.


      3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: To determine if the Duke Energy Center
      for the Performing Arts is north of Lake Tahoma, we need to consider the north-south
      orientation of these locations within North Carolina. Generally, the western
      part of North Carolina (where Marion and Lake Tahoma are) is southwest of the
      central part (where Raleigh is).


      4. **Conclusion Based on Geography**: Given that Raleigh (and thus the Duke
      Energy Center for the Performing Arts) is in the central part of North Carolina
      and Marion (near Lake Tahoma) is in the western part, and considering the general
      geography of the state, the Duke Energy Center for the Performing Arts would
      be east and slightly north of Lake Tahoma, but primarily it''s more east than
      north in terms of direct geographic comparison.


      Given the steps above, the answer to whether the Duke Energy Center for the
      Performing Arts is located north of Lake Tahoma is more about the direct north-south
      comparison rather than the overall geographic positioning which involves both
      north-south and east-west directions.


      The final answer is: YES'

      Ana, CA is located north of Wayfarers Chapel, CA, let''s break down the process:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Calvary Church of Santa Ana, CA, and Wayfarers Chapel, CA. Calvary Church is
      in Santa Ana, which is in Orange County, California. Wayfarers Chapel is in
      Rancho Palos Verdes, also in California but in Los Angeles County.


      2. **Understand Geographic Relations**: Next, we need to understand the geographic
      relationship between these two locations. Santa Ana, where Calvary Church is
      located, is generally southeast of Rancho Palos Verdes, where Wayfarers Chapel
      is situated.


      3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: To answer the question, we must determine
      if Santa Ana (and thus Calvary Church) is north of Rancho Palos Verdes (and
      thus Wayfarers Chapel). Given the typical north-south orientation of California,
      with northern parts of the state being distinct from southern parts, we can
      consider that Los Angeles County (where Rancho Palos Verdes is located) is generally
      north of Orange County (where Santa Ana is located).


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographic locations and their relative positions,
      Calvary Church of Santa Ana, CA, is not located north of Wayfarers Chapel, CA.
      Instead, it is located south of it due to the counties'' and cities'' relative
      positions.

      2. **Understand the geography**: New Jersey (NJ) and New York (NY) are neighboring
      states in the United States. New Jersey is located to the west and south of
      New York State. However, within these states, there are specific cities and
      areas to consider for precise location.


      3. **Specific locations**: Grant USA Tower is in New Jersey. Without a specific
      city mentioned, we''ll consider New Jersey as a whole. Barrow Street Theatre
      is in New York City (NYC), which is in the southeastern part of New York State.


      4. **Compare locations**: Generally, New Jersey is south of New York State,
      especially when comparing it to New York City. However, "north of" refers to
      direction, not the state as a whole. We need to consider the latitude or the
      general north-south positioning.

      south of New York, and considering that NYC (where Barrow Street Theatre is
      located) is in the southern part of New York State, it''s reasonable to conclude
      that a location in New Jersey would be south of a location in NYC, not north.

      3. **Improv Asylum Location**: Improv Asylum is a comedy club located in Boston''s
      North End, Massachusetts. The North End is a neighborhood of Boston.


      4. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: To determine if the Kendall Cogeneration
      Station is north of Improv Asylum, we need to understand the relative positions
      of Cambridge and Boston''s North End.


      5. **Cambridge and Boston Geography**: Cambridge is located just across the
      Charles River from Boston. The North End of Boston is relatively central but
      towards the eastern part of the city, near the waterfront.


      6. **Relative Positions**: Considering the layout of the Boston area, Cambridge
      (where the Kendall Cogeneration Station is located) is generally northwest of
      the North End of Boston (where Improv Asylum is located).


      Based on these steps, since Cambridge is generally northwest of Boston''s North
      End, the Kendall Cogeneration Station in Cambridge would be considered north
      (and slightly west, but primarily north for the purposes of this question) of
      Improv Asylum in Boston''s North End.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      \ Manhattan's Grid System**:\n   - Manhattan's avenues generally run north-south,\
      \ while streets run east-west. Central Park West is an avenue that runs along\
      \ the west side of Central Park, meaning it goes north-south. The numbering\
      \ of streets increases as you go north, and the numbering of avenues (like Central\
      \ Park West) increases as you go west (though for Central Park West, the numbering\
      \ would reflect its position relative to other avenues in Manhattan).\n\n3.\
      \ **Determine the Relative Positions**:\n   - **Latitude/Longitude or Street\

      \ Central Park West is an avenue and not a street, its address doesn't directly\

      \ position relative to 92nd Street.\n\n4. **Compare North-South Positions**:\n\
      \   - The key is comparing the north-south positions. Since Brick Presbyterian\

    9c9a15b9-e28f-45f4-9e81-289ae9569e07: "To answer this question, let's break down\
      \ the steps needed:\n\n1. **Identify the locations**: \n   - **257 Central Park\
      \ West, NY**: This is an address on the west side of Central Park in Manhattan,\
      \ New York City.\n   - **Brick Presbyterian Church (New York City), NY**: This\
      \ church is located at 62 East 92nd Street, New York, NY 10128, which places\
      \ it on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.\n\n2. **Understand the geography of\
      \ Manhattan**:\n   - Manhattan is laid out in a grid pattern with avenues running\
      \ north-south and streets running east-west.\n   - Central Park is a large park\
      \ in the middle of Manhattan, stretching from 59th Street to 110th Street, and\
      \ from 5th Avenue to 8th Avenue.\n\n3. **Determine the relative positions**:\n\
      \   - **257 Central Park West** is on Central Park West, which means it is on\
      \ the west side of Central Park. The exact street number (257) can help determine\
      \ its north-south position. Given the grid system, higher numbers generally\
      \ indicate locations further north in Manhattan.\n   - **Brick Presbyterian\
      \ Church** is at East 92nd Street. This places it on the Upper East Side, east\
      \ of Central Park.\n\n4. **Compare the locations**:\n   - Since **257 Central\
      \ Park West** is directly west of Central Park and the church is at **92nd Street**\
      \ on the east side, to determine if 257 Central Park West is north of the church,\
      \ we need to establish the street address's corresponding latitude.\n   - Central\
      \ Park West's numbering starts at 59th Street (the south end of Central Park)\
      \ and goes up to 110th Street (the north end of Central Park). Therefore, 257\
      \ Central Park West would be approximately at 85th Street (as each block is\
      \ roughly 20 addresses apart in Manhattan's grid system, and 59th to 85th is\
      \ approximately 26 blocks, which would correspond to around 260 addresses, but\
      \ considering the starting point and including partial blocks, 257 would be\
      \ slightly below this but still above 81st Street).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n\
      \   - Given that **257 Central Park West** is roughly around the mid-80s in\
      \ terms of street number and thus north of 81st Street, and considering **Brick\
      \ Presbyterian Church** is at 92nd Street, it means **257 Central Park West**\
      \ is indeed **south** of the church's location.\n\nTherefore, the answer to\

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Toronto
      Lake and Cheney Reservoir in Kansas. Toronto Lake is located in Woodson County,
      and Cheney Reservoir is located in Reno and Kingman counties.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we determine their geographic positions
      relative to each other. Toronto Lake is in southeastern Kansas, and Cheney Reservoir
      is in south-central Kansas.


      3. **Compare Positions**: To decide if Toronto Lake is north of Cheney Reservoir,
      we compare their positions. Generally, southeastern Kansas is southeast, and
      south-central Kansas is more to the west and slightly north of the southeastern
      part of the state.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of Kansas and the relative
      positions of Toronto Lake and Cheney Reservoir, Toronto Lake (in the southeast)
      is likely south or southeast of Cheney Reservoir (in the south-central area),
      not north.

      is specifically located in Dallas, Texas. Dallas, Texas, is relatively north
      compared to many parts of Alabama, especially when considering the state as
      a whole.


      6. **Make a comparison**: Given that Dallas, Texas, is generally north of the
      central and southern parts of Alabama, and considering Lake Martin''s location
      in eastern Alabama, it''s reasonable to conclude that the Dal-Tex Building in
      Dallas, Texas, is indeed north of Lake Martin, Alabama.

      north of Gibraltar Dam, CA, we need to follow a few steps of reasoning:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Lake Palmdale and Gibraltar Dam. Lake Palmdale is a reservoir located in Los
      Angeles County, California. Gibraltar Dam is also located in California.


      2. **Gibraltar Dam Location**: Gibraltar Dam is situated on the Santa Ynez River
      in Santa Barbara County, California. This information is crucial for understanding
      its geographical position relative to Lake Palmdale.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Knowing that Lake Palmdale is in Los Angeles County

      \ Orientation**:\n   - To determine if Lake Accotink, VA is north of Hardy Lake,\

      \ north or south of the Equator.\n   - Virginia's latitude ranges approximately\
      \ from 36.5\xB0N to 39\xB0N.\n   - Indiana's latitude ranges approximately from\
      \ 37.8\xB0N to 41.8\xB0N.\n\n4. **Compare Latitudes**:\n   - Given that Lake\
      \ Accotink, VA could be anywhere within Virginia's latitude range (36.5\xB0\
      N to 39\xB0N) and Hardy Lake, IN could be anywhere within Indiana's latitude\
      \ range (37.8\xB0N to 41.8\xB0N), it's possible for Lake Accotink to be south\
      \ of Hardy Lake, IN, especially considering the southern parts of Virginia.\n\
      \n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Without exact coordinates, we can still make an educated\
      \ guess. Given the potential overlap and the fact that parts of Indiana are\
      \ indeed north of parts of Virginia, it's plausible that Lake Accotink could\
      \ be south of Hardy Lake, IN. However, considering the question asks for a definitive\
      \ YES or NO answer and the fact that some parts of Virginia could be north of\
      \ some parts of Indiana, the most straightforward comparison based on typical\
      \ geographic understanding would lean towards the possibility that Lake Accotink\
      \ could be south of Hardy Lake, IN, but we must consider all possibilities.\n\
      \nGiven these considerations and the need for a simple YES or NO answer, we\
      \ must recognize that without precise locations (exact latitudes and longitudes),\
      \ the question poses a challenge. However, the general geographic trend suggests\
      \ that Lake Accotink, VA is more likely to be east and possibly south of Hardy\
      \ Lake, IN, rather than definitively north. Therefore, based on general geographic\
      \ principles and without exact coordinates, the answer to whether Lake Accotink,\
      \ VA is located north of Hardy Lake, IN would likely be NO, considering the\
      \ broader geographic context and the typical orientation of these states. \n\

      \ Without precise GPS coordinates or a detailed map, the exact north-south relationship\

      on the West Coast of the United States, while Missouri is located in the Midwestern
      United States, significantly to the east of California.


      3. **North-South Orientation**: We then consider the north-south orientation.
      Stockton Lake, MO, being in the Midwest, would generally be at a lower latitude
      (more south) than many parts of California, considering the overall geography
      of the United States.


      4. **Specific Locations**: Without exact coordinates, we can still infer that
      since California is to the west and generally at a higher latitude (more north)
      than Missouri, any location in California would likely be north of many locations
      in Missouri, including Stockton Lake.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical layout of the United States and the
      relative positions of California and Missouri, it is reasonable to conclude
      that Hawke Castle, CA, would indeed be located north of Stockton Lake, MO.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      Gaston, NC, and Boone Lake, TN. Lake Gaston is a lake along the North Carolina-Virginia
      border, and Boone Lake is in Tennessee.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we need to understand their geographic
      positions relative to each other. Generally, North Carolina is east of Tennessee,
      and Virginia is north of both North Carolina and Tennessee.


      3. **Specific Lake Locations**: Lake Gaston is situated on the border of North
      Carolina and Virginia. Boone Lake, on the other hand, is in northeastern Tennessee.


      4. **Compare Latitudes**: To determine if Lake Gaston is north of Boone Lake,
      we need to compare their latitudes. Lake Gaston spans across the North Carolina-Virginia
      border, which places it at a higher latitude than Boone Lake in Tennessee.

      and Rondout Reservoir is in New York (NY).


      2. **Determine geographical positions**: Generally, Connecticut is located south

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations mentioned
      in the question. House VI, CT refers to a house located in Connecticut, and
      Rondout Reservoir, NY refers to a reservoir located in New York.


      2. **Geographical Context**: Understanding the geographical context is crucial.
      Connecticut (CT) is a state located in the northeastern United States, and New
      York (NY) is also a state in the same region, with Connecticut situated to the
      east of New York.


      3. **Specific Locations**: House VI is a specific house designed by Peter Eisenman,
      located in Cornwall, Connecticut. Rondout Reservoir is located in the Catskill
      Mountains of New York State.


      4. **Comparative Geography**: To determine if House VI, CT is located north
      of Rondout Reservoir, NY, we need to understand the relative positions of these
      locations. The Catskill Mountains, where the Rondout Reservoir is situated,
      are generally southwest of Cornwall, Connecticut, considering the broader geographical
      layout of the region.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations and their relative positions,
      House VI in Connecticut is generally east and slightly north of the Rondout
      Reservoir in New York. However, the key factor here is whether it is specifically
      "north" of the reservoir. Given the proximity and the fact that Connecticut
      is directly east of New York, with parts of Connecticut being north of parts
      of New York, we can conclude that House VI, being in the western part of Connecticut,
      is likely north of the Rondout Reservoir, considering their specific locations.

      1. **Identify Locations**: \n   - Belden Place is a small alley in San Francisco,\
      \ California. It's known for its European-style ambiance and is located in the\
      \ heart of the city's financial district.\n   - The Queen Anne Hotel is also\
      \ located in San Francisco, California. It is known for its historic architecture\
      \ and its reputation as one of the city's most haunted hotels.\n\n2. **Determine\
      \ Geographic Relationship**:\n   - Since both locations are in San Francisco,\
      \ the next step is to understand their relative positions within the city. \n\
      \   - Belden Place is near the intersection of Pine and Bush Streets in the\
      \ financial district.\n   - The Queen Anne Hotel is located on Sutter Street.\n\
      \n3. **Compare Locations**:\n   - The financial district, where Belden Place\

    d8ab0864-61db-4217-b7b2-fe1f12fa1ac8: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps needed to determine if Herb Parsons Lake, TN is located north of the
      Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Memphis, Tennessee.


      1. **Identify the location of Herb Parsons Lake, TN**: Herb Parsons Lake is
      located in Fayette County, Tennessee. It''s a lake known for fishing and is
      situated a bit east of Memphis.


      2. **Identify the location of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in
      Memphis, Tennessee**: The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception is located
      in downtown Memphis, Tennessee. This gives us a clear point of reference in
      the city.


      3. **Compare the locations**: To determine if Herb Parsons Lake is north of
      the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, we need to understand the general
      geography of the area. Memphis is in southwestern Tennessee, and Fayette County,
      where Herb Parsons Lake is located, is east of Memphis but still in the southwestern
      part of the state.


      4. **Determine the directional relationship**: Since Herb Parsons Lake is in
      Fayette County, which is east of Memphis, and not significantly north (as both
      locations are in the southwestern part of Tennessee), we can infer that it is
      not north of the cathedral in Memphis. Instead, it''s more to the east.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is: **NO**'
    dc788fcc-0623-461d-985a-6b6a012c534b: 'To determine if Herb Parsons Lake, TN is
      located north of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception (Memphis, Tennessee),
      TN, let''s break down the process:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Herb Parsons Lake and the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Memphis,
      Tennessee.


      2. **Herb Parsons Lake Location**: Herb Parsons Lake is located in Fayette County,
      Tennessee. It''s known for its fishing and is situated near the city of Collierville,
      which is in the Memphis metropolitan area but east of Memphis.


      3. **Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception Location**: The Cathedral of the
      Immaculate Conception is located in Memphis, Tennessee, specifically in the
      downtown area. This means it is within the city limits of Memphis.


      4. **Compare Locations**: To determine if Herb Parsons Lake is north of the
      Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, we need to consider their relative positions.
      Memphis, where the cathedral is located, is in southwestern Tennessee. Fayette
      County, where Herb Parsons Lake is situated, is east of Memphis but not directly
      north.


      5. **Geographical Orientation**: Generally, locations that are directly north
      would be on a line that extends upwards from Memphis towards the northern parts
      of Tennessee or beyond. Since Herb Parsons Lake is more eastward than northward
      from Memphis, this suggests it is not directly north of the cathedral.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations and their relative positions,
      Herb Parsons Lake, being east of Memphis rather than directly north, indicates
      that it is not located north of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in
      Memphis, Tennessee.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Camanche Reservoir is located in California (CA),
      and Guist Creek Lake is located in Kentucky (KY).


      2. **Understand the geography of the United States**: California is on the West
      Coast, while Kentucky is in the Eastern part of the United States.


      3. **Determine the general latitudinal positions**: California is generally
      at a higher latitude than Kentucky. This is because California stretches from
      the Mexican border (at a relatively low latitude) up towards the Oregon border
      (at a higher latitude), while Kentucky is situated more centrally in terms of
      north-south positioning within the eastern United States, below the states like
      New York and above states like Florida.


      4. **Specific locations within states**: Camanche Reservoir is in the northern
      part of California''s Central Valley. Guist Creek Lake is in Shelby County,
      Kentucky.


      5. **Latitude comparison**: Given that California is west and generally north
      of Kentucky, and considering the continental United States'' geography, a location
      in northern California (like Camanche Reservoir) would indeed be north of a
      location in Kentucky (like Guist Creek Lake), regardless of their specific longitudes.

      2. **Understand Geographic Relations**: Next, we consider the geographic relationship
      between Texas and Arizona. Texas is located in the south-central United States,

      TX is located north of Sahuarita Lake, AZ, let''s analyze the information step
      by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Panther
      Creek Wind Farm and Sahuarita Lake. Panther Creek Wind Farm is located in Texas
      (TX), and Sahuarita Lake is in Arizona (AZ).


      2. **Understand Geography**: Next, we should understand the general geography
      of the United States, specifically the locations of Texas and Arizona. Texas
      is located in the southern United States, and Arizona is in the southwestern
      part of the country.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Comparing the two locations, we know that Texas is
      generally east and slightly north of Arizona. However, the specific locations
      within these states (Panther Creek Wind Farm in TX and Sahuarita Lake in AZ)
      need to be considered for an accurate comparison.


      4. **Latitude Comparison**: To determine if one location is north of the other,
      we need to compare their latitudes. Without specific coordinates, we can make
      a general assumption based on the states'' positions. Texas extends further
      north than Arizona, but the southern parts of Texas are at a similar latitude

      5. **Conclusion Based on State Locations**: Given that Texas as a whole is not
      exclusively north of Arizona (since parts of Texas are at similar latitudes
      to parts of Arizona), we must consider the specific regions within these states.
      Panther Creek Wind Farm is in Texas, and Sahuarita Lake is in southern Arizona.
      Southern Arizona is generally at a lower latitude than most of Texas.


      6. **Final Decision**: Since Panther Creek Wind Farm is in Texas and Sahuarita
      Lake is in southern Arizona, and considering that the southern part of Texas
      can be at a similar latitude or even slightly south of the southern part of
      Arizona, the question of whether Panther Creek Wind Farm is north of Sahuarita
      Lake depends on their exact latitudes. However, given the general geography,
      it''s plausible that parts of Texas, including where Panther Creek Wind Farm
      might be located, could be north of southern Arizona.


      Given these steps and the general knowledge that Texas can extend further north

    9f7c8afe-14cb-4cdd-99a9-83cc2b896d4c: "To determine if the Panther Creek Wind\
      \ Farm in Texas is located north of Sahuarita Lake in Arizona, let's break down\
      \ the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Locations**: \n   - Panther Creek Wind Farm\
      \ is in Texas (TX).\n   - Sahuarita Lake is in Arizona (AZ).\n\n2. **Understand\
      \ Geographic Relations**:\n   - Texas is located in the southern United States.\n\
      \   - Arizona is also in the southern United States but is west of Texas.\n\n\
      3. **Compare Latitudes**:\n   - To determine if one location is north of another,\
      \ we compare their latitudes. The location with the higher latitude is north\
      \ of the location with the lower latitude.\n   - Texas' latitude ranges approximately\
      \ from 25.8\xB0N to 36.5\xB0N.\n   - Arizona's latitude ranges from about 31.3\xB0\
      N to 37.0\xB0N.\n\n4. **Specific Locations**:\n   - Without the exact latitudes\
      \ of Panther Creek Wind Farm and Sahuarita Lake, we can make a general assumption\
      \ based on the states' positions. However, knowing that Sahuarita Lake is in\
      \ southern Arizona, its latitude is likely on the lower end of Arizona's range,\
      \ possibly around 32\xB0N or slightly higher, given Sahuarita's location near\
      \ Tucson, AZ.\n   - Panther Creek Wind Farm, being in Texas, could potentially\
      \ be at a lower latitude than parts of Arizona, considering Texas extends further\
      \ south than Arizona does.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the general geographic\
      \ information, without exact coordinates, it's reasonable to deduce that Panther\
      \ Creek Wind Farm could be south of Sahuarita Lake, especially considering Texas\
      \ extends further south than Arizona. However, the exact determination depends\
      \ on the specific latitudes of these locations. Still, based on typical geography\

    9fdb61d5-2e61-48f0-859b-73ef2e8322f4: 'To answer this question, I need to determine
      the locations of Cadle Tabernacle and BMO Plaza in Indiana and compare their
      positions.


      1. **Identify Cadle Tabernacle**: First, I need to identify what Cadle Tabernacle
      is. Cadle Tabernacle is a large church or auditorium, but without more context,
      it''s hard to pinpoint its exact location. Assuming it''s in Indiana, I would
      need to know the city or town.


      2. **Identify BMO Plaza**: BMO Plaza is likely a reference to a building or
      complex named after the Bank of Montreal (BMO), which has operations in the
      United States, including Indiana. In Indianapolis, there is a BMO Plaza.


      3. **Determine Locations**: Without exact addresses, I''ll assume Cadle Tabernacle
      is in Indianapolis, as it''s a significant city in Indiana, and BMO Plaza is
      also in Indianapolis. Cadle Tabernacle, if it exists in Indianapolis, would
      be compared against the location of BMO Plaza in the same city.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Since both locations are assumed to be in Indianapolis,
      to determine if Cadle Tabernacle is north of BMO Plaza, I''d need the exact
      addresses or a detailed map. However, for the sake of this exercise, let''s
      assume I found that Cadle Tabernacle is indeed located in Indianapolis.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Assumptions**: Given the lack of specific information
      about Cadle Tabernacle''s exact location in relation to BMO Plaza in Indianapolis,
      and considering the question requires a definitive YES or NO answer, I must
      proceed with the assumption that both are in the same city. Without precise
      locations, I''d typically look for addresses, but for the sake of argument,
      let''s say I''ve done that research.


      Based on typical research, if Cadle Tabernacle were in Indianapolis, and assuming
      BMO Plaza''s location is known (e.g., downtown Indianapolis), determining if
      it''s north would depend on the exact address of Cadle Tabernacle. However,
      the question seems to suggest a comparison that implies both are known entities
      in Indiana, possibly in the same city, given the state abbreviation "IN" is
      used for both.


      Given these steps and the nature of the question, the final answer would depend
      on the actual geographic locations of these two entities within Indiana. However,
      without access to real-time data or specific addresses at this moment, I will
      provide a hypothetical answer based on a typical scenario where such information

      the locations of Mammoth Pool Reservoir and Five Wounds Portuguese National
      Church, and then compare their positions.


      1. **Location of Mammoth Pool Reservoir, CA**: Mammoth Pool Reservoir is located
      in the Sierra National Forest, California. It is situated in the eastern part
      of the state, near the city of Fresno but more towards the eastern side of the
      Sierra Nevada mountain range.


      2. **Location of Five Wounds Portuguese National Church, CA**: This church is
      located in San Jose, California. San Jose is in the western part of California,
      in the San Francisco Bay Area, which places it on the western side of the state.


      3. **Comparing Locations**: Given that Mammoth Pool Reservoir is in the eastern
      part of California and Five Wounds Portuguese National Church is in the western
      part, near San Jose, we can conclude that Mammoth Pool Reservoir is east of
      the church. However, the question asks if it is located north of the church.


      4. **Determining North-South Orientation**: San Jose is generally south of the
      eastern Sierra Nevada area where Mammoth Pool Reservoir is located. The reservoir
      is more northward in relation to San Jose, considering the general geography
      of California.


      Therefore, based on the geographical locations and their relative positions,
      the answer to whether Mammoth Pool Reservoir, CA is located north of Five Wounds
      Portuguese National Church, CA is: **YES**.'

      positions. San Jose, where the church is, is generally south of the Sierra National
      Forest area, where Mammoth Pool Reservoir is located.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Mammoth Pool Reservoir is in the eastern-central
      part of California and Five Wounds Portuguese National Church is in the northern
      part of the state but more towards the west (in San Jose), we need to consider
      their relative north-south positions. San Jose is south of the general area

      To answer this question, we need to determine the geographical locations of
      both the Ambassador Theatre in St. Louis, Missouri, and Madrona Manor in California,
      and then compare their positions relative to each other.


      1. **Identify the location of Ambassador Theatre (St. Louis), MO**: St. Louis,
      Missouri is located in the Midwestern United States.


      2. **Identify the location of Madrona Manor, CA**: Madrona Manor is in California,
      which is on the West Coast of the United States.


      3. **Determine the general geographical relationship between Missouri and California**:
      Missouri is located east of California.


      4. **Consider the north-south axis**: Without specific latitude information,
      we generally know that parts of California can be both north and south of parts
      of Missouri, depending on the specific locations within each state. However,
      St. Louis, Missouri, is relatively in the northern part of the United States
      when compared to the southern parts of California but is south of the northern
      parts of California.


      5. **Madrona Manor''s specific location in California**: Since I don''t have
      the specific details on Madrona Manor''s exact location within California (whether
      it''s in the northern, central, or southern part), we must consider the general
      geography. California spans a significant latitude range, with its northern
      parts being farther north than Missouri and its southern parts being farther
      south.


      Given the information and the steps above, to accurately answer whether the
      Ambassador Theatre in St. Louis, MO, is located north of Madrona Manor, CA,
      we need to know the specific location of Madrona Manor within California. However,
      since the question requires a YES or NO answer without this specific detail,
      we must make a general assessment based on typical geographical knowledge.


      Since St. Louis, MO, is generally east and somewhat central in terms of north-south
      positioning in the United States, and without the exact location of Madrona
      Manor, it''s challenging to definitively say yes or no without more specific
      information. However, considering the broad question and the need for a binary
      answer, we can consider that parts of California (especially the northern parts)
      are indeed north of Missouri. But since the question is about a specific location
      (Madrona Manor) in California, and without knowing if it''s in the northern
      or southern part of the state, the most straightforward approach based on general
      knowledge would lean towards considering the potential for Madrona Manor to
      be in a part of California that could be either north or south of St. Louis,
      MO.


      Given this, a definitive YES or NO without more specific location details for
      Madrona Manor involves some degree of uncertainty. However, the question''s
      nature demands a choice. Considering typical geographical layouts and the fact
      that significant parts of California are indeed north of Missouri, but acknowledging
      that specific locations within California can vary significantly in latitude,
      the answer could lean towards a possibility but isn''t definitive without more
      specific location data for Madrona Manor.


      Therefore, based on the steps of reasoning and considering the need for a binary
      answer, the response, keeping in mind the lack of specificity about Madrona
      Manor''s exact location, would be guided by the understanding that St. Louis,
      MO, could be south of northern parts of California but without the specific
      location of Madrona Manor, the answer could be misleading. Thus, considering
      a general approach and the typical geographical layout, the answer would be
      NO, acknowledging that this is based on incomplete information regarding Madrona
      Manor''s exact location within California.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$'

    b21152b9-08fe-4672-bc61-cccd5bffa235: 'To determine if Jim Chapman Lake, TX is
      located north of Wright Patman Lake, TX, we need to establish the geographical
      locations of both lakes.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, let''s identify where each lake is located.
      Jim Chapman Lake, previously known as Cooper Lake, is located in northeast Texas,
      roughly between the cities of Sulphur Springs and Cooper. Wright Patman Lake
      is also located in northeast Texas but is closer to the city of Texarkana.


      2. **Compare Positions**: To compare their positions, we consider their proximity
      to major cities or landmarks. Wright Patman Lake is near Texarkana, which is
      on the Texas-Arkansas border. Jim Chapman Lake is situated more centrally within
      northeast Texas, away from the Arkansas border.


      3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Given that both lakes are in northeast
      Texas, the determining factor will be their relative positions along the north-south
      axis. Texarkana, being near the Arkansas border, suggests that Wright Patman
      Lake is positioned relatively north compared to other parts of northeast Texas.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations, Jim Chapman Lake is
      south of Wright Patman Lake because Wright Patman Lake is closer to the Arkansas
      border, placing it more to the north in the context of northeast Texas.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$'

      \ asks if the O'Reilly Theater is located north of the Harris Theater, both\
      \ in Pittsburgh, PA.\n\n3. **Consider Pittsburgh's layout**: Pittsburgh has\
      \ a complex layout with three rivers (Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio) and\
      \ many hills, which can make directions somewhat counterintuitive. However,\
      \ without specific knowledge of the exact locations of these theaters relative\
      \ to each other, one might assume that both are part of Pittsburgh's cultural\
      \ district, given their names and the city's pattern of cultural venues.\n\n\
      4. **Determine the relevance of exact addresses**: \n   - The O'Reilly Theater's\

      \ address is 809 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15222.\n\n5. **Compare locations**:\n\
      \   - Both theaters are in the 15222 zip code, suggesting they are relatively\
      \ close to each other within the city.\n   - To determine if one is north of\
      \ the other, we'd typically look at the street layout. In Pittsburgh, Liberty\
      \ Avenue and Penn Avenue are both significant streets in the downtown area,\
      \ but without specific directional knowledge, one might need a map to ascertain\
      \ their exact relationship.\n\n6. **Conclusion based on available data**:\n\
      \   - Given that both theaters are in the downtown/cultural district area and\
      \ without precise directional information or a map, it's challenging to definitively\
      \ say one is north of the other based solely on their names and the fact they're\
      \ both in Pittsburgh.\n\nHowever, considering the need for a YES or NO answer\
      \ and acknowledging the lack of detailed spatial information provided here,\
      \ let's simplify: If we had to make an educated guess based on typical urban\
      \ layouts and without specific knowledge of these theaters' relative positions,\
      \ we might err towards assuming they could be in close proximity but not necessarily\
      \ determine their north-south relationship without more data.\n\nGiven the addresses:\n\
      - O'Reilly Theater is at 621 Penn Avenue.\n- Harris Theater is at 809 Liberty\
      \ Avenue.\n\nLiberty Avenue and Penn Avenue intersect in the downtown area.\
      \ The address numbers suggest that Harris Theater (809 Liberty Avenue) is further\
      \ down Liberty Avenue compared to the starting point of Penn Avenue where O'Reilly\
      \ Theater is located. However, this doesn't directly answer the north-south\
      \ question without knowing the orientation of these streets relative to cardinal\
      \ directions in this part of Pittsburgh.\n\n**Final Step**: Since I must provide\
      \ a YES or NO answer and considering the information provided does not directly\
      \ answer the question without assuming the layout and cardinal directions of\
      \ Pittsburgh's streets, I will have to make a decision based on the assumption\

      \ break down the steps needed to find the answer:\n\n1. **Identify Locations**:\
      \ First, we need to identify the exact locations of both the O'Reilly Theater\
      \ and the Harris Theater in Pittsburgh, PA. \n\n2. **O'Reilly Theater Location**:\
      \ The O'Reilly Theater is located in the Pittsburgh Cultural District. Specifically,\
      \ its address is 621 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15222.\n\n3. **Harris Theater\
      \ Location**: The Harris Theater, also in the Pittsburgh Cultural District,\
      \ is located at 809 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15222.\n\n4. **Compare Locations**:\
      \ To determine if one is north of the other, we need to compare their locations\
      \ relative to each other. \n\n   - **Latitude Comparison**: Generally, the farther\
      \ north a location is, the higher its latitude. By comparing the latitudes of\
      \ the two theaters, we can determine their relative north-south positioning.\n\
      \   \n   - **Street Grid**: Pittsburgh's street grid can also provide clues.\
      \ In many cities, including Pittsburgh, streets are laid out in a grid pattern\
      \ where avenues run north-south and streets run east-west. However, Pittsburgh's\
      \ grid is somewhat irregular due to its hilly terrain and historical development.\
      \ Still, generally speaking, if one location is on a higher numbered street\
      \ or avenue than another, it might be farther north, depending on the orientation\
      \ of the grid in that specific area.\n\n5. **Specific Comparison**:\n   - The\
      \ O'Reilly Theater is at 621 Penn Avenue.\n   - The Harris Theater is at 809\
      \ Liberty Avenue.\n   \n   Without specific latitude and longitude coordinates\
      \ or a detailed map, we can make an educated guess based on the street names\

      \ the numbering and layout might not strictly follow a typical grid pattern\
      \ due to the city's unique topography and historical development.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\
      \ Given the addresses and assuming a somewhat regular grid pattern where higher\
      \ street numbers indicate a more northern location (which might not strictly\
      \ apply in Pittsburgh's case), we would still need to consider the actual layout\
      \ and how avenues and streets intersect in the Cultural District. \n\nHowever,\
      \ based on typical grid patterns and without more detailed geographical information,\
      \ we might incorrectly assume that a higher street number (809 for Harris Theater\

      \ require such information.\n\n**Answer**: To provide a definitive YES or NO\
      \ based on the steps outlined, we recognize the process involves identifying\
      \ locations, comparing them, and making a determination based on geographical\
      \ principles. However, the actual determination of whether the O'Reilly Theater\
      \ is north of the Harris Theater in Pittsburgh requires specific geographical\
      \ data or a detailed map of the area, which hasn't been consulted in this step-by-step\
      \ reasoning.\n\nGiven this, the answer should be based on actual geographical\
      \ research or mapping, which we've acknowledged as necessary but not executed\
      \ here. Thus, without executing the final step of geographical comparison, the\

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to identify the locations of both the
      Fitzgerald Theater and the In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre
      in Minnesota.


      2. **Fitzgerald Theater Location**: The Fitzgerald Theater is located in Saint
      Paul, Minnesota. It''s a historic theater known for hosting a variety of performances,
      including concerts and lectures, and it''s the home of the radio variety show
      "A Prairie Home Companion."


      3. **In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre Location**: This theatre
      is located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It''s known for its innovative puppetry
      and mask performances, often incorporating social and environmental themes into
      its productions.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Saint Paul and Minneapolis are both part of the Twin
      Cities metropolitan area in Minnesota but are distinct cities. Generally, Minneapolis
      is located west and slightly north of Saint Paul, but the specific locations
      of these theaters within their respective cities will determine their relative
      positions to each other.


      5. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Without exact addresses, we can consider
      the general layout of the Twin Cities. Minneapolis is generally to the west
      and slightly north of Saint Paul. However, the Fitzgerald Theater is in downtown
      Saint Paul, and the In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre is in
      the Powderhorn Park neighborhood of Minneapolis, which is south of downtown
      Minneapolis.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given the general locations, the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint
      Paul is likely south of the In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre
      in Minneapolis if considering the cities as a whole. However, the exact addresses
      are necessary for a precise determination. Assuming the addresses place the
