      1. First, I''ll locate New Melones Dam in California:

      - New Melones Dam is located in Calaveras County, California

      - This is in the central/eastern part of California


      2. Next, I''ll locate Pomme de Terre Lake in Missouri:

      - Pomme de Terre Lake is located in west-central Missouri

      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - California is west of Missouri

      - New Melones Dam is in eastern California

      - Pomme de Terre Lake is in western Missouri


      4. Reasoning about their relative north-south position:

      - California is generally at a lower latitude than Missouri

      - This means New Melones Dam is SOUTH of Pomme de Terre Lake


      5. Therefore, the answer to "Is New Melones Dam, CA located north of Pomme de

      1. First, I''ll locate Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles

      - It is located in the Koreatown area of Los Angeles

      - Specifically, it''s at 3300 Wilshire Blvd


      2. Next, I''ll locate Mark Taper Forum

      - It is located in the Music Center complex in Downtown Los Angeles

      - Its address is 135 N Grand Ave


      3. Now I''ll compare their geographic positions

      - Wilshire Blvd (where the church is) is south of Grand Ave (where Mark Taper
      Forum is)

      - This means the church is located SOUTH of the Mark Taper Forum


      4. The question asks: "Is Immanuel Presbyterian Church located NORTH of Mark
      Taper Forum?"

      - Based on the geographic positions, the answer is NO
