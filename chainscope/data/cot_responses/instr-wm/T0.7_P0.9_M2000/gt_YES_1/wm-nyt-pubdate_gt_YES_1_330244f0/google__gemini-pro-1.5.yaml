      "Taliban Launch Deadly Attack in Kabul" was from various dates, as this is a
      recurring event. To be accurate, I need a specific instance of this headline.  However,
      assuming a recent example, it is highly likely the Taliban attacks in Kabul
      mentioned in the NYT were *after* 2014.

      * "Deputy President of Kenya Goes on Trial in The Hague" refers to William Ruto''s
      trial, which began in September 2013.

      * "Dutch Peacekeepers Are Found Responsible for Deaths" refers to the Srebrenica
      massacre, and related findings/reports were published over many years.  To be
      precise, I''d need more information about *which* report/finding the question
      refers to.  However, the Srebrenica massacre itself occurred in July 1995, and
      subsequent reports and findings would have been published *after* that date.


      Since 2013 is later than 1995 (and any subsequent reports related to the massacre),
      the answer is YES.
