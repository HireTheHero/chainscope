      China Sea, a Far Bigger Test of Power Looms," I''ll guide you through a logical
      process:


      1. **Identify the Articles**: First, I would need to identify the specific New
      York Times (NYT) articles titled "U.S. Senators Say South Korea Should Not Hire
      China Firm" and "In the East China Sea, a Far Bigger Test of Power Looms." This
      step is crucial because without knowing the exact articles, we cannot proceed.


      2. **Find Publication Dates**: Once the articles are identified, I would typically
      search for their publication dates. The NYT and other news outlets usually include
      the publication date with each article.


      3. **Compare Publication Dates**: After obtaining the publication dates of both
      articles, I would compare them to determine which one was published later.


      Without access to real-time data or specific archives of the NYT at this moment,
      I''ll guide you through a hypothetical reasoning process based on typical practices:


      - If "U.S. Senators Say South Korea Should Not Hire China Firm" was published
      on a later date than "In the East China Sea, a Far Bigger Test of Power Looms,"
      the answer would be YES.

      - If "U.S. Senators Say South Korea Should Not Hire China Firm" was published
      on the same date or an earlier date than "In the East China Sea, a Far Bigger
      Test of Power Looms," the answer would be NO.


      Given the nature of this task, which requires specific information about the
      publication dates of the mentioned articles, and without the ability to access
      or search the NYT archives in real-time, I must rely on a general approach to
      answering such questions.


      Therefore, based on the process outlined and without specific details on the

      Joins Meeting of Arab League" was published later than "Lawmaker Says Britons
      Agree to New Press Rules After Hacking Scandal," we would typically follow these
      steps:


      1. **Identify the articles**: First, we need to ensure we have the correct articles
      from The New York Times (NYT). In this case, the two articles in question are
      "Syrian Opposition Joins Meeting of Arab League" and "Lawmaker Says Britons
      Agree to New Press Rules After Hacking Scandal."


      2. **Find publication dates**: Next, we need to find the publication dates for
      each article. Without access to the NYT database or archives at this moment,
      I can only provide a hypothetical process. Normally, one would look up the publication
      dates in the NYT archives or online.


      3. **Compare the dates**: Once we have the publication dates, we can compare
      them. If the date of "Syrian Opposition Joins Meeting of Arab League" is later
      than the date of "Lawmaker Says Britons Agree to New Press Rules After Hacking
      Scandal," the answer is yes. Otherwise, it''s no.


      However, without the ability to access the NYT database or archives in real-time,
      I must rely on the information given in the question, which does not include
      the publication dates. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based
      on the steps outlined.


      Given the format requested, which requires a YES or NO answer, I must emphasize
      that the answer depends on the specific publication dates of the articles. Since
      I don''t have access to that information, I must choose based on the general
      reasoning provided:

      and "Lawmaker Says Britons Agree to New Press Rules After Hacking Scandal."
      This step is crucial because without knowing the exact articles, we cannot proceed.

      \ the publication dates of the two articles mentioned:\n\n1. \"Dutch Peacekeepers\
      \ Are Found Responsible for Deaths\"\n2. \"Germany Sends 30 Death Camp Cases\
      \ to Local Prosecutors\"\n\nGiven that the actual dates are not provided in\
      \ the question, we'll have to rely on general knowledge or research to find\
      \ out when these articles were published. \n\nHowever, without direct access\
      \ to The New York Times (NYT) database or archives at this moment, I'll guide\
      \ you through a logical approach to solving this:\n\n- **Step 1:** Identify\
      \ the subjects of both articles. The first article is about Dutch peacekeepers\
      \ being found responsible for deaths, and the second is about Germany sending\
      \ death camp cases to local prosecutors.\n\n- **Step 2:** Recall any significant\
      \ events or timelines related to these subjects. The Netherlands has a history\
      \ of involvement in peacekeeping missions, and Germany's history includes dealing\
      \ with the aftermath of World War II and the Holocaust.\n\n- **Step 3:** Consider\
      \ the timeline of significant events related to these topics. The Dutch peacekeepers'\
      \ responsibility for deaths could have happened at any point during their peacekeeping\
      \ missions, which have spanned decades. Germany's handling of death camp cases\
      \ could have occurred at various points post-World War II.\n\n- **Step 4:**\
      \ Compare the timelines. Without exact dates, we can only speculate based on\
      \ general knowledge. The finding of responsibility for the Dutch peacekeepers\
      \ and the handling of death camp cases by Germany could have happened at any\
      \ point within the broader timelines of their respective histories.\n\nSince\
      \ I don't have real-time access to NYT archives or the specific publication\
      \ dates of these articles, and given the nature of the question requires a precise\
      \ yes or no answer based on actual publication dates, I must rely on the information\

      \ sharing among Western allies, and the second is about Pope Francis offering\
      \ a mass on an island that serves as a beacon for refugees.\n\n- **Step 2:**\
      \ Recall any significant events or timelines related to these subjects. Pope\
      \ Francis has been vocal about refugee issues, and his visits to places like\
      \ Lampedusa, an island off the coast of Italy, have been significant in drawing\
      \ attention to the refugee crisis.\n\n- **Step 3:** Consider the timeline of\
      \ significant events related to intelligence sharing among Western allies. The\
      \ history of intelligence sharing is extensive, and it would be challenging\
      \ to pinpoint a specific event without more context.\n\n- **Step 4:** Compare\
      \ the timelines. Without exact dates, we can only speculate based on general\
      \ knowledge. The publication of \"For Western Allies, a Long History of Swapping\
      \ Intelligence\" could have been at any point, given the broad nature of the\
      \ topic. The publication of \"Pope Offers Mass on Island Beacon for Refugees\"\
      \ might have coincided with Pope Francis's visit to Lampedusa in 2013 or with\
      \ other significant events related to his advocacy for refugees.\n\nSince I\
      \ don't have real-time access to NYT archives or the specific publication dates\

      \ yes or no answer based on actual publication dates, I must rely on the information\

      information typically available about New York Times (NYT) articles.


      1. **Identify the articles**: First, we need to identify the specific NYT articles
      titled "U.S. and China Find Convergence on Climate Issue" and "Typhoon Revives
      Debate on U.S. Food Aid Methods." This step is crucial because without knowing
      the exact articles, we cannot proceed.


      2. **Find publication dates**: Once the articles are identified, the next step
      is to find their publication dates. The New York Times and other news outlets
      typically include the publication date with each article.


      3. **Compare publication dates**: After obtaining the publication dates of both
      articles, we compare them to determine which one was published later.


      Without access to real-time data or specific archives of the NYT at this moment,
      I''ll guide you through a hypothetical reasoning process based on typical practices:


      - If "U.S. and China Find Convergence on Climate Issue" was published on a later
      date than "Typhoon Revives Debate on U.S. Food Aid Methods," the answer would
      be YES.

      - If "U.S. and China Find Convergence on Climate Issue" was published on the
      same date or an earlier date than "Typhoon Revives Debate on U.S. Food Aid Methods,"
      the answer would be NO.


      Given the nature of this task, which requires specific information about the
      publication dates of the mentioned articles, and without the ability to access
      or search the NYT archives in real-time, I must rely on a general approach to
      answering such questions.


      Therefore, based on the process outlined and without specific details on the
      publication dates, I am unable to provide a definitive YES or NO answer directly
      from the information given in the question. However, following the instructions
      for the format of the response, and acknowledging that a direct answer is requested:

      Times (NYT) articles mentioned in the question. Without specific access to the
      NYT database or archives at this moment, I would typically use a search engine

      4. **Consider Contextual Clues**: If the publication dates are not readily available,

      answer would be YES.

      - If "Militants Attack U.N. Compound in Somalia''s Capital" was published on

      - **Step 2**: Recall any significant events or timelines related to these subjects.
      The Bolshoi Ballet has been in the news for various scandals, including bribery
      allegations, over the years. Hezbollah has been involved in the Syrian conflict
      since its early stages, and its role has been a topic of discussion and news

      The Bolshoi Ballet''s bribery scandal could have occurred at any point in recent
      years, while Hezbollah''s involvement in Syria has been ongoing since 2012.


      - **Step 4**: Compare the timelines. Without exact dates, we can only speculate

      quitting the Bolshoi Ballet due to bribery allegations.

      The Iran sanctions and the Bolshoi Ballet scandal could have occurred at different
      times, but without specific dates, it''s challenging to determine.

      becomes available. However, without specific dates, it''s hard to be certain.

      a few logical steps:


      1. **Identify the Articles**: The two articles in question are "Taliban Launch
      Deadly Attack in Kabul" and "Taliban Flag Is Gone in Qatar, but Talks Remain
      in Doubt." These are specific articles from The New York Times (NYT).


      2. **Determine the Publication Dates**: We need to find out when each of these
      articles was published. Typically, this information is available in the NYT
      archives or on the articles themselves.


      3. **Compare the Dates**: Once we have the publication dates, we can compare
      them to determine which article was published later. If "Taliban Launch Deadly
      Attack in Kabul" was published after "Taliban Flag Is Gone in Qatar, but Talks
      Remain in Doubt," the answer is YES. If it was published before or on the same
      day, the answer is NO.


      Given that I don''t have access to real-time data or the ability to browse the
      internet at this moment, I can''t provide the specific publication dates for
      these articles. However, based on the general approach to answering such questions,
      I can guide you through the process.


      - If "Taliban Launch Deadly Attack in Kabul" was published after "Taliban Flag
      Is Gone in Qatar, but Talks Remain in Doubt," the answer would be YES.

      - If "Taliban Launch Deadly Attack in Kabul" was published before or on the
      same day as "Taliban Flag Is Gone in Qatar, but Talks Remain in Doubt," the
      answer would be NO.


      Since I don''t have the actual publication dates, I must clarify that the answer

      May Face Russian Piracy Charges" and "Netanyahu Is Said to View Iran Deal as

      2. **Find Publication Dates**: Next, we need to find the publication dates of
      these articles. The NYT and other news outlets usually include the publication
      date with each article.


      3. **Compare the Dates**: Once we have the publication dates, we can compare
      them. If the publication date of "Greenpeace Activists May Face Russian Piracy
      Charges" is later than the publication date of "Netanyahu Is Said to View Iran
      Deal as a Possible Trap," the answer is YES.


      Given the nature of this task, which requires specific information about the
      publication dates of the mentioned articles, and without the ability to access
      or search the NYT archives in real-time, I must rely on a general approach to

      2. **Find publication dates**: Typically, news articles have a date or timestamp
      indicating when they were published. Without access to the NYT database or archives
      at this moment, I can only assume that these dates are available.


      3. **Compare the dates**: If "Discussing Iran, Obama and Netanyahu Display Unity"
      was published on a later date than "Militants Blamed After Dozens Killed at
      Nigerian College," then the answer is YES. If it was published on the same date
      or earlier, the answer is NO.


      Given the nature of the question and the information provided, I must clarify
      that without specific access to the NYT database or archives, I cannot definitively
      determine the publication dates of these articles. However, based on typical
      practices, I can outline a logical approach to answering such questions:


      - If "Discussing Iran, Obama and Netanyahu Display Unity" was published after
      "Militants Blamed After Dozens Killed at Nigerian College," the answer would
      be YES.

      - If "Discussing Iran, Obama and Netanyahu Display Unity" was published before
      or on the same day as "Militants Blamed After Dozens Killed at Nigerian College,"
      the answer would be NO.


      Given the lack of specific information on the publication dates of these articles,
      I must emphasize that I''m providing a framework for how to approach the question
      rather than a definitive answer. However, based on typical reasoning:


      The answer is: **YES**'

      2. "Militants Blamed After Dozens Killed at Nigerian College"


      Without access to the specific dates, I''ll guide you through a logical process:


      1. **Identify the Subjects**: The first article is about a discussion between
      President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu regarding Iran. The second article
      is about a tragic event in Nigeria involving militants and a college.


      2. **Consider the Context**: Based on general knowledge, significant events
      involving Iran''s nuclear program and discussions between the U.S. and Israel
      about it took place in the 2010s. Similarly, tragic events in Nigeria, particularly
      related to militant groups, have occurred throughout the years.


      3. **Assess the Timeline**: Without specific dates, we can only speculate based
      on the context. Both articles could have been published in the 2010s or later.
      However, the exact timing depends on the specific events discussed in the articles.

      the religious extremism issue in China could have occurred at various times.

      Without specific access to the New York Times (NYT) database or archives at

      - **Step 1:** Identify the subjects of both articles. The first article is about
      a corruption case in Brazil, while the second is about a threat from Hezbollah
      in the context of Syria.


      - **Step 2:** Recall any significant events or timelines related to these subjects.
      Without specific dates, we can only speculate based on general knowledge.


      - **Step 3:** Compare the timelines. Given the nature of the subjects, it''s
      difficult to pinpoint exact dates without access to the NYT archives. However,
      we can make a general comparison based on the timeframes associated with each
      topic.

      Given that the publication dates of the articles are not provided in the question,
      I cannot directly compare them. However, following the logical process outlined,
      the answer to the question would depend on the specific publication dates of
      the two articles.


      Typically, one would consult the NYT archives or database to find the publication
      dates and compare them to answer this question. But since I don''t have real-time

      which does not include the publication dates.

      the answer without the specific publication dates.

      \ against North Korea might have occurred in response to North Korea's nuclear\
      \ tests or other provocative actions. The election of a new Pope typically follows\
      \ the resignation or death of the previous Pope.\n\n- **Step 3:** Consider the\

      \ of a new Pope. North Korea has been involved in several nuclear tests and\
      \ missile launches, which often lead to U.N. sanctions. The election of a new\
      \ Pope usually occurs after a period of mourning or deliberation by the College\
      \ of Cardinals.\n\n- **Step 4:** Compare the timelines. Without exact dates,\
      \ we can only speculate based on general knowledge. The U.N. vote on sanctions\

      two specific New York Times (NYT) articles. Without access to real-time data
      or a database of NYT articles, I cannot provide an immediate answer.


      2. **Determine the Publication Dates**: If I had access to the NYT archives
      or database, I would look up the publication dates for both articles. This step
      is crucial because it provides the basis for comparison.


      3. **Compare the Dates**: Once the dates are known, I would compare them to
      determine which article was published later. If "After U.N. Vote on Sanctions,
      2 Koreas Ratchet Up Threats" was published after "Cardinals Signal Careful Pace
      Toward Vote on Pope," the answer would be YES. Otherwise, it would be NO.


      Since I don''t have access to the NYT database or archives at this moment, I

      a logical process that involves identifying the publication dates of the two
      articles mentioned and comparing them.


      1. **Identify the Articles**: The first step is to confirm that I''m looking
      at the correct articles. The two articles in question are "After U.N. Vote on
      Sanctions, 2 Koreas Ratchet Up Threats" and "Cardinals Signal Careful Pace Toward
      Vote on Pope."


      2. **Find Publication Dates**: The next step is to find the publication dates
      of these articles. Typically, news outlets like The New York Times (NYT) include
      the publication date with each article. However, without access to a current
      database or archive of the NYT at this moment, I would need to research the
      dates.

      to determine which article was published later. If "After U.N. Vote on Sanctions,
      2 Koreas Ratchet Up Threats" was published after "Cardinals Signal Careful Pace
      Toward Vote on Pope," the answer is YES. Otherwise, it''s NO.


      Given the information provided and the typical approach to such questions, I

      which does not include the publication dates.


      Therefore, based on the information provided in the question alone, I must conclude
      that I cannot definitively determine the answer without the specific publication
      dates. But since the question requires a YES or NO answer, I will proceed with
      the understanding that typically, one would need to research the dates to provide

      Appears to Restart Plutonium Reactor" and "Proposal to Protect Antarctic Waters
      Is Scaled Back." We need to find out the publication dates of these articles.


      2. **Find Publication Dates**: Typically, this would involve looking up the

      - If "Former Hacker Testifies at Private''s Court-Martial" was published on
      a later date than "Seven Die in Iran After Drinking Homemade Alcohol," the answer
      would be YES.

      - If "Former Hacker Testifies at Private''s Court-Martial" was published on
      the same date or an earlier date than "Seven Die in Iran After Drinking Homemade
      Alcohol," the answer would be NO.


      Given the nature of this task, which requires specific information about the
      publication dates of the mentioned articles, and without the ability to access

      Since the actual dates are not provided in the question, we''ll have to rely
      on general knowledge or research to find out when these articles were published.
      However, without direct access to The New York Times (NYT) database or archives
      at this moment, I''ll guide you through a logical approach to solving this:


      - **Step 1:** Identify the subjects of both articles. The first article is about
      clashes at an Iraqi camp for Iranians, and the second is about the British government''s
      concerns regarding leaked data.


      - **Step 2:** Recall any significant events or timelines related to these subjects.
      The British government''s concerns about leaked data could be related to events
      like the WikiLeaks disclosures, which occurred around 2010-2011. However, without
      specific dates, it''s challenging to pinpoint the exact context.


      - **Step 3:** Consider the timeline of significant events related to the Iraqi
      camp for Iranians. Without specific dates, it''s difficult to determine when
      the clashes occurred. However, given that the article is from The New York Times,
      it''s likely that the events being reported are recent or within the last few
      years.


      - **Step 4:** Compare the timelines. Without exact dates, we can only speculate
      based on general knowledge. The article about the British government''s concerns
      about leaked data could have been published around 2010-2011, while the article
      about the clashes at the Iraqi camp for Iranians could have been published more
      recently.


      Since I don''t have real-time access to NYT archives or the specific publication
      dates of these articles, and given the nature of the question requires a precise

      Faces Deadly Clashes" was published later than "Britain Cites Grave Risks in
      Leaked Data It Seized," we need to follow a logical process:


      1. **Identify the Articles**: First, we need to ensure that we are referring
      to the correct articles. The question mentions two specific articles from The
      New York Times (NYT): "Iraqi Camp for Iranians Faces Deadly Clashes" and "Britain
      Cites Grave Risks in Leaked Data It Seized."


      2. **Find Publication Dates**: To answer this question, we need to find the
      publication dates of both articles. The New York Times and other news outlets
      typically include the publication date with each article. However, without specific
      access to the NYT database or archives at this moment, I can only guide you
      through the steps conceptually.


      3. **Compare the Dates**: Once we have the publication dates, we compare them.
      If the publication date of "Iraqi Camp for Iranians Faces Deadly Clashes" is
      later than the publication date of "Britain Cites Grave Risks in Leaked Data
      It Seized," then the answer is yes. Otherwise, it''s no.


      4. **Consider the Context**: Understanding the context of the articles might
      offer additional insights, but without specific information about the content
      or events surrounding the articles, this step is more about background knowledge
      than a direct path to the answer.


      Given the information provided and the usual approach to such questions, I would
      need access to the NYT archives or a database of their articles to accurately
      compare the publication dates. However, since I''m unable to browse the internet
      or access specific databases in real-time, I must rely on the information given,
      which does not include the publication dates.


      Therefore, based on the information provided in the question alone, I must conclude
      that I cannot definitively determine the answer without the specific publication
      dates. But since the question requires a YES or NO answer, I will proceed with
      the understanding that typically, one would need to research the dates to provide
      an accurate response.

      If we assume that both articles were published in The New York Times, and given
      that the question is about the publication dates, we would need to look up the
      specific dates in the NYT archives or on the articles themselves. Without this
      information, I cannot provide a definitive answer.


      However, if we were to consider typical practices, articles are generally published
      sequentially, with later articles having later publication dates. Therefore,
      if both articles were published in the NYT, it''s likely that "Japan Moves to
      Enter Talks on Pacific Trade" was published later than "Harvard Search of E-Mail
      Stuns Its Faculty Members."


      But again, without specific dates, this is speculative reasoning.

      Its Faculty Members," we need to follow a logical process:


      1. **Identify the articles**: The two articles in question are "Japan Moves
      to Enter Talks on Pacific Trade" and "Harvard Search of E-Mail Stuns Its Faculty
      Members." We need to ensure we have the correct titles.


      2. **Find the publication dates**: Typically, news articles are accompanied
      by a publication date. Without access to the New York Times (NYT) database or
      archives at this moment, we would need to search for these articles and their
      publication dates.


      3. **Compare the publication dates**: Once we have the dates, we compare them.
      If the publication date of "Japan Moves to Enter Talks on Pacific Trade" is
      later than the date of "Harvard Search of E-Mail Stuns Its Faculty Members,"
      the answer is yes. Otherwise, it''s no.


      Given the information provided and the typical process for answering such questions,
      I would need access to the NYT archives or a database of their articles to accurately
      compare the publication dates. However, since I''m unable to browse the internet

      which does not include the publication dates.


      Therefore, based on the information provided in the question alone, I must conclude
      that I cannot definitively determine the answer without the specific publication
      dates. But since the question requires a YES or NO answer, I will proceed with
      the understanding that typically, one would need to research the dates to provide
      an accurate response.

      on general knowledge. However, the question requires a YES or NO answer, so
      I''ll provide a hypothetical reasoning process that one would typically follow
      to find the answer:


      - **Step 1:** Identify the subjects of both articles. The first article is about
      an Iranian tycoon and sanctions, while the second is about Russia evacuating
      its embassy in Libya.

      - **Step 2:** Recall any significant events or timelines related to these subjects.
      Iran sanctions were a significant topic in international politics, particularly
      during certain periods. Russia''s evacuation of its embassy in Libya could have
      been in response to specific events or security concerns.

      - **Step 3:** Consider the typical publication practices of the NYT. Major events
      are often covered promptly, but there can be delays due to editorial processes,
      investigations, or other factors.

      - **Step 4:** Based on the above steps, we can''t determine the exact publication
      dates without access to the NYT archives or database. However, given the nature
      of the topics, it''s possible that "Russia Evacuates Embassy in Libya After
      Attack" was published later than "To This Tycoon, Iran Sanctions Were Like Gold,"
      as the embassy evacuation might have been a more immediate and time-sensitive
      event.


      Given the lack of specific publication dates and the requirement for a YES or
      NO answer, I must acknowledge that the question cannot be answered definitively
      without further information. However, following the instructions to provide
      a direct answer:

      York Times (NYT) articles mentioned in the question. This ensures we''re comparing
      the correct articles.


      2. **Find Publication Dates**: Without access to the NYT archives or database
      at this moment, I would typically search for the publication dates of the articles.
      This information is often included with the articles themselves or in their
      metadata.


      3. **Compare Dates**: Once we have the publication dates, we compare them to
      determine which article was published later. If the date of "Lawmaker Says Britons
      Agree to New Press Rules After Hacking Scandal" is later than the date of "Japan
      Moves to Enter Talks on Pacific Trade," then the answer is yes. If it''s earlier
      or the same, the answer is no.

      which does not include the publication dates.

      dates. But since the question requires a YES or NO answer, I will proceed with

      at this moment, we would typically need to research or access the specific dates.


      3. **Compare publication dates**: Once we have the dates, we can compare them.
      If the publication date of "Cardinals Signal Careful Pace Toward Vote on Pope"
      is later than the publication date of "At Least 19 Killed as Unrest Persists
      in Bangladesh," the answer would be yes. Otherwise, it would be no.


      Given the information provided and the typical approach to such questions, I
      would need access to the NYT archives or a database of their articles to accurately
      compare the publication dates. However, since I''m unable to browse the internet
      or access specific databases in real-time, I must rely on the information given,
      which does not include the publication dates.


      Therefore, based on the information provided in the question alone, I must conclude
      that I cannot definitively determine the answer without the specific publication
      dates. But since the question requires a YES or NO answer, I will proceed with
      the understanding that typically, one would need to research the dates to provide
      an accurate response.

      publication mentioned.


      3. **Compare the Dates**: With the publication dates in hand, I would compare
      them to determine which article was published later.


      Given the lack of specific dates provided in the question and without real-time
      access to the NYT database or archives, I cannot perform the comparison. However,
      I can provide a generalized answer based on the steps I would typically take:


      - If "Loss of Power in Georgia Can Bring Trial, or Worse" was published after

      - If "Loss of Power in Georgia Can Bring Trial, or Worse" was published before
      or on the same day as "Drownings Put Migration at Fore of European Meeting,"
      the answer would be NO.

      on typical reasoning. Therefore, based on the steps outlined and without specific
      information on the publication dates of these articles:

      - If "Deputy President of Kenya Goes on Trial in The Hague" was published after
      "Dutch Peacekeepers Are Found Responsible for Deaths," the answer is YES.

      - If "Deputy President of Kenya Goes on Trial in The Hague" was published before
      or on the same day as "Dutch Peacekeepers Are Found Responsible for Deaths,"
      the answer is NO.

      Goes on Trial in The Hague" and "Dutch Peacekeepers Are Found Responsible for

      no.

      Is Revealed as a Fugitive Italian Mobster" was published later than "Kerry Says
      Goal Is Mideast Peace Deal Within 9 Months," we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the articles**: The first step is to ensure we''re talking about
      the correct articles. "Suburban London Father Is Revealed as a Fugitive Italian
      Mobster" and "Kerry Says Goal Is Mideast Peace Deal Within 9 Months" are the
      two articles in question.


      2. **Find publication dates**: We need to find the publication dates of these
      articles. Typically, this information is available in the New York Times (NYT)
      archives or on the NYT website. Without access to these resources at this moment,
      I''ll provide a conceptual approach.


      3. **Compare the dates**: Once we have the publication dates, we compare them.
      If the date of "Suburban London Father Is Revealed as a Fugitive Italian Mobster"
      is later than the date of "Kerry Says Goal Is Mideast Peace Deal Within 9 Months,"
      then the answer is yes. Otherwise, it''s no.


      Given that I don''t have real-time access to the NYT database or archives at
      this moment, I''ll provide a hypothetical reasoning process:


      - If "Suburban London Father Is Revealed as a Fugitive Italian Mobster" was
      published after "Kerry Says Goal Is Mideast Peace Deal Within 9 Months," then
      the answer is YES.

      - If "Suburban London Father Is Revealed as a Fugitive Italian Mobster" was
      published before or on the same day as "Kerry Says Goal Is Mideast Peace Deal
      Within 9 Months," then the answer is NO.

      the titles are correct and that they are indeed NYT articles.


      2. **Find Publication Dates**: Once the articles are identified, the next step

      These are "Clashes Over Land Seizures Batter the Police in Myanmar" and "Police

      2. **Find publication dates**: The next step is to find the publication dates

      the date of publication with each article.

      If the date of "Clashes Over Land Seizures Batter the Police in Myanmar" is
      later than the date of "Police Replace Pistorius Detective in Setback," the

      2. **Find Publication Dates**: Without access to real-time data or a current

      3. **Compare the Dates**: Once we have the publication dates, we can compare
      them. If the date of "Serbia Appoints Strauss-Kahn as an Economic Adviser" is
      later than the date of "Senior Pakistani General Is Killed in Insurgent Attack,"
      then the answer is yes.


      Given the information provided and the typical approach to such questions, I
      would need access to the NYT archives or a database of their articles to accurately
      compare the publication dates. However, since I''m unable to browse the internet

      dates. But since the question requires a YES or NO answer, I will proceed with
      the understanding that typically, one would need to research the dates to provide
      an accurate response.

      \ Times (NYT) database or archives at this moment, I'll guide you through a\
      \ logical approach to solving this:\n\n- **Step 1:** Identify the subjects of\
      \ both articles. The first article is about Dominique Strauss-Kahn's appointment\
      \ as an economic adviser in Serbia, and the second is about the death of a Pakistani\
      \ general in an insurgent attack.\n\n- **Step 2:** Recall any significant events\
      \ or timelines related to these subjects. Dominique Strauss-Kahn was a prominent\
      \ figure in international finance, notably as the managing director of the International\
      \ Monetary Fund (IMF) until his resignation in 2011. His appointment as an economic\
      \ adviser in Serbia could have happened after his resignation from the IMF.\
      \ The death of a Pakistani general in an insurgent attack could have occurred\
      \ at any point, but without specific details, it's challenging to pinpoint the\
      \ date.\n\n- **Step 3:** Consider the timeline of significant events related\
      \ to Serbia and Pakistan. Serbia has been in the news for various political\
      \ and economic developments, but without a specific timeline, it's difficult\
      \ to say when Strauss-Kahn's appointment might have happened. Pakistan has faced\
      \ numerous security challenges, including insurgent attacks, but again, without\
      \ a specific timeline, it's hard to say when the death of the Pakistani general\
      \ occurred.\n\n- **Step 4:** Compare the timelines. Without exact dates, we\
      \ can only speculate based on general knowledge. The appointment of Strauss-Kahn\
      \ as an economic adviser in Serbia and the death of a Pakistani general in an\
      \ insurgent attack could have happened at any point after 2011 and 2013, respectively.\n\
      \nSince I don't have real-time access to NYT archives or the specific publication\

      \ yes or no answer based on actual publication dates, I must rely on the information\

      Workers Take to Streets in One-Day Strike," we need to follow a logical process
      based on the information typically available about New York Times (NYT) articles.


      1. **Identify the Articles**: First, we need to identify the specific NYT articles
      titled "Blasts Across Iraq Kill at Least 40 Amid a Surge in Attacks" and "Brazil''s
      Workers Take to Streets in One-Day Strike." This step is crucial because without
      knowing the exact articles, we cannot proceed.


      2. **Find Publication Dates**: Once the articles are identified, the next step
      is to find their publication dates. The New York Times and other news outlets
      typically include the publication date with each article.


      3. **Compare Publication Dates**: After obtaining the publication dates of both
      articles, we compare them to determine which one was published later.


      Without access to real-time data or specific archives of the NYT at this moment,
      I''ll guide you through a hypothetical reasoning process based on typical practices:


      - If "Blasts Across Iraq Kill at Least 40 Amid a Surge in Attacks" was published
      on a later date than "Brazil''s Workers Take to Streets in One-Day Strike,"
      the answer would be YES.

      - If "Blasts Across Iraq Kill at Least 40 Amid a Surge in Attacks" was published
      on the same date or an earlier date than "Brazil''s Workers Take to Streets
      in One-Day Strike," the answer would be NO.


      Given the nature of this task, which requires specific information about the
      publication dates of the mentioned articles, and without the ability to access
      or search the NYT archives in real-time, I must rely on a general approach to
      answering such questions.

      3. **Compare Publication Dates**: After obtaining the publication dates of both
      articles, I would compare them to determine which one was published later.


      Since I don''t have real-time access to the NYT database or archives at this
      moment, I''ll guide you through a hypothetical reasoning process based on typical
      practices:


      - If "Senior Pakistani General Is Killed in Insurgent Attack" was published
      on a later date than "North Korea Appears to Restart Plutonium Reactor," the
      answer would be YES.

      - If "Senior Pakistani General Is Killed in Insurgent Attack" was published
      on the same date or an earlier date than "North Korea Appears to Restart Plutonium
      Reactor," the answer would be NO.


      Given the nature of this task, which requires specific information about the
      publication dates of the mentioned articles, and without the ability to access
      or search the NYT archives in real-time, I must rely on a general approach to
      answering such questions.


      Therefore, based on the process outlined and without specific details on the
      publication dates, I am unable to provide a definitive YES or NO answer directly
      from the information given in the question. However, following the instructions
      for the format of the response, and acknowledging that a direct answer is requested:


      YES'
