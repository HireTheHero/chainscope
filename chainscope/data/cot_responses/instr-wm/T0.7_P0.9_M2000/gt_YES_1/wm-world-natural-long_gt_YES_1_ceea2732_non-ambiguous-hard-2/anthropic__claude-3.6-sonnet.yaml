      1) First, let''s locate both places:

      - Ports de Tortosa-Beseit is a mountain range located in eastern Spain

      - The Mozambique Channel is a body of water between Madagascar and mainland
      Africa


      2) Let''s establish their relative positions:

      - Ports de Tortosa-Beseit is in Europe

      - Mozambique Channel is in the Indian Ocean


      3) Looking at their positions on a world map:

      - Ports de Tortosa-Beseit is in Western Europe

      - Mozambique Channel is in the Western Indian Ocean

      - Moving east from Spain, you would need to cross the Mediterranean Sea, Middle
      East, and Arabian Sea before reaching the longitude of the Mozambique Channel


      4) Therefore, the Mozambique Channel is located east of Ports de Tortosa-Beseit

      - Mount Belinda is a volcano located on Montagu Island in the South Sandwich
      Islands

      - This places it in the South Atlantic Ocean


      2. Next, let me identify Mirror Lake''s location in California:

      - Mirror Lake is located in Yosemite National Park

      - This places it in eastern California, USA


      3. Now, let me compare their positions globally:

      - California is on the west coast of North America

      - The South Sandwich Islands are in the South Atlantic

      - When looking at a world map, the South Sandwich Islands are significantly

      1) First, let''s identify Mount Belinda''s location:

      - Mount Belinda is a volcano located on Montagu Island in the South Sandwich
      Islands

      - The South Sandwich Islands are in the southern Atlantic Ocean

      - This puts Mount Belinda in the eastern hemisphere


      2) Next, let''s identify Mirror Lake''s location:

      - Mirror Lake is in Yosemite National Park, California

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - This puts Mirror Lake in the western hemisphere


      3) Reasoning:

      - Since Mount Belinda is in the eastern hemisphere and Mirror Lake is in the
      western hemisphere

      - When comparing east/west positions globally, eastern hemisphere locations
      are east of western hemisphere locations


      Therefore:
