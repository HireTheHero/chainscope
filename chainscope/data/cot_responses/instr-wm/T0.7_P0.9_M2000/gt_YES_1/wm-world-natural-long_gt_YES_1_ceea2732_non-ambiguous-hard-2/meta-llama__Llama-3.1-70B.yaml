      \ islands of Sulawesi and Halmahera.\n   - Lake Tsomgo is located in Sikkim,\
      \ India, near the border with Tibet.\n\n2. **Determine the general geographical\
      \ positions**: \n   - Indonesia is located in Southeast Asia, while India is\
      \ in South Asia.\n   - Sulawesi, where the Gulf of Tomini is located, is further\
      \ east compared to Sikkim, where Lake Tsomgo is located.\n\n3. **Consider the\
      \ specific longitudes**:\n   - The Gulf of Tomini has a longitude of approximately\
      \ 122\xB0E.\n   - Lake Tsomgo has a longitude of approximately 88\xB0E.\n\n\
      4. **Compare the longitudes to determine east-west relationship**: \n   - Since\
      \ 122\xB0E (Gulf of Tomini) is greater than 88\xB0E (Lake Tsomgo), the Gulf\
      \ of Tomini is located east of Lake Tsomgo.\n\nGiven these steps, the answer\
