      1. Rewalsar Lake is located in Himachal Pradesh, India. It is situated near
      the town of Mandi in the state of Himachal Pradesh.


      2. Argolic Gulf is located in Greece, specifically in the eastern part of the
      Peloponnese peninsula.


      3. These two locations are very far apart - Rewalsar Lake is in northern India,
      while the Argolic Gulf is in southern Europe.


      4. To be "east" of the Argolic Gulf, Rewalsar Lake would need to be geographically
      located east of the gulf''s location.


      5. Given the vast distance between these locations, Rewalsar Lake is not east
      of the Argolic Gulf. In fact, it is significantly west of the gulf.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

    e5d362f3-8af3-41d0-a651-4c0c3e3e4130: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to locate Upvan Lake

      - Upvan Lake is located in Thane, Maharashtra, India


      2. Next, I need to locate Lake Lungern

      - Lake Lungern is located in Switzerland, in the canton of Obwalden


      3. These lakes are in completely different countries and continents

      - Upvan Lake is in Asia (India)

      - Lake Lungern is in Europe (Switzerland)


      4. Given their vast geographical separation, I can confidently say that "east"
      is not a meaningful directional term between these two lakes


      5. However, the question requires a YES or NO answer


      6. Technically, if I trace a great circle route from Upvan Lake to Lake Lungern,
      it would indeed be to the east

      2. Newfoundland is an island located in the Atlantic Ocean, in the easternmost

      - Andorra is a small country in the Pyrenees mountains between France and Spain

      - It is in southwestern Europe


      3. Comparing their geographical locations:

      - Ooty Lake is in southern India

      - Lake Engolasters is in southwestern Europe

      - These locations are on completely different continents

      - They are thousands of miles apart


      4. Determining east/west orientation:

      - From the perspective of a global map, Ooty Lake is significantly east of Lake
      Engolasters

      - Lake Engolasters is west of Ooty Lake


      5. Conclusion:

      Since Ooty Lake is east of Lake Engolasters, the answer is:


      YES'

      name seems unusual - there isn''t a famous mountain with this exact name.
