      of both places.


      1. **Taurus Mountains**: These mountains are located in southern Turkey. They
      run generally from west to east across southern Turkey, near the Mediterranean
      coast.


      2. **Putrajaya Lake**: This is a man-made lake located in Putrajaya, Malaysia.
      Putrajaya is a planned city and the federal administrative center of Malaysia,
      situated in the central part of Peninsular Malaysia.


      Next, we consider the relative positions:


      - Turkey (where the Taurus Mountains are) is located in the Middle East / Southeastern
      Europe.

      - Malaysia (where Putrajaya Lake is) is located in Southeast Asia, which is
      clearly to the east of Turkey.


      Therefore, since Malaysia lies to the east of Turkey, and Putrajaya Lake is
      in Malaysia, it is located to the east of the Taurus Mountains.

      1. **Lough Derg, County Donegal**: There are multiple lakes named Lough Derg

      of Ireland. County Donegal is located in the northern and western part of the
      Republic of Ireland.


      2. **Ahmic Lake**: This lake is located in Ontario, Canada. Specifically, it
      lies in the Parry Sound District of Ontario, which is in eastern Canada.


      Now, let''s consider the relative longitudes of each:


      - **County Donegal, Ireland** is located approximately around 8 degrees west
      longitude.

      - **Ahmic Lake, Ontario, Canada** is located approximately around 79 degrees
      west longitude.


      In terms of longitudinal position:

      - The more negative the longitude (further west), the further west the location
      is.

      - Since -79 (Ahmic Lake) < -8 (Lough Derg), Ahmic Lake is significantly further

      \ Bay**:\n   - Cobequid Bay is a bay in Nova Scotia, Canada.\n   - It is part\
      \ of the upper Bay of Fundy.\n   - Nova Scotia is located on the eastern coast\
      \ of Canada.\n\n2. **Locate the Ogilvie Mountains**:\n   - The Ogilvie Mountains\
      \ are located in the Yukon Territory, in northwestern Canada.\n   - The Yukon\
      \ is situated much farther west compared to Nova Scotia.\n\n3. **Compare their\
      \ positions**:\n   - Nova Scotia (Cobequid Bay) lies far to the east of the\
      \ Yukon Territory (Ogilvie Mountains).\n   - Therefore, Cobequid Bay is indeed\
      \ located east of the Ogilvie Mountains.\n\nAnswer: **YES**."
    ebfdfbdd-224b-403f-b4c3-99e74b6a20da: "To answer whether Cobequid Bay is located\
      \ east of the Ogilvie Mountains, we need to determine the geographic locations\
      \ of both places and compare their longitudes.\n\n1. **Cobequid Bay**:\n   -\
      \ Cobequid Bay is located in Nova Scotia, Canada.\n   - Nova Scotia is in the\
      \ eastern part of Canada.\n   - The approximate longitude of Cobequid Bay is\
      \ around 63\xB0W.\n\n2. **Ogilvie Mountains**:\n   - The Ogilvie Mountains are\
      \ located in the Yukon Territory in northwestern Canada.\n   - The approximate\
      \ longitude of the Ogilvie Mountains is around 138\xB0W.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n\
      \   - Since 63\xB0W is significantly east of 138\xB0W (smaller west longitudes\
      \ are farther east), Cobequid Bay is indeed east of the Ogilvie Mountains.\n\
      \nAnswer: **YES**."
