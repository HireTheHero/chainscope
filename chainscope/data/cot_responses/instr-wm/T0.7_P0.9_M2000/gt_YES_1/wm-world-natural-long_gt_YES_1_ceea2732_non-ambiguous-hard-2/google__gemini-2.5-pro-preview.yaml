    8eecf102-604b-4390-a7ff-14d1124040a0: "Okay, here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\
      \n1.  **Locate Mount Franklin, New Hampshire:** Mount Franklin is part of the\
      \ Presidential Range in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, USA. New Hampshire\
      \ is an East Coast state.\n\n2.  **Locate Harper Lake:** There are multiple\
      \ \"Harper Lakes.\" A very well-known one is Harper Dry Lake, located in San\
      \ Bernardino County, California, USA. California is a West Coast state. (Assuming\
      \ this prominent Harper Lake, as no other state qualifier is given). Other Harper\
      \ Lakes exist (e.g., in Colorado, Washington), but they are also significantly\
      \ west of New Hampshire.\n\n3.  **Compare their longitudinal positions:**\n\
      \    *   New Hampshire (and thus Mount Franklin) is in the Eastern Time Zone,\
      \ with longitudes roughly between 70\xB0W and 72.5\xB0W.\n    *   Harper Dry\
      \ Lake, California, is in the Pacific Time Zone, with a longitude of approximately\
      \ 117.3\xB0W.\n\n4.  **Determine the direction:** Locations with a smaller West\
      \ longitude (e.g., 71\xB0W) are east of locations with a larger West longitude\
      \ (e.g., 117\xB0W). Since 71\xB0W (approximate for Mt. Franklin) is numerically\
      \ smaller than 117\xB0W (approximate for Harper Lake, CA), Mount Franklin is\
      \ east of Harper Lake, CA.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning:\n\nYES"

      \ Mount Franklin, New Hampshire:** Mount Franklin is part of the Presidential\

      \ is 71.34\xB0 West.\n\n2.  **Locate Harper Lake:** Since no state is specified\

      \ sense. A well-known Harper Lake is located in San Bernardino County, California,\
