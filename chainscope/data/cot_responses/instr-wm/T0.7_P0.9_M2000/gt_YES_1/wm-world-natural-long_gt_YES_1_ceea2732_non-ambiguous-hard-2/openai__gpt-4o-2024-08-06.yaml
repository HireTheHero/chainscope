      It is a well-known scenic spot and a UNESCO World Heritage site.


      2. **Identify the location of Unnamed volcano (Ibugos)**: This requires identifying
      Ibugos. "Unnamed volcano" could refer to a specific volcano that might not be
      widely recognized. However, there is no well-documented volcano known as "Ibugos"
      in common geographical databases or literature. Assuming it refers to a location
      in the Philippines (Batanes Islands), Ibugos is a small island and doesn''t
      have a notable volcano.


      3. **Determine relative positions**: Assuming Ibugos refers to a location in
      the Philippines, the Batanes Islands (including Ibugos) are located to the east
      of China, where the Heavenly Lake of Tianshan is located.

      2. **Location of the Glarus Alps**: The Glarus Alps are a mountain range located
      in eastern Switzerland.


      3. **Relative positioning**: Ethiopia is located in the Horn of Africa, which
      is on the eastern side of the African continent. Switzerland is in central Europe.


      Now, compare their longitudinal positions:

      - Ethiopia, where Lake Afrera is located, is generally east of Switzerland.

      - Therefore, Lake Afrera is indeed located east of the Glarus Alps.

      2. **Identify the location of Gravelly Lake:** There are multiple lakes with
      the name "Gravelly Lake," but if we assume you are referring to one in Newfoundland
      and Labrador, it would be important to specify which one. However, there is
      no widely recognized Gravelly Lake in Newfoundland and Labrador. If you are
      referring to a Gravelly Lake outside of this region, we need to consider its
      location relative to Newfoundland.


      3. **Determine relative positions:** If Gravelly Lake is not in Newfoundland
      and Labrador or not specified, we typically assume the question refers to a
      known location. Assuming a Gravelly Lake outside Newfoundland and Labrador,
      Newfoundland is generally east of most places in mainland Canada due to its
      geographic location.


      Therefore, without a specific Gravelly Lake in Newfoundland and Labrador to
      compare with, and assuming a general understanding of geographic locations,
      the answer would be:


      **YES.** The Bay of Islands, Newfoundland and Labrador, is located east of most
      locations named Gravelly Lake outside Newfoundland and Labrador.'
    0928f58b-e6b5-4c22-89c6-d1775b0fc27a: 'To determine whether the Bay of Islands
      in Newfoundland and Labrador is located east of Gravelly Lake, we need to establish
      the locations of both places:


      1. **Bay of Islands**: This is a bay located on the west coast of Newfoundland,
      in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador.


      2. **Gravelly Lake**: There are several lakes with this name, but if we assume
      you are referring to Gravelly Lake in Newfoundland and Labrador, it is important
      to identify its specific location within the province.


      In Newfoundland and Labrador, the Bay of Islands is on the west coast, near
      the city of Corner Brook. If Gravelly Lake is located more inland or to the
      east of this area within Newfoundland and Labrador, then the Bay of Islands
      would be to the west of it.


      Without more specific information on the location of Gravelly Lake, the general
      assumption based on known geographic names is that the Bay of Islands is indeed
      on the west coast of the island of Newfoundland.


      Therefore, assuming Gravelly Lake is somewhere inland or not far east of the
      coast, the Bay of Islands would likely be to the west. However, if Gravelly
      Lake is located on the west coast or further west, the Bay of Islands could
      be east.


      Given typical geographic naming and known locations, the Bay of Islands is generally
      considered to be a western location in Newfoundland.


      Thus, without more precise information on the specific location of Gravelly
      Lake, the answer would be:


      NO, the Bay of Islands is not located east of Gravelly Lake if we assume Gravelly
      Lake is inland or east of the western coast where the Bay of Islands is situated.'

      hypothetical or less well-known Gravelly Lake within Newfoundland and Labrador.


      Assuming we are considering a Gravelly Lake that is not explicitly documented
      but could exist within Newfoundland and Labrador, if it were located anywhere
      on the island, it would likely be to the east of the Bay of Islands, given that

      2. **Mount Michael**: This is a volcano located on Saunders Island, which is
      part of the South Sandwich Islands in the southern Atlantic Ocean.


      Now, let''s consider their relative positions:


      - The Bay of Grama in Albania is situated in the Northern Hemisphere, in southern
      Europe.

      - Mount Michael is located in the Southern Hemisphere, far to the south of the
      Atlantic Ocean.


      Given their positions:


      - The Bay of Grama is located in Europe, which is significantly north and east
      relative to the South Sandwich Islands where Mount Michael is located.
