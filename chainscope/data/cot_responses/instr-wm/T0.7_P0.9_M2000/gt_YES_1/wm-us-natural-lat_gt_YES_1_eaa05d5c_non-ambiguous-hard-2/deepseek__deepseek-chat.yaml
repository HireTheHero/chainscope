    c837a2de-5b6f-4831-888f-e5e8ff4b343f: 'Let''s break this down step by step:


      1. **Locate Swiftcurrent Lake, MT**: Swiftcurrent Lake is located in Glacier
      National Park, Montana. Montana is in the northern United States, close to the
      Canadian border.


      2. **Locate Ritter Range, CA**: The Ritter Range is a mountain range in the
      Sierra Nevada, California. California is in the western United States, far south
      of Montana.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Since Montana is north of California, any point
      in Montana (including Swiftcurrent Lake) will naturally be north of any point
      in California (including the Ritter Range).

      Sandwich Range, NH

      The Sandwich Range is a subrange of the White Mountains in New Hampshire, USA.
      It is located in the northeastern part of the United States, specifically in
      the state of New Hampshire.


      ### Step 2: Identify the location of Coleto Creek Reservoir, TX

      Coleto Creek Reservoir is a reservoir located in Goliad County, Texas, USA.
      Texas is in the southern part of the United States, and Goliad County is in
      the southeastern region of Texas.


      ### Step 3: Compare the latitudes

      New Hampshire is significantly farther north than Texas. The Sandwich Range,
      NH, is located at a higher latitude than Coleto Creek Reservoir, TX.


      ### Step 4: Determine the answer

      Since the Sandwich Range, NH, is located at a higher latitude (farther north)
      than Coleto Creek Reservoir, TX, the answer is **YES**.

      \ Mountains, CO?** To determine the answer, we'll need to understand the geographical\
      \ locations of both Grinnell Lake in Montana and the La Plata Mountains in Colorado.\n\
      \n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\n**Grinnell Lake, MT:**\n- **State:**\
      \ Montana\n- **Known for:** Part of Glacier National Park, known for its stunning\
      \ turquoise color and scenic beauty.\n\n**La Plata Mountains, CO:**\n- **State:**\
      \ Colorado\n- **Known for:** Part of the San Juan Mountains, known for their\
      \ rugged peaks and mining history.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Relative Positions\n\
      \nTo determine if Grinnell Lake is north of the La Plata Mountains, we need\
      \ to look at their latitudes.\n\n- **Montana (MT):** Generally located in the\
      \ northern part of the United States.\n- **Colorado (CO):** Situated south of\
      \ Montana.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Latitudes\n\nLet's find the approximate\
      \ latitudes of both locations.\n\n**Grinnell Lake, MT:**\n- Latitude: Approximately\
      \ 48.8\xB0 N\n\n**La Plata Mountains, CO:**\n- Latitude: Approximately 37.4\xB0\
      \ N\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Latitudinal Difference\n\nComparing the two latitudes:\n\
      - Grinnell Lake, MT: 48.8\xB0 N\n- La Plata Mountains, CO: 37.4\xB0 N\n\nSince\
      \ 48.8\xB0 N is greater than 37.4\xB0 N, Grinnell Lake is located north of the\
      \ La Plata Mountains.\n\n### Step 5: Consider the Distance\n\nWhile the latitudinal\

      is located north of Diaz Lake, California, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Locate Echo Lake, Montana**: Echo Lake is a small lake located in Flathead
      County, Montana. Montana is in the northern part of the United States, near
      the Canadian border.


      2. **Locate Diaz Lake, California**: Diaz Lake is a reservoir located in Inyo
      County, California. California is in the western part of the United States,
      and Inyo County is in the eastern part of the state, near the Nevada border.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Montana is significantly farther north than California.
      Flathead County, where Echo Lake is located, is in the northernmost part of
      Montana, while Inyo County, where Diaz Lake is located, is in the southern part
      of California.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Echo Lake, Montana, is in a much more northern location
      than Diaz Lake, California, the answer is YES.

    f92cfb73-0baf-450f-a2ca-a5841695af6a: 'Let''s break this down step by step:


      1. **Locate Echo Lake, Montana**: Echo Lake is located in the northwestern part
      of Montana, near the city of Kalispell. Montana is in the northern United States,
      close to the Canadian border.


      2. **Locate Diaz Lake, California**: Diaz Lake is located in the southeastern
      part of California, near the town of Lone Pine. California is in the western
      United States, but much further south than Montana.


      3. **Compare their latitudes**: Since Montana is north of California, any lake
      in Montana (including Echo Lake) will naturally be north of any lake in California
      (including Diaz Lake).


      4. **Conclusion**: Echo Lake, Montana, is indeed located north of Diaz Lake,
      California.
