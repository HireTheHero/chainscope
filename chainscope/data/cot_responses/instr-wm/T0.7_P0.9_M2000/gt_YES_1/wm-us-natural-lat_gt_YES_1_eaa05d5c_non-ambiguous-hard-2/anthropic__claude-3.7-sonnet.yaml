      the relative positions of these two mountain ranges.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both mountain ranges.

      - Tatoosh Range is located in Washington state (WA), in the northwestern United
      States.

      - Ouachita Mountains are located in Arkansas (AR), in the south-central United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Washington state is in the far northwest of the contiguous United States.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central region of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Washington state is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US, bordering
      Canada.

      - Arkansas is much further south, positioned above Louisiana and not far from
      the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      - Any location in Washington state would be significantly north of any location
      in Arkansas.

      - Therefore, the Tatoosh Range in WA must be north of the Ouachita Mountains
      in AR.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Watchung Mountains is in New Jersey (NJ), which is in the northeastern United
      States.

      - Aransas Bay is in Texas (TX), which is in the southern United States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on a north-south axis.

      - New Jersey is significantly north of Texas on the map of the United States.

      - The Watchung Mountains are located in northern New Jersey.

      - Aransas Bay is located along the Gulf Coast of Texas, in the southern part
      of the state.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - Since New Jersey is north of Texas, and the Watchung Mountains are in New
      Jersey, while Aransas Bay is in southern Texas, the Watchung Mountains must
      be north of Aransas Bay.

      - Texas is a southern state that extends to the Gulf of Mexico.

      - Specifically, Watchung Mountains in northern NJ would be significantly further
      north than Aransas Bay on the Texas coast.


      Step 3: Reach a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      - Since Watchung Mountains is in the northeast and Aransas Bay is on the southern

      Step 3: Verify specific locations within their states.

      - Watchung Mountains is in northern New Jersey.

      - Aransas Bay is on the Gulf Coast of Texas, in the southern part of the state.


      This further increases the north-south distance between them, with Watchung

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Swiftcurrent Lake is located in Glacier National Park in Montana (MT).

      - The Ritter Range is located in the Sierra Nevada mountains in California (CA).


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Montana is a northern state, bordering Canada.

      - California is a western state, but located further south than Montana.

      - Glacier National Park is in the northern part of Montana, very close to the
      Canadian border.

      - Swiftcurrent Lake in northern Montana would be at a much higher latitude (further
      north) than the Ritter Range in California.

      - Any location in Montana is generally north of most locations in California,

      Let me think about this step by step:


      1) Misquah Hills is located in Minnesota (MN), which is a northern state in
      the US, bordering Canada.


      2) Caddo Lake is located in Louisiana (LA), which is a southern state in the
      US, bordering the Gulf of Mexico.


      3) In terms of US geography, Minnesota is positioned much further north than
      Louisiana. Minnesota is in the northern part of the continental US, while Louisiana
      is in the southern part.


      4) Since Misquah Hills is in Minnesota and Caddo Lake is in Louisiana, Misquah
      Hills must be north of Caddo Lake.


      YES, Misquah Hills, MN is located north of Caddo Lake, LA.'

      The Wallowa Mountains are located in northeastern Oregon.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Baldwin Hills is located.

      Baldwin Hills is located in Los Angeles County in southern California.


      Step 3: Compare the north-south positions of these locations.

      Oregon is entirely north of California on the west coast of the United States.
      Since the Wallowa Mountains are in Oregon and Baldwin Hills is in California,
      the Wallowa Mountains must be north of Baldwin Hills.


      YES, the Wallowa Mountains in Oregon are located north of Baldwin Hills in California.'

      - Since Oregon is north of California, and the Wallowa Mountains are in northeastern
      Oregon, while Baldwin Hills are in southern California, the Wallowa Mountains
      must be significantly further north than Baldwin Hills.

      States.

      - Henninger Flats is in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the United
      States.

      is generally not as far north as Minnesota.

      - Henninger Flats, being in Southern California near Los Angeles, is approximately
      around 34 degrees North latitude.

      the relative positions of these two natural places.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Lost Lake is located at Santiam Pass in Linn County, Oregon (OR)

      - Christmas Mountains are located in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider their states'' general positions.

      - Oregon is in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States

      - Texas is in the southern United States


      Step 3: Compare latitudes.

      - Oregon is significantly north of Texas in the United States

      - All locations in Oregon are generally north of locations in Texas


      Step 4: Verify the specific locations.

      - Lost Lake at Santiam Pass is in central Oregon

      - Christmas Mountains are in western Texas

      - Even the southernmost point of Oregon is still north of the northernmost point
      of Texas


      Therefore, Lost Lake (Santiam Pass, Linn County, Oregon) is definitely located
      north of Christmas Mountains (Texas).

      of Wallowa Lake, Oregon and the Magdalena Mountains, New Mexico.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations by state.

      - Wallowa Lake is in Oregon (OR), which is in the Pacific Northwest region of
      the United States.

      - The Magdalena Mountains are in New Mexico (NM), which is in the southwestern
      United States.
