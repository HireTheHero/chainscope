      1.  **Identify the location of Tatoosh Range, WA:** The Tatoosh Range is located
      in Washington State (WA). Washington State is in the Pacific Northwest region
      of the United States.

      2.  **Identify the location of Ouachita Mountains, AR:** The Ouachita Mountains
      are primarily located in Arkansas (AR), extending slightly into Oklahoma. Arkansas
