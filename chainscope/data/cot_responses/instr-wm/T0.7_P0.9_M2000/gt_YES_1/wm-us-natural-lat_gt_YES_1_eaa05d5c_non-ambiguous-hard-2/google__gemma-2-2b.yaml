    bdd1f1cc-cc4d-4d93-98e7-1be182b9e4fa: 'I am not sure if you can use the "in" or
      "of" in your question.

      The "of" is a preposition and is used when you are talking about the location
      of something.

      For example: "The dog is of the Brown family".

      The "in" is a preposition and is used when you are talking about something being
      inside something else.

      For example: "The dog is in the Brown family".


      If you are talking about a mountain range, you would use the "in" preposition.

      For example: "The Tatoosh Range is in the state of Washington".


      If you are talking about a lake, you would use the "of" preposition.

      For example: "The Tatoosh Range is of the state of Washington".


      Hope this helps!


      I think the correct answer is "Yes". The reason is that the Tatoosh Range is
      located in the state of Washington, and the Ouachita Mountains are located in
      the state of Arkansas.

      Well, in the 4th question I was trying to trick you into thinking that it''s
      a "yes" question.


      The other 3 are all "yes" questions.


      You should have known that the first question was "yes" and the second was "no".

      No, Castle Mountains, MT is located south of Guntersville Lake, AL, and is in

      I''m sorry, I should have been clearer. I didn''t mean it was a "trick" question.
      It''s just that the first three questions were "yes" questions. The fourth was
      a "no" question.

      I''m a little confused by the questions. I''m not sure I understand what they
      are asking.

      So the first three questions were "yes" questions and the fourth was a "no"
      question.
