      \ of both locations.\n\n1. **Locate Wallowa Lake, OR**: Wallowa Lake is situated\
      \ in northeastern Oregon. The coordinates are approximately 45.2840\xB0 N latitude\
      \ and 117.1882\xB0 W longitude.\n\n2. **Locate the Magdalena Mountains, NM**:\
      \ The Magdalena Mountains are located in western New Mexico, with approximate\
      \ coordinates of 34.0\xB0 N latitude and 27.0\xB0 W longitude.\n\n3. **Compare\
      \ Latitudes**: \n   - Wallowa Lake's latitude (approximately 45.2840\xB0 N)\
      \ is significantly higher than that of the Magdalena Mountains (approximately\
      \ 34.0\xB0 N).\n   - Since latitude indicates how far north or south a location\
      \ is, a higher latitude means a location is further north.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\
      \ Since Wallowa Lake is at a higher latitude than the Magdalena Mountains, it\
      \ is indeed located north of them.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question\
      \ is **YES**."

      \ Lake is situated in the northeastern part of Oregon, near the town of Joseph.\n\
      \n2. **Locate the Magdalena Mountains, New Mexico**: The Magdalena Mountains\

      \ Mountains, we can look at the latitudinal coordinates:\n   - Wallowa Lake\
      \ is approximately at latitude 45.3\xB0 N.\n   - The Magdalena Mountains are\
      \ roughly at latitude 34.9\xB0 N.\n\n4. **Compare the latitudes**: Since 45.3\xB0\
