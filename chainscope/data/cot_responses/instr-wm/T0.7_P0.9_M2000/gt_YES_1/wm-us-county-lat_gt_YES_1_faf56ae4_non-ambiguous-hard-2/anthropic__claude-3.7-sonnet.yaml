      1) Spotsylvania County is in Virginia (VA), which is on the East Coast of the
      United States.

      2) Virginia is in the mid-Atlantic region, roughly in the middle of the East
      Coast.

      3) Texas (TX) is in the southern United States, bordering Mexico.

      4) Cameron County, TX would be in Texas.

      5) Looking at their geographic positions: Virginia is significantly north of

      at the very southern tip of Texas along the Mexican border and the Gulf of Mexico.

      7) Spotsylvania County is in northern/central Virginia.


      Since Virginia is substantially north of Texas on the map, and specifically
      Spotsylvania County (in Virginia) is much further north than Cameron County
      (at the southern tip of Texas), Spotsylvania County is indeed north of Cameron
      County.

      Step 4: Spotsylvania County is in northern Virginia, not far from Washington
      DC.


      Step 5: Comparing latitudes, any location in Virginia will be significantly

      Step 2: Compare the latitudes of these states.

      - North Dakota is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US, located
      along the Canadian border.

      - Kentucky is much further south, positioned roughly in the middle section of
      the eastern United States.


      Step 3: Make the specific county comparison.

      - Rolette County is in the north-central part of North Dakota, very close to
      the Canadian border.

      - McCracken County is in the far western part of Kentucky.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on US geography.

      - Any county in North Dakota will be significantly north of any county in Kentucky
      due to their relative positions in the United States.

      - Therefore, Rolette County, ND must be north of McCracken County, KY.


      YES, Rolette County, ND is located north of McCracken County, KY.'

      of Rolette County, ND and McCracken County, KY by comparing their latitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Rolette County is in North Dakota (ND), which is a northern state bordering
      Canada.

      - McCracken County is in Kentucky (KY), which is in the southern part of the
      Midwest/eastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider their approximate latitudes.

      - North Dakota is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US, bordering
      Canada.

      - Kentucky is much further south, positioned roughly in the middle section of
      the eastern United States.


      Step 3: More specifically, Rolette County is in the north-central part of North
      Dakota, right along the Canadian border.

      - This places it at a very northern latitude within the continental US.


      Step 4: McCracken County is in the far western part of Kentucky (in the region

      Canada.

      - NC is North Carolina, located on the eastern seaboard in the southeastern
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south positioning of these states.

      - Minnesota is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US.

      - North Carolina is in the southern half of the US, well south of Minnesota.


      Step 3: Consider the specific counties.

      - Beltrami County is in Minnesota, so it inherits Minnesota''s northern position.

      - Randolph County is in North Carolina, so it inherits North Carolina''s southern
      position.


      Since Minnesota is significantly north of North Carolina, any county in Minnesota
      (including Beltrami) would be north of any county in North Carolina (including
      Randolph).

      - Iberville Parish is in southern Louisiana.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Despite where these counties are positioned within their respective states,

      \ tip of Michigan's Lower Peninsula, bordering Lake Huron.\n\n4) Gila County\
      \ is in Arizona (AZ), which is in the southwestern part of the United States.\n\
      \n5) Arizona is much further south than Michigan, being close to the Mexican\
      \ border.\n\n6) Comparing latitudes: Michigan counties are generally between\
      \ 41\xB0N and 48\xB0N latitude, while Arizona counties are generally between\
      \ 31\xB0N and 37\xB0N latitude.\n\n7) Presque Isle County is in the northern\
      \ part of Michigan, so it would be in the higher end of Michigan's latitude\
      \ range.\n\n8) Gila County is in central Arizona, so it would be in the middle\
      \ of Arizona's latitude range.\n\nBased on these geographic facts, Presque Isle\
      \ County, MI is definitely located north of Gila County, AZ.\n\nYES"

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both counties.

      - Presque Isle County is in Michigan (MI), which is in the northern part of
      the United States.

      - Gila County is in Arizona (AZ), which is in the southwestern part of the United
      States.

      - Michigan is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US, bordering
      Canada.

      - Arizona is a southern state, bordering Mexico.


      Step 3: More specifically for Presque Isle County, MI:

      - It''s located in the northeastern part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula, bordering
      Lake Huron.

      - Michigan counties, particularly those in the northern part of the state, are
