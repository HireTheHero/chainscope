      1. **Identify the states**: Rolette County is in North Dakota (ND), and McCracken
      County is in Kentucky (KY).

      2. **General geographical knowledge**: North Dakota is located in the northern
      United States, near the border with Canada. Kentucky is located more to the
      southeast, far from the Canadian border.

      North Dakota is significantly north of Kentucky due to their positions on the
      US map.

      4. **County-specific locations**: While specific county locations within states
      can vary, the overall north-south positioning of the states themselves gives
      us a clear indication. Rolette County, being in North Dakota, is expected to
      be north of McCracken County in Kentucky.

      1. **Identify the states**: Beltrami County is located in Minnesota (MN), and
      Randolph County is located in North Carolina (NC).

      2. **General geographic location of states**: Minnesota is located in the northern
      United States, often considered part of the Midwest or the Upper Midwest. North
      Carolina is located in the southeastern United States.

      3. **Latitude comparison**: Generally, the latitude of a location determines
      its north-south position. The higher the latitude, the further north a location
      is. Minnesota has a higher latitude than North Carolina due to its more northern
      position in the United States.

      4. **Specific county locations**: Without specific knowledge of the exact latitude
      of each county, we can rely on the general positions of their states. Beltrami
      County, being in Minnesota, is expected to be at a higher latitude (further
      north) than Randolph County in North Carolina.

      (WA), and Bullock County is located in the state of Alabama (AL).


      2. **Understand geographical positions**: Washington state is in the Pacific
      Northwest region of the United States, which is generally considered to be in
      the northern part of the country. Alabama, on the other hand, is in the Southeastern
      United States, which is more to the south.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: To determine if one county is north of the other,
      we need to compare their latitudes. Generally, the farther north a location
      is, the higher its latitude. Without needing the exact latitudes, we know that
      Washington state is significantly farther north than Alabama.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Asotin County, WA, is in a state that is considerably
      north of Alabama, where Bullock County is located, it logically follows that
      Asotin County is indeed north of Bullock County.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'

      Wisconsin, and Palo Pinto County is in Texas. Wisconsin is located in the northern
      United States, while Texas is in the southern part of the country.


      2. **Consider the latitude of each state**: Generally, the farther north a location

      (WA), and Ellis County is located in the state of Texas (TX).


      2. **Determine the general geographic positions of Washington and Texas**: Washington
      is in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, which is in the northern
      part of the country, near the border with Canada. Texas, on the other hand,
      is located in the South.


      3. **Consider the latitude of each county**: Generally, counties in Washington
      state are at a higher latitude (further north) than counties in Texas due to
      Washington''s more northern geographical location within the United States.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Washington state is north of Texas, it logically
      follows that Pacific County, WA, is north of Ellis County, TX.


      The final answer is: YES'
