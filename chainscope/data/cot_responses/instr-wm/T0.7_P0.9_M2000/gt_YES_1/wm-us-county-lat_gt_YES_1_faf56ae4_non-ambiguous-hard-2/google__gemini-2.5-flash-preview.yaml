      states is the primary factor. South Dakota is significantly further north than
      South Carolina.

      5.  **Compare the locations:** Since the entire state of South Dakota is north
      of the entire state of South Carolina, any county in South Dakota will be north
      of any county in South Carolina.


      Therefore, Hanson County, SD is located north of Beaufort County, SC.

      \ is north of another, I need their approximate latitudes.\n\n4.  **Find the\
      \ location of Ozaukee County, WI:** I know Wisconsin is in the upper Midwest\
      \ of the US. Ozaukee County is just north of Milwaukee. This puts it at a relatively\
      \ high latitude in the US. A quick search reveals Ozaukee County is around 43.3\
      \ degrees North latitude.\n\n5.  **Find the location of Freestone County, TX:**\
      \ I know Texas is in the southern US. Freestone County is in East Texas, roughly\
      \ between Dallas and Houston. This puts it at a relatively low latitude in the\

      \ N\n\n7.  **Interpret the comparison:** A higher North latitude means a location\
      \ is further north. Since 43.3\xB0 N is greater than 31.7\xB0 N, Ozaukee County,\
      \ WI is at a higher latitude than Freestone County, TX.\n\n8.  **Formulate the\

      \ Yes, Wisconsin is much further north than Texas. So a county in Wisconsin\
      \ should be north of a county in Texas. The calculated latitudes confirm this\
      \ intuition.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n1. Identify the two counties: Ozaukee\

      2.  **Identify the second county:** St. Lucie County, FL.

      3.  **Determine the location of Lenawee County, MI:** Michigan is a state in
      the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada and the Great Lakes.
      Lenawee County is in the southern part of Michigan.

      4.  **Determine the location of St. Lucie County, FL:** Florida is a state in

      1.  **Identify the core question:** The question asks for a YES or NO answer
      about the relative latitude of two US counties: Lenawee County, Michigan, and
      St. Lucie County, Florida. Specifically, is Lenawee County *north* of St. Lucie
      County?


      2.  **Recall geographical knowledge:** I know that Michigan is a state in the
      northern part of the contiguous United States, bordering Canada and the Great
      Lakes. I also know that Florida is a state in the southeastern part of the United
      States, a peninsula extending into the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, known
      for its warm climate.


      3.  **Relate states to latitude:** Generally, states further north have higher
      latitudes, and states further south have lower latitudes. Michigan is significantly
      north of Florida.


      4.  **Apply state knowledge to counties:** If a county is within a state, its
      latitude will be within the general latitudinal range of that state. While there
      can be variations within a state, a county in Michigan will almost certainly
      be at a higher latitude (further north) than a county in Florida.


      5.  **Consider potential exceptions (and dismiss them in this case):** Are there
      any extreme cases where a county in a generally southern state could be further
      north than a county in a generally northern state? Not in the contiguous US
      for states as far apart as Michigan and Florida. Florida is entirely south of
      even the southernmost parts of Michigan.


      6.  **Confirm the relative position:** Michigan is clearly north of Florida.
      Therefore, *any* county in Michigan will be north of *any* county in Florida.


      7.  **Formulate the final answer:** Based on the clear geographical relationship
      between the states of Michigan and Florida, Lenawee County (in Michigan) must
      be located north of St. Lucie County (in Florida).


      8.  **Determine the YES/NO answer:** The question asks "Is Lenawee County, MI
      located north of St. Lucie County, FL?". My conclusion is yes.


      9.  **Final check:** The steps of reasoning lead directly and unambiguously
      to the conclusion that Lenawee County, MI is indeed north of St. Lucie County,

      \  Asotin County is in Washington (WA).\n    *   Bullock County is in Alabama\
      \ (AL).\n3.  **Determine the general location of the states within the US:**\n\
      \    *   Washington is a state in the Pacific Northwest, located in the northwestern\
      \ corner of the contiguous United States. It is very far north.\n    *   Alabama\
      \ is a state in the Deep South, located in the southeastern part of the contiguous\
      \ United States. It is much further south than Washington.\n4.  **Compare the\
      \ latitudes:** Since Washington is in the far northwest and Alabama is in the\
      \ southeast, Washington is at a significantly higher latitude (further north)\
      \ than Alabama.\n5.  **Apply this to the counties:** If a state is generally\
      \ north of another state, then any county within the northern state will be\
      \ north of any county within the southern state (in the contiguous US context,\
      \ where states cover a large latitudinal range). Asotin County is in Washington,\
      \ and Bullock County is in Alabama. Washington is clearly north of Alabama.\n\

      \ to determine if Broome County, NY is north of Gadsden County, FL:\n\n1.  **Identify\
      \ the core question:** The question asks about the relative latitudinal positions\
      \ of two specific counties: Broome County, NY, and Gadsden County, FL. Specifically,\
      \ is Broome County *north* of Gadsden County?\n\n2.  **Identify the locations:**\n\
      \    *   Location 1: Broome County, New York (NY)\n    *   Location 2: Gadsden\
      \ County, Florida (FL)\n\n3.  **Recall or determine the general geographical\
      \ relationship between the states:** I know or can quickly determine that New\
      \ York is a state in the northeastern United States, while Florida is a state\
      \ in the southeastern United States. New York is significantly further north\
      \ than Florida.\n\n4.  **Determine the relative positions of the states based\
      \ on latitude:** New York is known for having a more northern latitude than\
      \ Florida. Florida is known for being a peninsula extending far south, bordering\
      \ the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. This confirms New York is generally\
      \ north of Florida.\n\n5.  **Consider if the specific counties reverse this\
      \ general state relationship:** While it's *possible* that a county in the southern\
      \ part of a northern state could be south of a county in the northern part of\
      \ a southern state, this is highly unlikely given the significant latitudinal\
      \ difference between New York and Florida as entire states.\n\n6.  **Verify\
      \ the locations of the specific counties within their states:**\n    *   Broome\
      \ County, NY: Located in the southern part of New York State, bordering Pennsylvania.\n\
      \    *   Gadsden County, FL: Located in the northern part of Florida, bordering\

      \ is in *southern* NY and Gadsden County is in *northern* FL, the difference\
      \ in the overall latitudinal position of the states is vast. Southern NY is\
      \ still much further north on the globe than northern FL.\n\n8.  **Formulate\
      \ the conclusion:** Since New York is generally much further north than Florida,\
      \ and Broome County (even in southern NY) is still at a significantly higher\
      \ latitude than Gadsden County (even in northern FL), Broome County must be\
      \ located north of Gadsden County.\n\n9.  **Final Answer Format:** The question\
