      1. **Locate Skamania County, WA**: Skamania County is in the state of Washington,
      located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is situated
      to the east of the Columbia River and north of the Columbia River Gorge.


      2. **Locate Etowah County, AL**: Etowah County is located in the state of Alabama,
      in the southeastern region of the United States. It is situated in the northeastern
      part of Alabama.


      3. **Compare the latitudinal positions**: Washington is generally located to
      the north of Alabama. More specifically, Skamania County has a latitude that
      is significantly higher than that of Etowah County, which is further south.


      4. **Determine the relative positions**: Since Skamania County is in the northern
      part of the United States (Washington) and Etowah County is in the southern
      part (Alabama), it follows that Skamania County is indeed north of Etowah County.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      YES'

      2. **Coleman County, Texas**: Coleman County is located in central Texas, which
      is in the southern part of the United States.


      Now, let''s consider their latitudes:


      - Vermont (and Windsor County) is generally at a higher latitude compared to
      Texas (and Coleman County). The latitude of Windsor County is approximately
      43 degrees North.

      - The latitude of Coleman County is approximately 31 degrees North.


      Since 43 degrees North is indeed north of 31 degrees North, we can conclude
      that Windsor County, VT is located north of Coleman County, TX.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.'

      1. **Slope County, North Dakota** is located in the north-central part of the
      state. It is situated at a latitude that is generally considered to be in the
      northern part of the United States.


      2. **Crane County, Texas** is located in the western part of Texas. It is situated
      at a latitude that is significantly further south than Slope County.


      Now, comparing the latitudes of both counties:


      - Slope County, ND has a latitude of approximately 46 degrees North.

      - Crane County, TX has a latitude of approximately 31 degrees North.


      Since 46 degrees North is clearly further north than 31 degrees North, it follows
      that Slope County, ND is indeed located north of Crane County, TX.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: YES.'
