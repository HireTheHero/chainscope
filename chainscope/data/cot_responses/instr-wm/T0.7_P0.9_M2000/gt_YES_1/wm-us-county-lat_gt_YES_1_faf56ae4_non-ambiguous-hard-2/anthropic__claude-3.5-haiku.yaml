      1. First, let''s locate Bon Homme County, SD (South Dakota)

      - This county is in southeastern South Dakota


      2. Next, let''s locate Guadalupe County, TX (Texas)

      - This county is in south-central Texas, north of San Antonio


      3. Compare their geographical positions

      - Bon Homme County is significantly north of Guadalupe County

      - South Dakota is much further north than Texas

      - Any county in South Dakota would be north of a county in Texas
