      the relative positions of Yellowstone County, MT, and Pecos County, TX, based
      on their locations in the United States.


      1. **Identify the states**: Yellowstone County is located in Montana (MT), and
      Pecos County is located in Texas (TX).


      2. **General geographical knowledge**: Montana is in the northwestern part of
      the United States, while Texas is in the south-central part.


      3. **Latitude comparison**: Generally, the farther north a location is, the
      higher its latitude. Montana, being in the northwest, is at a higher latitude
      than Texas, which is in the south.


      4. **Conclusion based on state locations**: Since Montana is north of Texas,
      any county in Montana, including Yellowstone County, will be north of any county
      in Texas, including Pecos County.

      1. **Identify the states**: Lucas County is in Ohio (OH), and Highlands County
      is in Florida (FL).

      2. **Consider general geography**: Ohio is in the Midwestern United States,
      while Florida is in the Southeastern United States.

      3. **Compare latitudes**: Generally, the farther north a location is, the higher
      its latitude. Without needing exact coordinates, we can infer that Ohio is significantly
      north of Florida.

      4. **Consider county-specific locations within states**: While counties within
      a state can vary in latitude, the overall north-south positioning of the states
      themselves provides a strong indication of their relative positions. Lucas County
      in Ohio and Highlands County in Florida would still reflect the general north-south
      relationship of their respective states.


      Based on these steps, we can conclude that Lucas County, OH, is located north
      of Highlands County, FL.


      The final answer is: YES

      its latitude. Vermont is located at a higher latitude than Texas.


      4. **Consider the specific counties**: While counties within a state can vary
      in latitude, the overall north-south positioning of the states themselves provides
      a strong indication of their relative positions. Windsor County in Vermont and
      Coleman County in Texas would still reflect the general north-south relationship
      of their respective states.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the states'' positions, Windsor County, VT, is indeed
      located north of Coleman County, TX.


      The final answer is: YES

      (MN), and Tunica County is located in the state of Mississippi (MS).


      2. **Understand the general geographic positions**: Minnesota is located in
      the northern United States, while Mississippi is located in the southern United
      States.


      3. **Consider the relative positions of the states**: Since Minnesota is located
      in the northern part of the country and Mississippi is in the southern part,
      any county in Minnesota would generally be located north of any county in Mississippi.


      4. **Apply the information to the specific counties**: Given that Becker County
      is in Minnesota, which is in the northern United States, and Tunica County is
      in Mississippi, which is in the southern United States, it follows that Becker
      County is located north of Tunica County.
