      step.


      1. The question is asking whether Yellowstone County, Montana (MT) is located
      north of Pecos County, Texas (TX).


      2. First, I need to recall the general geographic arrangement of the states
      Montana and Texas within the United States. Montana is located in the northwestern
      part of the country, bordering Canada. Texas is located in the southern part
      of the United States, bordering Mexico.


      3. Since Montana is a northern state and Texas is a southern state, Montana
      is generally north of Texas.


      4. Therefore, Yellowstone County, which is in Montana, would be north of Pecos
      County, which is in Texas.


      5. Let me double-check: Montana shares borders with North Dakota, South Dakota,
      Wyoming, and Idaho, and is one of the northernmost states in the US. Texas shares
      borders with Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Mexico, and is one
      of the southernmost states in the US.


      So yes, Yellowstone County, MT is located north of Pecos County, TX.</think>#
      Is Yellowstone County, MT located north of Pecos County, TX?


      To answer this question, I need to consider the geographic positions of these
      counties and their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these counties are located.

      - Yellowstone County is in Montana (MT)

      - Pecos County is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic position of these states.

      - Montana is one of the northernmost states in the US, bordering Canada

      - Texas is in the southern US, bordering Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Montana is significantly north of Texas on any US map

      - Any county in Montana would be north of any county in Texas


      Therefore, Yellowstone County, MT is definitely located north of Pecos County,
      TX.

      one is further north.


      Step 1: Let me recall the general geographical position of Vermont and Louisiana
      in the United States.

      - Vermont (VT) is located in the northeastern United States, specifically in
      the New England region. It borders Canada to the north.

      - Louisiana (LA) is located in the southern United States, along the Gulf of
      Mexico.


      Step 2: Based on the general positions of these states, Vermont is much further
      north than Louisiana in the United States.


      Step 3: Since Grand Isle County is in Vermont, and Calcasieu Parish is in Louisiana,
      it''s highly likely that Grand Isle County is located north of Calcasieu Parish.


      Step 4: To be more precise:

      - Grand Isle County is in northwestern Vermont, situated in Lake Champlain.

      - Calcasieu Parish is in southwestern Louisiana.


      Given the position of the states themselves, any county in Vermont would be
      north of any parish in Louisiana because of the significant latitude difference
      between these states.</think>I''ll reason through this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Grand Isle County is located in Vermont (VT), which is a state in the northeastern
      United States.

      - Calcasieu Parish is located in Louisiana (LA), which is a state in the southern
      United States along the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south positioning of these states.

      - Vermont is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US, bordering
      Canada.

      - Louisiana is one of the southernmost states in the US, bordering the Gulf
      of Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Any county in Vermont will be significantly north of any parish in Louisiana
      due to the states'' positions.

      - Grand Isle County is in northwestern Vermont in Lake Champlain.

      - Calcasieu Parish is in southwestern Louisiana.

      Since Grand Isle County is in Vermont, and Calcasieu Parish is in Louisiana,
      it follows that Grand Isle County would be located north of Calcasieu Parish.


      However, to be absolutely certain, I should note that:

      - Vermont is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US

      - Louisiana is one of the southernmost states in the US

      - There is no possibility that a county in Vermont would be south of a parish
      in Louisiana</think>To determine if Grand Isle County, VT is located north of

      - Vermont is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US.

      - Louisiana is one of the southernmost states in the contiguous US.


      Step 3: Compare the specific counties/parishes.

      - Grand Isle County is in Vermont, so it shares Vermont''s northern latitude.

      - Calcasieu Parish is in Louisiana, so it shares Louisiana''s southern latitude.


      Since all of Vermont is significantly north of all of Louisiana on the map of

      be north of any parish in Louisiana (including Calcasieu Parish).

      4) Even the southernmost county in Michigan would be significantly north of
      any county in Texas.


      5) Therefore, Gogebic County, MI must be located north of Scurry County, TX.

      locations of Montana (MT) and Louisiana (LA) within the United States.


      Montana (MT) is a state in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada.
      It''s one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US.


      Louisiana (LA) is a state in the southern United States, bordering the Gulf
      of Mexico. It''s one of the southernmost states in the US.


      Since Montana is in the north and Louisiana is in the south of the United States,
      it follows that counties in Montana would be north of parishes in Louisiana.
      (In Louisiana, counties are called "parishes" but they function as counties.)


      So, Fallon County in Montana would be located north of Sabine Parish in Louisiana

      Step 2: Consider the geographic position of these states.

      - Montana is located in the northwestern United States, along the Canadian border.
      It''s one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US.

      - Louisiana is located in the southern United States, along the Gulf of Mexico.
      It''s one of the southernmost states.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - All counties in Montana, including Fallon County, are significantly farther
      north than any parish in Louisiana.

      - Montana''s southern border is at a higher latitude than Louisiana''s northern
      border.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on relative positions.

      - Since Fallon County is in a northern state (Montana) and Sabine Parish is
      in a southern state (Louisiana), Fallon County must be north of Sabine Parish.

      to determine the geographic locations of both counties and compare them.


      Step 1: Identify where Cheboygan County, MI is located.

      Cheboygan County is in Michigan (MI), which is in the northern United States.
      Michigan is one of the Great Lakes states. Specifically, Cheboygan County is
      in the northern part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula, bordering Lake Huron, near
      the tip of the "mitten" shape.


      Step 2: Identify where Worth County, GA is located.

      Worth County is in Georgia (GA), which is in the southeastern United States.
      Georgia is much farther south than Michigan. Worth County is in the southern
      part of Georgia.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Since Michigan is in the northern United States and Georgia is in the southern
      United States, it''s clear that Cheboygan County, MI is north of Worth County,
      GA. The entire state of Michigan is north of the entire state of Georgia.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Let me determine the general locations of both counties.

      - Cheboygan County is in Michigan (MI), which is in the northern United States,
      specifically in the Upper Midwest region.

      - Worth County is in Georgia (GA), which is in the southeastern United States,
      much farther south.


      Step 2: Consider their positions within their respective states.

      - Cheboygan County is located at the northern tip of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula.

      - Worth County is in southern Georgia.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Michigan as a whole state is significantly north of Georgia.

      - Even the southernmost parts of Michigan are north of the northernmost parts
      of Georgia.

      - Therefore, Cheboygan County, MI must be north of Worth County, GA.


      YES'

      County, MI is located north of Worth County, GA. This requires me to think about
      the relative geographic positions of Michigan and Georgia in the United States,
      and then the relative positions of these specific counties within their states.


      Step 1: Consider the states Michigan (MI) and Georgia (GA).

      Michigan is in the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada, specifically
      in the Great Lakes region.

      Georgia is in the southeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic Ocean.


      From a north-south perspective, Michigan is clearly north of Georgia in the
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider the specific counties within their states.

      Cheboygan County is in Michigan (MI).

      Worth County is in Georgia (GA).


      Since Michigan as a whole is north of Georgia, it''s very likely that any county
      in Michigan would be north of any county in Georgia, regardless of their specific
      positions within their respective states.


      Step 3: To be thorough, I should consider if there''s any unusual geographic
      arrangement that might make a southern Michigan county be south of a northern
      Georgia county. But this is extremely unlikely given the significant distance
      between the states.


      Michigan''s southern border is well north of Georgia''s northern border, so
      any county in Michigan, including Cheboygan County, would be north of any county
      in Georgia, including Worth County.</think>To answer this question, I need to
      determine the relative geographic positions of these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Michigan (MI) is located in the northern United States, in the Great Lakes region
      bordering Canada.

      Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States, much further south.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic fact that Michigan as a whole state is significantly
      north of Georgia.


      Step 3: Since Cheboygan County is in Michigan and Worth County is in Georgia,
      and Michigan is entirely north of Georgia on the map, it follows that Cheboygan
      County must be north of Worth County.

      County, Washington is located north of Etowah County, Alabama.


      First, let me think about the locations of the states:

      - WA is Washington state, which is in the northwest corner of the continental
      United States.

      - AL is Alabama, which is in the southeastern United States.


      Generally speaking, Washington state is much further north than Alabama. Washington
      is along the northern border of the US (bordering Canada), while Alabama is
      in the Deep South.


      Now about the specific counties:

      - Skamania County is in Washington state

      - Etowah County is in Alabama


      Since Washington state is entirely north of Alabama, any county in Washington
      (including Skamania County) would be north of any county in Alabama (including
      Etowah County).


      So Skamania County, WA is indeed located north of Etowah County, AL.</think>To
      determine if Skamania County, WA is located north of Etowah County, AL, I need
      to consider the geographic locations of both counties and their respective states.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these counties are located.

      - Skamania County is in Washington state (WA)

      - Etowah County is in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic position of these states within the US.

      - Washington state is in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada.

      - Alabama is in the southeastern United States, much further south.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Washington state is one of the northernmost states in the continental US.

      - Alabama is one of the southern states, located in what''s known as the Deep
      South.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the counties.

      Since Washington state is entirely north of Alabama, any county in Washington
      (including Skamania) must be north of any county in Alabama (including Etowah).

      2) Highlands County, FL is in Florida (FL). Florida is a state in the southeastern

      I need to think about the geographic locations of these two counties:


      1) Lucas County is in Ohio (OH), which is a northern state in the Midwest region
      of the US, bordering Lake Erie.


      2) Highlands County is in Florida (FL), which is the southernmost state in the

    e1300b21-4fe9-4dcf-a637-db73a4ded0e3: '<think>I need to determine the relative
      positions of Lucas County, OH and Highlands County, FL.


      First, let''s think about their states:

      - OH is Ohio, which is in the northern part of the United States

      - FL is Florida, which is in the southernmost part of the continental United
      States


      Based on the states alone, I''m fairly confident that any county in Ohio would
      be north of any county in Florida. Ohio is several states north of Florida.


      To be more specific:

      - Lucas County, OH is in the northwestern part of Ohio, near the Michigan border
      and Lake Erie

      - Highlands County, FL is in central/southern Florida


      Given these locations, Lucas County, OH is definitely north of Highlands County,
      FL.</think># Is Lucas County, OH located north of Highlands County, FL?


      To answer this question, I need to analyze the geographic locations of these
      two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - Lucas County is in Ohio (OH)

      - Highlands County is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic position of these states

      - Ohio is in the northern United States, bordered by Lake Erie to the north

      - Florida is the southernmost state in the continental United States


      Step 3: Consider the specific county locations

      - Lucas County is in northwest Ohio, bordering Lake Erie

      - Highlands County is in central/southern Florida


      Step 4: Compare latitudes

      Since Ohio is several states north of Florida, and the entirety of Ohio is north
      of the entirety of Florida, any county in Ohio (including Lucas) must be north
      of any county in Florida (including Highlands).


      YES - Lucas County, OH is located north of Highlands County, FL.'

      - Ohio (OH) is a northern state, located in the Midwest region

      - Florida (FL) is a southern state, at the southeastern tip of the country


      Since Ohio is a northern state and Florida is quite far south (in fact, it''s
      the southernmost continental state), any county in Ohio would be north of any
      county in Florida.


      Therefore, Lucas County, OH would be located north of Highlands County, FL.</think>To
      determine if Lucas County, OH is located north of Highlands County, FL, I''ll

      Step 1: Consider the states where these counties are located.

      - Lucas County is in Ohio (OH)

      - Highlands County is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Think about the relative positions of these states.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Florida is located at the southeastern tip of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Ohio is much further north in the United States compared to Florida

      - Florida is one of the southernmost states in the continental US


      Step 4: Make the conclusion.

      Since Ohio is substantially north of Florida, Lucas County, OH must be north
      of Highlands County, FL.

      Step 1: Let me identify where Ogemaw County, MI is located.

      Ogemaw County is in Michigan (MI), which is in the northern part of the United
      States. Michigan is in the Great Lakes region.


      Step 2: Let me identify where San Jacinto County, TX is located.

      San Jacinto County is in Texas (TX), which is in the southern part of the United

      1. I need to know where Spink County, SD is located. SD is South Dakota, which
      is a northern state in the US.


      2. I also need to know where Sterling County, TX is located. TX is Texas, which
      is a southern state in the US.


      3. Since South Dakota is a state that''s located north of Texas in the United
      States, it follows that counties in South Dakota would be north of counties
      in Texas.


      4. Therefore, Spink County, SD would be located north of Sterling County, TX.


      Let me verify this: South Dakota borders North Dakota to the north, Minnesota
      to the east, Iowa and Nebraska to the south, and Wyoming and Montana to the
      west. Texas is much farther south, bordering Oklahoma to the north, Arkansas
      and Louisiana to the east, Mexico to the south, and New Mexico to the west.

      Let me think about this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the states: SD is South Dakota, and TX is Texas.


      2) Geographically, South Dakota is located in the northern part of the United
      States, while Texas is located in the southern part.


      3) South Dakota is entirely north of Texas on a map of the United States. The
      southernmost point of South Dakota is still significantly north of the northernmost
      point of Texas.


      4) Since Spink County is in South Dakota, and Sterling County is in Texas, Spink
      County must be north of Sterling County.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      South Dakota is in the northern part of the United States, bordering North Dakota,
      Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Montana.

      Texas is in the southern part of the United States, bordering Oklahoma, Arkansas,

      South Dakota as a whole state is significantly north of Texas. Even the southernmost
      point of South Dakota is north of the northernmost point of Texas.


      Step 4: Apply this to the counties.

      - North Dakota (ND) is in the northern part of the United States, bordering

      - Kentucky (KY) is in the southeastern/central part of the United States


      Based on the general locations of these states, it''s likely that any county

      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the states: ND stands for North Dakota, and KY
      stands for Kentucky.


      2) North Dakota is one of the northernmost states in the continental US, located

      6) Since any county in North Dakota would be north of any county in Kentucky
      due to the geographic positions of these states, Rolette County must be north

      Step 1: Identify the general locations of North Dakota and Kentucky within the
      US.

      North Dakota is a northern state, bordering Canada, in the upper midwest of
      the United States.

      Kentucky is a state in the southeastern/south-central United States.


      Just from this general knowledge, North Dakota is very far north in the US,
      while Kentucky is much more southern. But let me be more precise about the specific
      counties.


      Step 2: Locate Rolette County, ND more specifically.

      Rolette County is in north-central North Dakota, and actually borders Canada.
      North Dakota itself is already a very northern state, so Rolette County being
      in the northern part of North Dakota makes it extremely northern.


      Step 3: Locate McCracken County, KY more specifically.

      McCracken County is in the western part of Kentucky, near the Ohio River. Kentucky
      itself is much further south than North Dakota.


      Step 4: Compare the latitudes.

      Given their positions, Rolette County, ND is definitely much further north than
      McCracken County, KY. North Dakota borders Canada, while Kentucky is much more
      southern in the US.


      So my answer is YES, Rolette County, ND is located north of McCracken County,
      KY.</think># Is Rolette County, ND located north of McCracken County, KY?


      I''ll solve this step by step by comparing the geographic locations of these
      two counties.


      ## Step 1: Locate the states

      - North Dakota (ND) is a northern state in the upper Midwest that borders Canada

      - Kentucky (KY) is a south-central/southeastern state much further south


      ## Step 2: Locate the specific counties

      - Rolette County is in north-central North Dakota, along the Canadian border

      - McCracken County is in the western part of Kentucky, along the Ohio River


      ## Step 3: Compare latitudes

      - Being in North Dakota, especially in the northern part bordering Canada, Rolette
      County is at a much higher latitude

      - Kentucky as a whole is significantly further south than North Dakota

      - McCracken County''s position in western Kentucky places it much further south
      than any point in North Dakota

      1. Wyoming is located in the western United States, in the Mountain region.

      2. Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, in the South Atlantic
      region.


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - Wyoming is generally much further north than Georgia.

      - Wyoming is one of the northern states, while Georgia is one of the southern
      states.


      Since Washakie County is in Wyoming, and Peach County is in Georgia, it''s highly
      likely that Washakie County is located north of Peach County. Wyoming''s southern

      likely that Windsor County is located north of Coleman County. However, let
      me think about whether there could be any exceptions based on the specific locations
      of these counties within their states.


      Vermont is entirely north of Texas. Even the southernmost point of Vermont would
      be north of the northernmost point of Texas. So any county in Vermont, including
      Windsor County, would be north of any county in Texas, including Coleman County.


      So the answer is that Windsor County, VT is indeed located north of Coleman
      County, TX.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions of
      these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' locations.

      Vermont (VT) is located in the northeastern United States, bordering Canada.

      Texas (TX) is located in the southern United States, bordering Mexico.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south relationship of these states.

      Vermont is one of the northernmost states in the continental US.

      Texas is much further south in the country.


      Step 3: Consider county locations within their states.

      Even the southernmost point of Vermont is significantly north of the northernmost
      point of Texas. This means that any county in Vermont (including Windsor County)
      must be north of any county in Texas (including Coleman County).


      YES, Windsor County, VT is located north of Coleman County, TX.'

      First, I know that Minnesota (MN) is a northern state in the US, bordering Canada,
      while Texas (TX) is a southern state bordering Mexico.


      In general, Minnesota is substantially north of Texas in terms of latitude.
      Minnesota is in the northern part of the contiguous United States, while Texas
      is in the southern part.


      So just based on the states, I would expect that Sibley County, MN is north
      of Bell County, TX. But let''s be more precise.


      Sibley County is in Minnesota, and Minnesota is entirely north of Texas. Therefore,
      Sibley County, MN must be north of Bell County, TX.</think># Is Sibley County,
      MN located north of Bell County, TX?


      Let me think about the locations of these counties:


      1) Sibley County is in Minnesota (MN)

      2) Bell County is in Texas (TX)

      3) Geographically, Minnesota is a northern state located near the Canadian border

      4) Texas is a southern state, located much further south in the US

      5) Any county in Minnesota would be north of any county in Texas due to their
      relative positions in the country


      Since Sibley County is in Minnesota and Bell County is in Texas, and Minnesota
      is entirely north of Texas, Sibley County must be north of Bell County.

      First, let''s consider the states:

      - SD (South Dakota) is in the northern part of the United States

      - TX (Texas) is in the southern part of the United States


      Just based on the states alone, we can say that South Dakota is north of Texas.
      But to be precise, let''s think about the specific counties.


      Edmunds County is in South Dakota, which borders North Dakota to the north,
      Minnesota to the east, Iowa and Nebraska to the south, and Wyoming and Montana
      to the west. South Dakota is quite far north in the US.


      Reeves County is in Texas, which borders Oklahoma to the north, Arkansas and
      Louisiana to the east, Mexico to the south, and New Mexico to the west. Texas
      is in the southern United States.

      - Edmunds County is in South Dakota (SD)

      - Reeves County is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - South Dakota is located in the northern Great Plains region of the United
      States

      - Texas is located in the southern United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - South Dakota is entirely north of Texas on the US map

      - All counties in South Dakota must therefore be north of all counties in Texas


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Since Edmunds County is in South Dakota and Reeves County is in Texas, Edmunds
      County must be north of Reeves County.

      First, let''s think about the states:

      - North Dakota (ND) is a northern state in the US, bordering Canada

      - Texas (TX) is a southern state in the US, bordering Mexico


      Based on this general knowledge, North Dakota is located north of Texas in the
      United States. So any county in North Dakota should be north of any county in
      Texas.


      Therefore, Cavalier County, ND should be located north of Stonewall County,
      TX.


      Let me double-check this reasoning:

      1. North Dakota is a northern state (near the Canadian border)

      2. Texas is a southern state (near the Mexican border)

      3. States in the north are above states in the south on a map

      4. Therefore, counties in North Dakota would be north of counties in Texas


      My reasoning checks out. Cavalier County, ND is indeed located north of Stonewall
      County, TX.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both counties by their states.

      - Cavalier County is in North Dakota (ND)

      - Stonewall County is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - North Dakota is a northern state in the US, located along the Canadian border

      - Texas is a southern state in the US, located along the Mexican border


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - North Dakota is significantly north of Texas on the US map

      - Any county in North Dakota would therefore be north of any county in Texas


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on their state locations.

      Since Cavalier County is in North Dakota, and Stonewall County is in Texas,
      Cavalier County must be north of Stonewall County.

      First, let''s think about which states these counties are in:

      - Kossuth County is in Iowa (IA)

      - McMullen County is in Texas (TX)


      Now, I need to think about the general geographic positions of these states.
      The United States is generally laid out where northern states are above southern
      states.


      Iowa (IA) is in the Midwest region of the United States, and is significantly
      north of Texas.

      Texas (TX) is in the southern United States, bordering Mexico.

      north of Texas.


      Step 3: Consider county positions within their states.

      Even without knowing the exact locations of these counties within their respective
      states, the north-south distance between Iowa and Texas is so substantial that
      any county in Iowa would be north of any county in Texas.

      part of the United States, bordering Canada. Mississippi (MS) is in the southern
      part of the United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico.


      3. Geographically, Minnesota is significantly north of Mississippi. Minnesota

      Colorado states. Idaho is in the northwestern United States, while Colorado
      is more centrally located.


      3. Specifically, Idaho is north of Colorado. Idaho borders Canada to the north,
      and is generally quite far north in the continental US.


      4. Boundary County, ID specifically would be in Idaho. Based on its name "Boundary,"

      Summit County is in northeastern Ohio. Its county seat is Akron.

      Zavala County is in southern Texas, near the Mexican border. Its county seat
      is Crystal City.


      Given the positions of these states, and the positions of these counties within
      their states, I can confidently say that Summit County, OH is located north
      of Zavala County, TX. Ohio is well north of Texas, and Summit County is not
      in southern Ohio, while Zavala County is in southern Texas, which would only
      increase the north-south distance between them.</think>I need to determine the
      geographic locations of these two counties and compare their latitudes.

      States.

      - Zavala County is in Texas (TX), which is in the southern United States, bordering
      Mexico.


      Step 2: Consider their positions within their respective states.

      - Summit County is located in northeastern Ohio. Its county seat is Akron.

      - Zavala County is located in southern Texas, near the Mexican border. Its county
      seat is Crystal City.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Ohio is entirely north of Texas on the map of the United States.

      - Even the southernmost part of Ohio is still significantly north of the Texas-Mexico
      border region where Zavala County is located.


      YES, Summit County, OH is located north of Zavala County, TX.'

      1. Lenawee County is in Michigan (MI)

      2. St. Lucie County is in Florida (FL)


      Michigan is a northern state in the US, bordering Canada, while Florida is a
      southern state at the bottom of the US east coast.


      Geographically speaking, all of Michigan is north of all of Florida. Since Lenawee

      - Michigan is located in the northern United States, in the Great Lakes region

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States, at the southern tip
      of the eastern seaboard


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes

      - All of Michigan is significantly north of all of Florida

      - Michigan''s southern border is much farther north than Florida''s northern
      border


      Step 4: Apply this to the counties

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States, extending south as a
      peninsula


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Michigan is significantly further north than Florida

      - All Michigan counties are north of all Florida counties


      Since Lenawee County is in Michigan and St. Lucie County is in Florida, and
      Michigan is entirely north of Florida, Lenawee County must be north of St. Lucie

      half.


      Step 4: More specifically, let me think about Shoshone County, ID.

      Shoshone County is in the northern part of Idaho, bordering Montana.


      Step 5: Think about Rowan County, NC.

      Rowan County is in central North Carolina.


      Step 6: Make a latitude comparison.

      - Shoshone County is in Idaho (ID), which is in the northwestern United States.

      - Rowan County is in North Carolina (NC), which is in the southeastern United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south positioning of these states.

      - Idaho is a northern state, bordering Canada at its northern edge.

      - North Carolina is much further south, positioned in the southern half of the
      United States.


      Step 3: Consider the specific positions of these counties within their states.

      - Shoshone County is in the northern part of Idaho.

      - Rowan County is in the central part of North Carolina.


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      - Even the southernmost parts of Idaho are generally north of the northernmost

      Let me think about where these counties are:


      1. Shoshone County, ID is in Idaho (ID). Idaho is in the northwestern part of
      the United States.

      2. Rowan County, NC is in North Carolina (NC). North Carolina is on the east
      coast of the United States, in the southeastern part.

      - Idaho is generally much further north than North Carolina

      - Idaho is in the northern part of the country, bordering Canada in some parts

      - North Carolina is a southern state, though not the southernmost


      To be more precise:

      - Shoshone County is in the northern part of Idaho, likely around 47-48 degrees
      North latitude

      - Rowan County, NC would be around 35-36 degrees North latitude

      - Rowan County is in North Carolina (NC), which is on the east coast in the
      southeastern United States


      ## Step 2: Compare latitudes

      - Idaho is significantly further north than North Carolina

      - Idaho is a northern state that borders Canada

      - North Carolina is a southern state (though not the deepest South)


      ## Step 3: County-specific locations

      - Shoshone County is located in the northern part of Idaho, approximately between
      47-48 degrees North latitude

      - Rowan County is in central North Carolina, approximately between 35-36 degrees

      regardless of where specifically within those states the counties are located.


      So Billings County, ND should be located north of DeSoto County, MS.</think>To
      determine if Billings County, ND is located north of DeSoto County, MS, I need
      to consider the geographic positions of these states and counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      North Dakota (ND) is a northern state that borders Canada at the northern US
      border.

      Mississippi (MS) is a southern state located near the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south relationship.

      North Dakota is substantially north of Mississippi in the United States. The
      entirety of North Dakota lies north of Mississippi.


      Step 3: Examine county locations within their states.

      Since Billings County is in North Dakota, and DeSoto County is in Mississippi,
      their relative positions would follow the same north-south relationship as their
      respective states.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Any county in North Dakota, including Billings County, would be located north
      of any county in Mississippi, including DeSoto County.

      Iowa (IA) is located in the Midwest/Upper Midwest region of the United States.

      Alabama (AL) is located in the Southeastern region of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare the general north-south positioning of these states.

      Iowa is significantly north of Alabama in the United States. Iowa borders Minnesota
      to the north and Missouri to the south, while Alabama is much further south,
      bordering Florida and the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 3: Consider the specific counties.

      Dubuque County is in Iowa, inheriting Iowa''s northern position.

      Geneva County is in Alabama, inheriting Alabama''s southern position.


      Since Iowa is substantially north of Alabama, any county in Iowa (including
      Dubuque County) would be north of any county in Alabama (including Geneva County).

      2. Idaho is a northwestern state, located in the northern part of the United
      States.

      3. Louisiana is a southeastern state, located in the southern part of the United
      States.


      Based on just the states, Idaho is definitely north of Louisiana. However, to

      5. Iberville Parish is located in the southern part of Louisiana.


      Even though Owyhee County is in the southern part of Idaho, Idaho as a whole

      Iberville Parish, LA.


      To confirm: Idaho''s southern border is still significantly north of Louisiana''s
      northern border. Therefore, any county in Idaho (including one at its southern

      ID located north of Iberville Parish, LA?


      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) Owyhee County is located in Idaho (ID), which is a northwestern state in
      the USA.

      2) Iberville Parish is located in Louisiana (LA), which is a southeastern state
      in the USA.

      3) Geographically, Idaho is much further north than Louisiana on the map of
      the United States.

      4) Even though Owyhee County is in the southern portion of Idaho, the entire

      To solve this, I need to think about the geographic locations of these counties
      in terms of their latitudes.


      Idaho is a state in the northwest of the United States, bordering Canada, Montana,
      Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, Washington, and Oregon.


      Louisiana is a state in the southern United States, located on the Gulf of Mexico.


      Given the locations of these states, generally speaking:

      - Idaho is in the northern part of the US

      - Louisiana is in the southern part of the US


      This means that counties in Idaho are almost certainly located north of parishes
      in Louisiana (note: Louisiana uses "parish" instead of "county" for its administrative
      divisions).

      Owyhee County is in southwestern Idaho.

      Iberville Parish is in southeastern Louisiana.

      Idaho is located in the northwestern United States, while Louisiana is in the
      deep south of the country.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions within the continental US.

      Even the southernmost part of Idaho is generally further north than the northernmost
      part of Louisiana due to their positions in the country.


      Step 3: Specifically locate the counties in question.

      Owyhee County is in southwestern Idaho, while Iberville Parish is in southeastern
      Louisiana.


      Step 4: Compare latitudes.

      Despite Owyhee County being in the southern part of Idaho, it still sits at

      is located north of Iberville Parish, LA, I need to know their relative locations
      in the United States.


      Idaho (ID) is a state in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada. It''s
      one of the northern states in the country.


      Louisiana (LA) is a state in the southern United States, along the Gulf of Mexico.
      It''s one of the southernmost states in the continental US.


      Given the general geography of the US:

      - Idaho is far north of Louisiana

      - Therefore, any county in Idaho should be north of any parish in Louisiana
      (parishes in Louisiana are equivalent to counties in other states)


      So, Owyhee County in Idaho should be located north of Iberville Parish in Louisiana.</think>I
      need to determine the relative positions of these two locations in the United
      States.


      Step 1: Identify the states these counties are in.

      - Owyhee County is in Idaho (ID)

      - Iberville Parish is in Louisiana (LA) (parishes in Louisiana are equivalent
      to counties)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Idaho is located in the northwestern United States

      - Louisiana is located in the southern United States along the Gulf of Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Idaho is significantly further north in the United States compared to Louisiana

      - All counties in Idaho would be north of all parishes in Louisiana based on
      their latitudes


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Owyhee County is in Idaho, and Iberville Parish is in Louisiana, Owyhee
      County must be north of Iberville Parish

      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on the US map

      - Idaho is located in the northwestern United States

      - Louisiana is located in the southern United States along the Gulf of Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes

      - Idaho is positioned much further north than Louisiana

      - All counties in Idaho would be north of all parishes in Louisiana due to their
      states'' relative positions

      - Texas (TX) is a southern state, bordering Mexico


      Based on the general locations of these states, Wisconsin is definitely north
      of Texas. So a county in Wisconsin would almost certainly be north of a county
      in Texas.


      To be more precise:

      - Calumet County is in Wisconsin

      - Palo Pinto County is in Texas


      Since Wisconsin is entirely north of Texas on the map of the United States,

      To be more precise:

      1. Wisconsin is in the northern part of the US, bordering the Great Lakes region

      2. Texas is in the southern part of the US, bordering Mexico

      Montana is significantly further north than Texas in the United States. In fact,
      Montana is one of the northernmost states in the continental US, while Texas
      is one of the southernmost states.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific counties.

      Since Treasure County is in Montana, and Cottle County is in Texas, the north-south
      relationship between the states applies to these counties as well. Any county
      in Montana would be north of any county in Texas.


      YES, Treasure County, MT is located north of Cottle County, TX.'

      (MT) and Cocke County, Tennessee (TN).


      Step 1: Let me first identify where both counties are located within their respective
      states.

      - Sanders County is located in Montana, which is in the northwestern United
      States.

      - Cocke County is located in Tennessee, which is in the southeastern United
      States.


      Step 2: Now I need to determine their relative north-south positions.

      - Montana is considerably north of Tennessee in the United States.

      - Montana borders Canada to the north, while Tennessee is much further south,
      bordering states like North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi.


      Step 3: Since Montana is north of Tennessee, it''s highly likely that any county
      in Montana would be north of any county in Tennessee. To be completely certain,
      I would need to check the specific latitudes of these counties, but based on
      the general geography of the United States, I can confidently say that Sanders
      County, MT is north of Cocke County, TN.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Sanders County is in Montana (MT), which is a northern state in the western
      United States.

      - Cocke County is in Tennessee (TN), which is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the north-south geography of the United States.

      - Montana is one of the northernmost states in the continental US, bordering
      Canada.

      - Tennessee is much further south, positioned in the mid-southern region of
      the country.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - All of Montana (including Sanders County) is significantly north of all of
      Tennessee (including Cocke County).

      - Even the southernmost point of Montana is north of the northernmost point
      of Tennessee.


      YES, Sanders County, MT is located north of Cocke County, TN.'

      to determine the relative positions of Sanders County, Montana (MT) and Cocke
      County, Tennessee (TN) on a north-south axis.


      First, I need to recall the general geographic positions of Montana and Tennessee
      within the United States:

      - Montana is a northern state, bordering Canada

      - Tennessee is in the southeastern United States


      In terms of latitude:

      - Montana is much further north than Tennessee

      - Any county in Montana would generally be north of any county in Tennessee


      Therefore, Sanders County, MT would be located north of Cocke County, TN simply
      based on the fact that Montana is significantly north of Tennessee in the United
      States.</think>I''ll solve this step by step to determine the relative positions
      of these two counties.


      Step 1: Consider the geographic locations of Montana and Tennessee.

      Montana is a northwestern state that borders Canada, located in the northern
      part of the United States.

      Tennessee is a southeastern state, located much further south in the country.


      Step 2: Consider the north-south positioning (latitude).

      Montana as a whole is significantly north of Tennessee on the map of the United
      States.

      All counties in Montana would be at higher latitudes than counties in Tennessee.


      Step 3: Specifically for Sanders County, MT and Cocke County, TN.

      Since Sanders County is in Montana, and Cocke County is in Tennessee, the geographic
      relationship between the states applies to these counties as well.


      YES, Sanders County, MT is located north of Cocke County, TN.'
    f18a3b45-fa0e-4302-85c2-89d010c601a3: '<think>I need to determine whether Sanders
      County, Montana (MT) is located north of Cocke County, Tennessee (TN). To do
      this, I need to compare their latitudes.


      Montana is a northern US state, bordering Canada, while Tennessee is in the
      southern part of the US. Generally speaking, Montana is north of Tennessee.


      To be more precise:

      - Sanders County is in the northwestern part of Montana

      - Cocke County is in eastern Tennessee


      Given the general geography of the United States, Montana is significantly north
      of Tennessee. All counties in Montana should be north of all counties in Tennessee
      on a north-south axis.


      So Sanders County, MT would be located north of Cocke County, TN.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step by comparing the geographical locations of these two
      counties.


      Step 1: First, let me consider where Montana (MT) and Tennessee (TN) are located
      within the United States.

      - Montana is a northern state, located along the US-Canada border

      - Tennessee is a southern state, located in the southeastern United States


      Step 2: Let''s think about the general north-south positioning of these states.

      - Montana is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US

      - Tennessee is considerably further south


      Step 3: Even accounting for specific county positions within each state:

      - Sanders County is in northwestern Montana

      - Cocke County is in eastern Tennessee

      - Any county in Montana would be significantly north of any county in Tennessee


      Therefore, Sanders County, MT is definitely located north of Cocke County, TN.
