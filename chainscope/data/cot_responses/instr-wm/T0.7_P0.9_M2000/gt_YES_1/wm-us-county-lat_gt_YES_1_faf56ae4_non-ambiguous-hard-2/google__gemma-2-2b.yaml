    cfba1443-634c-40ee-870e-f63894da3548: 'The only way to solve this question is
      to examine each of the counties'' positions on a map.


      It''s a good exercise to try and figure out how to do it without a map.


      Let''s start with the easiest part of this question, which is that the counties
      are both located in the United States.


      Then let''s narrow it down to the states.


      That leaves us with only two states, Vermont and Louisiana.


      Now we can examine the counties'' locations on a map.


      Vermont is in the northeastern part of the United States, while Louisiana is
      in the southeastern part.


      This means that the counties are not located in the same state, and therefore
      the answer is "no."


      I hope this helps!

      "The most northerly county is, not surprisingly, Alaska''s North Slope Borough,
      which is located in the northernmost part of the state, along the Arctic Ocean.
      It''s also the least populous county in the country, with a population of just
      30,000 people. It is bordered by the Beaufort Sea to the north, the Chukchi
      Sea to the northeast, and the Bering Sea to the east. The borough is home to
      numerous indigenous communities, including the Inuvialuit, the Gwich''in, and
      the Yup''ik. The region is known for its stunning landscapes, including glaciers,
      fjords, and tundra. It is also a popular destination for wildlife viewing, with
      opportunities to see polar bears, whales, and other animals. In terms of geography,
