    00d681ac-2e07-40a4-ab5c-2fe87e82ff9c: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate Quesnel Lake:

      - Quesnel Lake is located in British Columbia, Canada

      - It is in the central interior region of British Columbia

      - It is north of Vancouver


      2. Next, locate Ross Lake:

      - Ross Lake is located in Washington state, USA

      - It is in the North Cascades region

      - It is near the border between Washington and British Columbia


      3. Consider their relative geographic positions:

      - Quesnel Lake is north of the US-Canada border

      - Ross Lake is south of the US-Canada border

      - This means Quesnel Lake is located west of Ross Lake, not east


      4. Therefore, the answer is: NO, Quesnel Lake is not located east of Ross Lake.


      NO'

      age in what is now western New York state, near Niagara Falls.


      Step 3: Comparing their locations:

      - Four Mile Lake is in central Ontario

      - Lake Tonawanda was located near Niagara Falls

      - Niagara Falls is west of central Ontario


      Therefore, Four Mile Lake would actually be EAST of the location of the former
      Lake Tonawanda.


      The answer is: YES.'

    f0901d28-d9a5-466c-ac25-ceb5ec23276c: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Mount Athabasca is located in the Canadian Rockies, specifically in Jasper
      National Park in Alberta, Canada.


      2. Wallowa Lake is located in northeastern Oregon, United States.


      3. Alberta (where Mount Athabasca is) is west of Oregon (where Wallowa Lake

      Mountains

      - The Khentii Mountains are west of the Java Sea


      5. Conclusion:

      Since the Java Sea is located east of the Khentii Mountains, the answer is:


      YES'
