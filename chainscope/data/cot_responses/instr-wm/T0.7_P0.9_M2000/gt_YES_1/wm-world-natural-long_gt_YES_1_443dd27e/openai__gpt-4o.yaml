      4. **Specific Orientation:** While the Gorce Mountains are north of the Tatra
      Mountains, they are generally not east of Morskie Oko within the Tatra region.

      Oko.

      - Lake Izabal is in Central America, which is generally south of the United

      - Queen Victoria Sea is to the north and slightly west relative to Lake Abaya,
      given that Lake Abaya is closer to the equator and in Africa, while Queen Victoria
      Sea is in the Arctic region, north of Europe.


      Therefore, Queen Victoria Sea is not located east of Lake Abaya.


      The answer is: NO.'

      \ the east-west positions, we need to look at the longitudes:\n   - Annecy is\
      \ approximately at 6.1 degrees East longitude.\n   - Lysefjord is approximately\
      \ at 6.3 degrees East longitude.\n\n4. **Compare the longitudes**: Since 6.1\
      \ is less than 6.3, Lake Annecy is located slightly to the west of Lysefjord.\n\
      \nBased on these steps, the answer is NO; Lake Annecy is not located east of\
      \ Lysefjord."
