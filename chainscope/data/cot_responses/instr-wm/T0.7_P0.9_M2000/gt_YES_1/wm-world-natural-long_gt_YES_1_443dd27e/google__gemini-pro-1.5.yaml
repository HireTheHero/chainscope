      3. **Determine relative positions:** Indiana is in the Western Hemisphere, and

      of longitude.  Since Antarctica is essentially centered around the South Pole,
      almost *all* landmass other than Antarctica itself will be north of it.  While
      one could technically draw a line east from Mount Shinn and eventually circle
      the globe to reach Indiana, the vast majority of the eastward journey would
      be over water with no land between the two points.  Common understanding of
      "east" does not typically encompass a full global circumnavigation.


      Therefore, while technically a path due east from Mount Shinn could eventually
      reach Barbee Lake, Barbee Lake is generally considered to be *west* of Mount
      Shinn, due to the intervening continents and oceans.

      need to identify the specific Four Mile Lake in Ontario, as there might be multiple
      lakes with the same name.  A quick search shows several Four Mile Lakes in Ontario.  It''s
      important to be precise. Let''s assume the question refers to a commonly known
      one, perhaps near a larger city, or specify a region if possible. For the sake
      of this example, let''s assume a hypothetical location in central Ontario.

      Lake is east of Lake Tonawanda, a specific Four Mile Lake in far western Ontario
      *could* theoretically be west of Lake Tonawanda. Without a more precise location
      for Four Mile Lake, a definitive answer is difficult.

      3. **East/West Relative to Continents:**  Since North America is generally north
      and slightly west of Antarctica, saying something is *east* of Antarctica from
      North America is tricky.  East and west become circular at the poles.  However,
      we can think about longitude.


      4. **Longitude:** We need to know if Quidi Vidi Lake is further east in terms
      of longitude than the Pensacola Mountains.  Newfoundland is in the western hemisphere
      (negative longitude). Antarctica, including the Pensacola Mountains, spans all
      longitudes.  However, the Pensacola mountains themselves are in West Antarctica.


      5. **Western Hemisphere vs West Antarctica:**  Both locations are in the western
      hemisphere (negative longitude).  Therefore, to be *east* of the Pensacola Mountains,
      Quidi Vidi would need a longitude LESS negative (closer to zero) than the Pensacola
      Mountains.
