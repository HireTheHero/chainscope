      To answer this, I need to consider the geographic locations of these states
      and zip codes.


      North Dakota is a state in the northern United States, bordering Canada.

      Nebraska is a state in the central United States, south of North Dakota.


      Generally speaking, North Dakota is north of Nebraska. So any location in North
      Dakota would typically be north of any location in Nebraska.


      I can also look at the zip code patterns. In the US postal system, zip codes
      generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the east and northeast,
      and higher numbers are in the west and southwest. However, the first digit is
      most relevant for the region, and both these zip codes start with different
      digits (5 vs 6).


      The first digit "5" typically covers the Midwest including North Dakota, while
      "6" covers Nebraska and other central states. This doesn''t directly tell us
      about north/south positioning though.


      Given the geographic locations of the states themselves, I can confidently say
      that 58401, ND is north of 68506, NE because North Dakota is north of Nebraska.</think>#
      Is 58401, ND located north of 68506, NE?


      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1) 58401 is a ZIP code in North Dakota (ND)

      2) 68506 is a ZIP code in Nebraska (NE)

      3) Geographically, North Dakota is located directly north of Nebraska in the

      2) 68506 is a zip code in Nebraska (NE)

      3) I need to determine if the North Dakota zip code is north of the Nebraska
      zip code


      In general, North Dakota is located north of Nebraska in the United States.
      North Dakota borders Canada to the north, while Nebraska is several states south
      of the Canadian border.


      Looking at their positions:

      - North Dakota is in the northern part of the United States

      - Nebraska is in the central part of the United States


      Since North Dakota is entirely north of Nebraska on a map of the United States,
      any location in North Dakota (including zip code 58401) would be north of any
      location in Nebraska (including zip code 68506).


      So the answer should be YES.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the states these zip codes belong to.

      - 58401 is in North Dakota (ND)

      - 68506 is in Nebraska (NE)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      North Dakota is positioned along the northern US border with Canada, while Nebraska
      is located in the central United States.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      North Dakota is entirely north of Nebraska on the US map. The southern border
      of North Dakota doesn''t extend as far south as the northern border of Nebraska.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since any location in North Dakota must be north of any location in Nebraska
      due to their relative positions, zip code 58401 in ND must be north of zip code
      68506 in NE.

      The question is asking if zip code 58401 in North Dakota (ND) is located north
      of zip code 68506 in Nebraska (NE).


      To determine this, I need to:

      1. Recognize that this is about geographical locations of two zip codes

      2. Determine the relative geographical positions of North Dakota and Nebraska


      North Dakota and Nebraska are both states in the Midwest region of the United
      States. Geographically:

      - North Dakota is located along the northern border of the US (bordering Canada)

      - Nebraska is located south of North Dakota


      In terms of their positions:

      - North Dakota is further north than Nebraska

      - Any location in North Dakota would be north of any location in Nebraska


      Since 58401 is in North Dakota (ND) and 68506 is in Nebraska (NE), and North
      Dakota is north of Nebraska, we can conclude that 58401 is located north of
      68506.</think># Is 58401, ND located north of 68506, NE?

      is in Nebraska (NE).


      2) Looking at the geographical layout of US states, North Dakota is positioned
      directly north of Nebraska in the central United States.


      3) North Dakota shares its northern border with Canada, while Nebraska is located
      several states south of the Canadian border.


      4) Since these zip codes are in their respective states, and North Dakota is
      entirely north of Nebraska, any location in North Dakota (including 58401) would
      be north of any location in Nebraska (including 68506).


      Therefore, YES, 58401, ND is located north of 68506, NE.'

      40108 is a ZIP code in Kentucky (KY).

      35951 is a ZIP code in Alabama (AL).


      In general, locations with higher latitude values are further north. So I need
      to determine if the latitude of 40108, KY is greater than the latitude of 35951,
      AL.


      Kentucky is generally north of Alabama in the United States. Kentucky borders
      Tennessee to its south, and Tennessee borders Alabama to its south. So geographically
      speaking, Kentucky is north of Alabama.


      Looking at the ZIP codes more specifically:

      - ZIP codes in Kentucky typically start with 400-427

      Step 1: Let me consider the geographic locations of Kentucky and Alabama. Kentucky
      is a state that is entirely north of Alabama in the United States. Kentucky
      borders Tennessee to its south, and Tennessee borders Alabama to its south.


      Step 2: Let''s consider what we know about ZIP code geography. ZIP codes in
      Kentucky typically begin with 40-42, while Alabama ZIP codes typically begin
      with 35-36. These numbers generally follow geographic patterns.


      Step 3: Since Kentucky as a state is north of Alabama, and these ZIP codes (40108
      and 35951) are standard codes for their respective states, ZIP code 40108 in
      Kentucky must be north of ZIP code 35951 in Alabama.

      2) To answer this, I need to know the geographical positions of these zip codes.
      Since zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to be in
      the eastern and southern parts of the US, and higher numbers in the western
      and northern parts, there''s a clue here. But I should be more precise.


      3) More importantly, I know that Kentucky (KY) is generally located north of

      - 35951 is in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Kentucky is located entirely north of Alabama on the US map. Kentucky borders
      Tennessee to its south, and Alabama is south of Tennessee.


      Step 3: Since all of Kentucky is north of all of Alabama geographically, any

      - 40108 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 35951 is in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: Recall general geographic knowledge about these states.

      Kentucky is generally north of Alabama in the United States. Kentucky borders
      Tennessee to its south, and Tennessee borders Alabama to its south. So in general,
      locations in Kentucky are north of locations in Alabama.


      Step 3: Consider possible exceptions.

      While Kentucky is generally north of Alabama, specific zip codes could potentially
      be exceptions if, for example, one zip code is in the far southern part of Kentucky
      and the other is in the far northern part of Alabama. However, this is unlikely

      Kentucky is located entirely north of Alabama in the United States. Kentucky
      borders Tennessee on its southern border, and Tennessee borders Alabama on its
      northern border.


      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      Since Kentucky as a state is entirely north of Alabama as a state, any location
      in Kentucky (including zip code 40108) must be north of any location in Alabama

      Since US zip codes are geographic, I need to think about the relative positions

      States. Generally speaking, locations in Kentucky will be north of locations
      in Alabama.


      But to be more precise, I should consider that zip codes don''t perfectly align
      with latitude. However, in the US zip code system, the first digit generally
      increases from east to west, and within regions, there is some correlation with
      latitude.


      Kentucky zip codes typically start with 4, while Alabama zip codes typically
      start with 3. This is consistent with Kentucky being north of Alabama.

      Kentucky is located entirely north of Alabama in the United States. Kentucky
      shares its southern border with Tennessee, which in turn borders Alabama to
      the north.


      Step 3: Verify if this general state relationship applies to these specific
      zip codes.

      While zip codes don''t perfectly follow latitude lines, the geographic arrangement
      of these states means that any location in Kentucky (including 40108) will be

      Generally speaking, in the US:

      - Georgia is north of Florida (GA is above FL on a map)

      - Lower zip codes in the same general region often (but not always) correspond
      to more northern locations


      Let''s think about this:

      - The first 3 digits of a zip code (316xx vs 331xx) often indicate the general

      - 316xx is a lower number than 331xx, which might suggest it''s more northern

      - Georgia is north of Florida


      Given that Georgia is north of Florida, and the zip code for the Georgia location
      (31632) has a lower first 3 digits than the Florida location (33187), it seems

    dfcf16f8-46a5-49c2-a527-eb26cd00f0b8: '<think>I need to determine if the zip code
      31632 in Georgia (GA) is located north of the zip code 33187 in Florida (FL).


      First, let''s think about US geography. Georgia is a state that is located directly
      north of Florida. So in general, locations in Georgia tend to be north of locations
      in Florida.


      However, the question is about specific zip codes, and states have irregular
      shapes, so I need to be more precise.


      In the US zip code system, the first three digits generally indicate a geographic
      region. Let''s analyze the zip codes:


      31632 - This is in Georgia, starting with "316"

      33187 - This is in Florida, starting with "331"


      In the US, zip codes generally (but not always) follow a pattern where lower
      numbers are more northern. However, this is not always reliable, especially
      across state lines.


      The most important factor here is that Georgia is north of Florida, and these
      zip codes are in their respective states. While there are some parts of Georgia
      that extend south of some parts of Florida due to the irregular shape of the
      states, generally speaking, most Georgia zip codes are north of Florida zip
      codes.


      Without specific geographic information about these zip codes, I''m going to
      rely on the general geographic relationship of the states. Since 31632 is in
      Georgia and 33187 is in Florida, and Georgia is north of Florida, I believe
      31632, GA is likely north of 33187, FL.</think>To determine if 31632, GA is
      located north of 33187, FL, I need to consider the geographic positions of these
      zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 31632 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)

      - 33187 is a zip code in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography.

      Georgia is a state that borders Florida to the north. In general, Georgia locations
      are north of Florida locations.


      Step 3: Look at the zip code numbers.

      In the US zip code system, while not an absolute rule, lower numbers in the
      same region often (but not always) indicate more northern locations. Here we
      have 31632 vs 33187.


      Step 4: Verify the specific locations.

      31632 is in Alapaha, Georgia, which is in the southern part of Georgia.

      33187 is in the Miami area, which is in the far southern part of Florida.


      Even though 31632 is in southern Georgia, any location in Georgia (including
      its southernmost points) is still north of Miami, which is near the southern
      tip of Florida.


      YES, 31632, GA is located north of 33187, FL.'

      Looking at the United States geography:

      - Michigan is generally north of Kentucky in the United States

      - Michigan is in the northern part of the Midwest, bordering the Great Lakes

      \nStep 1: Let's consider the geography of New Mexico and Arizona. New Mexico\
      \ is to the east of Arizona, and they share a border. However, the question\
      \ is about whether one zip code is north of the other, not east/west.\n\nStep\
      \ 2: In the US zip code system, the first digit generally represents a large\
      \ geographical region, with lower numbers in the east and higher numbers in\
      \ the west. The first three digits (the sectional center facility or \"SCF\"\
      ) generally correspond to a specific area within a state.\n\nFor 87301 (NM)\
      \ and 85614 (AZ):\n- They both start with 8, which means they're in the same\
      \ broad region of the US.\n- 873xx is a prefix for northwestern New Mexico\n\
      - 856xx is a prefix for southern Arizona\n\nStep 3: Since we're comparing northern\
      \ NM (87301) with southern AZ (85614), and New Mexico and Arizona are roughly\
      \ at similar latitudes (with some overlap), a zip code in northwestern New Mexico\
      \ is very likely to be north of a zip code in southern Arizona.\n\nSo my reasoning\
      \ suggests that 87301, NM is north of 85614, AZ.</think>To determine if 87301,\
      \ NM is north of 85614, AZ, I need to analyze these zip codes and their geographic\

      \ in northwestern New Mexico (specifically in the Gallup area)\n- 85614 is in\
      \ southern Arizona (in the Green Valley area south of Tucson)\n\nStep 2: Consider\
      \ the general geography of these states.\n- Arizona and New Mexico are adjacent\
      \ states that share a border\n- Arizona is west of New Mexico\n\nStep 3: Compare\
      \ the latitudes.\n- Northwestern New Mexico (87301) is positioned in the upper\
      \ portion of the state\n- Southern Arizona (85614) is positioned in the lower\
      \ portion of that state\n- The northern parts of New Mexico are generally at\
      \ higher latitudes than the southern parts of Arizona\n\nStep 4: Make the comparison.\n\
      - Gallup, NM (87301) is at approximately 35.5\xB0 N latitude\n- Green Valley,\
      \ AZ (85614) is at approximately 31.9\xB0 N latitude\n\nSince 35.5\xB0 N is\

      In general, higher latitude numbers indicate locations further north in the
      United States.


      Illinois is typically north of Tennessee in the United States. Illinois is in
      the Midwest region, while Tennessee is in the Southeast/South region.


      Specifically:

      - 60625 is in Chicago, Illinois (northern Illinois)

      - 37128 is in Murfreesboro, Tennessee (central Tennessee)


      Since Illinois is north of Tennessee, and specifically Chicago is in northern
      Illinois while Murfreesboro is in central Tennessee, it''s very likely that
      60625, IL is north of 37128, TN.


      Also, the first two digits of zip codes in the US roughly correspond to geographic
      location, with lower numbers generally in the northeast and higher numbers as
      you move south and west. The fact that the Illinois zip starts with 60 and the

      60625 in Illinois is located north of zip code 37128 in Tennessee.


      To answer this, I need to know the relative geographical positions of these
      zip codes. In the US, zip codes generally follow a pattern where higher numbers
      tend to be in the northern and western parts of the country, but I should verify
      the specific locations.


      60625 is in Illinois (IL), which is a northern state.

      37128 is in Tennessee (TN), which is south of Illinois.


      In general, Illinois is north of Tennessee in the United States. Illinois borders
      Wisconsin to the north and extends down to where it borders Kentucky, while
      Tennessee is further south, bordering Kentucky on its northern border.


      Since 60625 is in Illinois and 37128 is in Tennessee, and Illinois is geographically
      north of Tennessee, it''s very likely that 60625 is north of 37128.


      To be even more precise:

      - 60625 appears to be in the Chicago area in northeastern Illinois

      - 37128 appears to be in the Murfreesboro area in central Tennessee


      Given these locations, 60625 in Illinois is definitely north of 37128 in Tennessee.</think>To
      determine if 60625, IL is north of 37128, TN, I need to analyze the geographic
      locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 60625 is a zip code in Illinois (IL), specifically in the Chicago area in
      the northeastern part of the state.

      - 37128 is a zip code in Tennessee (TN), in the Murfreesboro area in central
      Tennessee.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Illinois and Tennessee.

      - Illinois is a northern state that extends from the Wisconsin border down to
      Kentucky.

      - Tennessee is located south of Illinois, with Kentucky in between them.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations within their states.

      - 60625 being in Chicago puts it in the northern part of Illinois.

      - 37128 in Murfreesboro is in central Tennessee.


      Since Illinois is entirely north of Tennessee on the map of the United States,
      any location in Illinois (including 60625) must be north of any location in
      Tennessee (including 37128).

      to determine if 24179, VA is located north of 29033, SC.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 24179 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      - 29033 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      Virginia is a state in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, while South
      Carolina is located in the southeastern United States. Generally speaking, Virginia
      is north of South Carolina.


      Step 3: Think about the relative positions.

      Since zip codes are generally assigned in geographic patterns where lower numbers
      tend to be in the northeastern parts of the US and higher numbers toward the
      southwest, the zip code 24179 in VA being lower than 29033 in SC is consistent
      with the northern location.


      Step 4: Make the conclusion.

      Since Virginia is geographically north of South Carolina, and the zip codes
      follow the expected pattern, 24179, VA is likely north of 29033, SC.</think>I
      need to determine whether 24179, VA is north of 29033, SC.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 24179 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 29033 is in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Virginia is located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, while South
      Carolina is in the Southeastern region. On a map of the United States, Virginia
      is positioned entirely north of South Carolina.


      Step 3: Verify if this general state relationship applies to these specific
      zip codes.

      Even without knowing the exact locations of these zip codes within their states,
      any location in Virginia will be north of any location in South Carolina because
      there is no geographic overlap between these states.


      YES, 24179, VA is located north of 29033, SC.'
    3bc0b2ab-2704-4faa-8ecd-b1bc83427060: '<think>To determine if 24179, VA is located
      north of 29033, SC, I need to:


      1. Identify what state VA and SC stand for

      2. Find the locations of these zip codes

      3. Compare their geographical positions (north/south)


      VA stands for Virginia, and SC stands for South Carolina.


      Now, I need to think about the relative positions of these states. Virginia
      is located north of South Carolina on the US east coast. The states from north
      to south in that region are roughly:

      - Virginia

      - North Carolina

      - South Carolina


      Since Virginia (VA) is north of South Carolina (SC), zip code 24179 in Virginia
      is very likely north of zip code 29033 in South Carolina.


      To be completely certain, I would need to check if there are any unusual geographical
      quirks with these specific zip codes, but based on the general locations of
      these states, it''s highly likely that 24179, VA is indeed north of 29033, SC.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 24179 is in VA (Virginia)

      - 29033 is in SC (South Carolina)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      Virginia is located north of South Carolina on the US east coast. Looking at
      a map of the US, the states are arranged with Virginia above North Carolina,
      which is above South Carolina.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      While zip codes can sometimes have unusual distributions, the first digits of
      US zip codes generally follow a geographical pattern. The "2" in 24179 indicates
      a more northern region than the "2" in 29033, which further supports the state-level
      geography.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Since Virginia is definitively north of South Carolina, and there are no geographical
      anomalies that would place a Virginia zip code south of a South Carolina zip
      code, 24179 VA must be north of 29033 SC.


      YES'

      north of 29033, SC, I need to:


      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their latitudes (north-south positions)


      24179 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      29033 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)


      Generally speaking, Virginia is located north of South Carolina in the United
      States. Virginia shares its southern border with North Carolina, which is north
      of South Carolina.


      The specific zip codes might have unusual positions, but the general geography
      of US states would suggest that any location in Virginia would be north of any
      location in South Carolina.


      So based on the geographical positions of these states:

      - Virginia (24179) is further north

      - South Carolina (29033) is further south


      Therefore, 24179, VA should be located north of 29033, SC.</think>I''ll solve
      this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify what states these zip codes are in.

      - 24179 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 29033 is in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Virginia is located north of North Carolina

      - North Carolina is located north of South Carolina

      - Therefore, Virginia is north of South Carolina


      Step 3: While specific zip codes within states could theoretically have unusual
      relative positions, the entire state of Virginia is geographically north of
      the entire state of South Carolina.


      Step 4: Therefore, any location in Virginia (including zip code 24179) must
      be north of any location in South Carolina (including zip code 29033).

      Even without knowing the exact locations of these zip codes within their respective

      Since these are US zip codes, I can use the fact that generally, zip codes are
      organized geographically. For instance, lower zip code numbers tend to be in
      the eastern and northeastern parts of the US, and higher numbers tend to be
      in the western parts.


      However, within this general pattern, we need to compare the states:

      - 29205 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 32601 is in Florida (FL)


      South Carolina is a state that is located north of Florida on the US map. Florida
      is the southernmost state in the continental United States, while South Carolina
      is several states north of Florida.


      So regardless of the specific locations within each state, any location in South
      Carolina will be north of any location in Florida.


      Therefore, 29205, SC is indeed located north of 32601, FL.</think>To determine
      if zip code 29205 in South Carolina is north of zip code 32601 in Florida, I
      need to consider the geographic locations of these states.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 29205 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 32601 is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Florida is the southernmost state in the continental United States

      - South Carolina is located several states north of Florida on the eastern seaboard


      Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the specific zip codes.

      - Since any location in South Carolina is north of any location in Florida (due
      to their relative positions), it follows that zip code 29205 in SC must be north
      of zip code 32601 in FL.


      YES, 29205, SC is located north of 32601, FL.'

      step:


      1) 29205 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)

      2) 32601 is a zip code in Florida (FL)


      I need to determine if the location with zip code 29205 in South Carolina is
      north of the location with zip code 32601 in Florida.


      In the United States, states that are further north generally have lower zip
      codes than states that are further south. However, this is not a perfect correlation
      since zip codes are assigned by region and postal routes, not strictly by latitude.


      But in general, we know that South Carolina (SC) is north of Florida (FL). SC
      shares borders with North Carolina to its north, and Georgia to its south. Florida
      is south of Georgia. So geographically, any location in South Carolina would
      be north of any location in Florida.


      So just based on the states, 29205 in SC would be north of 32601 in FL.


      Additionally, looking at the zip codes themselves: 29xxx (for SC) is a lower
      number than 32xxx (for FL), which is consistent with the general pattern of
      lower zip codes being assigned to more northern areas on the east coast of the
      US.


      So based on both the state locations and the zip code patterns, 29205, SC is
      located north of 32601, FL.</think># Is 29205, SC located north of 32601, FL?


      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1) 29205 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)

      2) 32601 is a zip code in Florida (FL)

      3) Geographically, South Carolina is located entirely north of Florida on the
      US east coast

      4) Additionally, on the east coast of the US, zip codes generally follow a pattern
      where more northern locations have lower numbers than southern locations

      5) The zip code for the South Carolina location (29205) has a lower number than
      the Florida location (32601), which is consistent with this pattern


      Since South Carolina is north of Florida, and these zip codes follow the standard
      geographical pattern, the location with zip code 29205 in SC is indeed north
      of the location with zip code 32601 in FL.

      The question is asking whether the location in Oklahoma is north of the location

      Oklahoma ZIP codes generally start with 73-74

      Texas ZIP codes generally start with 75-79


      Since 73644 is in the Oklahoma range and 75149 is in the Texas range, and Oklahoma
      is generally north of Texas, it''s likely that 73644, OK is indeed north of
      75149, TX.


      To be even more certain, I can recall that ZIP codes in the US often follow
      a pattern where lower numbers tend to be in the northeastern parts of the country,
      and higher numbers tend to be in the southwestern parts. Since 73644 is a lower
      number than 75149, this further suggests that 73644 is likely to be north of
      75149.


      Based on these considerations, I believe that 73644, OK is north of 75149, TX.</think>#
      Is 73644, OK located north of 75149, TX?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 73644 is in Oklahoma (OK)

      - 75149 is in Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography

      Oklahoma is directly north of Texas along most of their shared border. This
      gives us a general indication, but I need to check the specific ZIP codes.


      ## Step 3: Analyze the ZIP codes

      - 73644 appears to be in western Oklahoma (Hobart area)

      - 75149 is in the Dallas-Fort Worth area of Texas (Mesquite)


      ## Step 4: Compare positions

      The Dallas-Fort Worth area is in north Texas, but it''s still south of the Oklahoma
      border. Hobart, OK is definitely north of Dallas, TX.

      First, let me think about the geography of the United States. Kentucky is a
      state that is located north of Georgia. In general, locations in Kentucky would
      be north of locations in Georgia.


      We can also reason about this using the zip codes themselves. In the US zip
      code system:

      - The first digit generally represents a group of states, with lower numbers
      typically being in the eastern/northeastern US and higher numbers in the western
      US

      - The first three digits generally represent a sectional center facility


      So for:

      - 40422 (KY): The "4" indicates a region that includes Kentucky

      - 31206 (GA): The "3" indicates a region that includes Georgia


      Additionally, within the general zip code system, higher numbers in the first
      digit tend to be more northern (except for the far west). So a "4" prefix (Kentucky)
      would generally be north of a "3" prefix (Georgia).


      So based on both the state locations and the zip code structure, 40422, KY should
      be north of 31206, GA.</think># Is 40422, KY located north of 31206, GA?

      1) First, I need to identify the states: 40422 is in Kentucky (KY) and 31206
      is in Georgia (GA)


      2) Looking at the geography of the United States, Kentucky is located north
      of Georgia - Kentucky shares its southern border with Tennessee, which in turn
      borders Georgia to its north


      3) While specific zip codes within states could sometimes create exceptions
      (like a northern Georgia zip code potentially being north of a southern Kentucky
      zip code), this is not the case here


      4) In the US zip code system, these codes follow general geographic patterns

      - All locations in Kentucky have higher latitudes than locations in Georgia


      Step 4: Make the determination

      - Since 40422 is in Kentucky and 31206 is in Georgia, and Kentucky is north

      - Georgia (GA) is a state in the southeastern United States


      In terms of geographical positioning, Kentucky is generally located north of
      Georgia. Kentucky shares borders with states like Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois
      to its north, and Tennessee to its south. Georgia is further south, bordering
      Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina.


      Since 40422 is a zip code in Kentucky and 31206 is a zip code in Georgia, and
      Kentucky is north of Georgia, it follows that 40422, KY would be north of 31206,
      GA.


      So the answer should be YES, 40422, KY is located north of 31206, GA.</think>To
      determine if 40422, KY is located north of 31206, GA, I need to analyze their
      geographical positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved

      - 40422 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 31206 is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      Kentucky is located in the east-central United States, while Georgia is in the
      southeastern United States. On a map of the US, Kentucky sits entirely north
      of Georgia.


      Step 3: Consider zip code specifics

      While specific zip codes might vary in their exact north-south positioning within
      their respective states, Kentucky''s southern border is still north of Georgia''s
      northern border. Even the southernmost point of Kentucky is north of the northernmost
      point of Georgia.


      Step 4: Draw conclusion

      Since 40422 is in Kentucky and 31206 is in Georgia, and Kentucky is definitively
      north of Georgia, we can conclude that 40422, KY is located north of 31206,
      GA.


      YES'

      To answer this, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative positions north/south


      Let me start with what I know about US geography: Oklahoma (OK) is generally
      located north of Texas (TX), as it borders Texas on its northern border. So
      at a state level, locations in Oklahoma tend to be north of locations in Texas.


      However, I need to be more specific with these particular zip codes:


      74104 appears to be a zip code in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which is in the northeastern
      part of Oklahoma.

      77807 appears to be a zip code in Bryan/College Station area, Texas, which is
      in the central-eastern part of Texas.


      Given that Oklahoma borders Texas on the north, and these specific locations

      in Kentucky (KY).


      To answer this, I need to reason about the geographical locations of these zip
      codes.


      First, let me think about the general geography of Indiana and Kentucky. Indiana
      is a state that is generally north of Kentucky. The two states share a border,
      with Indiana to the north and Kentucky to the south.


      Given that general information, we would expect that a zip code in Indiana would
      be north of a zip code in Kentucky. However, to be more precise, I should consider
      the specific locations of these zip codes.


      Without having specific coordinate data for these zip codes, I can make a reasonable
      judgment based on the state locations:

      - 46565 is in Indiana (IN)

      - 42141 is in Kentucky (KY)


      Since Indiana is north of Kentucky, and these zip codes are in their respective
      states, it''s reasonable to conclude that 46565, IN is north of 42141, KY.</think>#
      Is 46565, IN located north of 42141, KY?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 46565 is in Indiana (IN)

      - 42141 is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Indiana is located directly north of Kentucky. The two states share a border,
      with Indiana positioned above Kentucky on the map.


      Step 3: Consider zip code patterns.

      While zip codes aren''t perfectly sequential by latitude, they generally follow
      regional patterns. The higher first digits in the Indiana zip code (46xxx vs
      42xxx) are consistent with its northern position.


      Step 4: Make the determination based on state locations.

      Since 46565 is in Indiana, and 42141 is in Kentucky, and Indiana is north of
      Kentucky, the zip code in Indiana must be north of the zip code in Kentucky.

      In the US, zip codes aren''t perfectly aligned with latitude, but I can use

      Indiana (IN) is located north of Kentucky (KY). The entire state of Indiana

      Since Indiana is entirely north of Kentucky, any location in Indiana (including
      46565) would be north of any location in Kentucky (including 42141).

      To solve this, I need to understand the geographic positions of these zip codes.
      Let me think about the relative positions of Indiana and Kentucky states.


      Indiana is a state in the Midwest region of the United States, and Kentucky
      is a state in the southeastern United States. Generally speaking, Indiana is
      located north of Kentucky. They share a border, with Indiana being directly
      north of Kentucky.


      Now, let''s think about the specific zip codes:

      - 46565 is in Indiana (IN)

      - 42141 is in Kentucky (KY)


      Since Indiana is north of Kentucky geographically, and these zip codes are in
      their respective states, it''s highly likely that 46565, IN is located north
      of 42141, KY.


      Additionally, we can look at the zip code numbers themselves. In the U.S. postal
      system, zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the
      eastern and northeastern parts of the country, and higher numbers are in the
      western and southern parts. However, within individual states, the pattern may
      vary, so I can''t rely solely on the numeric values.


      Given that Indiana is geographically north of Kentucky, I can conclude that
      46565, IN is located north of 42141, KY.</think>To determine if 46565, IN is

      1. Identify the locations corresponding to these zip codes

      2. Determine their latitudes

      3. Compare the latitudes to see which is further north


      Let me work through this:


      15683 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      24523 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)


      In general, Pennsylvania is located north of Virginia in the United States.
      Pennsylvania borders Virginia''s northern neighbor (Maryland), so Pennsylvania
      is typically north of Virginia.


      However, to be precise about these specific zip codes, I should identify their
      exact locations. Without looking up the exact coordinates, I can use my general
      knowledge:


      - Pennsylvania zip codes starting with "156" are in the southwestern part of
      Pennsylvania

      - Virginia zip codes starting with "245" are in the central/western part of
      Virginia


      Even though 15683 is in the southern part of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania as a
      whole is north of Virginia. The northernmost parts of Virginia are still generally
      south of the southernmost parts of Pennsylvania.


      So my reasoning suggests that 15683, PA should be north of 24523, VA.</think>#
      Is 15683, PA located north of 24523, VA?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes based on their
      geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 15683 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 24523 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      - Pennsylvania is located directly north of Maryland

      - Virginia is located south of Maryland

      - This means Pennsylvania is north of Virginia


      Step 3: Analyze the specific zip codes

      - 15683 is in southwestern Pennsylvania

      - 24523 is in central/western Virginia

      - Even though 15683 is in the southern portion of Pennsylvania, the geographic
      positioning of the states means it would still be north of locations in Virginia


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on general geographic positioning

      - Since Pennsylvania is entirely north of Virginia in the United States, any
      location in Pennsylvania (including 15683) would be north of any location in
      Virginia (including 24523)

      Let me break this down:

      1. I need to determine the geographical locations of these zip codes

      2. Then compare their latitudes to see which one is more north


      For 15683, PA:

      This is a zip code in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia
      in the United States.


      For 24523, VA:

      This is a zip code in Virginia.


      Since Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia on the US map, it''s likely

      To answer this question, I need to analyze the geographical locations of these

      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 15683 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 24523 is in Virginia (VA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states

      Pennsylvania is located directly north of Virginia on the US map. The entire
      state of PA is north of VA, with their borders meeting in places.


      ## Step 3: Consider zip code patterns

      US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the eastern/northeastern
      US and higher numbers as you move west/southwest. The first digit of the zip
      code is particularly important:

      - 15xxx codes are in western Pennsylvania

      - 24xxx codes are in central/western Virginia


      ## Step 4: Make a determination

      Since Pennsylvania is north of Virginia geographically, and the zip code patterns
      don''t suggest any unusual geographic anomaly, the location represented by zip
      code 15683 in PA would be north of the location represented by zip code 24523

      15683 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA).

      24523 is a zip code in Virginia (VA).


      Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is north of Virginia, as Pennsylvania borders
      Virginia''s northern neighbor (Maryland). But I need to be more precise and
      check the specific zip codes.


      Let me think about the general layout of zip codes in the US. Zip codes generally
      increase from east to west and from north to south, but there are many exceptions
      and irregularities.


      The first digit of the zip code generally indicates a large geographical region:

      - 0 and 1: Northeast

      - 2 and 3: Southeast and parts of the Mid-Atlantic

      - 4 and 5: Midwest and parts of the South

      - etc.


      Given that 15683 starts with "1", it''s likely in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania.

      Given that 24523 starts with "2", it''s likely in the northern/central part
      of Virginia.


      Based on the general geography of the US, Pennsylvania is north of Virginia.
      Even if 15683 is in southern Pennsylvania and 24523 is in northern Virginia,
      Pennsylvania''s southern border is still north of Virginia''s northern border
      (with the exception of the small part of VA that extends north between WV and
      MD).


      So without knowing the exact coordinates, I can reasonably conclude that 15683,
      PA is likely north of 24523, VA.</think># Is 15683, PA located north of 24523,

      - 15683 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      ## Step 2: Consider the geography of these states

      Pennsylvania is entirely north of Virginia in terms of geography. Pennsylvania
      borders New York to the north and Maryland to the south, while Virginia is south
      of Maryland.


      ## Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes

      Even without knowing the exact locations of these specific zip codes, we can
      be confident in our answer because:

      - All of Pennsylvania is geographically north of Virginia

      - There are no geographic anomalies where any part of Virginia extends north

      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1. 26301 is a zip code in West Virginia (WV)

      2. 27707 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      3. To determine which is further north, I need to consider the general geographic

      4. West Virginia is located north of North Carolina in the United States.

      5. While specific zip codes could potentially change this relationship in unusual

      6. West Virginia''s zip codes generally start with 24-26, while North Carolina''s
      start with 27-28, which is consistent with the general north-to-south ordering

      27707 is in North Carolina (NC).


      2) Looking at the geographic layout of the United States, West Virginia is positioned
      north of North Carolina. West Virginia shares its southern border with Virginia,
      which in turn borders North Carolina to the north.


      3) While specific zip codes can sometimes be exceptions to general state positions
      (especially in border areas), in this case the zip codes follow the standard
      geographical relationship of their states.


      4) Additionally, the US Postal Service generally assigned lower zip code numbers
      to northern areas and higher numbers to southern areas in the eastern United

      Step 1: First, I need to recall the geographical locations of West Virginia
      and North Carolina.

      West Virginia is located in the Appalachian region of the southern United States,
      but it''s actually north of North Carolina. North Carolina is further south
      along the Atlantic coast.


      Step 2: Now, let''s consider the specific zip codes.

      Zip code 26301 is in West Virginia, and zip code 27707 is in North Carolina.


      Step 3: In the United States zip code system, generally lower numbers are assigned
      to areas in the northeastern parts of the country, and numbers increase as you
      move south and west. However, this is not always perfectly consistent, especially
      for specific areas within states.


      Step 4: Given that West Virginia is geographically north of North Carolina,

      I''ll solve this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the states: WV is West Virginia, and NC is North
      Carolina.


      2) Geographically, West Virginia is located north of North Carolina. West Virginia
      borders Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Maryland, and Virginia, while North Carolina
      is further south on the Atlantic coast.


      3) While zip codes don''t perfectly align with latitude (north-south position),
      in this case we''re comparing zip codes from different states.


      4) Since West Virginia (where 26301 is located) is entirely north of North Carolina
      (where 27707 is located), we can conclude that zip code 26301 is indeed north
      of zip code 27707.

      5. Zip code 12009 is in Albany County, NY, in the eastern part of New York state.


      6. Zip code 19362 is in southeastern Pennsylvania, likely in Chester County.

      north of 19362, PA, I need to identify the locations of these two zip codes

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 12009 is a zip code in New York state (NY)

      - 19362 is a zip code in Pennsylvania state (PA)


      In general, locations with lower zip codes in the northeastern US tend to be
      more northerly, as the zip code system generally assigns lower numbers in the
      northeast and higher numbers as you move south and west. New York state is generally
      north of Pennsylvania.


      Based on my knowledge of US geography:

      - New York is generally north of Pennsylvania

      - Zip codes starting with 120xx are likely in the eastern part of upstate New
      York

      - Zip codes starting with 193xx are likely in southeastern Pennsylvania


      Given these geographic patterns, it''s very likely that 12009, NY is indeed
      north of 19362, PA. The zip code 12009 should be in the Capital Region of New
      York, while 19362 would be in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania near the

      So yes, 12009, NY is almost certainly located north of 19362, PA.</think># Is
      12009, NY located north of 19362, PA?


      Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the general locations of these zip codes based
      on their state and numbering patterns.


      2) Zip code 12009 is in New York (NY). The "120xx" zip codes are typically located
      in the Capital District region of eastern New York state.


      3) Zip code 19362 is in Pennsylvania (PA). The "193xx" zip codes are typically
      located in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania.


      4) Geographically, New York state is positioned north of Pennsylvania.


      5) More specifically, the Capital District region of NY (where 12009 would be)
      is significantly north of southeastern Pennsylvania (where 19362 would be).


      6) The US postal zip code system generally assigns lower numbers in the northeastern
      US, with numbers increasing as you move south and west. The fact that 12009
      has a lower first digit than 19362 also supports that it''s in a more northern
      region.


      YES, 12009, NY is located north of 19362, PA.'

      1. First, I need to identify where 12009, NY is located. 12009 is a ZIP code
      in New York state.

      2. Then, I need to identify where 19362, PA is located. 19362 is a ZIP code
      in Pennsylvania.

      3. Finally, I need to determine if the NY location is north of the PA location.


      Generally, New York state is north of Pennsylvania, but I need to be more precise
      since we''re talking about specific ZIP codes, and some parts of NY could be
      south of some parts of PA.


      Let me think about the ZIP code patterns:

      - ZIP codes in the northeastern US generally start with lower numbers in the
      north and increase as you go south.

      - New York ZIP codes typically start with 1, while Pennsylvania ZIP codes typically
      start with 1 or 2.


      In this case, 12009 (NY) starts with 12, while 19362 (PA) starts with 19. The
      lower number (12) indicates a more northern location compared to the higher
      number (19).

      - 12009 is a ZIP code in New York (NY)

      - 19362 is a ZIP code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the ZIP code numbering system.

      In the US postal system, ZIP codes generally follow a pattern where codes start
      with lower numbers in the northeast and increase as you move south and west.
      ZIP codes beginning with 1 cover the northeastern states.


      Step 3: Compare the specific codes.

      - 12xxx ZIP codes typically cover the eastern/central portions of New York state

      - 19xxx ZIP codes typically cover the southeastern portion of Pennsylvania


      Step 4: Determine relative positions.

      12009 (Altamont, NY) is in the eastern part of New York state, while 19362 (Oxford,
      PA) is in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania near the Maryland border. Geographically,
      New York is north of Pennsylvania, and these specific locations follow that

      To determine this, I need to figure out what locations these zip codes correspond
      to, and then compare their latitudes. A location with a higher latitude is further
      north.


      Zip code 12009 is in New York (NY). Let me recall where this might be. New York
      zip codes starting with 12xxx are generally in the eastern/capital region of
      New York state.


      Zip code 19362 is in Pennsylvania (PA). Pennsylvania zip codes starting with

      Given that New York is generally north of Pennsylvania, there''s a good chance
      that 12009, NY is north of 19362, PA. But I need to be more precise.


      Since I don''t have direct access to a zip code database, I need to think about
      the general geography:


      1. New York state is directly north of Pennsylvania

      2. Zip code 12009 in NY is likely in the eastern part of NY state

      3. Zip code 19362 in PA is likely in the eastern part of PA


      Eastern New York is still north of eastern Pennsylvania. So based on this reasoning,

      if 12009, NY is north of 19362, PA


      To answer this question, I need to determine the geographical locations of these
      zip codes and compare their latitudes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Zip code 12009 is in New York state

      - Zip code 19362 is in Pennsylvania


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographical arrangement

      - 12xxx zip codes are typically in the eastern/capital region of New York

      - 19xxx zip codes are typically in the eastern part of Pennsylvania

      - New York state is positioned directly north of Pennsylvania


      ## Step 3: Compare relative positions

      - Even when comparing the eastern portions of both states, New York locations
      remain north of Pennsylvania locations

      - The latitude of locations in eastern NY (including 12009) would be higher
      than locations in eastern PA (including 19362)


      ## Answer: YES


      12009, NY is located north of 19362, PA.'

      54143 is a zip code in Wisconsin (WI)

      61611 is a zip code in Illinois (IL)


      I need to determine if the location corresponding to 54143, WI is north of the
      location corresponding to 61611, IL.


      First, let me think about the geographic relationship between Wisconsin and
      Illinois. Generally speaking, Wisconsin is located north of Illinois in the
      United States. Wisconsin borders Illinois on Illinois''s northern border. So
      a location in Wisconsin is likely to be north of a location in Illinois.


      However, I should check the specific zip codes to be sure.


      ZIP code 54143 appears to be in northeastern Wisconsin, likely in or near Marinette
      County, which is on the border with Michigan''s Upper Peninsula.


      ZIP code 61611 appears to be in central Illinois, likely in or near Peoria County.


      Since Wisconsin is north of Illinois, and 54143 is in Wisconsin while 61611
      is in Illinois, it''s very likely that 54143, WI is indeed north of 61611, IL.</think>I
      need to determine if a location in Wisconsin is north of a location in Illinois.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 54143 is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - 61611 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Wisconsin is located directly north of Illinois. The entire state of Wisconsin
      is positioned above Illinois on a map.


      Step 3: Look at the specific zip codes.

      - 54143 is in northeastern Wisconsin (specifically in the Marinette area)

      - 61611 is in central Illinois (in the Peoria area)


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      Since Wisconsin is entirely north of Illinois, and these zip codes are in their
      respective states, the Wisconsin zip code must be north of the Illinois zip
      code.

    733d915a-e343-4ac2-b505-02cdef2c9009: '<think>Let me break this down step by step:


      1) I need to determine the location of 22124, VA (Virginia) and 29418, SC (South
      Carolina).


      2) Then I need to determine if the Virginia zip code is north of the South Carolina
      zip code.


      First, let''s consider the general geographic positions of Virginia and South
      Carolina in the United States:

      - Virginia is located on the East Coast, roughly in the mid-Atlantic region

      - South Carolina is also on the East Coast, but further south, in the southeastern
      region


      In general, Virginia is north of South Carolina. But I should be more specific
      about these particular zip codes.


      Zip code 22124 is in Virginia, and based on the general pattern of US zip codes,
      lower numbers tend to be in the eastern and northeastern parts of the country.
      Virginia zip codes generally start with 220-246.


      Zip code 29418 is in South Carolina. South Carolina zip codes generally start
      with 290-299.


      Given that Virginia is entirely north of South Carolina geographically, and
      these are valid zip codes for their respective states, it''s very likely that
      22124, VA is indeed north of 29418, SC.</think># Is 22124, VA located north
      of 29418, SC?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 22124 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 29418 is in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Virginia is located on the mid-Atlantic coast of the United States, while South
      Carolina is located on the southeastern coast. Looking at a US map, Virginia
      is entirely north of South Carolina.


      Step 3: Consider if there are any geographic anomalies with these specific zip
      codes.

      While some states have irregular borders, Virginia and South Carolina have a
      straightforward north-south relationship. Virginia''s southern border is well
      north of South Carolina''s northern border, with North Carolina in between them.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on geography.

      Since all of Virginia (including zip code 22124) is north of all of South Carolina
      (including zip code 29418), the answer is clear.

      In the US zip code system, the first digit generally indicates a broad geographical

      Georgia is generally located north of Florida in the United States. This is

      First, let''s identify what these zip codes represent:

      - 30566 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)

      - 32818 is a zip code in Florida (FL)


      In the US postal code system, generally:

      1. The first digit represents a broad geographical region (from 0 in the Northeast
      to 9 in the West)

      2. The first three digits together represent a more specific area within that

      Looking at these two zip codes:

      - 305xx zip codes are in Georgia

      - 328xx zip codes are in Florida


      Now, I need to think about the geographical relationship between Georgia and

      First, let me identify what these ZIP codes represent:

      - 30566 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 32818 is in Florida (FL)


      To determine if one location is north of another, I need to compare their latitudes.
      A higher latitude means further north.


      However, I don''t have direct access to the exact latitudes of these specific
      ZIP codes. But I can reason about this using the general pattern of ZIP codes
      in the United States.


      In the U.S. ZIP code system:

      1. The first digit generally divides the country from east to west, with 0 on
      the east coast and 9 on the west coast.

      2. The first three digits together (the "sectional center facility" or SCF)
      generally represent a geographical region.


      Georgia ZIP codes typically start with 3, and Florida ZIP codes also typically
      start with 3.


      Since both states are on the eastern side of the US, we can''t use the first
      digit to determine north/south positioning.


      However, Georgia is generally north of Florida geographically. Georgia borders
      Florida on its northern border. So any location in Georgia would be north of
      any location in Florida.


      Therefore, 30566, GA would be north of 32818, FL simply because Georgia is north
      of Florida.


      Additionally, looking at the first three digits: 305 vs 328, lower numbers in
      this region generally correspond to more northern locations (though this is
      not always consistent).</think># Is 30566, GA located north of 32818, FL?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 30566 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 32818 is in Florida (FL)

      Georgia is located directly north of Florida. The entire state of Georgia is

      Step 3: Consider the specific ZIP codes.

      While specific ZIP codes within states can vary in their exact north/south positioning,
      in this case, since we''re comparing locations from different states with a
      clear north/south relationship, the state locations determine the answer.


      Since any location in Georgia is north of any location in Florida (due to their
      geographic positions), ZIP code 30566 in Georgia must be north of ZIP code 32818
      in Florida.

      - 03784 is a zip code in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 10457 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Determine their specific locations.

      - 03784 appears to be in Newport or Sunapee, New Hampshire, which is in the
      central/western part of NH

      - 10457 is in the Bronx, New York City, which is in the southern part of New
      York state


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - New Hampshire is generally north of New York City

      - The Bronx (NYC) is located in the southern part of New York state

      - Even the northernmost parts of NYC are south of central New Hampshire


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Newport/Sunapee, NH (03784) is definitely north of the Bronx, NY (10457)

      46013 is a zip code in Indiana (IN)

      40475 is a zip code in Kentucky (KY)


      Generally speaking, Indiana is north of Kentucky, as Kentucky is directly south
      of Indiana. The two states share a border, with Indiana being to the north.


      Now, the specific zip codes might be in different parts of their respective
      states, but given that:

      - Indiana zip codes typically start with 46-47

      Step 3: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      - Indiana zip codes generally start with 46-47

      - Kentucky zip codes generally start with 40-42

      - The zip code 46013 is in Indiana, and 40475 is in Kentucky


      Step 4: Make a determination based on geography.

      Since Indiana is north of Kentucky, and these zip codes are in their respective

      Step 2: Now, I need to consider the specific zip codes. In the US zip code system,
      the first three digits typically indicate a sectional center facility (SCF)

      First, I know that Oklahoma is generally north of Texas in the United States,
      which suggests that a zip code in Oklahoma might be north of one in Texas. But
      I need to confirm this with the specific zip codes.

      First, let me understand what these ZIP codes correspond to:

      - 97330 is a ZIP code in Oregon (OR)

      - 94585 is a ZIP code in California (CA)


      To determine which is further north, I need to compare their latitudes. Generally,
      higher latitude numbers indicate locations further north in the northern hemisphere.


      Oregon is a state that''s located north of California on the US west coast.
      So generally, locations in Oregon would be north of locations in California.
      However, I should think more specifically about these ZIP codes, as states have

      97330 appears to be the ZIP code for Corvallis, Oregon. Corvallis is located
      in the Willamette Valley in western Oregon.


      94585 appears to be the ZIP code for Suisun City, California, which is located
      in Solano County in the northern part of California, not far from the San Francisco
      Bay Area.


      Given Oregon''s position relative to California, and specifically Corvallis''

    05e199e7-a4dc-427e-ab02-f8084245f840: '<think>Let me break this down step by step:


      1. The question is asking about the relative positions of two US zip codes:
      39350 in Mississippi (MS) and 70047 in Louisiana (LA).


      2. Specifically, I need to determine if 39350, MS is located north of 70047,
      LA.


      3. To answer this, I need to understand the general geography of these states
      and where these zip codes are located.


      4. Mississippi (MS) is generally located north of Louisiana (LA). Mississippi
      borders Louisiana on Louisiana''s northern side.


      5. ZIP code 39350 is in Mississippi. While I don''t know exactly where in Mississippi
      this zip code is, the fact that it''s in MS suggests it''s likely north of most
      of Louisiana.


      6. ZIP code 70047 is in Louisiana. I don''t know exactly where in Louisiana
      this zip code is.


      7. Without specific location data for these zip codes, I need to use my general
      knowledge about US geography and ZIP code assignments.


      8. In the US ZIP code system, generally lower numbers are in the eastern parts
      of the country and higher numbers are in the western parts. The first digit
      indicates a general region (0-9 from east to west).


      9. The ZIP codes here (39350 and 70047) have different first digits (3 vs 7),
      which typically indicates they''re in different regions.


      10. ZIP codes starting with 3 are generally in the southeastern states, and
      codes starting with 7 are typically in the south-central states.


      11. Within this system, Mississippi (with ZIP codes often starting with 3) would
      typically be east of Louisiana (with ZIP codes often starting with 7).


      12. However, being east/west doesn''t directly tell us about north/south positioning.


      13. But knowing that Mississippi is generally north of Louisiana, I can infer
      that a ZIP code in Mississippi (39350) is likely north of a ZIP code in Louisiana
      (70047).</think># Is 39350, MS located north of 70047, LA?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1) 39350 is a ZIP code in Mississippi (MS)

      2) 70047 is a ZIP code in Louisiana (LA)

      3) 39350 (MS) is specifically in Philadelphia, Mississippi, in the central-eastern
      part of the state

      4) 70047 (LA) is in the LaPlace area, which is in southern Louisiana near New
      Orleans

      5) Geographically, Mississippi is positioned above Louisiana on the map

      6) Even the southern parts of Mississippi are generally north of southern Louisiana
      areas like LaPlace

      7) Philadelphia, MS is in the central part of Mississippi, making it significantly
      north of LaPlace, LA


      ## Answer: YES


      39350, MS (Philadelphia, Mississippi) is indeed located north of 70047, LA (LaPlace,
      Louisiana).'

      The zip codes are:

      1. 39350, MS (Mississippi)

      2. 70047, LA (Louisiana)


      I need to determine if 39350, MS is located north of 70047, LA.


      First, I''ll think about the general geographic orientation of Mississippi and
      Louisiana. Mississippi is generally north and east of Louisiana. But I need
      to be more precise about these specific zip codes.


      Looking at US zip code patterns:

      - Mississippi zip codes generally start with 386-397

      - Louisiana zip codes generally start with 700-714


      The fact that Mississippi has 393xx codes and Louisiana has 700xx codes aligns
      with the general geographic pattern that Mississippi is north of Louisiana.
      But I should verify the specific locations.


      Zip code 39350 appears to be in Mississippi, likely in the central or southern
      part of the state.

      Zip code 70047 appears to be in Louisiana, likely in the southeastern part of
      the state.


      Given the general geographic relationship between Mississippi and Louisiana,
      and the pattern of zip codes, it''s very likely that 39350, MS is indeed north
      of 70047, LA. Louisiana is the southernmost state between the two, and Mississippi
      sits above it.</think># Comparing Locations of Zip Codes 39350, MS and 70047,
      LA


      I need to determine if the Mississippi zip code is north of the Louisiana zip
      code.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 39350 is in Mississippi (MS)

      - 70047 is in Louisiana (LA)


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic orientation

      Mississippi is located directly north of Louisiana in the United States. The
      states share a border, with Mississippi positioned above Louisiana.


      ## Step 3: Consider zip code patterns

      - Mississippi zip codes typically range from 386xx to 397xx

      - Louisiana zip codes typically range from 700xx to 714xx


      ## Step 4: Specific location analysis

      39350 is in central Mississippi, while 70047 is in southern Louisiana. Given
      the geographic arrangement of these states, any location in Mississippi would
      be north of southern Louisiana.

      2. First, let''s think about the geographic relationship between Mississippi
      and Louisiana. Generally speaking, Mississippi is located to the north and east
      of Louisiana. Louisiana is on the Gulf Coast, and Mississippi is above it.


      3. However, the states have irregular shapes, so we need to check the specific
      zip codes.

      5. 70047 is a zip code in Louisiana. Louisiana is generally south of Mississippi,
      but again, I need to be more specific.


      6. Without detailed information about these specific zip codes, I''ll rely on

      likely in the central part of Mississippi, while Louisiana zip codes starting
      with 700xx are likely in the southeastern part of Louisiana.


      7. Given that Mississippi is north of Louisiana, and these zip codes appear

      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 39350 is in Mississippi (MS), specifically in Neshoba County in the east-central
      part of the state.

      - 70047 is in Louisiana (LA), specifically in St. Charles Parish in the southeastern
      part of the state near New Orleans.


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Mississippi is generally positioned north and east of Louisiana.

      - Louisiana extends further south toward the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations of these zip codes.

      - Neshoba County, MS (39350) is located in the central-eastern portion of Mississippi.

      - St. Charles Parish, LA (70047) is in the southern portion of Louisiana.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      - Since 39350 is in central Mississippi and 70047 is in southern Louisiana,
      and Mississippi is generally north of Louisiana, 39350 is indeed north of 70047.

      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Find the location of 39350, MS

      2. Find the location of 70047, LA

      3. Compare their latitudes (north-south positions)


      Let me think about the geography of these states first. Mississippi is generally
      located to the north of Louisiana, as Louisiana is on the Gulf Coast and Mississippi
      is above it. However, the exact locations depend on the specific zip codes.


      Mississippi''s zip codes usually start with 38 or 39, and Louisiana''s with
      70-71.


      39350 appears to be in central Mississippi.

      70047 appears to be in southern Louisiana.


      Based on the general geography, it''s very likely that 39350, MS is north of
      70047, LA, since Mississippi is generally north of Louisiana, and 70047 is likely
      in the southern part of Louisiana.


      To be more precise, I would need to know the exact latitudes of these zip codes.

      - 39350 is in Mississippi (MS)

      - 70047 is in Louisiana (LA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geography of these states

      - Mississippi is generally positioned north of Louisiana

      - Louisiana borders the Gulf of Mexico at its southern end

      - Louisiana zip codes typically start with 70-71

      - 39350 is likely in central Mississippi

      - 70047 is likely in southern Louisiana based on the numbering pattern


      ## Step 4: Make the comparison

      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 39350 is in Mississippi (MS)

      - 70047 is in Louisiana (LA)


      ## Step 2: Consider general state geography

      Mississippi is generally positioned north of Louisiana on the US map. Louisiana
      borders the Gulf of Mexico in the south, while Mississippi is positioned above
      it.


      ## Step 3: Examine zip code patterns

      - The 393xx zip code range typically covers central Mississippi

      - The 700xx zip code range typically covers southern Louisiana near New Orleans


      ## Step 4: Determine relative position

      Based on state geography and zip code distribution patterns, zip code 39350
      in Mississippi would be located north of zip code 70047 in Louisiana.

      in Ohio (OH) is located north of zip code 25601 in West Virginia (WV).


      To determine this, I need to think about the geographic locations of these zip
      codes.


      44094 is a zip code in Ohio. While I don''t know the exact city, Ohio is generally
      located north of West Virginia in the United States.


      25601 is a zip code in West Virginia.


      In general, zip codes in the US roughly follow a pattern where lower numbers
      tend to be in the northeast and higher numbers in the west and south. However,
      this is not a perfect north-south correlation, especially when comparing across
      different states.


      Since Ohio (44094) is a state that borders West Virginia (25601) to the north,
      and considering the general geographic relationship between these states, it''s
      very likely that 44094, OH is indeed north of 25601, WV.


      Ohio is situated north of West Virginia on a map of the United States. So in

      need to determine if zip code 44094 in Ohio is located north of zip code 25601

      Step 1: Consider the geographic relationship between Ohio and West Virginia.

      Ohio is generally located north of West Virginia. The entire state of Ohio is
      positioned above most of West Virginia on a U.S. map.


      Step 2: Identify the specific locations.

      Zip code 44094 is in Willoughby, Ohio, which is in the northeastern part of
      Ohio near Lake Erie.

      Zip code 25601 is in Logan County, West Virginia, which is in the southern part
      of West Virginia.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Northern Ohio locations like Willoughby are significantly further north than
      southern West Virginia locations. Ohio''s location near Lake Erie puts it much
      further north than the coal country region of southern West Virginia where Logan
      County is located.


      Based on this analysis, zip code 44094 in Ohio is definitely located north of
      zip code 25601 in West Virginia.

      44094, OH is a zip code in Ohio. Let me recall where this might be. Ohio is
      generally north of West Virginia. 44094 appears to be in northeastern Ohio,
      likely in the Cleveland area or nearby. Specifically, I believe 44094 is in
      Willoughby, Ohio, which is indeed in the northeastern part of the state near
      Lake Erie.


      25601, WV is a zip code in West Virginia. West Virginia is generally south of
      Ohio. 25601 would be somewhere in West Virginia, likely in the southern or central
      part of the state.


      Geographically, Ohio is north of West Virginia. The northernmost parts of Ohio
      (especially near Lake Erie) are significantly north of even the northernmost
      parts of West Virginia. Since 44094 is in northeastern Ohio near Lake Erie,
      and 25601 is in West Virginia, it''s highly likely that 44094, OH is north of
      25601, WV.

      - 44094 is in Willoughby, Ohio, which is located in the northeastern part of
      Ohio near Lake Erie.

      - 25601 is in West Virginia, which is a state that borders Ohio to the southeast.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Ohio and West Virginia.

      - Ohio is generally north of West Virginia.

      - Northeastern Ohio (where Willoughby is located) is particularly far north
      in the state.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Willoughby, OH (44094) is near Lake Erie at the northern edge of Ohio.

      - West Virginia zip codes in the 25601 range are in the central or southern
      parts of West Virginia.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these geographic positions.

      - Given that 44094 is in the northern part of Ohio near Lake Erie, and 25601
      is in West Virginia which is south of Ohio, the Ohio location must be north
      of the West Virginia location.

      determine if 44094, OH is located north of 25601, WV, I need to analyze the
      geographic locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 44094 is a zip code in Willoughby, Ohio, located in the northeastern part
      of Ohio near Lake Erie.

      - 25601 is a zip code in West Virginia, located in the southern part of that
      state.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Ohio and West Virginia.

      Ohio is generally positioned north of West Virginia. Specifically, northeastern
      Ohio (where 44094 is located) is significantly north of most of West Virginia.


      Step 3: Compare latitudes.

      - Ohio zip codes in the 44xxx range are in the northern part of Ohio, close
      to Lake Erie.

      - West Virginia zip codes in the 25xxx range are typically in the southern portions
      of West Virginia.


      Step 4: Conclusion based on geography.

      Northeastern Ohio is definitively north of southern West Virginia on a map of
      the United States.

      to:

      1. Identify the locations of zip codes 54180, WI and 60651, IL

      2. Determine their relative positions (which one is further north)


      Let me reason through this:


      54180 is a zip code in Wisconsin (WI)

      60651 is a zip code in Illinois (IL)


      Generally, Wisconsin is located north of Illinois in the United States. Wisconsin
      borders Illinois on its southern border, while Illinois borders Wisconsin on
      its northern border.


      Wisconsin zip codes typically start with 53 or 54, while Illinois zip codes
      often start with 60 or 61.


      Based on the general geography of the United States, a zip code in Wisconsin
      (54180) would be north of a zip code in Illinois (60651).


      So my conclusion would be that yes, 54180, WI is likely located north of 60651,
      IL.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 54180 is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - 60651 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      Wisconsin is located directly north of Illinois. The entire state of Wisconsin
      is north of Illinois.


      Step 3: Verify based on zip code patterns

      Wisconsin zip codes generally start with 53-54, while Illinois zip codes typically
      start with 60-62. The zip code patterns confirm these are in their respective
      states.


      Step 4: Determine relative position

      Since any location in Wisconsin is north of Illinois, and these zip codes are
      in their respective states, the Wisconsin zip code must be north of the Illinois
      zip code.

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative positions (north/south)


      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - 54180, WI: This is a zip code in Wisconsin (WI)

      - 60651, IL: This is a zip code in Illinois (IL)


      Now, I need to determine if the Wisconsin zip code is north of the Illinois
      zip code.


      Geographically speaking, Wisconsin is generally north of Illinois. Wisconsin
      borders Illinois on Illinois''s northern border. So in general, locations in
      Wisconsin tend to be north of locations in Illinois.


      However, I should be more precise since the question is about specific zip codes.
      The general geography of the US puts Wisconsin north of Illinois, so a zip code
      in Wisconsin (54180) should be north of a zip code in Illinois (60651).


      So the Wisconsin zip code (54180) is very likely north of the Illinois zip code
      (60651).</think>I need to determine if 54180, Wisconsin is north of 60651, Illinois.


      Step 1: Consider the geographical positions of Wisconsin and Illinois.

      Wisconsin is a state that borders Illinois to the north. The entire state of
      Wisconsin is situated north of Illinois.


      Step 2: Analyze the zip codes.

      Since 54180 is in Wisconsin (WI) and 60651 is in Illinois (IL), and Wisconsin
      is located entirely north of Illinois, any location in Wisconsin would be north
      of any location in Illinois.


      Step 3: Reach a conclusion based on state geography.

      Because the Wisconsin zip code must be in Wisconsin and the Illinois zip code
      must be in Illinois, the Wisconsin location must be north of the Illinois location.


      YES'

      to determine whether the zip code 54180 in Wisconsin is located north of the
      zip code 60651 in Illinois.


      First, let me identify where these zip codes are located:


      1. 54180, WI - This is a zip code in Wisconsin

      2. 60651, IL - This is a zip code in Illinois


      In general, locations in Wisconsin tend to be north of locations in Illinois,
      since Wisconsin is entirely north of Illinois. But I need to be precise about
      these specific zip codes.


      In the US zip code system, the first three digits generally indicate a geographical
      region. Zip codes starting with 54x are in northern/central Wisconsin, while
      zip codes starting with 60x are in the Chicago area of Illinois.


      Wisconsin zip codes typically range from 53xxx to 54xxx, with the northern parts
      of the state having zip codes starting with 54. Illinois zip codes typically
      range from 60xxx to 62xxx, with the northern part (Chicago area) having zip
      codes starting with 60.


      Given that 54180 is in Wisconsin and 60651 is in Illinois, and based on the
      general geographical arrangement of these states and their zip code patterns,
      it''s very likely that 54180, WI is indeed north of 60651, IL.</think>I need

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 54180 is in Wisconsin (WI)

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Wisconsin and Illinois.

      Wisconsin is located directly north of Illinois. The entire state of Wisconsin
      is positioned above Illinois on the map.


      Step 3: Analyze the specific zip codes.

      - Wisconsin zip codes typically range from 53xxx-54xxx, with higher numbers
      often (but not always) indicating more northern locations

      - Illinois zip codes generally start with 60xxx-62xxx, with 60xxx being in the
      Chicago area (northern Illinois)


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Even though 60651 is in northern Illinois (Chicago area), it''s still in Illinois,
      which is entirely south of Wisconsin where 54180 is located.

      3. Compare their north-south positions


      NH stands for New Hampshire, which is a state in the northeastern United States,
      specifically in the New England region.


      NJ stands for New Jersey, which is a state on the east coast of the United States,
      south of New York.


      Geographically, New Hampshire is north of New Jersey on a map of the United
      States. New Hampshire borders Canada to its north, Maine to its east, Massachusetts
      to its south, and Vermont to its west. New Jersey is further south, bordering
      New York to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, Delaware to the southwest,
      and Pennsylvania to the west.


      Given the geographic positions of these states, a zip code in New Hampshire
      (03303) would be north of a zip code in New Jersey (07640).


      To be extremely precise, I should confirm the specific locations of these zip

      - 03303, NH refers to a zip code in New Hampshire

      - 07640, NJ refers to a zip code in New Jersey


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - New Hampshire is located in New England in the northeastern United States

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast, south of New York

      - New Hampshire is entirely north of New Jersey on the map


      Step 3: Verify the specific zip codes.

      - Zip codes in New Hampshire begin with "03" which is assigned to the northern
      region

      - Zip codes in New Jersey begin with "07" which is assigned to the northern

      4. New Jersey is located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the eastern United States

      5. On a map of the United States, New Hampshire is positioned north of New Jersey

      To solve this problem, I need to determine the locations of these zip codes
      and compare their latitudes.


      First, let''s think about the general geography of the United States:

      - New Jersey (NJ) is a northeastern state

      - Virginia (VA) is a mid-Atlantic state located south of New Jersey


      In general, New Jersey is north of Virginia. The entire state of New Jersey
      is north of the entire state of Virginia.


      07852 is a zip code in New Jersey, and 22134 is a zip code in Virginia.


      Since New Jersey is entirely north of Virginia geographically, any location
      in New Jersey (including 07852) would be north of any location in Virginia (including
      22134).


      Therefore, 07852, NJ is located north of 22134, VA.</think># Is 07852, NJ located
      north of 22134, VA?


      I''ll solve this step by step by comparing the geographic locations of these
      zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 07852 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 22134 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - New Jersey is a northeastern state

      - Virginia is a mid-Atlantic state

      - On a map of the United States, New Jersey is entirely north of Virginia


      Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the specific zip codes.

      - Since New Jersey is geographically north of Virginia, any location in New
      Jersey (including zip code 07852) would be north of any location in Virginia
      (including zip code 22134)


      YES - 07852, NJ is located north of 22134, VA.'

      1. I need to determine if the zip code 07852 in New Jersey (NJ) is located north
      of zip code 22134 in Virginia (VA).


      2. To answer this, I need to know the geographical locations of these zip codes.


      In general:

      - New Jersey is a state in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia is a state in the southeastern United States


      Geographically, New Jersey is located north of Virginia on the map of the United
      States. The entire state of New Jersey is north of the entire state of Virginia.


      So without even knowing the specific locations of these zip codes within their
      states, I can say that any location in New Jersey (including zip code 07852)
      would be north of any location in Virginia (including zip code 22134).


      Therefore, 07852, NJ is located north of 22134, VA.</think>I need to determine
      if a zip code in New Jersey is north of a zip code in Virginia.


      Step 1: Identify the geographical relationship between the states.

      New Jersey (NJ) is a northeastern state, while Virginia (VA) is a mid-Atlantic
      state further south.


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions.

      Geographically, the entire state of New Jersey lies north of the entire state
      of Virginia on the U.S. map.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 07852 is in New Jersey and 22134 is in Virginia, the New Jersey zip code
      must be north of the Virginia zip code, regardless of their specific locations
      within their respective states.

      First, I need to figure out the general geographic position of these states.
      New Jersey is in the northeastern United States, while Virginia is in the mid-Atlantic
      region, south of New Jersey.


      Generally speaking, New Jersey is north of Virginia. However, I should verify
      this by checking the specific locations of these zip codes.


      07852 is a zip code in New Jersey. Without looking up the specific town, I know
      that all of New Jersey is north of all of Virginia geographically.


      22134 is a zip code in Virginia. Again, even without knowing the specific town,
      Virginia is entirely south of New Jersey.


      Given the geography of the eastern United States, any location in New Jersey
      would be north of any location in Virginia. This is because New Jersey is entirely
      north of Virginia, with several states (Maryland, Delaware, and potentially
      parts of Pennsylvania) between them.</think>To determine if 07852, NJ is located

      - 07852 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 22134 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      New Jersey is located in the northeastern United States, while Virginia is in
      the mid-Atlantic region. On a north-south axis, New Jersey lies entirely north
      of Virginia.


      Step 3: Verify for specific zip codes

      Even without knowing the exact towns these zip codes represent, the geographic
      reality is that any location in New Jersey will be north of any location in
      Virginia due to the relative positions of these states. There are no parts of
      Virginia that extend north of any part of New Jersey.


      YES, 07852, NJ is located north of 22134, VA.'

      - 07852 is a zip code in New Jersey

      - 22134 is a zip code in Virginia


      Since New Jersey is entirely north of Virginia on the US map, any location in
      New Jersey would be north of any location in Virginia. Therefore, 07852, NJ
      is located north of 22134, VA.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the states for each zip code.

      - 07852 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      New Jersey is located in the northeastern United States, while Virginia is in

      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Looking at a map of the United States, New Jersey is entirely north of Virginia.
      The southernmost point of New Jersey is still north of the northernmost point
      of Virginia.


      Step 4: Draw conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      Since any location in New Jersey must be north of any location in Virginia (based

      22134 in VA.

      Arkansas is located directly north of Louisiana. The entire state of Arkansas
      sits above Louisiana on the map.


      Step 3: Apply this knowledge to the zip codes.

      Since 72364 is in Arkansas, and 70711 is in Louisiana, and Arkansas is entirely

      (Arkansas) is north of 70711, LA (Louisiana).


      To answer this, I''ll need to:

      1. Understand the relative geographic positions of these states

      2. Verify the specific locations of these zip codes


      First, general geographic knowledge: Arkansas is a state that borders Louisiana
      to the north. So generally speaking, locations in Arkansas tend to be north
      of locations in Louisiana.


      Now, let''s look at the specific zip codes:

      - 72364, AR - This is in Arkansas

      - 70711, LA - This is in Louisiana


      Given that Arkansas is generally north of Louisiana, and these zip codes follow
      the standard pattern for their respective states (7xxxx), it''s very likely
      that 72364, AR is indeed north of 70711, LA.


      US zip codes aren''t perfectly aligned with latitude, but they do generally
      follow geographic patterns. The first three digits of a zip code (723 vs 707)
      indicate different postal zones, and in this case, they align with the general
      north-south arrangement of these states.</think>To determine if 72364, AR is
      located north of 70711, LA, I need to analyze these zip codes and their states''
      relative positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 72364 is in Arkansas (AR)

      - 70711 is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Arkansas is positioned directly north of Louisiana on the US map. Arkansas''s
      southern border connects with Louisiana''s northern border.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code patterns.

      US zip codes are somewhat organized geographically. The 723xx range in Arkansas
      is generally in the eastern/southeastern portion of the state, while the 707xx
      range in Louisiana is typically in the northern/central part of Louisiana.


      Step 4: Combine this information.

      Since Arkansas is entirely north of Louisiana, and these specific zip codes
      don''t represent any unusual geographic anomalies that would contradict this
      relationship, a location in Arkansas (72364) would be north of a location in
      Louisiana (70711).


      YES'

      1) I need to determine if zip code 72364 in Arkansas (AR) is located north of

      (LA) in the United States. Arkansas borders Louisiana on Louisiana''s northern
      side.


      3) The zip code 72364 is in Arkansas, and 70711 is in Louisiana.


      4) Since Arkansas is entirely north of Louisiana geographically, any location
      in Arkansas would be north of any location in Louisiana.


      5) Therefore, zip code 72364 in Arkansas must be located north of zip code 70711
      in Louisiana.</think>To determine if 72364, AR is located north of 70711, LA,

      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 72364 is in Arkansas (AR)

      - 70711 is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Arkansas is located directly north of Louisiana. The entire state of Arkansas
      is positioned above Louisiana on the map.


      Step 3: Compare the zip codes.

      Since 72364 is in Arkansas and 70711 is in Louisiana, and Arkansas is entirely
      north of Louisiana, it follows that any location in Arkansas (including zip
      code 72364) would be north of any location in Louisiana (including zip code
      70711).

      - 08022, NJ (New Jersey state)


      To determine if one location is north of another, I need to compare their latitudes.
      A higher latitude means further north.


      While I don''t have the exact latitude values for these specific zip codes in
      my knowledge, I can reason about this based on the general geographic relationship
      between New York and New Jersey, and the patterns in their zip codes.


      In the US zip code system:

      - New Jersey zip codes generally start with 07-08


      The zip code 12192 is in New York state, which is generally north of New Jersey.
      Furthermore, within the zip code system, higher first digits often (but not
      always) correspond to more northern locations on the East Coast.


      So 12192 (NY) would likely be north of 08022 (NJ) for two reasons:

      1. New York is generally north of New Jersey

      2. The higher first digit (12 vs 08) is consistent with the general north-south

      - New York state is generally located north of New Jersey state

      - Specifically, 12192 is in the eastern part of New York state

      - 08022 is in the southern portion of New Jersey


      ## Step 3: Examine zip code patterns

    dea3e44d-58a2-4fbb-a6bc-f824d0c2595f: '<think>This question asks if 12192, NY
      (New York) is located north of 08022, NJ (New Jersey).


      To determine this, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their latitudes (north-south position)


      For US zip codes:

      - Zip code 12192 is in New York state

      - Zip code 08022 is in New Jersey state


      In general, New York state is north of New Jersey state, but I need to be more
      precise since we''re dealing with specific zip codes. These states border each
      other, and parts of NY can be at similar latitudes to parts of NJ.


      Zip code 12192 appears to be in West Coxsackie, NY, which is in the eastern
      part of New York state, near the Hudson River.


      Zip code 08022 appears to be in Columbus, NJ, which is in the central-southern
      part of New Jersey.


      Given the general geography of the northeastern US, a location in eastern NY
      (especially along the Hudson) would typically be north of central-southern NJ.
      This is because NY extends north of NJ, and the southern parts of NY are still
      generally north of central NJ.


      So based on my knowledge of US geography, 12192 (West Coxsackie, NY) is very
      likely north of 08022 (Columbus, NJ).</think># Is 12192, NY located north of
      08022, NJ?


      I need to determine the geographic locations of these zip codes and compare
      their positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Zip code 12192 is in West Coxsackie, NY, located in eastern New York along
      the Hudson River

      - Zip code 08022 is in Columbus, NJ, located in central/southern New Jersey


      ## Step 2: Compare latitudes

      - New York state is generally north of New Jersey

      - West Coxsackie (12192) is in the eastern part of NY, roughly halfway up the
      state

      - Columbus (08022) is in the central-southern portion of New Jersey

      - Looking at their relative positions, West Coxsackie is significantly further
      north than Columbus


      ## Conclusion

      YES - 12192, NY (West Coxsackie) is located north of 08022, NJ (Columbus).'

      \ NJ)\n   - Zip codes starting with 1 cover New York and parts of Pennsylvania\n\
      \n3) New York state is generally north of New Jersey state\n\n4) Specifically\

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Virginia and North Carolina.

      Virginia is located north of North Carolina in the United States. The entire
      state of Virginia is north of North Carolina.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      While the specific locations within each state matter, the fact that one zip
      code is in Virginia and the other is in North Carolina gives us a strong indication.
      Virginia zip codes are generally north of North Carolina zip codes due to the
      states'' relative positions.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion.

      Since 24482 is in Virginia, and 27896 is in North Carolina, and Virginia is

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Virginia is located directly north of North Carolina. The entire state of Virginia

      Step 3: Analyze the zip codes.

      While specific zip codes within states can vary in their exact north/south positioning,
      in this case we''re comparing zip codes from two adjacent states where one is
      completely north of the other.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      Since 24482 is in Virginia, and Virginia is entirely north of North Carolina
      (where 27896 is located), this zip code must be north of the North Carolina
      zip code.

      Since these are US zip codes, I can use the fact that locations in the US that

      because zip codes are assigned in a somewhat complex pattern. The most reliable

      Virginia (VA) is a state that borders North Carolina (NC) to the north. So generally

      Let''s look at the specific zip codes:

      - 24482 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 27896 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Since Virginia is north of North Carolina, and these zip codes don''t seem to

      - 27896 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Virginia is located directly north of North Carolina along the eastern United
      States. The entire southern border of Virginia connects with the northern border
      of North Carolina.


      Step 3: Consider zip code patterns.

      While zip codes aren''t perfectly aligned with latitude, they generally follow
      geographic patterns. Lower zip codes in the eastern US tend to be more northern
      than higher zip codes.


      Step 4: Compare the specific zip codes.

      24482 (VA) has a lower number than 27896 (NC), which is consistent with the
      general north-south arrangement of these states.


      Given that Virginia is north of North Carolina, and the zip code numbering pattern

    ea33135f-f04c-4684-9a19-32f3411e5d56: '<think>Let me break this down step by step:


      1) I need to determine if zip code 24482 in Virginia is north of zip code 27896
      in North Carolina.


      2) To determine this, I need to know the geographical positions of these zip
      codes.


      3) Generally speaking, Virginia (VA) is north of North Carolina (NC) since VA
      borders NC on its northern edge. So as a general rule, locations in VA tend
      to be north of locations in NC.


      4) However, I should verify this with the specific zip codes in question, as
      state borders aren''t perfectly horizontal lines.


      5) Zip code 24482 appears to be in Virginia (VA).


      6) Zip code 27896 appears to be in North Carolina (NC).


      7) Since Virginia is north of North Carolina, and these zip codes are in their
      respective states, it''s most likely that 24482, VA is north of 27896, NC.


      8) This is especially true because zip codes in the eastern US generally follow
      a pattern where lower numbers are assigned to more northern areas. The fact
      that 24482 is a lower number than 27896 further supports that it''s likely to
      be further north.</think># Is 24482, VA located north of 27896, NC?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Let''s consider the states first. Virginia (VA) is located directly
      north of North Carolina (NC) on the US map.


      Step 2: Looking at the zip code patterns, lower zip code numbers in the eastern
      US generally correspond to more northern locations. The first digit "2" in both
      zip codes indicates they''re in the eastern region, but 24482 is a lower number
      than 27896.


      Step 3: More specifically, the second digit "4" in 24482 corresponds to areas
      in Virginia, while the second digit "7" in 27896 corresponds to areas in North
      Carolina. The US Postal Service assigned lower second digits to more northern
      states in this region.


      Therefore, zip code 24482 in Virginia is indeed located north of zip code 27896
      in North Carolina.

      Let me think about the geographic locations:

      - 05201 is a zip code in Vermont (VT)

      - 07092 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)


      The United States is generally organized such that states further north tend
      to have lower zip code first digits, with some exceptions. However, I shouldn''t
      rely solely on the zip code numbers to determine geographical positions. Let
      me focus on the states:


      Vermont (VT) is located in the northeastern United States, specifically in the
      New England region.

      New Jersey (NJ) is located on the eastern seaboard, south of New York.


      Looking at their relative positions, Vermont is definitely north of New Jersey.
      Vermont borders Canada to the north, while New Jersey is significantly further
      south.


      Therefore, regardless of the specific locations within these states represented
      by these zip codes, a location in Vermont would be north of a location in New
      Jersey.</think>I need to determine if the location with zip code 05201 in Vermont

      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 05201 is in Vermont (VT)

      - 07092 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic locations of these states.

      Vermont is located in the northeastern United States in the New England region,
      bordering Canada to the north.

      New Jersey is located on the mid-Atlantic coast, south of New York State.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Vermont is positioned significantly further north than New Jersey on a map of
      the United States. All locations in Vermont are north of all locations in New
      Jersey.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on state positions.

      Since any location in Vermont must be north of any location in New Jersey, zip
      code 05201 in VT must be north of zip code 07092 in NJ.

      First, let''s recall that the position on the north-south axis in North America
      corresponds to latitude, with higher latitude values being further north.


      To answer this, I need to determine the relative geographical positions of these
      two zip codes:


      1. 05201 is in Vermont (VT)

      2. 07092 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Vermont is a state in the northeastern United States, part of the New England
      region. New Jersey is a state on the East Coast of the United States.


      Geographically, I know that Vermont is located north of New Jersey. Vermont
      borders Canada to its north, New Hampshire to its east, Massachusetts to its
      south, and New York to its west. New Jersey is further south, bordering New
      York to the north and northeast, the Atlantic Ocean to the east and south, and
      Pennsylvania and Delaware to the west.


      Since Vermont as a state is entirely north of New Jersey as a state, any zip
      code in Vermont would be north of any zip code in New Jersey. Therefore, 05201,
      VT is north of 07092, NJ.</think>To determine if 05201, VT is located north

      - 05201 is in Vermont (VT)

      - 07092 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of these states

      Vermont is located in the northeastern United States (in New England), while
      New Jersey is located on the mid-Atlantic east coast.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions

      Vermont is positioned significantly north of New Jersey on a map of the United
      States. Vermont borders Canada to its north, while New Jersey is several states
      south of the Canadian border.


      Step 4: Consider specific zip codes

      Even the southernmost parts of Vermont lie north of the northernmost parts of
      New Jersey, so any Vermont zip code will be north of any New Jersey zip code.

      (Arkansas) is located north of 77360, TX (Texas).


      Let me think about the geographic layout of the United States:

      - Arkansas is generally located north of Texas in the United States.

      - However, I should check the specific zip codes to be certain.


      For zip codes:

      - 72601 is in Arkansas

      - 77360 is in Texas


      In the US zip code system:

      - First digit roughly indicates geographic region (lower numbers are generally
      in the northeast/east, higher numbers in the west)

      - 7xxxx zip codes cover several south-central states


      The fact that Arkansas has 72xxx and Texas has 77xxx is consistent with the
      general pattern that Arkansas is north of Texas, as zip codes within the same
      first-digit region often increase as you move south.


      Based on my knowledge of US geography, Arkansas (AR) is indeed located north
      of Texas (TX). So a zip code in Arkansas (72601) would be north of a zip code
      in Texas (77360).</think># Is 72601, AR located north of 77360, TX?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions
      of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 72601 is in Arkansas (AR)

      - 77360 is in Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      Arkansas is positioned directly north of Texas on the US map. Arkansas shares
      its southern border with Texas, with Arkansas being the more northern state
      of the two.


      ## Step 3: Check if there are any unusual geographic anomalies

      While some states have irregular borders that can create exceptions, the zip
      code 72601 (Harrison, AR) is located well within Arkansas, and 77360 (Oakhurst,
      TX) is firmly within Texas. There are no geographic anomalies that would change
      their north-south relationship.


      ## Conclusion

      YES, 72601, AR is located north of 77360, TX.'

      Let me recall what I know about these regions:

      - AR is Arkansas, a state north of Texas

      - TX is Texas

      - In general, zip codes in the northern US tend to have lower numbers than those
      in the southern US


      72601 is in Arkansas, which is generally north of Texas. Also, the lower zip
      code number (72xxx vs 77xxx) suggests it might be further north, though this
      isn''t always reliable.


      More specifically:

      - 72601 is the zip code for Harrison, Arkansas

      - 77360 would be a zip code in Texas


      Harrison, AR (72601) is in the northern part of Arkansas, quite close to the
      Missouri border.

      77360 appears to be in the eastern part of Texas.

      part of Arkansas.


      4) Zip code 77360 is located in Texas, in the eastern region of the state.


      5) Since Arkansas is north of Texas, and 72601 is in Arkansas while 77360 is
      in Texas, the Arkansas zip code must be north of the Texas zip code.


      YES, 72601, AR is located north of 77360, TX.'

      Let''s break this down:

      1. 72601 is in Arkansas (AR)

      2. 77360 is in Texas (TX)


      I need to determine whether 72601, AR is north of 77360, TX.


      In general, US zip codes are roughly organized geographically, with lower numbers
      in the northeast and higher numbers in the southwest and west. However, this
      is a very rough pattern and not reliable for precise location comparisons.


      Arkansas is generally north of Texas. The entire state of Arkansas is north
      of much of Texas. However, to be precise, I need to know the specific locations
      of these zip codes.


      Zip code 72601 is in Harrison, Arkansas, which is in the northern part of Arkansas.

      Zip code 77360 would be in eastern Texas.


      Given that Arkansas is north of Texas, and 72601 is in northern Arkansas, while

      always north of locations in North Carolina. This is because New York is entirely
      north of North Carolina on the map of the United States.


      So based on the general geographic knowledge, I can conclude that 14892, NY
      is located north of 27704, NC.</think>I need to determine if one zip code location
      is north of another by comparing their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 14892 is in New York (NY)

      - 27704 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      New York is located in the northeastern United States, while North Carolina
      is in the southeastern United States. On a map of the US, New York is positioned
      significantly north of North Carolina.


      Step 3: Compare relative positions

      Even without knowing the exact towns these zip codes represent, any location
      in New York state would be north of any location in North Carolina because the
      entire state of New York is north of the entire state of North Carolina.

      1. 14892, NY is a zip code in New York state.

      2. 27704, NC is a zip code in North Carolina.


      Generally speaking, New York is north of North Carolina in the United States.
      But let me be more precise and check these specific zip codes.


      14892 is a zip code in New York. I believe it''s in the southern tier of New
      York state, possibly in the Finger Lakes region.


      27704 is a zip code in North Carolina. I believe it''s in Durham, NC, which
      is in the central part of North Carolina.


      Since New York is north of North Carolina, and these zip codes don''t seem to
      be in unusual locations within their states that would change this relationship,
      I can confidently say that 14892, NY is located north of 27704, NC.</think>I''ll
      determine if 14892, NY is north of 27704, NC by comparing their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 14892 is a zip code in New York state, likely in the Finger Lakes or Southern
      Tier region.

      - 27704 is a zip code in Durham, North Carolina.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between New York and North Carolina.

      - New York state is positioned in the northeastern United States.

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States.

      - In terms of latitude, New York is significantly north of North Carolina.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations within their states.

      - Even the southernmost parts of New York state are generally north of the northernmost
      parts of North Carolina.

      - The difference in latitude between these states is substantial enough that
      any zip code in NY would be north of any zip code in NC.


      YES, 14892, NY is located north of 27704, NC.'

      The format is:

      - 14892, NY (New York)

      - 27704, NC (North Carolina)


      I need to figure out whether the location with zip code 14892 in New York is
      north of the location with zip code 27704 in North Carolina.


      Since I''m being asked about north/south positioning, I need to compare the
      latitudes of these locations. In general, New York state is north of North Carolina
      state, but I should verify with the specific zip codes.


      New York is a northern state in the US, while North Carolina is a southern state
      (though not the most southern). Geographically speaking, New York is definitely
      north of North Carolina.


      Given that 14892 is in New York and 27704 is in North Carolina, and considering

      York''s southern border is around 40-42 degrees North latitude, while North
      Carolina''s northern border is around 36 degrees North latitude.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 14892 is in NY and 27704 is in NC, and all of NY is north of all of NC,
      the location with zip code 14892 must be north of the location with zip code

      in North Carolina (27408) is located north of a zip code in Florida (32092).


      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1. The zip code 27408 is in North Carolina (NC)

      2. The zip code 32092 is in Florida (FL)

      3. North Carolina is a state that is located north of Florida on the US map

      4. Since 27408 is in North Carolina, and 32092 is in Florida, and North Carolina

      So the zip code 27408, NC is located north of 32092, FL.</think># Is 27408,
      NC located north of 32092, FL?


      To determine the answer, I need to analyze the geographical positions of these
      zip codes.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1. Zip code 27408 is located in North Carolina (NC)

      2. Zip code 32092 is located in Florida (FL)

      3. Geographically, North Carolina is a state that lies entirely north of Florida

      Step 3: Determine the relative positions of the specific zip codes.

      Since 84009 is in Utah, and 86326 is in Arizona, and Utah is entirely north

      think through this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 61104 is located in Rockford, Illinois (IL)

      - 37127 is located in the Nashville area, Tennessee (TN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Tennessee is in the Southeastern region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Illinois is positioned north of Tennessee on the US map

      - Specifically, Rockford is in northern Illinois, making it even further north
      compared to Nashville, which is in central Tennessee


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on latitude comparison.

      - Any location in Illinois would generally be north of locations in Tennessee

      - 61104 (Rockford, IL) is definitely north of 37127 (Nashville area, TN)

    2ab1f60f-a24a-448d-894e-3d6ea528b6dd: '<think>This question is asking me to compare
      the geographical locations of two zip codes:

      1. 61104 in Illinois (IL)

      2. 37127 in Tennessee (TN)


      Specifically, it''s asking if the Illinois zip code is north of the Tennessee
      zip code.


      Let me think about US geography:

      - Illinois (IL) is generally north of Tennessee (TN) in the United States

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region, while Tennessee is in the Southeast region

      - Looking at a mental map of the US, Illinois borders Wisconsin to the north
      and Kentucky to the south, while Tennessee is south of Kentucky


      Since Illinois is a state that''s entirely north of Tennessee, any location
      in Illinois would be north of any location in Tennessee. This is a geographical
      fact based on the positions of these states.


      Therefore, zip code 61104 in Illinois would be north of zip code 37127 in Tennessee.</think>To
      determine if 61104, IL is north of 37127, TN, I need to consider the geographical
      positions of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 61104 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 37127 is in Tennessee (TN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Tennessee
      is in the Southeast region. Looking at a map of the US, Illinois is positioned
      entirely north of Tennessee.


      Step 3: Since Illinois is completely north of Tennessee geographically, any
      location in Illinois (including zip code 61104) would be north of any location
      in Tennessee (including zip code 37127).


      YES'

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      Illinois is generally north of Tennessee. Illinois is in the Midwest region,
      while Tennessee is in the Southeast/South region of the United States.


      Step 3: Be more specific about these zip codes.

      61104 is likely in or near Rockford, Illinois, which is in the northern part
      of Illinois.

      37127 is likely in or near Nashville or another city in Tennessee.


      Step 4: Compare latitudes.

      Even the southernmost part of Illinois is generally north of Tennessee. So a
      zip code in Illinois (61104) would be north of a zip code in Tennessee (37127).

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      Illinois is positioned entirely north of Tennessee on the map of the United
      States.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      61104 is a zip code in Illinois, specifically in the Rockford area in the northern
      part of the state.

      37127 is a zip code in Tennessee, in the middle part of that state.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Illinois is entirely north of Tennessee geographically, any location in
      Illinois (including 61104) would be north of any location in Tennessee (including
      37127).

      First, I need to identify where these zip codes are located:

      - 13502 is in New York state

      - 07114 is in New Jersey state


      Generally speaking, New York is north of New Jersey, but I need to be more precise
      since we''re talking about specific zip codes, and parts of NY could be at the
      same latitude or even south of parts of NJ.


      13502 appears to be the zip code for Utica, NY, which is in central New York
      state.

      07114 appears to be a zip code in Newark, NJ, which is in northern New Jersey.


      Given their locations:

      - Utica, NY (13502) is significantly further north in New York state

      - Newark, NJ (07114) is in northern New Jersey, close to New York City


      Utica is definitely further north than Newark. Newark is near NYC in the southern

      north of 97227, OR, I need to:


      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their latitudes (north-south positions)


      First, let me think about the general pattern of US zip codes. In the US ZIP
      code system:

      - The first digit generally represents a broad geographical region, from 0 in
      the northeast to 9 in the west

      - ZIP codes starting with 9 are in the western US

      - ZIP codes in Washington (WA) generally start with 98 or 99

      - ZIP codes in Oregon (OR) generally start with 97


      Since 98229 is in Washington state and 97227 is in Oregon state, and Washington
      is directly north of Oregon on the US west coast, it''s very likely that 98229
      is north of 97227.


      To be more specific:

      - 98229 is likely in the western part of Washington

      - 97227 is likely in the western part of Oregon


      Given the geographical arrangement of these states, with Washington being entirely
      north of Oregon, a location in Washington (98229) would be north of a location
      in Oregon (97227).</think>To determine if 98229, WA is located north of 97227,
      OR, I need to analyze the geographical relationship between these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 98229 is in Washington (WA)

      - 97227 is in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Washington and Oregon.

      Washington state is positioned entirely north of Oregon state along the west
      coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code patterns.

      ZIP codes are generally assigned with some geographical logic. The higher first
      digits of Washington''s zip code (98xxx vs Oregon''s 97xxx) also align with
      the northward progression of the postal code system on the west coast.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on state boundaries.

      Since 98229 is in Washington and 97227 is in Oregon, and Washington is entirely
      north of Oregon, the Washington zip code must be north of the Oregon zip code.


      YES'
    3ed4d998-4ffe-435e-85df-96a9d3ae8d3f: '<think>To determine if 98229, WA is located
      north of 97227, OR, I need to:


      1. Understand the zip code system in the US

      2. Determine the geographic locations of these zip codes

      3. Compare their latitudes to see which one is farther north


      The US zip code system generally follows some geographic patterns. The first
      digit typically indicates a general region of the country, with lower numbers
      in the east/northeast and higher numbers in the west.


      98229 is in Washington state (WA)

      97227 is in Oregon state (OR)


      Washington state is directly north of Oregon on the west coast of the United
      States. In general, Washington zip codes start with 98 or 99, while Oregon zip
      codes start with 97.


      Since 98229 is in Washington and 97227 is in Oregon, and Washington is north
      of Oregon, it follows that 98229, WA is located north of 97227, OR.


      To be completely sure, I could check the specific locations of these zip codes,
      but the general state relationship gives us the answer: Washington is north
      of Oregon, so a Washington zip code will be north of an Oregon zip code.</think>I
      need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 98229 is in Washington (WA)

      - 97227 is in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between these states.

      Washington state is located directly north of Oregon state on the west coast
      of the United States.


      Step 3: Check if there are any unusual circumstances.

      While some zip codes near state borders could potentially create exceptions,
      these particular zip codes (98229 and 97227) don''t appear to be in such border
      regions. The 982xx series is well within Washington, and 972xx is well within
      Oregon.


      Step 4: Make the determination based on state positions.

      Since Washington is north of Oregon, and these zip codes are standard ones for
      their respective states, 98229 in WA must be north of 97227 in OR.


      YES'
    71f46561-65bd-43a5-967e-dca23700273c: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative positions of two zip codes:

      1. 98229, WA (Washington state)

      2. 97227, OR (Oregon state)


      First, I know that Washington state is located north of Oregon state in the
      United States, as Washington borders Canada to the north, and Oregon is directly
      south of Washington.


      The zip codes themselves can also give us some information. In the US postal
      system, zip codes are generally assigned with some geographical logic:

      - The first digit generally divides the country into regions (0 for Northeast,
      9 for West Coast, etc.)

      - The first three digits usually define a sectional center facility

      - The complete 5-digit code identifies a delivery area


      Both zip codes start with 9, which corresponds to the West Coast region, which
      is correct for WA and OR.


      Since both zip codes are in their respective states (98229 in Washington and
      97227 in Oregon), and Washington is north of Oregon, it''s very likely that
      98229, WA is north of 97227, OR.


      Additionally, the higher first three digits (982 vs 972) generally indicates
      a more northern location within the same region, which further supports this
      conclusion.</think># Is 98229, WA located north of 97227, OR?


      I''ll analyze this step by step:


      1) First, let''s identify the states: 98229 is in Washington (WA) and 97227
      is in Oregon (OR).


      2) Geographically, Washington state is positioned directly north of Oregon state
      in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.


      3) Looking at the zip code patterns, both begin with "9" which indicates the
      West Coast region, but Washington zip codes typically start with "98" or "99"
      while Oregon zip codes typically start with "97".


      4) Since 98229 is in Washington and 97227 is in Oregon, and Washington is north
      of Oregon, we can conclude that 98229, WA is indeed north of 97227, OR.

      1. 98229 is in Washington state (WA)

      2. 97227 is in Oregon state (OR)


      First, I know that Washington state is located north of Oregon state, as Washington
      is directly above Oregon on the west coast of the United States.


      The zip codes themselves also provide some information. Generally, zip codes
      are assigned somewhat geographically in the US, with lower numbers in the northeast
      and higher numbers as you move west and south. However, within neighboring states,
      we need to be more careful.


      The fact that the Washington zip code (98229) starts with 982xx while the Oregon
      zip code (97227) starts with 972xx suggests the Washington one is indeed further
      north, as zip codes within the Pacific Northwest region would tend to increase
      as you go north.


      Given that:

      1. Washington state is north of Oregon state

      2. The zip code numbering pattern supports this (higher numbers in WA than OR)


      I can conclude that 98229, WA is indeed north of 97227, OR.</think>I need to
      determine if the zip code 98229 in Washington is north of zip code 97227 in

      Step 1: First, I''ll consider the states. Washington (WA) is located directly
      north of Oregon (OR) on the west coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Since 98229 is in Washington and 97227 is in Oregon, and Washington
      is north of Oregon, we can conclude that the Washington zip code is north of
      the Oregon zip code.


      Step 3: As additional confirmation, the numbering system of US zip codes in
      the Pacific Northwest generally increases as you move northward, which is consistent
      with 98229 (WA) being north of 97227 (OR).


      YES, 98229, WA is located north of 97227, OR.'

      1. We have 97236, OR (Oregon) and 95425, CA (California)

      2. I need to determine if the Oregon zip code is north of the California zip
      code

      3. Oregon is a state that is located north of California on the US west coast

      4. Generally, zip codes in Oregon would be north of zip codes in California

      5. However, I should consider if there might be any exceptions depending on
      the specific locations


      In the US zip code system, the first digit generally indicates a geographical
      region, with lower numbers typically in the northeast and higher numbers toward
      the west.


      97236 is in Oregon, and starts with "97"

      95425 is in California, and starts with "95"


      Both are in the western US (as expected for OR and CA). The fact that the Oregon
      zip code starts with 97 while the California one starts with 95 doesn''t tell
      us much about their north-south positioning specifically.


      Since Oregon is directly north of California as states, and there are no unusual
      geographical quirks where parts of Oregon dip below parts of California (the
      border is relatively straight east-west), a zip code in Oregon would be north
      of a zip code in California.</think># Is 97236, OR located north of 95425, CA?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1. 97236 is a zip code in Oregon (OR)

      2. 95425 is a zip code in California (CA)

      3. Oregon is a state that borders California to the north

      4. The Oregon-California border runs east-west, with Oregon entirely north of
      California

      5. Therefore, any location in Oregon (including all Oregon zip codes) must be
      north of any location in California


      ## Conclusion:


      YES, 97236, OR is located north of 95425, CA.'

    0de2a935-6bc7-4d75-bbea-90a484daed38: '<think>To determine if 28602, NC is located
      north of 29404, SC, I need to consider the geographic locations of these zip
      codes.


      First, let me consider what these codes represent:

      - 28602 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 29404 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)


      Generally speaking, North Carolina is located north of South Carolina in the
      United States. That''s a starting point, but I should be more precise since
      zip codes near the border could break this pattern.


      Looking at the zip code patterns:

      - Zip codes in the US are generally assigned with lower numbers in the northeast
      and higher numbers as you go south and west

      - The first digit of both codes is 2, which places them in the eastern US

      - The second digit is 8 for the NC zip code and 9 for the SC zip code


      The fact that the NC zip code starts with 28xxx while the SC zip code starts
      with 29xxx actually suggests that the NC location might be north of the SC location,
      as zip codes generally increase as you go south in a region.


      So based on both the state locations (NC is north of SC) and the zip code numbering
      pattern (28xxx is typically north of 29xxx), I can conclude that 28602, NC is
      likely located north of 29404, SC.</think>I need to determine the relative positions
      of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 28602 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 29404 is in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between the states.

      North Carolina is generally located north of South Carolina on the map.


      Step 3: Examine the zip code patterns.

      U.S. zip codes are somewhat organized geographically. In the eastern U.S., the
      first three digits generally increase as you move south. Here we have:

      - North Carolina: 286xx

      - South Carolina: 294xx

      This pattern confirms the general north-south relationship.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Since North Carolina is north of South Carolina, and the zip code patterns support
      this geographic relationship, 28602, NC is indeed north of 29404, SC.


      YES'
    189e6f58-bd30-43e1-99e7-4bf00309bf62: '<think>Let me reason through this step
      by step:


      1) The question is asking about the relative geographical positions of two zip
      codes: 28602 in North Carolina (NC) and 29404 in South Carolina (SC).


      2) Specifically, I need to determine if 28602, NC is north of 29404, SC.


      3) In the US zip code system, the first three digits generally correspond to
      larger geographical regions. Lower numbers in the first three digits often (but
      not always) correspond to more northern locations within a region.


      4) However, it''s more reliable to consider the states themselves. North Carolina
      (NC) is geographically north of South Carolina (SC).


      5) Since 28602 is in North Carolina, and 29404 is in South Carolina, and North
      Carolina is north of South Carolina, it''s likely that 28602 is north of 29404.


      6) Additionally, the zip code numbers themselves provide a clue - zip codes
      beginning with 286xx are generally north of those beginning with 294xx in this
      region.</think># Is 28602, NC located north of 29404, SC?


      Let me analyze this step by step:


      1) First, I''ll identify the states: 28602 is in North Carolina (NC) and 29404
      is in South Carolina (SC).


      2) Geographically, North Carolina is positioned directly north of South Carolina.


      3) In the US postal system, while zip codes don''t perfectly align with latitude,
      they generally follow geographic patterns within regions.


      4) Since these zip codes are in adjacent states where one state is clearly north
      of the other, the location of 28602 in NC would be north of 29404 in SC.


      Therefore, YES, 28602, NC is located north of 29404, SC.'

      zip code 28602 in North Carolina is north of zip code 29404 in South Carolina.


      First, let''s think about how zip codes are organized in the US. While zip codes
      aren''t perfectly organized geographically, there are some general patterns.
      The first digit of a zip code divides the country into 10 large regions, with
      0 being in the Northeast and 9 being in the West. The first three digits typically
      identify a sectional center facility.


      In this case, both zip codes start with "2", which generally covers the mid-Atlantic
      and southeastern states.


      Looking more closely:

      - 28602 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 29404 is in South Carolina (SC)


      Geographically, North Carolina is located north of South Carolina. That''s a
      general geographic fact about these two states.


      Now, looking at the zip code numbers themselves:

      - 28xxx (North Carolina)

      - 29xxx (South Carolina)


      In the US postal system, lower zip code numbers in the same region generally
      (though not always) correspond to more northern locations. Since 28602 is a
      lower number than 29404, this reinforces the idea that 28602 is likely north
      of 29404.


      So based on both the state locations (NC is north of SC) and the zip code patterns,
      28602, NC is indeed north of 29404, SC.</think># Is 28602, NC located north
      of 29404, SC?


      Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the states: 28602 is in North Carolina (NC) and
      29404 is in South Carolina (SC).


      2) Geographically, North Carolina is located directly north of South Carolina
      on the US map.


      3) Looking at the zip code patterns: In the US postal system, the first digit
      "2" indicates these are both in the same general region (Mid-Atlantic/Southeast).


      4) The second digit helps narrow down location within that region. The "8" in
      28602 represents areas in North Carolina, while the "9" in 29404 represents
      areas in South Carolina.


      5) Since North Carolina (28xxx) is north of South Carolina (29xxx), zip code
      28602 is indeed north of zip code 29404.

      2. Compare their latitudes (a higher latitude is further north)


      First, let''s think about the general geographic relationship between Pennsylvania

      Step 1: Let me identify the approximate location of 18210, PA.

      Zip code 18210 is in Pennsylvania (PA). Pennsylvania is a state in the northeastern
      United States.


      Step 2: Let me identify the approximate location of 22406, VA.

      Zip code 22406 is in Virginia (VA). Virginia is a state in the southeastern
      United States, south of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is north of Virginia. The entirety of Pennsylvania

      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 18210 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 22406 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Pennsylvania and Virginia.

      Pennsylvania is located entirely north of Virginia in the United States. The
      southernmost point of Pennsylvania is still north of the northernmost point
      of Virginia.


      Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the zip codes.

      Since 18210 is in Pennsylvania and 22406 is in Virginia, and Pennsylvania is

      Let me think about the geographic layout:

      - Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia

      - Zip code 18210 in PA appears to be in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania

      - Zip code 22406 in VA appears to be in the northern part of Virginia


      Based on general knowledge of US geography, Pennsylvania is located north of
      Virginia on the US east coast. Even the southernmost parts of Pennsylvania would
      typically be north of most parts of Virginia.


      More specifically:

      - 18210 is in Carbon County, PA, which is in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania

      - 22406 is in Stafford County, VA, which is in the northern part of Virginia


      Given this information, it''s almost certain that 18210, PA is north of 22406,
      VA. Pennsylvania is entirely north of Virginia on the map, and these specific

      - 18210 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 22406 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Pennsylvania is located directly north of Virginia on the US east coast. The
      entire state of Pennsylvania is north of Virginia.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - 18210 is in Carbon County in northeastern Pennsylvania

      - 22406 is in Stafford County in northern Virginia


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      Even though 22406 is in northern Virginia, it is still south of the Pennsylvania
