      1. **22124, VA**: This zip code corresponds to an area in Virginia, specifically
      in the vicinity of Great Falls, Virginia, which is located in the northern part
      of the state.


      2. **29418, SC**: This zip code is associated with North Charleston, South Carolina,
      which is located in the southeastern part of the state.


      Next, we assess their relative latitudinal positions:

      - Virginia is generally located north of South Carolina. Specifically, Great
      Falls, VA (22124) is situated at a latitude that is significantly north of North
      Charleston, SC (29418).


      Based on this geographical relationship, we can conclude that 22124, VA is indeed
