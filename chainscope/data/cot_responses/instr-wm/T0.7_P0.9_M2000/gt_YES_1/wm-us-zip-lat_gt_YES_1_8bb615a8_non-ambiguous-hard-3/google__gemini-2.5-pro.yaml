      \nI'm currently focused on determining the location parameters. My initial step\
      \ is to identify the core question, which is to ascertain whether a specific\
      \ North Dakota zip code lies north of a Nebraska zip code. I'm now breaking\
      \ down this question to gather the necessary data. This includes determining\
      \ the location of zip code 58401, ND.\n\n\n**Analyzing Latitudinal Data**\n\n\
      My analysis of the question has yielded the locations of both zip codes. I determined\
      \ Jamestown, ND (58401) is located at approximately 46.9\xB0 N latitude and\
      \ Lincoln, NE (68506) is at approximately 40.8\xB0 N. With this data in hand,\
      \ I can confidently state that Jamestown, ND is indeed north of Lincoln, NE,\
      \ since 46.9\xB0 > 40.8\xB0.\n\n\n**Verifying Geographical Comparison**\n\n\
      The analysis confirms Jamestown, ND is north of Lincoln, NE. I considered this\
      \ by comparing latitudes and by consulting a US map, both confirming the geographical\
      \ relationship. My reasoning is sound, and the step-by-step process is ready\

      I''ve isolated the core question: comparing the geographical position of two
      US zip codes. Now, I''m breaking down the inputs, specifically extracting the
      zip codes themselves. Next, I need to find a reliable method for determining
      their relative north/south positions, maybe by calling an API.



      **Analyzing State Comparisons**


      I''ve moved beyond simply identifying the zip codes. My focus now is on how
      the states compare geographically. I am utilizing my general understanding of
      US geography to determine their relative positions. Comparing ND to NE seems
      straightforward, as ND is clearly north of NE. I am currently outlining the
      simplest reasoning path to confirm my conclusion, as well as the steps to take.



      **Mapping Zip Code Logic**


      I''m now thoroughly outlining the detailed, step-by-step method. First, I''ll
      specify each zip code''s city and state. Then, I''ll precisely compare their
      state-level geographical placements, based on my knowledge of the US map. Lastly,
      I''m confirming the conclusion by checking the latitudes, providing additional
      proof. The synthesis of all these steps leads to a definitive "YES" or "NO"
      response, as required.



      **Structuring the Final Answer**


      I''m putting together the final draft now. I''ll start by clearly identifying
      the locations and then present my state-level geographical comparison. The final
      answer, "YES," will be the conclusion after the detailed steps. I''m also keeping
      in mind that providing additional verification is crucial for supporting my
      final conclusion, by including latitude comparisons.

      Now, I''m ready to delve into the geographic aspect. I plan to use the zip code
      to locate the geographic coordinates and then determine relative positions.



      **Assessing Geographical Relationship**


      I''m now comparing locations for confirmation. I''ve pinpointed Troutville,
      VA for zip code 24179 and Columbia, SC for 29033. My next step involves confirming
      their relative positions geographically. It seems VA is north of SC, which already
      provides a strong indication. I''ll utilize coordinates to strengthen this claim,
      aiming for a definitive answer.



      **Determining Geographic Positions**


      I''m now expanding on the initial comparison of locations. After establishing
      Virginia is north of South Carolina, I questioned the universal applicability
      of this assertion. Upon consideration, I evaluated specific latitude boundaries
      of the states. I''ve concluded that the northernmost part of SC is still south
      of the southernmost part of VA, confirming that 24179 (Troutville, VA) is indeed
      north of 29033 (Columbia, SC).



      **Establishing Geographical Hierarchy**

      Carolina. After considering the potential edge case, I''ve confirmed that any
      point in Virginia is north of any point in South Carolina, definitively settling
      the question.

      I''m zeroing in on the user''s core need: determining the relative North-South
      positioning of two US zip codes. I''ll provide a direct YES or NO answer, but
      the key lies in clearly explaining my approach. I''m sketching out how to break
      down the problem.



      **Formulating the Approach**


      I''ve moved to structuring the plan. I''ll pinpoint the zip codes'' corresponding
      cities. Next, I''ll get the latitude and longitude. After, I''ll compare the
      latitudes to provide the answer and elaborate the reasoning. I''m currently
      working on a simulated search to execute the plan and test my strategy.



      **Refining the Execution**


      I''ve now executed the plan internally, finding the cities, their latitudes,
      and confirming the northern position. The crucial step is crafting the explanation,
      which I''ve started. I''m working through the step-by-step reasoning, structuring
      the findings and making the comparative conclusion. I''m focused on presenting
      the information concisely and accurately.



      **Optimizing the Explanation**


      I''ve shifted from coordinate comparisons to a simpler, more reliable method:
      leveraging the states'' known geographical relationship. Recognizing that Indiana
      lies north of Kentucky simplifies the explanation. I''m streamlining my presentation
      by citing the state locations. I''m refining the step-by-step process.



      **Finalizing the Response**


      I''ve finalized the complete answer using the state-level comparison. The text
      is drafted, clearly identifying the zip codes'' locations, and then using the
      Ohio River border to explain the North-South positioning. I''m now reviewing
      the final explanation, ensuring clarity and brevity before presenting the answer
      in its complete format, including the definitive YES.



      **Revising the Approach**


      I''ve entirely pivoted to utilizing state-level geographical knowledge. By focusing
      on the relative positions of Indiana and Kentucky, I can provide a clear and
      concise answer. My plan now relies solely on establishing the states'' positions
      and then drawing a straightforward conclusion. The response will be based entirely
      on the states, not coordinates.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we identify the city and state for each zip code.

      involves a direct comparison of their state locations, with a focus on their
      latitudinal relationship. I''m moving toward providing a definitive north/south
      answer.



      **Verifying Geographic Orientation**


      I''ve clarified the core question: assessing the north/south relationship of
      the zip codes. I''ve successfully associated 46565 with Rochester, IN, and 42141
      with Glasgow, KY. My focus now is on comparing these locations. A latitude-based
      comparison is in progress, along with a state-level assessment, to determine
      the definitive answer. I''m aiming for a concise and authoritative response.



      **Formulating the Definitive Answer**


      I''ve carefully considered the user''s question, breaking down the input and
      developing a structured solution. I''ve pinpointed the relevant cities and compared
      their locations at the state level. Now, I''m synthesizing the final answer,

      I''m currently focusing on the geographical question. I''ve identified the need
      to compare the relative north-south positions of two zip codes. Next, I plan
      to deconstruct the input to extract and understand the meaning of each zip code.



      **Mapping Coordinates to States**


      I''ve moved beyond state-level comparisons. Now, I''m looking up the specific
      cities associated with the zip codes. Oakton, VA, is located, and I''ve confirmed
      the city for 29418, SC. I''m also identifying the position of each city in their
      respective states.



      **Determining Geographical North**


      I''ve now gathered all the necessary components to derive a conclusive answer.
      My process involves identifying zip codes, states, and cities. I''ll compare
      state geographical positions, then cross-reference city placements within those
      states to determine the final answer. Essentially, I''m forming a precise, logical

      3.  Finally, we compare the geographic locations. The state of Virginia is located
      entirely north of the state of South Carolina. Therefore, any location in Virginia
      is north of any location in South Carolina.

      The process is now almost fully defined, which provides the step-by-step output,
      from identifying the locations to the final "YES/NO" answer. I''ve gone ahead
      to check for any edge cases. Refining the logic, I checked the northernmost
      and southernmost points of the states involved to confirm my geographic reasoning
      is correct.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to identify the city and state for each zip code.

      2.  The zip code 43950 is for Lisbon, Ohio.

      3.  The zip code 28216 is for Charlotte, North Carolina.

      4.  Next, we compare the geographical locations. The state of Ohio is located
      entirely north of the state of North Carolina. Therefore, any location in Ohio
      is north of any location in North Carolina.

      I''ve started by zeroing in on the user''s core question: determining the relative
      geographical position of two zip codes. The goal is a simple "YES" or "NO" response,
      indicating if 30566 is north of 32818. Right now, my focus is on establishing
      the necessary geographical reasoning.



      **Assessing Latitudinal Data**


      \n\n


      I''ve dug into the specifics of latitude now, confirming my initial assessment.
      I''ve found that Pendergrass, GA sits around 34.16 degrees latitude, while Orlando,
      FL is closer to 28.54 degrees. This numerical confirmation solidifies my conclusion:
      Pendergrass is indeed north of Orlando. I am nearly done with the reasoning.



      **Confirming Geographical Comparison**


      \n\n


      Now, I''m consolidating my approach. I am outlining the geographical steps,
      detailing the city and state for each zip code, and comparing their locations.
      After that, I am presenting the latitudes to give the user a very explicit comparison,
      confirming that Pendergrass is indeed north of Orlando, and explaining how I
      came to that determination. Finally, the answer itself.



      **Mapping Out the Response**

      I''ve broken down the entire process into actionable steps now. I''m refining
      my output to mirror my reasoning, showing the locations first, then the core
      logic. Next I''ll include the latitude comparison, and culminate with the required,
      concise answer. I am pleased with how the approach is unfolding.

      \ with the goal of retrieving the correct state for further analysis.\n\n\n\
      **Evaluating North/South Relationship**\n\nI've determined I need the latitude\

      I''m currently working to determine the exact geographical coordinates associated
      with each ZIP code. This involves retrieving the latitude and longitude for
      both 98229 and 97227. My next step involves comparing the latitudes to ascertain
      which location is positioned further north.



      **Confirming Northward Position**


      I''ve established that 98229 is in Bellingham, Washington, and 97227 is in Portland,
      Oregon. The key now is to firmly grasp their comparative latitudinal positions.
      Given Washington''s overall northern placement relative to Oregon, and Bellingham''s
      positioning near the Canadian border, I am confident that 98229 lies geographically
      north of 97227.



      **Formulating the Solution**


      I''ve broken down the problem by first identifying the cities associated with
      each ZIP code: Bellingham, WA, and Portland, OR. Next, I established that Washington
      lies north of Oregon. Now, my process involves outlining a step-by-step logic
      to confirm that Bellingham, WA, is indeed positioned further north, culminating
      in a concise final answer.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  The ZIP code 98229 is located in Bellingham, Washington.

      2.  The ZIP code 97227 is located in Portland, Oregon.

      3.  The state of Washington is geographically located entirely north of the
      state of Oregon.

      4.  Therefore, Bellingham, WA is north of Portland, OR.

      is north of 97227. Next, I must decompose the request to devise a plan to get
      to the answer.



      **Mapping ZIP Code Coordinates**


      I''ve started by translating the ZIP codes into their corresponding cities.
      98229 is Bellingham, WA, and 97227 is Portland, OR. My current focus involves
      placing these cities on a mental map to get closer to an answer about their
      relative geographic positions.



      **Deducing Relative Locations**


      I''ve drilled down into finding the cities associated with the ZIP codes and
      their states. Bellingham, WA, and Portland, OR, are the key locations to compare.
      My line of thought then focused on the geographic relationship between the states,
      identifying that Washington lies north of Oregon. Given this, I am ready to
      answer the core question.

      97227? It''s a simple yes or no. I''ll need to chart out the justification clearly,
      step-by-step.



      **Assessing ZIP Code Locations**


      Okay, I''ve pinpointed Bellingham, WA (98229), and Portland, OR (97227). Next,
      I plan to compare their general latitude, using a map as a visual aid. I''ll
      focus on which city resides further north.



      **Formulating Step-by-Step Reasoning**


      Now, I''m focused on structuring the response logically. The core is to break

      this. I must first extract and interpret the zip code data provided. I will
      ensure a clear "YES" or "NO" response.



      **Mapping the Approach**


      I''ve refined my initial reasoning. Now, I''m thinking I can simplify this further.
      The geographical order of the states suggests a simple "yes," but I need to
      confirm this rigorously. I am moving towards finding latitude and longitude
      data for each zip code to perform the comparison. I''ll need a reliable data
      source for this.



      **Verifying the Locations**


      I''m now zeroing in on the specific cities associated with each zip code. I''ve
      confirmed that 97236 is part of Portland, OR, and 95425 is in Cloverdale, CA.
      Based on the geographic locations of Oregon and California, my initial belief
      that the answer is "yes" is looking very strong. I''m now focusing on pinpointing
      their respective latitudes. Once I have those, I can definitively confirm the
      answer. I will then articulate my reasoning in a clear, easy-to-understand response.



      **Solidifying the Conclusion**


      I''ve now refined the analysis with a detailed plan, confirming the general
      location of the zip codes. I''ve broken the question down and executed each
      step. Through these steps, I''ve found that 97236 (Portland, OR) is north of
      95425 (Cloverdale, CA). I''ve run through the relevant reasoning, and the correct
      and final answer is "YES".

      03079 in New Hampshire is geographically north of the ZIP code 11561 in New
      York. Next, I''m deconstructing the ZIP codes to prepare for comparing their
      locations.



      **Mapping ZIP Code Locations**


      I''ve successfully located the cities associated with each ZIP code: Pelham,
      NH (03079), and Long Beach, NY (11561). My focus now is on analyzing the geographic
      relationship between these two locations. I''m planning to consider the relative
      positions of the states involved, as well as any specific city-level considerations,
      to formulate my answer.



      **Formulating a Solution**


      I''m now synthesizing my findings into a clear, logical argument. I''m structuring
      the reasoning step-by-step, ensuring each point logically supports the conclusion.
      I''ll start by identifying locations, then analyze their relative positions,
      and finally, I will arrive at a definitive "yes" or "no" answer. The framework
      is now complete and ready for a concise final formulation.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to identify the city and state for each zip code.

      2.  The zip code 03079 is for Pelham, New Hampshire.

      3.  The zip code 11561 is for Long Beach, New York.

      4.  Geographically, the state of New Hampshire is located entirely north of
      Long Island, New York, where Long Beach is situated.


      Therefore, 03079, NH is located north of 11561, NY.
