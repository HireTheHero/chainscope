      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 58401 is in North Dakota (ND)

      - 68506 is in Nebraska (NE)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - North Dakota is located along the northern border of the United States, bordering
      Canada.

      - Nebraska is located south of North Dakota, with South Dakota in between them.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Since North Dakota is north of Nebraska on the map of the United States, any
      location in North Dakota would be north of any location in Nebraska.

      - The specific zip codes don''t change this geographical relationship.


      Step 4: Confirm with the numerical pattern of zip codes.

      - Lower zip code numbers in the 5xxxx range are generally assigned to more northern
      states than higher numbers in the 6xxxx range in this region.

      - 58401 (5xxxx) vs 68506 (6xxxx) follows this pattern.


      Therefore, YES, 58401, ND is located north of 68506, NE.'

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 58401 is in North Dakota (ND)

      - 68506 is in Nebraska (NE)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical locations of these states.

      - North Dakota is located in the northern part of the United States, bordering
      Canada.

      - Nebraska is located south of North Dakota, with South Dakota in between them.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      - The first digit of a zip code generally follows a geographical pattern, with
      lower numbers in the northeast and higher numbers in the west.

      - However, the relevant factor here is the actual geographical location of these
      specific places.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since North Dakota is geographically north of Nebraska, and these zip codes
      represent locations within their respective states, the location represented
      by 58401 in North Dakota would be north of the location represented by 68506
      in Nebraska.

      - While zip codes aren''t perfectly aligned with latitude, the first digit generally
      follows a geographical pattern from east to west.

      - The second and third digits generally identify regions within states.

      - The lower first digit (5) for North Dakota versus (6) for Nebraska generally
      aligns with the geographical reality that North Dakota is north of Nebraska.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - North Dakota is definitely north of Nebraska on a map.

      - 40108 is a ZIP code in Kentucky (KY)

      - 35951 is a ZIP code in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Kentucky is a state that is entirely north of Alabama

      - All locations in Kentucky are north of most locations in Alabama


      Step 3: Look more specifically at these ZIP codes.

      - ZIP codes in the US generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to
      be in the northeastern US and higher numbers toward the west and south

      - The first digit "4" for Kentucky vs "3" for Alabama suggests the Kentucky

      North and South


      Step 3: Consider ZIP code patterns.

      - In the US ZIP code system, generally (though not perfectly), lower numbers
      tend to be in the eastern US and higher numbers in the western US

      - The first digit represents a broad geographic region, with 3 covering the
      Southeast and 4 covering parts of the South/Midwest

      - The fact that KY has a "4" prefix and AL has a "3" prefix is consistent with
      their relative positions


      Step 4: Make the determination based on state locations.

      - Since Kentucky is entirely north of Alabama, any location in Kentucky (including
      ZIP code 40108) must be north of any location in Alabama (including ZIP code
      35951)


      NO WAIT - I need to verify this more carefully. Let me check the specific locations:


      ZIP code 40108 is in Ekron, Kentucky, which is in the northern part of Kentucky.

      ZIP code 35951 is in Gaylesville, Alabama, which is in the northeastern part
      of Alabama.


      Since Kentucky''s southern border is entirely north of Alabama''s northern border,
      any point in Kentucky (including 40108) must be north of any point in Alabama
      (including 35951).


      YES, 40108, KY is located north of 35951, AL.'

      - 33187 is a zip code in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider what the zip code numbers tell us.

      In the US zip code system, the first three digits generally indicate geographic
      regions. Lower numbers tend to be in the northeastern parts of the country,
      with numbers increasing as you move south and west.


      Step 3: Compare the states geographically.

      Georgia is located directly north of Florida, as Florida borders Georgia''s
      southern border.


      Step 4: Compare the specific zip codes.

      - 31632 (in GA) has a lower first three digits (316) than 33187 (in FL) which
      has 331

      - Within the general zip code system, lower numbers in this region typically
      indicate more northern locations

      Step 1: Let me identify what these zip codes represent.

      - 31632, GA is a zip code in Georgia (GA).

      - 33187, FL is a zip code in Florida (FL).


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Georgia and Florida.

      - Georgia is located directly north of Florida in the United States.


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code numbers.

      - In the US postal system, zip codes generally follow patterns where lower numbers
      tend to be in the northeastern parts of the country, and numbers increase as
      you move south and west.

      - 31632 (Georgia) is a lower number than 33187 (Florida).

      - This aligns with the general geographic relationship between these states.


      Step 4: Confirm the specific locations.

      - 31632 is in southern Georgia.

      - 33187 is in southern Florida (Miami-Dade County area).

      - Even though 31632 is in southern Georgia, any location in Georgia would be

      - 33187 is a zip code in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Georgia and Florida.

      Georgia is located directly north of Florida in the United States.


      Step 3: Analyze the zip codes.

      In the US postal system, zip codes generally follow geographic patterns. Lower
      zip code numbers in the same region typically indicate more northern locations.


      Step 4: Compare the zip codes.

      31632 (GA) has a lower number than 33187 (FL). This supports the general pattern
      that the Georgia location is further north.


      Step 5: Combine the geographic knowledge with the zip code information.

      Since Georgia is north of Florida, and the zip code pattern also suggests a
      more northern location for 31632, we can conclude that 31632, GA is indeed north
      of 33187, FL.

      Georgia is located north of Florida, as Florida is the southernmost state in
      the continental US.


      Step 3: Look at the zip codes more specifically.

      US zip codes generally follow patterns where lower numbers are often in the

      - 31632 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)

      - 33187 is a zip code in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider what the zip codes tell us about location.

      In the US zip code system, generally lower numbers are in the eastern and northern
      parts of the country, with the first digit dividing the country into regions.


      Step 3: Compare the first digits.

      Both zip codes start with 3, which covers the southeastern United States.


      Step 4: Compare the second digits.

      31632 starts with 31, while 33187 starts with 33. Lower second digits typically
      indicate more northern locations within the same first-digit region.


      Step 5: Consider the states.

      Georgia is generally north of Florida, as Florida is the southernmost state
      in the continental US.


      Step 6: Make a conclusion based on both the state locations and zip code patterns.

      Since 31632 is in Georgia (which is north of Florida) and has a lower second

      - Kentucky is located south of Michigan, in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Michigan is generally north of Kentucky on a map

      - Any location in Michigan would be north of any location in Kentucky


      Step 4: Specifically for these zip codes, 49445 (Muskegon, MI) is in the western
      part of Michigan, while 42420 (Dixon, KY) is in western Kentucky. The north-south
      relationship remains the same.


      YES, 49445, MI is located north of 42420, KY.'

      - 15061 appears to be in western Pennsylvania, in the Aliquippa/Monaca area

      - 23832 appears to be in central Virginia, near Chesterfield/Richmond area


      Step 3: Consider the geographic relationship between Pennsylvania and Virginia.

      - Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia in the United States

      - Virginia borders Pennsylvania''s southern neighbor (Maryland)


      Step 4: Specifically compare these locations.

      - Western Pennsylvania (15061) is still north of central Virginia (23832)

      - Even the southernmost parts of PA are typically north of central VA locations


      Based on this geographic analysis, 15061, PA is indeed located north of 23832,
      VA.

      - 15061 is a ZIP code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 23832 is a ZIP code in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Pennsylvania is a state that borders Virginia to the north

      - Generally, Pennsylvania is north of Virginia


      Step 3: Verify the specific locations.

      - ZIP code 15061 appears to be in the western part of Pennsylvania (likely near
      the Pittsburgh area)

      - ZIP code 23832 appears to be in the central/southern part of Virginia


      Step 4: Consider latitude.

      - Since Pennsylvania is directly north of Virginia, and these ZIP codes are
      in their respective states, it''s highly likely that the Pennsylvania ZIP code
      has a higher latitude than the Virginia ZIP code.

      - 15061 is a ZIP code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 23832 is a ZIP code in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Pennsylvania is a state that borders Virginia to the north

      - Generally, states further north have lower ZIP code numbers in the eastern
      US


      Step 3: Look more specifically at these ZIP codes.

      - 15061 is in the 150xx range, which corresponds to western Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh
      area)

      - 23832 is in the 238xx range, which corresponds to central/southern Virginia
      (near Richmond)


      Step 4: Compare latitudes.

      - Western Pennsylvania (15061) is definitely north of central Virginia (23832)

      - The lower ZIP code number (15xxx vs 23xxx) in this eastern region also suggests
      the Pennsylvania location is further north


      NO


      Wait, I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me correct this:


      Pennsylvania is indeed north of Virginia, and ZIP code 15061 (in western PA)

      if 40422, KY is north of 31206, GA.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      - 40422 is a ZIP code in Kentucky (KY)

      - 31206 is a ZIP code in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Kentucky is a state that borders the northern part of Tennessee

      - Georgia is a state south of Tennessee

      - Therefore, Kentucky is generally north of Georgia


      Step 3: More specifically, looking at the ZIP codes:

      - ZIP codes in the US generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in
      the northeast and higher numbers are in the west and south

      - 40xxx ZIP codes are in Kentucky

      - 31xxx ZIP codes are in Georgia

      - The first digits (4 vs 3) suggest Kentucky is further north


      Step 4: The specific ZIP codes:

      - 40422 is in central Kentucky

      - 31206 is in central Georgia

      - Given the states'' relative positions, a ZIP code in central Kentucky would
      be north of a ZIP code in central Georgia


      Based on this reasoning, YES, 40422, KY is located north of 31206, GA.'

      Step 1: Let me think about the geographic relationship between Indiana and Kentucky.
      Indiana is generally located north of Kentucky, as Kentucky borders Indiana''s
      southern border.


      Step 2: Let''s look at the zip codes. Zip codes in the US generally follow a
      pattern where lower numbers tend to be in the eastern and northeastern parts

      Indiana is north of Kentucky geographically, and these zip codes appear to be
      standard codes for their respective states (not unusual outliers), the location
      associated with the Indiana zip code would be north of the location associated
      with the Kentucky zip code.

      first digits in the zip code often (but not always) correlate with more northern
      locations.

      - 46565 (starting with 4) is in Indiana

      - 42141 (also starting with 4) is in Kentucky


      Step 4: Make the determination based on state locations.

      - Since 46565 is in Indiana, and 42141 is in Kentucky, and Indiana is north
      of Kentucky, we can conclude that 46565, IN is indeed north of 42141, KY.


      YES, 46565, IN is located north of 42141, KY.'

      Step 1: Identify the states for the zip codes.

      - 46565 is in Indiana (IN)

      - 42141 is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Indiana and Kentucky.

      - Indiana is located directly north of Kentucky in the United States.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - 46565 is in northern Indiana (based on the zip code range for Indiana, where
      higher numbers in the 46xxx range tend to be in the northern part)

      - 42141 is in Kentucky


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Indiana is north of Kentucky, and 46565 is in Indiana while 42141 is
      in Kentucky, zip code 46565 must be north of zip code 42141.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of Indiana and Kentucky.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Kentucky is located south of Indiana

      - The entire state of Indiana is north of Kentucky


      Step 3: Since these zip codes are in their respective states:

      - 46565 (IN) must be in Indiana

      - 42141 (KY) must be in Kentucky


      Step 4: Make the conclusion based on the states'' relative positions.

      - Since Indiana is entirely north of Kentucky, any location in Indiana must
      be north of any location in Kentucky.

      - 26301 is a zip code in West Virginia (WV)

      - 27707 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - West Virginia is located north of North Carolina in the United States.

      - West Virginia borders Virginia to its south, while North Carolina is south
      of Virginia.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - The first digits of US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers

      south and west.

      - 30566 (GA) has a lower first digit (3) than 32818 (FL), which also starts
      with 3.

      - Looking at the second digit, 30566 has a "0" while 32818 has a "2".

      - Within the same first digit region, lower second digits typically indicate
      locations further north.


      Step 4: Conclude based on both state location and zip code patterns.

      - Georgia is north of Florida

      - 46013 is in Indiana (IN)

      - 40475 is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: I need to determine their relative positions on a north-south axis.


      Step 3: Generally speaking, Indiana is located north of Kentucky, as Kentucky
      borders Indiana''s southern boundary.


      Step 4: To be more specific about these particular zip codes:

      - 46013 is in Anderson, Indiana

      - 40475 is in Richmond, Kentucky


      Step 5: Indiana zip codes typically start with 46-47, while Kentucky zip codes
      typically start with 40-42. The higher first digits in Indiana''s zip codes
      reflect the general north-to-south organization of the US zip code system.


      Step 6: Anderson, Indiana (46013) is in the central part of Indiana, while Richmond,
      Kentucky (40475) is in the central-eastern part of Kentucky. Given the geographical
      arrangement of these states, Anderson, IN would be north of Richmond, KY.

      Arkansas is located directly north of Louisiana in the United States.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      In the US zip code system, codes generally increase from east to west, but the

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 24482 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 27896 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Virginia and North Carolina.

      Virginia is located directly north of North Carolina along the eastern United
      States.


      Step 3: Since zip codes generally follow geographic patterns, a zip code in
      Virginia (24482) would typically be north of a zip code in North Carolina (27896).


      Step 4: To be thorough, I should note that there could be exceptions near the
      border, but given standard zip code assignments, a Virginia zip code would be
      north of a North Carolina zip code.


      Based on this reasoning: YES, 24482, VA is located north of 27896, NC.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 24482 is a ZIP code in Virginia (VA)

      - 27896 is a ZIP code in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geography of Virginia and North Carolina.

      - Virginia is generally located north of North Carolina

      - The two states share a border, with Virginia being the northern neighbor


      Step 3: Consider the ZIP code patterns.

      - Lower ZIP codes in this region generally correspond to more northern locations

      - 24482 (in VA) has a lower number than 27896 (in NC)

      - This supports the general pattern of more northern locations having lower
      ZIP codes in this area


      Step 4: Combine the state-level and ZIP code information.

      - Virginia is north of North Carolina

      - The specific ZIP code 24482 in VA is likely to be north of 27896 in NC based
      on both state location and ZIP code numbering patterns

      - 27896 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      Virginia is located north of North Carolina along the eastern seaboard of the

      - The 244xx range is in Virginia

      - The 278xx range is in North Carolina


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Virginia is north of North Carolina, and the zip code 24482 is in Virginia

      - 27896 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Virginia and North
      Carolina.

      - Virginia is a state that borders North Carolina to the north

      - North Carolina is located south of Virginia


      Step 3: Based on the state locations alone, a zip code in Virginia would typically
      be north of a zip code in North Carolina, since Virginia is north of North Carolina.


      Step 4: While there could potentially be unusual border situations, the standard
      zip code numbering doesn''t contradict this geographic relationship. The lower
      zip code number (24482) being in the more northern state (VA) and the higher
      zip code (27896) being in the more southern state (NC) is consistent with the

      if 72601, AR is north of 77360, TX.


      Step 1: First, I need to understand the geographic relationship between Arkansas
      (AR) and Texas (TX). Generally, Arkansas is located to the northeast of Texas.


      Step 2: Let''s analyze the zip codes. In the US zip code system, the first digit
      generally indicates a geographic region, with lower numbers typically representing
      more northern regions.

      - 72601 starts with 7, indicating it''s in the south-central region

      - 77360 also starts with 7, but the second digit (7) is higher than the second
      digit of 72601 (2)


      Step 3: More specifically, zip codes beginning with 72 are in Arkansas, while
      those beginning with 77 are in Texas. Within the regional numbering system,
      lower numbers within the same first digit generally indicate more northern locations.


      Step 4: 72601 is in Harrison, Arkansas, which is in the northern part of Arkansas.

      77360 is in Oakhurst, Texas, which is in east Texas.


      Step 5: Geographically, northern Arkansas is indeed north of east Texas.


      Therefore, YES, 72601, AR is located north of 77360, TX.'

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Arkansas and Texas.

      - Arkansas is located directly north of Texas in the United States.


      Step 3: Examine the specific zip codes.

      - Zip codes in the US generally follow patterns where lower numbers are typically
      assigned to the northeastern parts of the country, with numbers increasing as
      you move south and west.

      - The 72xxx series is used in Arkansas

      - The 77xxx series is used in Texas


      Step 4: Compare the specific zip codes.

      - 72601 is in northern Arkansas (Harrison area)

      - 77360 is in eastern Texas


      Step 5: Make the determination based on relative positions.

      - Since Arkansas is north of Texas, and these zip codes follow the standard
      pattern for their respective states, 72601 in AR would be north of 77360 in
      TX.

      First, I need to identify the locations:

      - 27408 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 32092 is a zip code in Florida (FL)


      To determine if one location is north of another, I need to compare their geographical
      positions.


      Step 1: Consider the states.

      North Carolina is located north of Florida in the United States. North Carolina
      borders South Carolina to its south, and South Carolina borders Georgia, which
      borders Florida. So generally, any location in North Carolina would be north
      of any location in Florida.


      Step 2: Verify with zip code geography.

      Zip codes in the US generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to be
      in the northeast and higher numbers toward the southwest. The first digits of
      these zip codes (2 for NC and 3 for FL) confirm the north-to-south arrangement.


      Step 3: Specifically for these zip codes:

      - 27408 is in Greensboro, NC

      - 32092 is in St. Augustine, FL

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 27408 is a zip code in Greensboro, North Carolina (NC)

      - 32092 is a zip code in St. Augustine, Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of North Carolina and Florida.

      - North Carolina is a state located in the southeastern United States

      - Florida is also in the southeastern US, but positioned south of North Carolina

      - Generally, North Carolina lies north of Florida on a map

      - Greensboro, NC (27408) is located in central North Carolina

      - St. Augustine, FL (32092) is in northeastern Florida

      - Even the northernmost parts of Florida are still south of central North Carolina


      Since North Carolina is north of Florida, and these particular zip codes follow

      - Florida is the southernmost state on the East Coast, while North Carolina
      is several states north of Florida.


      Step 3: Look at the zip code numbers themselves.

      - US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to be in
      the northeastern US and higher numbers tend to be in the southern and western
      US.

      - However, within different states, this pattern doesn''t necessarily hold for

      if 61104, IL is north of 37127, TN.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 61104 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 37127 is in Tennessee (TN)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Illinois is a northern state, located in the Midwest region

      - Tennessee is a southern state, located in the Southeast region


      Step 3: More specifically, Illinois is entirely north of Tennessee on a map
      of the United States. The southernmost point of Illinois is still north of the
      northernmost point of Tennessee.


      Step 4: Since 61104 is in Illinois and 37127 is in Tennessee, and Illinois is
      geographically north of Tennessee, it follows that 61104, IL must be north of
      37127, TN.

      First, I need to identify the locations of these zip codes:

      - 61104 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 37127 is in Tennessee (TN)


      To determine which is further north, I need to compare their geographical positions:


      1. Illinois is generally located north of Tennessee in the United States. Illinois
      borders Wisconsin to the north and extends down to Kentucky, while Tennessee
      is further south, bordering Kentucky.


      2. More specifically, zip code 61104 is in Rockford, Illinois, which is in the
      northern part of Illinois.


      3. Zip code 37127 is in the Nashville area of Tennessee, which is in the central
      part of Tennessee.


      4. Given the general north-south arrangement of these states, and the specific
      locations within those states, 61104 (Rockford, IL) is definitely north of 37127
      (Nashville area, TN).


      Therefore, YES, 61104, IL is located north of 37127, TN.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 98229 is a zip code in Washington state (WA)

      - 97227 is a zip code in Oregon state (OR)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Washington and Oregon.

      - Washington state is located directly north of Oregon state on the west coast
      of the United States.


      Step 3: Look at the zip code patterns.

      - US zip codes generally follow patterns where higher numbers in the first three
      digits often (but not always) indicate more northern locations.

      - 982xx (Washington) is higher than 972xx (Oregon), which is consistent with
      Washington being north of Oregon.


      Step 4: Confirm the specific locations.

      - 98229 is in Bellingham, Washington, in the northwestern part of the state

      - 97227 is in Portland, Oregon, in the northern part of that state


      Since any location in Washington state would be north of Portland, Oregon (as

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Washington and Oregon.

      Washington state is located directly north of Oregon on the west coast of the
      United States.


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      In the US postal system, zip codes generally follow geographic patterns. Within
      a region, higher numbers typically indicate more northern locations.

      - 98229 (WA) starts with 982xx

      - 97227 (OR) starts with 972xx

      The Washington zip code has a higher first three digits (982 > 972), which is
      consistent with its more northern location.


      Step 4: Confirm the specific locations.

      98229 is in the Bellingham area of Washington, which is in the northern part
      of the state.

      97227 is in the Portland area of Oregon, which is in the northern part of Oregon.

      - 97227 is a zip code in Oregon state (OR)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Washington and Oregon.

      - Washington state is located directly north of Oregon state on the west coast
      of the United States.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      - In the US postal system, zip codes generally increase from east to west and
      from south to north.

      - The first digit represents a national area (9 for western states)

      - The first three digits typically represent a sectional center facility


      Step 4: Compare the zip codes.

      - 98229 (WA) starts with 982, which is a higher number than 972 in 97227 (OR)

      - This higher number is consistent with the northward progression of zip codes


      Step 5: Verify the specific locations.

      - 98229 is in Bellingham, WA, which is in the northern part of Washington

      - 97227 is in Portland, OR, which is in the northern part of Oregon

      - Oregon is located north of California on the West Coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Consider ZIP code numbering patterns.

      - While ZIP codes generally follow patterns (lower numbers in the east, higher
      numbers in the west), the first digit is most important for regional assignment.

      - ZIP codes beginning with 9 cover the West Coast states.

      - Within the West Coast region, Oregon ZIP codes typically begin with 97, while
      Northern California ZIP codes often begin with 95 or 96.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since 97236 is in Oregon, and Oregon is north of California where 95425 is
      located, the answer is YES.


      NO WAIT - I should verify this more carefully. ZIP codes don''t perfectly align
      with latitude. Let me check more specifically:

      - 97236 is in the Portland area of Oregon

      - 95425 is in Cloverdale, California, in the northern part of the state


      Portland, Oregon is definitely north of Cloverdale, California.


      YES, 97236, OR is located north of 95425, CA.'

      north of 11561, NY. Let me think step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 03079 is a zip code in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 11561 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Determine the specific locations.

      - 03079 appears to be Salem, New Hampshire

      - 11561 appears to be Long Beach, New York (on Long Island)


      Step 3: Consider the general geography of the northeastern United States.

      - New Hampshire is a New England state located north of New York state

      - Long Beach, NY is on Long Island, in the southern part of New York state


      Step 4: Compare their relative positions.

      - Salem, NH is in southern New Hampshire, but even southern NH is generally
      north of Long Island, NY

      is located north of 22406, VA (Virginia).


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 18210 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA).

      - 22406 is a zip code in Virginia (VA).


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Pennsylvania is a state that borders Virginia to the north.

      - Generally, locations in Pennsylvania are north of locations in Virginia.


      Step 3: Look at the zip code patterns.

      - US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the northeast
      and higher numbers are in the southwest.

      - 18xxx zip codes are typically in northeastern Pennsylvania.

      - 22xxx zip codes are typically in northern Virginia.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Pennsylvania is north of Virginia, and the zip code patterns confirm
      this general north-south relationship, zip code 18210 in PA would be north of
      zip code 22406 in VA.


      YES, 18210, PA is located north of 22406, VA.'
