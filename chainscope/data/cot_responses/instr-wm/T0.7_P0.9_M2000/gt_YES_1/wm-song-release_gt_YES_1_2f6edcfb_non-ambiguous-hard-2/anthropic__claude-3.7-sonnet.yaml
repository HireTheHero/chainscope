      Step 1: Let me check Pink Floyd''s "Round and Around."

      Actually, Pink Floyd doesn''t have a song called "Round and Around." They have
      songs like "Us and Them," "Comfortably Numb," etc., but not "Round and Around."
      This might be a confusion with another artist.

      Divinyls did release a song called "Science Fiction" on their 1982 album "Desperate."

      I cannot make a valid comparison of release dates.


      However, if we''re referring to a different Pink Floyd song or if "Round and

      Step 1: Let me identify Pink Floyd''s "Round and Around."

      There''s actually some confusion here, as Pink Floyd doesn''t have a well-known
      song called "Round and Around." They have a song called "Around and Around"
      from the 1969 album "Ummagumma." If this is the song in question, it would be
      from 1969.

      Divinyls released "Science Fiction" as a single in 1985, and it also appeared
      on their album "What a Life!" released the same year.

      If we''re referring to Pink Floyd''s "Around and Around" from 1969, and Divinyls''s
      "Science Fiction" from 1985, then Pink Floyd''s song was released earlier (1969

      Pink Floyd doesn''t actually have a song titled "Round and Around." They have

      but no song specifically called "Round and Around."

      Divinyls released "Science Fiction" on their album "Desperate" in 1983.

      Step 2: Identify when Cassidy''s "Hotel" was released.

      There appears to be some ambiguity here, as there isn''t a widely known song

      song titled "Hotel." There''s also the song "Hotel California" by the Eagles,

      Step 2: Identify when "Hotel" by Cassidy was released.

      This is more challenging as there are multiple artists named Cassidy. The most
      notable song titled "Hotel" by an artist named Cassidy would be by rapper Cassidy,

      I need to determine which Cassidy this refers to. There''s David Cassidy who
      had hits in the 1970s, and there''s Cassidy Pope, a more recent artist. However,
      I don''t have specific information about a song called "Hotel" by an artist
      named Cassidy in my knowledge base.


      Step 3: Since I don''t have definitive information about "Hotel" by Cassidy,
      I cannot make a reliable comparison between the release dates.


      Without complete information about both songs'' release dates, I cannot provide
      a definitive YES or NO answer to whether Jason Aldean''s "Girl Like You" was
      released later than Cassidy''s "Hotel."'

      Jason Aldean''s "Girl Like You" and Cassidy''s "Hotel" to compare them.


      Step 1: Identify when Jason Aldean''s "Girl Like You" was released.

      Jason Aldean''s "Girl Like You" was released in 2018 as the fourth single from
      his album "Rearview Town."


      Step 2: Identify when Cassidy''s "Hotel" was released.

      I need to determine which Cassidy this refers to. The most likely reference
      is to David Cassidy, who had a song called "Hotel" on his 1976 album "Getting
      It in the Street."


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      Jason Aldean''s "Girl Like You" (2018) was released much later than David Cassidy''s
      "Hotel" (1976).


      YES, Jason Aldean''s "Girl Like You" was released later than Cassidy''s "Hotel."'

      two songs: "Girl Like You" by Jason Aldean and "Hotel" by Cassidy.


      Step 1: Identify when "Girl Like You" by Jason Aldean was released.

      "Girl Like You" was released by Jason Aldean in 2018 as the third single from
      his album "Rearview Town."


      Step 2: Identify when "Hotel" by Cassidy was released.

      This is more challenging as there isn''t a widely known song called "Hotel"
      by an artist named Cassidy. The most similar reference might be to "Hotel" by
      Cassidy Boensch, but this isn''t a well-documented release. Alternatively, there
      could be confusion with Cassidy''s other songs or with David Cassidy''s works,
      but none prominently titled "Hotel."


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      Since I cannot definitively establish the existence or release date of "Hotel"
      by Cassidy, I cannot make a valid comparison.


      NO


      I cannot confirm that Jason Aldean''s "Girl Like You" was released later than
      Cassidy''s "Hotel" because I cannot verify the existence or release date of
      the latter song.'

      "Girl Like You" was released in 2018 as a single from Jason Aldean''s album
      "Rearview Town."


      Step 2: Identify when "Hotel" by Cassidy was released.

      This is more challenging because there are multiple artists named Cassidy. The
      most notable song called "Hotel" by an artist named Cassidy would be by rapper
      Cassidy, which was released in 2004 as part of his album "Split Personality."

      Jason Aldean''s "Girl Like You" (2018) was released after Cassidy''s "Hotel"

      featured on Rita Ora''s song "Girls" (with Bebe Rexha and Cardi B) in 2018.
      However, I don''t believe Charli XCX has a solo song simply called "Girls."


      Step 2: Let me identify "Elastic Heart" by Diplo.

      "Elastic Heart" is primarily known as a song by Sia (featuring The Weeknd and
      Diplo) released in 2013. Diplo was a producer on this track, but it''s not typically
      credited as "Diplo''s Elastic Heart" - it''s Sia''s song.

      3) If we''re referring to Sia''s "Elastic Heart" (which Diplo was involved with),
      it was released in 2013 as part of "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" soundtrack,
