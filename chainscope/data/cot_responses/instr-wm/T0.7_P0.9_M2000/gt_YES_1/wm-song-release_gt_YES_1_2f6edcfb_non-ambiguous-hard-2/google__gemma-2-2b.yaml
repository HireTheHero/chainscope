      The 1980s were a decade filled with incredible music, and two of the most popular
      songs of the decade are "Uptown Anthem" by Naughty by Nature and "We''ll Bring
      the House Down" by Slade.


      **Step 2:**

      The release dates of these two songs are as follows:


      - "Uptown Anthem" was released in 1990.

      - "We''ll Bring the House Down" was released in 1983.

      The 12-Bar Original was released in 1964, while Seconds was released in 1980.


      **Step 2:**


      Therefore, 12-Bar Original was released before Seconds.


      **Step 3:**


      Since we know that Uptown Anthem was released in 2000, it follows that 12-Bar
      Original was released earlier than Uptown Anthem.


      **Step 4:**


      Therefore, the correct answer is YES.
