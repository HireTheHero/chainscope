      3. Compare the two dates to see which came later.


      **Step 1: Charli XCX''s "Girls"**

      There is some potential confusion here, as "Girls" is a song title used by multiple
      artists. However, Charli XCX did release a song called "Girls Night Out" in
      2018, but she does not have a widely known song titled simply "Girls." There
      is a song called "Girls" by Rita Ora featuring Charli XCX, Cardi B, and Bebe
      Rexha, which was released on May 11, 2018.


      So, if the question refers to Charli XCX''s involvement in the song "Girls"
      (Rita Ora ft. Charli XCX, Cardi B, and Bebe Rexha), then the release date is
      May 11, 2018.


      **Step 2: Diplo''s "Elastic Heart"**

      "Elastic Heart" is a song originally released as part of the soundtrack for
      "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire." It was released in 2013 by Sia featuring
      The Weeknd and Diplo.


      So Diplo contributed to "Elastic Heart," which was released in 2013.


      **Step 3: Compare the dates**

      - "Elastic Heart" (Diplo): 2013

      - "Girls" (with Charli XCX): 2018


      Therefore, "Girls" was released later than "Elastic Heart."
