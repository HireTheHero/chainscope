      1. First, let''s find the release date of Billie Piper''s "Walk of Life":

      - Billie Piper was primarily a pop singer in the late 1990s

      - Her music career was most active around 1998-2000

      - "Walk of Life" was released in 1998


      2. Now, let''s find the release date of Gwen Stefani''s "What U Workin'' With?":

      - This song is from Gwen Stefani''s solo career

      - It was released on her album "The Sweet Escape" in 2006


      3. Comparing the release dates:

      - Billie Piper''s song: 1998

      - Gwen Stefani''s song: 2006


      4. Is Gwen Stefani''s song later than Billie Piper''s?

      - 2006 is later than 1998

      - So yes, Gwen Stefani''s song was released later
