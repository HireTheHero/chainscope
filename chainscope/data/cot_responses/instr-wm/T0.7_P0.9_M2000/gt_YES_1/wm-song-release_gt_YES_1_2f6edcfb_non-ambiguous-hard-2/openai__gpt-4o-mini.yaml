      the release dates of both songs:


      1. **Marilyn Manson''s "Lunchbox":** This song was released in 1990.

      2. **The Cure''s "Never Enough":** This song was released in 1990 as well, but
      specifically on the album "Mixed Up," which came out in 1990.


      Now, we compare the two dates:


      - Both songs were released in the same year (1990).

      - Since they were released in the same year, we need to check if one was released
      later in that year than the other. However, "Never Enough" is often noted to
      have been released later in the year compared to "Lunchbox."


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question "Was Marilyn Manson''s Lunchbox
      released later than The Cure''s Never Enough?" is:


      NO.'
