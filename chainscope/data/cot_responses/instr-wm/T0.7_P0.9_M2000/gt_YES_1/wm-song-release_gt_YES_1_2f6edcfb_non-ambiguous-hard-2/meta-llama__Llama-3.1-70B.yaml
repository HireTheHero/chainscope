      Now, we can compare the release dates:


      - "The Ones You Love" by Rick Astley was released in 1993.

      - "In High Places" by Mike Oldfield was released in 1987.


      Since 1993 is later than 1987, we can conclude that "The Ones You Love" by Rick
      Astley was released later than "In High Places" by Mike Oldfield.

      Travis Scott''s "The Plan" is a song from the soundtrack of the movie "Tenet"
      directed by Christopher Nolan. It was released on August 21, 2020.


      Ghetts''s "Pow 2011" is a remix of the song "Pow (Forward)" by Lethal Bizzle.
