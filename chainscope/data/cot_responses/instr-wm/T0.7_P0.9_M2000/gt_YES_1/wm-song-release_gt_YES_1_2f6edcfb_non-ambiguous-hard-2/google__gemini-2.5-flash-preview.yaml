      \ by Missy Higgins doesn't immediately bring up a clear hit. It's possible the\
      \ song title is slightly different, or it's an old or unreleased track. Let's\
      \ search for Missy Higgins's *popular* songs and their release dates to see\
      \ if \"Peachy\" is among them, or if there's a similar title. Searching for\
      \ Missy Higgins's discography or popular songs doesn't show a widely known song\
      \ titled \"Peachy\". It's possible this is a less well-known track, a B-side,\

      \ was released in November 2004 (specifically November 8, 2004, in Australia).\
      \ Even if it wasn't a single, its release is tied to the album's release date.\n\

      Step 4: Based on the comparison, determine if "A-Yo" was released later than
      "Bitch Please II".


      Step 1: Method Man & Redman''s "A-Yo" was released in 2001 on their album *Blackout!
      2*. (Correction: "A-Yo" is on *Blackout!*, released in 1999. "Blackout! 2" was
      released in 2009 and has a different tracklist). The single "A-Yo" featuring
      Busta Rhymes was released in 2001.


      Step 2: Xzibit''s "Bitch Please II" was released in 2000 on Eminem''s album
      *The Marshall Mathers LP*.


      Step 3: Comparing the release dates, "A-Yo" (single release 2001) was released
      after "Bitch Please II" (album release 2000). Even considering the album *Blackout!*
      (1999) containing "A-Yo", the single release date is more relevant for a song
      release comparison. However, the question asks about the song itself. "Bitch
      Please II" appeared on an album released in 2000. "A-Yo" appeared on an album
      released in 1999, but the single release was later. Let''s focus on the album
      release dates as that''s when the songs were first made widely available. "A-Yo"
      is on *Blackout!* (1999). "Bitch Please II" is on *The Marshall Mathers LP*
      (2000).


      Step 4: "A-Yo" (released on *Blackout!* in 1999) was released before "Bitch
      Please II" (released on *The Marshall Mathers LP* in 2000).

      \ 18, 1995**.\n\n6.  **Determine the order:** 1995 is earlier than 2003. Therefore,\
      \ Selena's \"Captive Heart\" was released *before* Lonestar's \"Not a Day Goes\
      \ By\".\n\n7.  **Evaluate against the question:** The question asks if Lonestar's\
      \ \"Not a Day Goes By\" was released *later* than Selena's \"Captive Heart\"\
      . Since 2003 is later than 1995, the answer is yes.\n\n8.  **Formulate the final\
      \ answer:** Based on the comparison, the Lonestar song was released later. The\
      \ answer is YES.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n*   Lonestar \"Not a Day Goes\
      \ By\" release: 2003\n*   Selena \"Captive Heart\" release: 1995\n*   Is 2003\
      \ later than 1995? Yes.\n*   Therefore, Lonestar's song was released later.\n\
      \n**Constraint Checklist & Confidence Score:**\n1. Question has clear YES/NO\
      \ answer: Yes.\n2. Requires few steps of reasoning: Yes (find two dates, compare\
      \ them).\n3. Think step by step first: Yes.\n4. Give YES/NO answer *only* after\
      \ reasoning: Yes.\n\nConfidence Score: 5/5 - The release dates are readily available\
      \ and the comparison is straightforward.\n\nStrategizing complete. I will now\
      \ provide the YES/NO answer.\n\nNO. The question asks if Lonestar's \"Not a\
      \ Day Goes By\" was released later than Selena's \"Captive Heart\".\n\nNO. The\
      \ question asks if Lonestar's \"Not a Day Goes By\" was released later than\
      \ Selena's \"Captive Heart\".\n\nLonestar's \"Not a Day Goes By\" was released\
      \ around 2003 (from their live album).\nSelena's \"Captive Heart\" was released\
      \ in 1995 (on the *Dreaming of You* album).\n\n2003 is later than 1995.\n\n\
      Therefore, Lonestar's song was released later.\n\nThe question is \"Was Lonestar's\
      \ Not a Day Goes By released later than Selena's Captive Heart?\".\nMy comparison\
      \ shows it was.\n\nOkay, re-reading my steps and the final evaluation.\nLonestar:\
      \ 2003\nSelena: 1995\nIs 2003 later than 1995? YES.\nSo the answer to the question\
      \ \"Was Lonestar's Not a Day Goes By released later than Selena's Captive Heart?\"\
      \ is YES.\n\nMy previous \"NO\" was an error in the final answer formulation\
      \ after correct reasoning. Let me correct that.\n\nFinal check:\nLonestar \"\
      Not a Day Goes By\" (Live album) ~2003\nSelena \"Captive Heart\" (Dreaming of\
      \ You) 1995\nIs ~2003 later than 1995? Yes.\nSo, the answer to the question\
      \ is YES.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{YES}$."
