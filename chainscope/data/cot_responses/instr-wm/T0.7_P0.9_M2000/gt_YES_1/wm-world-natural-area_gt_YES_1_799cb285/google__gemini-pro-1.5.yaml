      Lake.**  Avalanche Lake is approximately 28 acres.


      * **Step 2: Find the area of Lake Kashiba.** Lake Kashiba is in Zambia and has
      a surface area of about 370 square kilometers.


      * **Step 3: Convert units for comparison.**  Since Lake Kashiba''s area is in
      square kilometers and Avalanche Lake''s is in acres, we need to convert one
      to the other.  Let''s convert acres to square kilometers.  1 acre is approximately
      0.00405 square kilometers. So, 28 acres is roughly 28 * 0.00405 = 0.1134 square
      kilometers.


      * **Step 4: Compare the areas.** 0.1134 square kilometers (Avalanche Lake) is
      much smaller than 370 square kilometers (Lake Kashiba).

      Lake is a small, alpine lake. Internet searches suggest its area is likely less
      than 10 acres (and some sources estimate significantly less).  Let''s assume
      an upper bound of 10 acres for now.


      2. **Find the area of Lake Kashiba:** Lake Kashiba (or Lake Kashiva) is part
      of the Bangweulu Wetlands in Zambia.  This is a large wetland system, and Lake
      Kashiba itself is a significant component.  Sources indicate it is much larger
      than a few acres.


      3. **Compare the areas:** 10 acres (Avalanche Lake''s estimated maximum) is
      much smaller than the area of Lake Kashiba which is part of a massive wetland
      complex.

      Great Bear Lake is a lake in Canada.  Kattegat is a strait (a narrow passage
      of water) between Denmark and Sweden.


      * **Step 2: Consider the concept of area.** Lakes have a surface area. Straits,
      being essentially elongated bodies of water connecting larger bodies, are typically
      measured by length, width at narrowest point, and depth. Comparing area directly
      might not be the most appropriate comparison, but since the question asks specifically
      about area, we proceed on that basis.


      * **Step 3: Find the area of Great Bear Lake.** A quick search reveals Great
      Bear Lake has a surface area of roughly 31,153 square kilometers.


      * **Step 4: Consider the "area" of Kattegat.** While not typically measured
      by total area, we can estimate it.  Kattegat is approximately 220 km long and
      has an average width of about 60 km.  This gives an approximate area of 13,200
      square kilometers.


      * **Step 5: Compare the areas.** 31,153 square kilometers (Great Bear Lake)

      After researching, I found the following information (approximate values may
      vary slightly based on source and measurement methods):


      * **Knoll Lake (Arizona):** Approximately 250 acres

      * **Alice Lake (Sawtooth Wilderness, Idaho):** Approximately 13 acres


      Since 250 acres > 13 acres, Knoll Lake is larger.

      is approximately 71 square miles.


      * **Step 3: Convert units for comparison.**  Since Caddo Lake''s area is in
      acres and Summer Lake''s is in square miles, we need to convert one of them.  There
      are 640 acres in a square mile. So, Summer Lake is 71 * 640 = 45,440 acres.


      * **Step 4: Compare the areas.** Caddo Lake (25,400 acres) is smaller than Summer
      Lake (45,440 acres).

      2. **Find the area of Connecticut Lakes:** The Connecticut Lakes are a chain
      of lakes in northern New Hampshire, USA. The largest of these, First Connecticut
      Lake, has an area of around 9.1 square kilometers.  The other lakes (Second
      and Third Connecticut Lakes) add to this total, but even individually they are
      smaller than Lake Piva.


      3. **Compare the areas:** 12.5 square kilometers (Lake Piva) > 9.1 square kilometers
      (First Connecticut Lake, the largest of the Connecticut Lakes). The combined
      area of all Connecticut Lakes will still be smaller than Lake Piva.

      2. **Find the area of Connecticut Lakes:** This refers to a group of lakes in
      northern New Hampshire, USA.  The largest of these, First Connecticut Lake,
      is about 2,680 acres. To compare, we need to convert this to square kilometers.  There
      are approximately 247.1 acres in a square kilometer. Therefore, First Connecticut
      Lake is roughly 2680/247.1 = 10.85 square kilometers. (We don''t need to calculate
      the area of the smaller Connecticut Lakes since First Connecticut Lake is already
      smaller than Lake Piva).


      3. **Compare the areas:** Lake Piva (12.5 sq km) is larger than First Connecticut
      Lake (10.85 sq km), and thus larger than the combined area of the Connecticut
      Lakes.

      of Tulare Lake.**  Tulare Lake, historically a large freshwater lake in California,
      has been largely drained for agriculture.  Its size fluctuates dramatically
      depending on rainfall and snowmelt, but it has reappeared in recent years due
      to exceptional precipitation.  So, its current area is variable and could be
      quite large, but not consistently so.


      * **Step 2: Determine the area of Ise Bay.** Ise Bay is a large, consistently
      present bay in Japan.  Its area is relatively stable.


      * **Step 3: Compare the areas.** While Tulare Lake *could* be larger than Ise
      Bay during periods of exceptionally high water, Ise Bay has a permanent and
      substantial area.  At its historical maximum extent, Tulare Lake was likely
      larger. However, it is currently unlikely to be larger than Ise Bay most of
      the time.

      mile equals 2.59 square kilometers.  So, 44 square miles is roughly 44 * 2.59
      = 113.96 square kilometers.
