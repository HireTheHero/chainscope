      1. First, I need to find information about Lake Kaiiwi

      - Lake Kaiiwi is located in Northland, New Zealand

      - It has an area of approximately 25 hectares


      2. Next, I need to find information about Paruthipattu Lake

      - Paruthipattu Lake is located in Tamil Nadu, India

      - After searching, I cannot find reliable information about its exact area


      3. Analysis:

      - While I have data for Lake Kaiiwi''s area (25 hectares)

      - I don''t have reliable data for Paruthipattu Lake''s area

      - Without knowing both areas, I cannot make a valid comparison


      Therefore, I cannot make a definitive YES or NO determination without having
      complete information about both lakes'' areas.


      I must answer: CANNOT DETERMINE with available information.'
