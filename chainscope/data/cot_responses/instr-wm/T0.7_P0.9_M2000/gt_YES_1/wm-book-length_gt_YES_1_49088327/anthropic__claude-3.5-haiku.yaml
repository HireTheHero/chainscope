      longer than "The Art of Drowning".

      3. Ruth Rendell''s "Talking to Strange Men" is a crime novel, and her books
      are often similar in length.


      4. However, I do not have precise page count information for these specific
      books memorized.


      5. Without being able to definitively verify the exact page lengths, I cannot
      confidently state whether one is longer than the other.


      6. When I''m uncertain, the responsible answer is to say I do not know.


      Given my inability to confirm the precise lengths, I cannot provide a YES or
      NO answer with confidence.'

      1. First, I''ll check the details of Bernard Cornwell''s "Sharpe''s Fortress":

      - This is a historical novel in the Sharpe series

      - Published in 1995

      - Typically around 350-400 pages long


      2. Next, I''ll check Ruth Rendell''s "Talking to Strange Men":

      - This is a psychological crime novel

      - Published in 1984

      - Typically around 250-300 pages long


      3. Comparing the lengths:

      - "Sharpe''s Fortress" appears to be longer than "Talking to Strange Men"


      4. Therefore, the answer is: YES.


      YES'

      352 is greater than 336, so "Sharpe''s Fortress" is longer.
