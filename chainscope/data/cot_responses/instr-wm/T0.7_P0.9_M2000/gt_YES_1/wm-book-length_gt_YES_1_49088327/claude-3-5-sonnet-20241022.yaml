      1. The All Music Guide to Jazz by Stephen Thomas Erlewine is a reference guide/encyclopedia
      about jazz music. Reference guides in this series typically run around 1,000-1,500
      pages.


      2. Toll the Hounds is the eighth novel in Steven Erikson''s Malazan Book of
      the Fallen series. Like most books in this series, it is a very long fantasy
      novel, running approximately 1,200-1,300 pages.


      3. While both are lengthy books, reference guides like the All Music Guide series
      tend to be printed in a different format (often larger pages with columns) compared
      to novels.


      4. However, even accounting for format differences, these books are actually
      quite similar in length.


      5. Without having exact page counts in front of me (and considering different
      editions might vary), I cannot make a fully confident determination.


      Given the uncertainty in the exact lengths and different formats, I must answer:

      1. First, let me check the lengths of both books:

      - The Eye of the World (Book 1) is approximately 814 pages

      - Winter''s Heart (Book 9) is approximately 766 pages


      2. Comparing these numbers:

      814 > 766


      3. Therefore, The Eye of the World is longer than Winter''s Heart.


      NO


      Wait, the question asked if Winter''s Heart is longer than The Eye of the World,
      not the other way around.


      The correct answer is: YES


      The Eye of the World is longer than Winter''s Heart.'
