      \n3. **Look up the information**:\n   - \"Infinity Blade: Redemption\" by Brandon\

      \   - \"Every Heart a Doorway\" by Seanan McGuire is also a novella, specifically\

      Brandon Sanderson''s "Infinity Blade: Redemption" is a novella, so it''s likely
      to be shorter than a full-length novel. Novellas typically range from around
      20,000 to 50,000 words, which is equivalent to about 80 to 200 pages, depending
      on formatting and font size.


      Seanan McGuire''s "Every Heart a Doorway" is also a novella, and it''s about
      173 pages in its paperback edition. This suggests it''s probably around the
      same length as "Infinity Blade: Redemption", but it''s difficult to say for
      sure without knowing the exact page count for Sanderson''s book.


      Based on this information, it''s not clear whether "Infinity Blade: Redemption"
      is longer than "Every Heart a Doorway". It''s possible that they''re about the
      same length, or that one is slightly longer than the other, but without more
      specific information, it''s difficult to say for sure.

      \   - Postmodern novels like \"J R\" can also vary in length, but they are often\

      \ \n   - D.J. MacHale is known for young adult fiction, particularly fantasy\
      \ and adventure.\n   - William Trevor is known for literary fiction, often characterized\
      \ by insightful character studies and exploration of human relationships.\n\
      3. **Consider typical book lengths by genre**:\n   - Young adult fantasy novels\
      \ can vary in length, but they often fall within the range of 60,000 to 100,000\
      \ words.\n   - Literary fiction novels can also vary, but they might typically\
      \ be longer, often in the range of 80,000 to 120,000 words, depending on the\
      \ style and complexity.\n4. **Research specific page counts**:\n   - \"The Lost\

      5. **Comparison**:\n   - Without exact word counts, we can estimate based on\

      \ book.\n   - \"Total Control\" by David Baldacci is a thriller, and while Baldacci's\
      \ books can vary in length, thrillers are generally shorter than epic fantasy\
      \ novels.\n\n4. **Compare the Lengths**:\n   - Without exact page counts, we\

      \ - Gideon Defoe is known for writing humorous and satirical fiction, particularly\

      \   - Humorous fiction can vary in length but often falls in the range of 50,000\

      Gail Tsukiyama is an American author, and "The Samurai''s Garden" is a novel
      by her. The page count for "The Samurai''s Garden" by Gail Tsukiyama is 256
      pages (according to the paperback edition).


      Michio Kaku is a theoretical physicist and popular science author. "Beyond Einstein:

      1. **Identify the books**: We are comparing "The Price of Silence: The Duke
      Lacrosse Scandal, the Power of the Elite, and the Corruption of Our Great Universities"
      by William David Cohan and "The Dragonbone Chair" by Tad Williams.

      2. **Determine the authors'' genres**: William David Cohan is known for non-fiction
      books, particularly those related to finance and business. Tad Williams, on
      the other hand, is a fantasy author known for epic fantasy novels.

      3. **Typical book lengths by genre**: Non-fiction books can vary widely in length,
      but they often range from 50,000 to 100,000 words. Fantasy novels, especially
      epic fantasy like "The Dragonbone Chair," can be much longer, often exceeding
      100,000 words.

      4. **Research specific page counts**: The page count for "The Price of Silence"
      is around 656 pages, while "The Dragonbone Chair" is around 672 pages.

      5. **Comparison**: Without exact word counts, we can estimate based on page
      numbers. Assuming an average of 250-300 words per page, "The Price of Silence"
      would have approximately 164,000-197,000 words, and "The Dragonbone Chair" would
