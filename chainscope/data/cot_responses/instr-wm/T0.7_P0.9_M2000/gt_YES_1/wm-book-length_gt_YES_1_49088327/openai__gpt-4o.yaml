      With these estimates in mind, "Nothing To Lose" can be slightly longer depending

      Therefore, if we consider the average page count across the usual editions:


      - "Nothing To Lose" is not conclusively longer than "Desert God" in a definitive

      organized more like an encyclopedia.

      novels. "Toll the Hounds" itself is around 1,200 pages in the mass-market paperback

      Given these points, reference books like the "All Music Guide to Jazz" can vary

      1. **Forest Mage by Robin Hobb**: "Forest Mage" is the second book in the Soldier
      Son Trilogy and is a novel. Novels typically have a significant page count,
      and "Forest Mage" is specifically known to be quite lengthy, with its editions
      often having around 700 pages.


      2. **The Mousetrap and Other Plays by Agatha Christie**: This is a collection
      of plays. While plays are generally shorter than novels in terms of text length,
      the entire collection would include multiple plays. However, even with multiple
      plays included, the total page count generally tends to be less than that of
      a lengthy novel like "Forest Mage."


      Given that "Forest Mage" is a long single novel and "The Mousetrap and Other
      Plays" is a collection that typically contains fewer pages overall, it is reasonable
      to conclude that "Forest Mage" is longer.

      2. **Identify the page count of "Budding Prospects":** This novel, published
      in 1984, generally has about 352 to 384 pages, based on various editions.


      3. **Compare the page counts:** Both books are very similar in page count, with
      editions of both books falling in the range of 320 to 384 pages. However, "The
      Courtship of Princess Leia" can have editions that are slightly shorter, while
      "Budding Prospects" tends to consistently be around 352 to 384 pages.


      Based on this information, the answer is NO, "The Courtship of Princess Leia"
      is not definitively longer than "Budding Prospects," as both books have similar
      lengths, and "Budding Prospects" may even be slightly longer depending on the
      edition.'
