      - Badin Lake is located in North Carolina


      3. Compare the geographical locations

      - Missouri is located in the central United States

      - North Carolina is located on the eastern coast of the United States


      4. Determine their relative north-south positioning

      - Missouri is significantly west and north of North Carolina

      - Therefore, a location in Missouri would indeed be north of a location in North
      Carolina


      5. Conclusion: The Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis is located north of Badin
      Lake, NC.
