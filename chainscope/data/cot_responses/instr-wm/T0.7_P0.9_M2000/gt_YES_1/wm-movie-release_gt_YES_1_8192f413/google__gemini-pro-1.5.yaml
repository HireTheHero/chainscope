      6. **Consider the ambiguity.** Since the question is about "later than," and

      universally accurate YES/NO answer is impossible without specifying a region.


      However, if we assume the question refers to the US release, the answer is NO.

      4. **Conclusion:** Since there is no movie called *Brave* directed by Richard
      Stanley, the question is flawed.  However, if we assume the question meant to
      ask if ANY movie directed by Richard Stanley was released *after* 1995, then
      the answer would depend on finding the latest release date of a Richard Stanley
      film.  *Color Out of Space* was released in 2019.


      5. **Final Answer:** YES (Assuming the question intended to compare any Richard
      Stanley film''s release date to *Bloodfist VI*''s release date.)

      of Flesh (Nikutai no mon) was released in 1964.

      3. **Compare the release dates:** Both films were released in the same year.  Further
      research might be needed to determine precise release months, but the question
      only asks if Gate of Flesh was released *later* than A Distant Trumpet.  Since
      they were released in the same year, it''s not *necessarily* later.

      2. **Find the release date of *A Distant Trumpet*:** *A Distant Trumpet* was
      released in 1964.


      3. **Compare the release dates:** Both films were released in the same year.  Further
      research would be needed to determine if one was released earlier in the year
      than the other.  Without knowing which was released first in 1964, a definitive
      YES or NO answer is impossible.


      However, the question asks if *Gate of Flesh* was released *later* than *A Distant
      Trumpet*. Since they were released in the same year, it''s possible, but not
      definitively answerable with the current information.  Therefore, the answer
      is:


      NO (assuming "later" means strictly after, not including the same year)

      US release was in May 1964.  Determining which was *first* in 1964 might require
      more specialized sources.  However, for the purpose of this question, it''s
      enough to know they were both released in the same year.


      NO.

      it''s possible, but not definitively conclusive based on the year alone.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**. (It''s not definitively yes, and the burden
      of proof lies on confirming a *later* release, which isn''t established.)

      Since it''s *possible* Deuta was released later, but we don''t have enough information

      more likely scenario, if we assume a later release for Deuta within the same

      but not definitively confirmed.  Without more precise release dates (month and
      day), a definitive answer is difficult.


      4. **Consider the possibility of different regional releases:**  Even if one
      film premiered earlier in one country, it might have been released later in
      another. This further complicates a definitive answer.


      Therefore, without more specific release date information, I cannot definitively
      say yes or no.  I could answer "Maybe", but the question restricts the answer
