      1. First, I''ll check if Richard Stanley made a movie called "Brave":

      - I do not find a movie by Richard Stanley called "Brave"

      - This suggests the premise of the question might be incorrect


      2. I''ll verify the details about "Bloodfist VI: Ground Zero":

      - Rick Jacobson did direct a movie in the Bloodfist series

      - Bloodfist VI: Ground Zero was released in 1995


      3. Since I cannot confirm the existence of a Richard Stanley movie called "Brave",
      I cannot compare release dates.


      Given the information available, I cannot definitively answer the question.


      However, if I must give a YES or NO answer based on the information at hand:


      NO


      (Because the first part of the question premise appears to be false, and without
      a verified movie to compare, the answer defaults to NO)'

      1. First, I''ll find the release year for "Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace":

      - This film was directed by Terence Fisher

      - It was released in 1962


      2. Next, I''ll find the release year for "We Joined the Navy":

      - This film was directed by Wendy Toye

      3. Now I''ll compare the years:

      - "Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace" was released in 1962

      - "We Joined the Navy" was released in 1961

      - 1962 is later than 1961
