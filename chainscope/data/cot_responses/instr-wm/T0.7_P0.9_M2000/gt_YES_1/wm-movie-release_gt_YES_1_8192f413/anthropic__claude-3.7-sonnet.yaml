      - "Red" was released in October 2010.

      - "A Woman" was released in April 2010.

      12, 2013


      Step 3: Determine which came later.

      Even if we consider Pandora''s Promise''s wider release date (June 12, 2013),
      Summer in February was still released later (June 14, 2013).

    fadbf7cc-57a2-4be1-96ac-1139931bf3b8: 'I need to determine the release years of
      two movies: Richard Stanley''s "Brave" and Rick Jacobson''s "Bloodfist VI: Ground
      Zero".


      Step 1: Let me identify Richard Stanley''s "Brave".

      There appears to be a confusion here. Richard Stanley is a filmmaker known for
      movies like "Hardware" (1990) and "Dust Devil" (1992), but he''s not known for
      directing a film called "Brave." The well-known animated film "Brave" (2012)
      was produced by Pixar and directed by Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman.


      Step 2: Let me identify Rick Jacobson''s "Bloodfist VI: Ground Zero".

      "Bloodfist VI: Ground Zero" directed by Rick Jacobson was released in 1995.
      It''s part of the Bloodfist martial arts film series.


      Step 3: Make a comparison.

      Since I cannot confirm the existence of a film called "Brave" directed by Richard
      Stanley, I cannot make a valid comparison between release dates.


      However, if the question is referring to the Pixar film "Brave" (2012), then
      it was released after "Bloodfist VI: Ground Zero" (1995).


      NO - I cannot confirm that "Richard Stanley''s Brave" was released later than
      "Bloodfist VI: Ground Zero" because I cannot verify the existence of a film
      called "Brave" directed by Richard Stanley.'

      two movies: "Brave" directed by Richard Stanley and "Bloodfist VI: Ground Zero"
      directed by Rick Jacobson.


      Step 1: Identify Richard Stanley''s "Brave"

      Actually, I don''t believe Richard Stanley directed a film called "Brave." Richard
      Stanley is known for films like "Hardware" (1990), "Dust Devil" (1992), and
      more recently "Color Out of Space" (2019). The well-known film "Brave" was a
      2012 Pixar animated film directed by Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman, not Richard
      Stanley.


      Step 2: Identify "Bloodfist VI: Ground Zero"

      "Bloodfist VI: Ground Zero" directed by Rick Jacobson was released in 1995.
      It was part of the Bloodfist martial arts film series.


      Step 3: Compare release dates

      Since Richard Stanley doesn''t appear to have directed a film called "Brave,"
      I cannot make a direct comparison. If we''re referring to the Pixar "Brave"
      (2012), then it was released after "Bloodfist VI: Ground Zero" (1995).


      However, since the question specifically asks about Richard Stanley''s "Brave"
      which doesn''t exist to my knowledge, I cannot give a definitive answer based
      on that specific film.


      NO - I cannot confirm that "Richard Stanley''s Brave" was released later than
      "Bloodfist VI: Ground Zero" because I don''t believe Richard Stanley directed
      a film called "Brave."'

      - "Piker''s Peak" was a Looney Tunes animated short film released in 1957, specifically
      on May 12, 1957.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      - Both films were released in 1957.

      - Without the exact month and day for "Hour of Decision," I cannot determine
      with complete certainty which came first.

      - However, based on available information, they were released in the same year.


      Since I don''t have the precise release date for "Hour of Decision" beyond the
      year 1957, I cannot definitively state which film was released later. If "Hour
      of Decision" was released after May 12, 1957, then the answer would be YES.
      If it was released before May 12, 1957, then the answer would be NO.


      Given this uncertainty, I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer without
      more specific release date information for "Hour of Decision."'

      - "Hour of Decision" directed by C. M. Pennington-Richards was released in 1957.

      - "Piker''s Peak" directed by Friz Freleng was a Looney Tunes cartoon released
      in 1957.

      - "Piker''s Peak" was released on May 12, 1957.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      - April 1957 comes before May 12, 1957.

      - Therefore, "Hour of Decision" was released earlier than "Piker''s Peak."


      Step 4: Answer the question "Was Hour of Decision released later than Piker''s
      Peak?"

      - Since "Hour of Decision" was released earlier (April) than "Piker''s Peak"
      (May), the answer is NO.

      closest film I can identify in Upendra''s filmography is "Om" (1995).

      - If comparing with "Om" (1995): "Love! Valour! Compassion!" (1997) was released
      later.

      - If comparing with "Omkaram" (1997): They were released in the same year, but
      I would need specific dates to determine which came first.


      Given the information available and assuming the question refers to Upendra''s
      "Om" (1995), not "Omkaram":


      YES, Joe Mantello''s "Love! Valour! Compassion!" was released later than Upendra''s
      film.'

      - After checking, I find that "Omkaram" (sometimes spelled "Omkara") directed

      - Note: There is also a 2006 Hindi film "Omkara" directed by Vishal Bhardwaj,

      Step 3: Compare the release years.

      - Both films were released in the same year (1997).

      - Without more specific release date information (month and day), I cannot determine
      if one was released later than the other within the same year.


      Since both films were released in the same year and I don''t have more specific

      Step 1: Find the release date of "Love! Valour! Compassion!"

      "Love! Valour! Compassion!" was released in 1997. It was directed by Joe Mantello
      and was based on Terrence McNally''s play of the same name.


      Step 2: Find the release date of "Omkaram" directed by Upendra

      "Omkaram" (also spelled as "Om Karam" or simply "Om") is a Kannada film directed

      "Love! Valour! Compassion!" was released in 1997.

      "Omkaram" was released in 1995.

      1997 comes after 1995.

      - "Love! Valour! Compassion!" was released in 1997.


      Step 2: Identify the release year of "Omkaram" directed by Upendra.

      - I need to check if there is a film called "Omkaram" directed by Upendra. Based
      on my knowledge, Upendra directed films like "Om" (1995), "A" (1998), and "Upendra"
      (1999), but I don''t have clear information about a film titled "Omkaram" directed
      by him. There is a Telugu film called "Omkaram" but it doesn''t appear to be
      directed by Upendra.

      - "Love! Valour! Compassion!" was released in 1997.


      Step 2: Identify when "Omkaram" directed by Upendra was released.

      - I need to check when "Omkaram" was released. However, I don''t believe there
      is a film called "Omkaram" directed by Upendra. Upendra is an Indian filmmaker
      who directed films like "Om" (1995), "A" (1998), and "Upendra" (1999), but I

      - "Love! Valour! Compassion!" was released in 1997.


      Step 2: Identify when "Omkaram" directed by Upendra was released.

      - I need to check when "Omkaram" was released. However, I should note that Upendra
      is an Indian filmmaker, and I believe the film being referenced might actually
      be "Om" (1995) or possibly "A" (1998), as I don''t have a specific record of
      a film titled "Omkaram" by Upendra.

      - The closest match I can identify is likely "Om" which was released in 1995.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      - If we''re referring to "Om" (1995), then "Love! Valour! Compassion!" (1997)
      was released later.

      - If "Omkaram" is a different film with a later release date than 1997, my answer
      would change.

      - "Thulli Thirintha Kaalam" is a Tamil film that was released in 1998.


      Step 2: Let me identify when "Silencing Mary" directed by Craig R. Baxley was
      released.

      - "Silencing Mary" (also known as "Silencing Mary: The Mary Stuartson Story")
      was a TV movie released in 1998.


      Step 3: I need to determine the exact release dates within 1998 to compare them.

      - "Thulli Thirintha Kaalam" was released on January 14, 1998.

      - "Silencing Mary" was released on March 8, 1998.


      Step 4: Compare the dates.

      - January 14, 1998 comes before March 8, 1998.

      - Therefore, "Thulli Thirintha Kaalam" was released earlier than "Silencing
      Mary."


      The question asks if "Thulli Thirintha Kaalam" was released later than "Silencing
      Mary," which is not correct.


      NO'

      - "Thulli Thirintha Kaalam" directed by Balasekaran

      Step 2: Find their release dates.

      - "Thulli Thirintha Kaalam" was released in 1998. It''s a Tamil film.

      - "Silencing Mary" was released in 1998 as well. It''s a TV movie directed by
      Craig R. Baxley.

      I cannot definitively determine which was released later.


      However, based on the information available to me, I don''t have the precise
      dates within 1998 to make a definitive comparison.


      NO - I cannot confirm that Thulli Thirintha Kaalam was released later than Silencing
      Mary based on the available information, as both were released in 1998 and I
      don''t have more specific timing data.'

      - 1995 (Paappi Devataa) is later than 1994 (Widows'' Peak).

      John Irvin''s "Widows'' Peak."

      film was released later within 1950.

      - However, based on the information available, "Mark of the Gorilla" was released
      in early 1950 (February).


      Since I don''t have complete information about the exact release date of "Afsar"
      beyond the year, I cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer to whether "Mark

      House of Horrors" was released early in 1965 (February), and animated shorts
      like "The Wild Chase" were typically released throughout the year, there''s
      a reasonable chance "The Wild Chase" came later in 1965.

      Step 3: Make a determination based on available information.

      - Without the exact month for "The Wild Chase," I can''t be 100% certain.

      - However, since "Dr. Terror''s House of Horrors" was released in February 1965,
      and "The Wild Chase" was also released in 1965, it''s more likely that "The

      Let me find the release years for each film:


      "The Treasure of San Teresa" (also known as "Hot Money Girl") was released in
      1959.


      "Nor the Moon by Night" was released in 1958.


      Comparing these dates: 1959 comes after 1958.


      So, was Alvin Rakoff''s "The Treasure of San Teresa" released later than Ken
      Annakin''s "Nor the Moon by Night"?


      YES'

      1. Georges Lautner''s "Les Bons Vivants" (also known as "The Good Life" in English)

      2. Seth Holt''s "The Nanny"


      Looking up the release years:

      - "Les Bons Vivants" was released in 1965

      - "The Nanny" was released in 1965


      Since both films were released in the same year (1965), I need to check if there''s

      However, since the question requires a YES/NO answer based on available information,
