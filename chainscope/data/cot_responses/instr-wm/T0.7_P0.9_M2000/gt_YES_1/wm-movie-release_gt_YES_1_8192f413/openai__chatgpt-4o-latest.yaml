      2. Rick Jacobson''s *Bloodfist VI: Ground Zero* is part of the *Bloodfist* series
      and was released in 1995.

      3. To determine if *Brave* was released later, we need to establish its release
      year.

      4. *Brave* was completed around 1994 but had a very limited release, with some
      sources indicating it was not widely distributed until later.

      5. However, *Bloodfist VI: Ground Zero* had a clear release in 1995.


      Since *Brave* does not have a widely recognized later release date beyond 1995,
      we conclude:


      **NO**, *Brave* was not released later than *Bloodfist VI: Ground Zero*.'
