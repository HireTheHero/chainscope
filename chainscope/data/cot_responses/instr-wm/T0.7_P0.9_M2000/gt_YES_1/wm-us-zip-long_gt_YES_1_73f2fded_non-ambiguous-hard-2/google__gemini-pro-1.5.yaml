      is in New Jersey, which is on the East Coast of the US.  34994 is in Florida,
      also on the East Coast.


      2. **Consider longitude:**  Since both are on the East Coast, we need to determine
      which is further east using longitude.  Locations further east have higher longitude
      values.


      3. **Approximate longitude is sufficient:** We don''t need exact coordinates.
      New Jersey is significantly north of Florida.  The Earth curves, meaning lines
      of longitude converge as you move north.  Therefore, even if two locations have
      similar longitudes near the equator, the more northerly location will be significantly
      further east if it''s much higher in latitude.

      United States, while Florida is also on the East Coast but extends further south.  A
      substantial portion of Florida is *west* of New Jersey when looking at a map.


      3. **Relative Position:**  New Jersey is generally north and east of Florida.

      north of FL, it is also significantly *east* of a substantial portion of Florida,
      including the area where 34994 likely resides.

      is on the East Coast, and FL (Florida) is also on the East Coast, but further
      south.

      2. **General East/West understanding:**  Longitude determines East/West placement.
      Higher longitude values are further east.

      3. **Relative positions of NJ and FL:** New Jersey is considerably north and
      east of Florida.  While Florida extends eastward in its southern portion, New
      Jersey as a whole is further east.

      zip codes:** 08620 is in New Jersey, which is on the East Coast of the US. 34994
      is in Florida, also on the East Coast.


      2. **Determine relative north/south positions:** New Jersey is north of Florida.


      3. **Consider how longitude relates to east/west on a map:**  Moving further
      east increases the longitude. Since both locations are on the East Coast, the
      more eastern location will have the *higher* longitude.


      4. **We don''t need precise longitude, just relative:** Since New Jersey is
      north of Florida and both are on the East Coast, the question of "east-ness"
      essentially becomes a question of whether New Jersey is *significantly* north
      enough to be at a more easterly longitude than a point in Florida.  It''s likely,
      but we should consider Florida''s shape.


      5. **Florida extends eastward significantly in its south:**  The easternmost
      point of Florida is substantially east of many points in New Jersey.


      6. **Therefore, without precise coordinates, we cannot definitively say 08620,
      NJ is east of 34994, FL.** It''s plausible 34994 is actually further east.

      2. **Consider east/west within the same state:**  Zip codes increase from west
      to east within a state.


      3. **Consider east/west between states:** Since Virginia is significantly north
      of Georgia, and the earth is a sphere (roughly), a location in eastern Virginia
      will be east of a location in western Georgia.  Even central or western Virginia
      is likely still east of most of Georgia.

      east, and higher zip codes are further west. However, this is a very broad generalization
      and not reliable for precise comparisons, especially within the same general
      region.

      3. **Focus on the states and north/south:** Since both states are on the east

      generalization *sometimes* applies, but it''s not guaranteed.  We don''t even

      2. **General US geography:** Michigan is east of Iowa.

      3. **Zip codes within states:**  Zip codes generally increase from east to west.  While
      this isn''t a perfect rule, it holds true in this case given the states involved.  A
      lower zip code in Michigan will be further east than a higher zip code in Iowa.

      4. **Conclusion:** Since Michigan is east of Iowa, 49453 in MI is east of 50703
      in IA.
