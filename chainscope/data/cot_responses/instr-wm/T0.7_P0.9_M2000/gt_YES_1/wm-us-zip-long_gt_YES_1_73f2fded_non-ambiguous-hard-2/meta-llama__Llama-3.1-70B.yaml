      \ is generally considered to be in the Southeastern United States.\n\n3. **Compare\
      \ the locations**:\n   - Since both states are on the East Coast, we need to\
      \ consider their relative positions to determine if one is east of the other.\n\
      \   - New Jersey is north of Virginia on the East Coast, but both are generally\
      \ considered to be in the eastern part of the United States.\n\n4. **Consider\

      \ each zip code's location within its state, we rely on the general east-west\
      \ alignment of the states.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that New Jersey\
      \ is north of Virginia, and considering their general east-west positions on\
      \ the East Coast, we can infer that 08221, NJ is indeed east of 24486, VA.\n\
