      \ of these areas to determine their east-west relationship.\n   - Without exact\
      \ longitude values provided, general knowledge suggests that parts of Oregon\

      \ geographic locations. Both are on the West Coast, but Oregon stretches slightly\
      \ more eastward than California's westernmost points. Yet, without exact coordinates\
      \ or more detailed geographic analysis, the answer could lean towards the understanding\
      \ that parts of Oregon might be east of parts of California, depending on the\
      \ specific locations.\n\n**Final Step**: Given the information and typical geographic\

      run through parts of both states, but Washington is closer to the Pacific Ocean,
      placing it generally west of Wyoming.


      3. **Zip Code Specifics**: The zip codes given, 82609 for Wyoming and 99207
      for Washington, can help pinpoint more specific locations within these states.
      However, without needing to look up the exact locations of these zip codes,
      we can infer based on the states'' general positions relative to each other.


      4. **East-West Comparison**: Given that Washington is west of Wyoming, any location

      \   - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States.\n   - Minnesota\
      \ is located in the upper midwestern United States.\n\n3. **Determine Longitude**:\n\
      \   - To determine if one location is east of another, we need to compare their\
      \ longitudes. Locations with higher longitude values are to the east (up to\
      \ the 180-degree meridian, after which longitude values decrease as you move\
      \ east).\n   - Pennsylvania's longitude ranges approximately from 74.7\xB0 W\
      \ to 80.5\xB0 W.\n   - Minnesota's longitude ranges approximately from 89.5\xB0\
      \ W to 97.2\xB0 W.\n\n4. **Compare Longitudes**:\n   - Since Pennsylvania's\
      \ longitude range (approximately 74.7\xB0 W to 80.5\xB0 W) is less than Minnesota's\
      \ (approximately 89.5\xB0 W to 97.2\xB0 W), it means Pennsylvania is east of\
      \ Minnesota.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that 15062, PA is in Pennsylvania\
      \ and 55388, MN is in Minnesota, and knowing Pennsylvania is east of Minnesota,\
      \ we can conclude that 15062, PA is indeed located east of 55388, MN.\n\nThe\
      \ final answer is: **YES**"

      \ (VA).\n\n2. **General Geographic Location of States**:\n   - Massachusetts\
      \ is located in the Northeastern United States.\n   - Virginia is located in\
      \ the Eastern United States but is south of Massachusetts.\n\n3. **Determine\
      \ East-West Relationship**:\n   - Since both states are on the eastern side\
      \ of the United States, the question becomes about their relative positions\
      \ east-west of each other.\n   - Generally, Massachusetts is northeast, and\
      \ Virginia is southeast. \n\n4. **Longitude Comparison**:\n   - To be east of\
      \ another location, an area must have a higher longitude (in the context of\
      \ the Western Hemisphere, where both the US and these states are located).\n\
      \   - Massachusetts has a longitude range that is generally more east than Virginia's\
      \ because it is farther northeast.\n\nBased on these steps, we can conclude\
      \ that Massachusetts (01364) is indeed east of Virginia (23702), considering\
      \ their general geographic positions and without needing the exact longitudes\

      \ States, which is generally considered to be in the eastern part of the country\

      \ part of the continental United States for the most part, especially when considering\

      \   - Since both locations are on the eastern side of the United States, the\

      \ of 28107, NC, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the locations**:\
      \ \n   - 08080 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ).\n   - 28107 is a zip code in\
      \ North Carolina (NC).\n\n2. **Determine the general geographical locations\
      \ of NJ and NC**:\n   - New Jersey (NJ) is located in the Northeastern United\
      \ States.\n   - North Carolina (NC) is located in the Southeastern United States.\n\
      \n3. **Compare their longitudinal positions (east-west)**:\n   - Since both\
      \ states are on the East Coast, we need to consider their relative positions.\
      \ New Jersey is generally north of North Carolina. However, to determine if\
      \ it's east, we must consider that the East Coast of the United States is oriented\
      \ roughly north-south. Therefore, being north does not necessarily mean being\
      \ east or west in this context. We need to look at the specific longitudes or\
      \ consider the coastline's orientation.\n\n4. **Specific consideration of the\
      \ coastline and state positions**:\n   - The eastern seaboard of the United\
      \ States has a coastline that is roughly parallel to the longitude lines in\
      \ this area. North Carolina and New Jersey both border the Atlantic Ocean, but\
      \ their positions relative to each other are more north-south than east-west\
      \ due to the coastline's orientation.\n\n5. **Conclusion based on geographical\
      \ knowledge**:\n   - Given that 08080, NJ, and 28107, NC, are both on the East\
      \ Coast and considering the general north-south alignment of the coastline in\
      \ this region, we can deduce that New Jersey is north (and slightly east due\
      \ to the Earth's slightly ellipsoidal shape and the curvature of longitude lines)\
      \ of North Carolina. However, in terms of direct east-west comparison without\
      \ considering latitude (north-south), New Jersey is not significantly east or\
      \ west of North Carolina in a way that would categorically place one entirely\
      \ to the east of the other based solely on their state locations.\n\n6. **Final\
      \ determination**:\n   - Considering the above steps and understanding that\
      \ the question asks for a straightforward east-west comparison without accounting\
      \ for the north-south difference, we need to consider if the longitude of 08080,\
      \ NJ, is east of the longitude of 28107, NC.\n\nGiven these considerations and\
      \ the fact that we're comparing across state lines without specific longitude\
      \ values provided, the critical factor is recognizing that both locations are\
      \ on the eastern seaboard, and their primary difference is in latitude (north-south)\
      \ rather than longitude (east-west). However, to provide a clear YES or NO answer:\n\
      \nSince New Jersey is generally northeast of North Carolina, and considering\
      \ the question's framing which implies a direct east-west comparison might overlook\
      \ the nuanced north-south and east-west interplay in this region, we must acknowledge\
      \ that in a broad geographical sense, New Jersey is indeed east (and more significantly,\
      \ north) of North Carolina. Therefore, the answer to whether 08080, NJ, is located\

      \ Southeastern United States.\n\n3. **Relative East-West Positions**:\n   -\
      \ Since both states are on the East Coast, we need to consider their relative\
      \ positions. \n   - Connecticut is generally north and slightly east of Florida\
      \ due to the coastline's curvature.\n\n4. **Specific Longitude Comparison**:\n\
      \   - To be precise, we compare the longitudes:\n     - The longitude of 06712\
      \ (Waterbury, CT) is approximately 73.05\xB0 W.\n     - The longitude of 33330\
      \ (Davie, FL) is approximately 80.25\xB0 W.\n   - Since lower longitude values\
      \ indicate an eastern position, 06712, CT is indeed east of 33330, FL based\
      \ on longitude.\n\nBased on these steps, the answer to whether 06712, CT is\

      1. First, let''s identify the states: 10918 is located in New York (NY), and
      30346 is located in Georgia (GA).

      2. Next, we consider the general geography of the United States. New York is
      located in the Northeast, while Georgia is in the Southeast.

      3. Since New York is northeast and Georgia is southeast, we can infer that New
      York is generally north and slightly east of Georgia, but more importantly for
      this question, it is north.

      4. The question asks if 10918, NY is located east of 30346, GA. Given that NY
      is north of GA and considering the U.S. geography, being north does not necessarily
      mean it''s east or west, but in this case, New York is indeed east of Georgia
      because it is on the eastern seaboard and Georgia, while also on the eastern
      seaboard, is south of New York.

      we compare their longitudes. Locations with higher longitude values are more
      eastward. However, without specific longitude values for these zip codes, we
      rely on general knowledge. New Jersey is generally east of Indiana due to the

      1. **Identify the States**: First, we identify the states involved. 11768 is
      in New York (NY), and 45342 is in Ohio (OH).


      2. **General Geographic Locations of States**: Next, we consider the general
      geographic locations of these states. New York is located in the Northeastern
      United States, while Ohio is in the Midwestern United States.


      3. **Relative Positions of States**: Generally, the Northeast is east of the
      Midwest. This suggests that New York, being in the Northeast, would be east
      of Ohio, which is in the Midwest.


      4. **Specific Locations Within States**: To refine our understanding, we should

      to a location in Suffolk County, New York, on Long Island. The zip code 45342
      refers to a location in Ohio, specifically in the area around Miamisburg, which
      is near Dayton.


      5. **Longitude Comparison**: The most direct way to determine if one location

      (more positive numbers) are further east when considering the Western Hemisphere.
      However, without specific longitude values for these zip codes, we rely on general
      knowledge of U.S. geography.


      6. **General Knowledge Application**: Knowing that the entire state of New York
      is generally east of the entire state of Ohio, and considering the locations
      of these specific zip codes, we can infer their relative east-west positions.

      \ the United States, and Oregon (OR) is also on the West Coast, north of California.\n\
      \n2. **Understand the zip code system**: Zip codes in the United States are\
      \ generally assigned from east to west, with lower numbers in the east and higher\
      \ numbers in the west. However, within each state or region, the assignment\
      \ can seem more random but still follows a pattern that reflects the geographic\
      \ location within that state or area.\n\n3. **Look up the specific zip codes**:\n\
      \   - 90043 is in Los Angeles, California.\n   - 97331 is in Albany, Oregon.\n\
      \n4. **Determine their relative east-west positions**: Since both zip codes\
      \ are on the West Coast, we need to consider their relative positions rather\
      \ than their absolute east-west positions in the country. Oregon is north of\
      \ California, but we're interested in east-west positioning.\n\n5. **Consider\
      \ the longitude**: To determine if one location is east of the other, we need\
      \ to look at their longitudes. The more west a location is, the higher its longitude\
      \ will be (in terms of negative numbers, as we're dealing with the Western Hemisphere).\
      \ However, without specific longitude values, we rely on general geographic\
      \ knowledge that Oregon and California are both western states, with their relative\
      \ east-west positions depending on specific locations within those states.\n\
      \n6. **General knowledge application**: Knowing that both states are on the\
      \ West Coast and considering that the question asks for a relative position\
      \ (east of), we should recognize that Oregon is generally at a similar longitude\
      \ to California but is slightly to the east in some areas due to its northern\
      \ position. However, the specific zip codes provided need to be considered for\
      \ their exact locations.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Given the general westward decrease\
      \ in zip code numbers and knowing both states are on the West Coast, the question\
      \ hinges on the specific geographic locations of these zip codes. Without exact\
      \ longitude values, the determination relies on understanding that within the\
      \ western United States, the difference in east-west positioning between two\
      \ points in different states can be subtle and depends on their specific longitudes.\
      \ Generally, though, Oregon would be considered slightly east or at a similar\
      \ east-west position compared to parts of California due to its northern and\
      \ slightly more eastern geographic location on the West Coast.\n\nGiven these\
      \ considerations and the fact that both locations are on the West Coast with\
      \ Oregon being slightly more eastward in its northern parts, and without precise\
      \ longitude data provided, the question seems to test understanding of relative\
      \ geographic positions. However, since Oregon is north and slightly east of\
      \ California in a broad sense, but considering the specific locations within\
      \ these states can vary, the precise answer depends on the exact longitudes\
      \ of 90043, CA, and 97331, OR.\n\n90043, CA (Los Angeles) has a longitude around\
      \ -118.4, and 97331, OR (Albany) has a longitude around -123.1. Given that the\
      \ more negative the longitude, the farther west a location is, Albany, OR (97331),\

      in the northern part of the United States, considered part of both the Midwest
      and the Western United States, but it is generally to the east of Kansas. Kansas,
      on the other hand, is located in the central part of the United States, often
      considered part of the Midwest but is west of Minnesota.


      3. **Specific zip code locations**: Now, let''s consider the specific locations
      within these states. The zip code 55404 is associated with Minneapolis, Minnesota,
      which is in the southeastern part of the state. The zip code 67037 is associated
      with Garden City, Kansas, which is in the southwestern part of the state.
