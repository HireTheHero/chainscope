    0803f87a-455d-439d-8f6f-ea3485aa0daf: 'Okay, let''s break this down:


      1.  **Identify the locations:** We need to compare the location of US zip code
      06438, CT with the location of US zip code 29206, SC.

      2.  **Identify the states:** CT stands for Connecticut. SC stands for South
      Carolina.

      3.  **Determine the relative geography:** Connecticut is a state in the New
      England region of the northeastern United States. South Carolina is a state
      in the southeastern United States.

      4.  **Compare East/West positions:** Geographically, the northeastern US (where
      Connecticut is located) is situated east of the southeastern US (where South
      Carolina is located) when considering longitude lines.

      5.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, any location in Connecticut will be east of any
      location in South Carolina.

      5.  **Determine direction:** Geographically, any location in Massachusetts is
      east of any location in central or eastern Pennsylvania like Conyngham. Specifically,
      Nahant (01908) is much further east than Conyngham (18218).


      Therefore, the location of 01908, MA is east of the location of 18218, PA.

    aac253ce-463b-4d84-966f-3e9941b781a6: 'Okay, let''s break this down:


      1.  **Identify the states:** 02452 is in MA (Massachusetts). 15690 is in PA
      (Pennsylvania).

      2.  **Determine the relative location of the states:** Massachusetts is located
      on the East Coast of the United States. Pennsylvania is located to the west
      of Massachusetts.

      3.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, any location in Massachusetts is east of any
      location in Pennsylvania.

      \ the state for each zip code:**\n    *   02452 is in Massachusetts (MA).\n\
      \    *   15690 is in Pennsylvania (PA).\n\n2.  **Determine the relative geographical\

      \ the one corresponding to zip code 02452) will be east of any location within\
      \ Pennsylvania (like the one corresponding to zip code 15690).\n\nYES"
    ad2cddf3-6dc9-49bf-bb8c-93ec9b234263: 'Okay, here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the locations:** The first zip code, 02452, is in Massachusetts
      (MA). The second zip code, 15690, is in Pennsylvania (PA).

      2.  **Determine the relative geography of the states:** Massachusetts is a state
      on the East Coast of the United States. Pennsylvania is also an eastern state,
      but it lies geographically to the west of Massachusetts.

      3.  **Compare the specific locations (optional but confirmatory):** 02452 corresponds
      to Waltham, MA, which is near Boston on the eastern side of Massachusetts. 15690
      corresponds to Youngwood, PA, which is in southwestern Pennsylvania.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Since Massachusetts as a whole is east of Pennsylvania,
      and Waltham, MA is significantly further east than Youngwood, PA, the location
      02452, MA is indeed east of 15690, PA.
