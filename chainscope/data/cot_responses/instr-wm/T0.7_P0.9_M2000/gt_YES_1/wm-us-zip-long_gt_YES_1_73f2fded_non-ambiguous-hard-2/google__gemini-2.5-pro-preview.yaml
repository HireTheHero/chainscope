      \ the location of 90043, CA:** A quick search shows this zip code is in Los\
      \ Angeles, California.\n2.  **Identify the location of 97331, OR:** A quick\
      \ search shows this zip code is in Corvallis, Oregon.\n3.  **Compare their geographical\
      \ positions:**\n    *   Los Angeles, CA is in Southern California, relatively\
      \ close to the Pacific coast.\n    *   Corvallis, OR is in the Willamette Valley\
      \ in Oregon, also relatively close to the Pacific coast but further north.\n\
      \    *   If you visualize a map of the US West Coast, Los Angeles is generally\
      \ to the east of a line drawn straight north from many parts of coastal Oregon,\
      \ and specifically, it is east of Corvallis.\n    *   To be more precise:\n\
      \        *   Los Angeles longitude is approximately 118.3\xB0 W.\n        *\
      \   Corvallis longitude is approximately 123.2\xB0 W.\n    *   Since longitude\
      \ values become less negative (or more positive if you consider East as positive)\
      \ as you move east, -118.3\xB0 W is east of -123.2\xB0 W.\n\nTherefore, 90043,\
      \ CA (Los Angeles) is located east of 97331, OR (Corvallis).\n\nYES"
