      in the northeastern United States. South Carolina (SC) is a state in the southeastern
      United States. Geographically, the Northeast is generally to the north and east

      \  33990 is Cape Coral, FL.\n\n5.  **Find the Latitudes and Longitudes (Approximate):**\
      \ We need geographical coordinates for these locations. Zip codes correspond\
      \ to areas, so we'll find representative coordinates (like the center of the\
      \ zip code area or a prominent point within it). A quick search or mapping tool\

      \ W (or just 81.94 West)\n\n7.  **Interpret the Longitudes for East/West:**\n\
      \    *   Locations further *east* have longitudes closer to 0\xB0 (the Prime\
      \ Meridian, which is in Greenwich, England).\n    *   In the Western Hemisphere\
      \ (where the US is), longitudes are negative or denoted with 'W'. A longitude\

      \ of -81.94 West.\n\n8.  **Formulate the Answer:** Greenwood Lake, NY (10927)\
      \ has a longitude of approximately -74.30\xB0 W. Cape Coral, FL (33990) has\

      \ 33990.\n\n9.  **State the Final YES/NO Answer:** Based on the comparison,\
      \ the statement is true.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation: The longitude of 10927,\
      \ NY (~74.30\xB0 W) is less west (or more east) than the longitude of 33990,\
      \ FL (~81.94\xB0 W). Therefore, 10927, NY is located east of 33990, FL.\n\n\

      \ eastern coastline of the US. Florida is a peninsula jutting south. New York\
      \ is further up the coast.\n5.  **Determine the general longitudinal positions:**\
      \ While specific zip code coordinates are not given, we know the states' general\
      \ positions. Florida is generally located further west than the most eastern\
      \ parts of New York, and its coastline sweeps westward as it goes south. New\

      asks about the relative location of a place associated with zip code 10927,
      NY and a place associated with zip code 33990, FL.

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** New York (NY) is a state
      in the Northeastern United States. Florida (FL) is a state in the Southeastern
      United States.

      3.  **Compare the general locations:** In general, the Northeastern US is located
      to the north and east of the Southeastern US. More specifically, Florida is
      directly south of states like Georgia and Alabama, while New York is north of
      Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

      4.  **Consider longitude:** Longitude measures east-west position. States further
      east have higher (less negative) or positive longitudinal values, depending
      on the reference meridian (usually Greenwich). The US is west of the Prime Meridian,
      so longitudes are negative. Eastern states are less negative (closer to 0) than
      western states.

      5.  **Compare the longitudes:** New York is generally further east (less negative
      longitude) than Florida, which is further west (more negative longitude) along
      the Atlantic coast, especially the western part of Florida where 33990 is located.

      6.  **Confirm specific locations (optional but helpful):** 10927 is Haverstraw,
      NY. 33990 is Cape Coral, FL. Haverstraw is on the Hudson River, significantly
      east of the center of the US. Cape Coral is on the Gulf Coast of Florida, significantly
      west of the Atlantic coast of Florida and therefore further west than Haverstraw,
      NY.

      7.  **Conclusion:** Since New York is generally east of Florida, and specifically

      and Virginia. Virginia is located directly to the north of North Carolina.


      Step 3: Recognize that zip codes do not directly correspond to a simple linear
      west-to-east sequence across states. Zip codes are assigned based on geographical
      areas, often following postal routes and population centers. To determine if
      one is east of the other, we need to consider the actual locations of these
      specific zip codes within their respective states.


      Step 4: Determine the approximate location of 28457, NC. A quick search reveals
      that 28457 corresponds to the town of Ocean Isle Beach, NC. Ocean Isle Beach
      is located on the coast of North Carolina, in the southeastern part of the state.


      Step 5: Determine the approximate location of 24354, VA. A quick search reveals

      2.  **Determine the rough geographical relationship:** Virginia is directly
      north of North Carolina.

      3.  **Consider the zip code structure:** US zip codes are generally assigned
      geographically. Lower first digits are typically in the east, and higher first
      digits move westward. The first digit of a zip code often indicates a general
      region or group of states.

      4.  **Compare the first digits:** 28457 starts with 2, and 24354 starts with
      2. This suggests they are in the same general geographic region (Southeastern

      5.  **Refine the location based on the states:** Since VA is north of NC, a
      zip code in NC (like 28457) must be *south* of a zip code in VA (like 24354),
      assuming they are in roughly the same east-west band within their respective
      states.

      6.  **Visualize/Confirm:** Imagine a map. North Carolina is south of Virginia.
      If you pick a point in NC and a point in VA, the NC point will be south of the
      VA point. Whether the NC point is east or west of the VA point depends on their
      specific longitudes.

      is about zip codes in North Carolina (NC) and Virginia (VA).

      2.  **Locate the states geographically:** Virginia is north of North Carolina.

      3.  **Consider the general trend of zip codes:** In the US, zip codes generally
      increase as you move south and west.

      4.  **Compare the zip code numbers:** 28457 is a higher number than 24354.

      5.  **Relate zip code numbers to location within the states:** Higher zip codes
      within the southern region (where NC and VA are located) tend to be further
      south and/or west compared to lower numbers within the same general area or
      region.

      6.  **Synthesize the information:** Since North Carolina is south of Virginia,
      a zip code in NC is likely to be south of a zip code in VA. The higher zip code
      number (28457) in the more southern state (NC) further supports that it is likely
      located south and potentially west of the lower zip code number (24354) in the
      more northern state (VA).

      7.  **Address the specific question (east vs. west):** While the zip codes generally
      indicate north/south and potentially east/west trends, the higher number in
      the southern state doesn''t guarantee it''s *east* of the lower number in the
      northern state. However, consider the general progression. Zip codes in the
      eastern US start lower and increase as you go west and south. A higher number
      in a state south of another state suggests a position potentially south and
      *west* or at least not significantly east of the lower number in the state to
      the north.

      8.  **Refine the east/west comparison:** To be east of something, you must be
      further east geographically. Given that NC is primarily south of VA, and the
      zip code in NC (higher number) is likely further south and potentially west
      along the numerical progression, it is highly improbable that it is located
      *east* of the zip code in VA (lower number). The numerical progression strongly
      suggests the NC zip code is south and likely west or at a similar longitude
      as the VA zip code.

      a standard map of the US.


      3.  **Determine the general locations of the states:** Florida is on the southeastern
      coast of the US. Texas is in the south-central US. Looking at a map, Florida
      is clearly to the east of Texas.


      4.  **Consider exceptions (though not needed here):** While it''s possible for
      specific points within large states to deviate from the general state relationship
      (e.g., the westernmost point of Florida vs. the easternmost point of Texas),
      the vast majority of Florida is significantly east of the vast majority of Texas.
      The specific zip codes likely represent locations well within the typical boundaries
      of their respective states.


      5.  **Conclusion based on state locations:** Since Florida as a state is located
      east of Texas as a state, a location within Florida (represented by 33703) will
      be located east of a location within Texas (represented by 75150).

      longitudes.

      5.  **Approximate locations:** 18951 is Doylestown, PA. 42431 is Madisonville,
      KY.

      6.  **Compare longitudes:** Doylestown, PA is around 75.1 degrees West longitude.
      Madisonville, KY is around 87.5 degrees West longitude.

      7.  **Conclusion:** A smaller West longitude number means further east. 75.1
      is less than 87.5. Therefore, Doylestown, PA (18951) is located east of Madisonville,
      KY (42431).

      \  The question asks if zip code 90650 (CA) is located east of zip code 97229\
      \ (OR).\n2.  To determine east/west position, we need to compare the longitudes\
      \ of the two locations.\n3.  Find the approximate longitude for 90650, CA. This\
      \ zip code is in the Whittier area, near Los Angeles. Its approximate longitude\
      \ is around -118.03\xB0.\n4.  Find the approximate longitude for 97229, OR.\
      \ This zip code is in the Beaverton/Portland area. Its approximate longitude\

      \ and -122.88\xB0 (for 97229).\n6.  On a number line, -118.03 is to the right\
      \ of -122.88.\n7.  Since we are dealing with west longitudes (negative values),\
      \ a longitude value that is closer to zero (less negative) represents a location\
      \ further east.\n8.  Therefore, -118.03\xB0 is further east than -122.88\xB0\
      .\n9.  This means 90650, CA is located east of 97229, OR.\n\nYES"

      3.  **Compare the general locations geographically:** The northeastern US is
      generally located to the east and *north* of the southeastern US.

      4.  **Focus on East/West:** While Massachusetts is north of Georgia, its *eastern*
      location relative to Georgia is the key factor. The entire state of Massachusetts
      is located significantly east of the entire state of Georgia.

      5.  **Apply to the specific zip codes:** Since the states themselves have this
      clear East-West relationship, any location within Massachusetts (like 01430)
      will be east of any location within Georgia (like 31636).

    c5b8122c-6c6a-48ef-9bb9-241a6845ee95: '1.  **Identify the locations:** The question
      asks about the relative position of two locations based on their zip codes:
      01430, MA and 31636, GA.

      2.  **Determine the states:** 01430 is in Massachusetts (MA). 31636 is in Georgia
      (GA).

      3.  **Compare the general locations of the states:** Massachusetts is a state
      in the northeastern United States. Georgia is a state in the southeastern United
      States.

      4.  **Reason about relative longitude:** States in the Northeast are generally
      located further east than states in the Southeast, although there is some overlap
      in longitude. However, the question is specifically about *east* vs. *west*.
      To be definitively "east of" another location, the eastern location must have
      a greater longitude (closer to 0 degrees or positive values when measured from
      the Prime Meridian, or less negative values when measured from the Anti-Meridian).

      5.  **Consider the specific areas within the states:** While state generalizations
      are helpful, specific locations within states can vary. However, given the significant
      geographical separation between the Northeast and Southeast, and the general
      west-to-east progression across the US (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), it''s
      highly probable that a location in Massachusetts will be east of a location
      in Georgia.

      6.  **Confirm with geographical knowledge:** Massachusetts is significantly
      further east than Georgia. Boston, MA is approximately at -71 degrees longitude.
      Atlanta, GA is approximately at -84 degrees longitude. A location at -71 degrees
      is east of a location at -84 degrees.

      7.  **Apply to the specific zip codes:** While the exact longitudes of 01430
      and 31636 would confirm precisely, the general position of MA relative to GA
      makes it overwhelmingly likely that any point in MA is east of any point in
      GA.


      Therefore, 01430, MA is located east of 31636, GA.

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** Florida (FL) is in the
      southeastern United States. Minnesota (MN) is in the upper Midwest/north-central
      United States.

      3.  **Consider the typical longitudinal positions of these states:** Florida
      is significantly further east than most of the central and western United States.
      Minnesota is located further west than Florida.

      4.  **Confirm relative longitude:** Florida''s easternmost points are around
      80 degrees West longitude. Minnesota''s easternmost points are around 90 degrees
      West longitude, and it extends much further west. Therefore, Florida is generally
      located east of Minnesota.

      5.  **Relate state position to zip code position:** Since the question asks
      about specific zip codes within these states, and the states themselves have
      a clear east-west relationship, the zip codes within those states will generally
      follow that relationship unless they are extreme outliers near state borders
      (which is not the case here; Pensacola, FL and Rochester, MN are well within
      their respective states).

      6.  **Conclude the relative position of the zip codes:** Since Florida is east

      1.  The question asks about the relative geographic location of two US zip codes:
      44116, OH and 77045, TX. Specifically, it asks if 44116 is located *east* of
      77045.

      2.  To determine the relative east/west position of two points on Earth, we
      need to compare their longitudes. A more eastern location will have a higher
      (less negative) longitude value compared to a more western location.

      3.  I need to find the approximate geographic coordinates (specifically, longitude)
      for each zip code.

      4.  Look up 44116, OH. This zip code is in the Cleveland, Ohio area. Cleveland
      is in the Eastern Time Zone, which is roughly centered around 75 degrees West
      longitude. A quick search confirms that the central longitude for 44116 is approximately
      -81.85 degrees West.

      5.  Look up 77045, TX. This zip code is in the Houston, Texas area. Houston
      is in the Central Time Zone, which is roughly centered around 90 degrees West
      longitude. A quick search confirms that the central longitude for 77045 is approximately
      -95.39 degrees West.

      6.  Now compare the longitudes: -81.85 degrees West (44116) and -95.39 degrees
      West (77045).

      7.  On a number line, -81.85 is to the right of -95.39. In geographic terms,
      this means -81.85 degrees West is *east* of -95.39 degrees West.

      8.  Therefore, 44116, OH is located east of 77045, TX.

      of Texas, a location in Ohio will almost certainly be east of a location in
      Texas based on longitude.

      4.  **Refine based on specific zip codes (optional but confirms the general

      \ of two locations, we need to know their approximate longitude. Longitude lines\
      \ run north-south and measure position east or west of the Prime Meridian (0\xB0\
      \ longitude). Locations further east have higher (more positive) longitude values\
      \ or less negative longitude values (depending on the convention used, but generally,\
      \ for locations in the US, we're dealing with negative longitudes, where less\
      \ negative means further east).\n\n3.  **Find the approximate location of 44116,\
      \ OH:** A quick search or knowledge base lookup reveals that 44116 is a zip\
      \ code in Rocky River, Ohio, a suburb west of Cleveland. Ohio is in the Eastern\
      \ Time Zone (mostly) and is located in the midwestern/eastern part of the US.\
      \ Its longitude is roughly around -81.8 degrees.\n\n4.  **Find the approximate\
      \ location of 77045, TX:** A quick search or knowledge base lookup reveals that\
      \ 77045 is a zip code in Houston, Texas. Texas is in the Central Time Zone (mostly)\
      \ and is located in the southern/south-central part of the US. Its longitude\
      \ is roughly around -95.3 degrees.\n\n5.  **Compare the longitudes:**\n    *\
      \   Ohio location (44116): approximately -81.8\xB0 West longitude.\n    *  \
      \ Texas location (77045): approximately -95.3\xB0 West longitude.\n\n6.  **Interpret\
      \ the comparison:** On a standard map of the Western Hemisphere, locations further\
      \ *east* have longitudes closer to 0\xB0 (or less negative). -81.8 is less negative\
      \ than -95.3. Therefore, -81.8\xB0 is located to the east of -95.3\xB0.\n\n\
      7.  **Formulate the answer based on the comparison:** Since the Ohio zip code\
      \ (44116) is at a longitude of approximately -81.8\xB0 and the Texas zip code\
      \ (77045) is at a longitude of approximately -95.3\xB0, and -81.8\xB0 is east\
      \ of -95.3\xB0, the Ohio location is east of the Texas location.\n\n8.  **Provide\
      \ the final YES/NO answer:** The reasoning confirms that the Ohio zip code is\
      \ east of the Texas zip code.\n\nYES"

      part of the US. Texas (TX) is in the South/South-Central part of the US.

      3.  **Consider the relative east/west positions of the states:** Ohio is generally
      located significantly *east* of Texas.

      4.  **Consider zip codes within states:** While zip codes within a state can
      vary in precise location, the *state* itself provides the primary east/west
      context. It''s highly improbable that a specific zip code in a state as far
      west as Texas would be located east of a specific zip code in a state as far
      east as Ohio.

      \ and their values determine how far east or west a location is from the Prime\
      \ Meridian. A higher longitude value (closer to 0 for positive, or less negative\
      \ for negative) generally indicates a more easterly location within the Western\
      \ Hemisphere (which the US is in).\n\n3.  **Find the location for each zip code:**\

      \ same north-south line. Neither state is significantly *west* of the other\
      \ in a way that would put a location in the northern state (NY) *east* of a\
      \ location in the southern state (VA) on the same coast.\n\n7.  **Refine the\
      \ comparison:** While minor wiggles in the coastline exist, generally speaking,\
      \ locations on the East Coast at similar longitudes will be north/south of each\
      \ other. For a location in New York to be *east* of a location in Virginia,\
      \ Virginia would have to extend significantly further west than New York, or\
      \ New York would have to extend significantly further east than Virginia. This\
      \ is not the case. Both states occupy a similar range of longitudes on the East\
      \ Coast.\n\n8.  **Formulate the conclusion:** Since New York is north of Virginia\
      \ and both are on the same general coastline, a location in New York (like 11239)\
      \ will not be *east* of a location in Virginia (like 22407); it will be roughly\
      \ at the same longitude or slightly west or east depending on the specific points,\
      \ but the primary difference is North/South. For 11239, NY to be *east* of 22407,\
      \ VA, Virginia would have to be significantly further west than New York, which\
      \ is geographically incorrect.\n\n9.  **Final Answer Determination:** Based\
      \ on the geographical relationship between New York and Virginia on the East\
      \ Coast, a location in New York is not typically located *east* of a location\
      \ in Virginia.\n\n10. **Format the output:** Provide the step-by-step thinking\
      \ first, then the final YES/NO answer.\n\n*   Step 1: Identify the locations:\
      \ 11239, NY and 22407, VA.\n*   Step 2: Understand the relative geographic positions\
      \ of the states: New York is north of Virginia, both are on the East Coast.\n\
      *   Step 3: Consider the meaning of \"east of\". For one location to be east\
      \ of another, it must be further towards the eastern side of the map (greater\
      \ longitude).\n*   Step 4: Evaluate the longitudes. Since both states are on\
      \ the East Coast and New York is north of Virginia, they occupy a similar range\
      \ of longitudes. New York does not extend significantly further east than Virginia\
      \ in a way that would place a location there *east* of a location in Virginia.\
      \ In fact, Virginia's western border extends further west than New York's.\n\
      *   Step 5: Conclude the relative position. A location in New York (north) is\
      \ not generally east of a location in Virginia (south) on the East Coast.\n\n\
      Here's the thinking process:\n\n1.  **Identify the locations:** We are comparing\
      \ 11239, NY and 22407, VA.\n2.  **Determine the general geographic relationship\
      \ of the states:** New York is a state in the northeastern US, located north\
      \ of Virginia, which is a state in the southeastern US. Both are located on\
      \ the Atlantic coast.\n3.  **Consider the comparison requested:** The question\
      \ asks if the New York location is *east* of the Virginia location. This refers\
      \ to their relative position along lines of longitude.\n4.  **Evaluate the relative\
      \ longitudes:** Since both states are on the East Coast and New York is predominantly\
      \ north of Virginia, their longitudes are generally similar. New York does not\
      \ extend significantly further east than Virginia. In fact, parts of Virginia\
      \ extend further west than parts of New York.\n5.  **Draw a conclusion:** For\
      \ 11239, NY to be *east* of 22407, VA, the longitude of 11239 would have to\
      \ be greater (further east) than the longitude of 22407. Given the relative\
      \ north-south positions of the states on the East Coast, this is not the case.\
      \ The primary geographical difference between these locations is North-South,\
      \ not East-West in the way the question implies.\n\nNO"

      \ geographical comparison between two locations based on their zip codes: 11239,\
      \ NY and 22407, VA. Specifically, is the NY location *east* of the VA location?\n\
      \n2.  **Recognize the need for geographical context:** Zip codes are not direct\
      \ latitude/longitude coordinates, but they represent a specific geographical\
      \ area. To answer whether one is east of the other, I need to know the approximate\
      \ locations represented by these zip codes.\n\n3.  **Determine the location\
      \ of 11239, NY:** I know 112xx zip codes are generally in Brooklyn, New York\
      \ City. I can quickly confirm that 11239 is specifically in the East New York\
      \ neighborhood of Brooklyn. New York City is located on the East Coast of the\
      \ United States.\n\n4.  **Determine the location of 22407, VA:** I know 224xx\
      \ zip codes are in Virginia. A quick check reveals that 22407 is in the Fredericksburg\
      \ area of Virginia. Fredericksburg is located in Northern Virginia, south of\
      \ Washington D.C.\n\n5.  **Compare the locations geographically:**\n    *  \
      \ New York City (Brooklyn) is on the East Coast, roughly at a latitude similar\
      \ to northern Virginia, but significantly further north than most of Virginia.\n\
      \    *   Fredericksburg, VA, is inland from the coast compared to New York City.\n\
      \    *   When comparing locations at roughly similar latitudes in the eastern\
      \ US, moving south generally means moving slightly *west* relative to the coastline,\
      \ which curves westward as you go south from New England down to the Mid-Atlantic.\n\
      \    *   More importantly, consider the relative positions: New York City is\
      \ located north *and* east of Fredericksburg, VA. Fredericksburg is located\
      \ south *and* west of New York City.\n\n6.  **Formulate the comparison for \"\
      east of\":** To say \"A is east of B\" means that if you were to draw a line\
      \ of longitude through B, A would be located to the right (east) of that line.\
      \ Since New York City is located significantly further east along the coastline\
      \ and further north than Fredericksburg, it is clearly located east of Fredericksburg.\n\
      \n7.  **Final check:** New York City is further east than Fredericksburg, Virginia.\
      \ Therefore, 11239, NY is located east of 22407, VA.\n\n8.  **Formulate the\
      \ YES/NO answer:** Based on the comparison, the statement \"11239, NY is located\

    9ba96767-5136-45de-a32e-0e31599573e3: '1.  **Understand the question:** The question
      asks if a specific Mississippi zip code (39367) is geographically located east
      of a specific Oklahoma zip code (73801).


      2.  **Recognize the information needed:** To answer this, I need the geographical
      location (specifically, the longitude) of each zip code. Zip codes themselves
      don''t directly encode precise longitude, but they correspond to specific areas
      that are located at certain longitudes.


      3.  **Determine the location of 39367, MS:** This zip code is in Shubuta, Mississippi.
      Mississippi is in the southeastern United States. Its longitude is roughly around
      -88 to -91 degrees West.


      4.  **Determine the location of 73801, OK:** This zip code is in Woodward, Oklahoma.
      Oklahoma is in the south-central United States, west of Mississippi. Its longitude
      is roughly around -94 to -103 degrees West.


      5.  **Compare the longitudes:** Locations further east have less negative longitude
      (closer to 0). Mississippi''s longitude (around -88 to -91) is less negative
      than Oklahoma''s longitude (around -94 to -103).


      6.  **Conclusion:** Since Mississippi is located at a less negative longitude

      the answer:


      1.  **Identify the locations:** We are comparing the location of 40175, KY (Kentucky)
      and 64701, MO (Missouri).

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** Kentucky is generally
      considered a state in the Southeastern or East South Central region of the US.
      Missouri is generally considered a state in the Midwest or West North Central
      region.

      3.  **Consider the relative position of these states:** Looking at a map of
      the United States, Kentucky is located to the east of Missouri. Missouri is
      located to the west of Kentucky.

      4.  **Relate the zip codes to the states:** Zip code 40175 is in Kentucky. Zip
      code 64701 is in Missouri.

      5.  **Compare the positions based on the states'' relative locations:** Since
      Kentucky is east of Missouri, any location within Kentucky will generally be
      east of any location within Missouri, assuming a direct east-west comparison.


      Therefore, 40175, KY is located east of 64701, MO.


      The answer is YES.'

      \ or NO answer: Is US zip code 40175 (Kentucky) located geographically east\
      \ of US zip code 64701 (Missouri)?\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Information Needed:**\
      \ To determine if one location is east of another, I need their approximate\
      \ geographical positions, specifically their longitudes. Zip codes correspond\
      \ to geographic areas.\n\n3.  **Strategy:** I need to find the approximate location\
      \ (latitude/longitude) for each zip code and compare their longitudes.\n\n4.\
      \  **Information Gathering (Simulated):** I would use a geographical database\
      \ or mapping tool (like Google Maps, a zip code lookup service with coordinates,\
      \ etc.) to find the locations associated with each zip code.\n\n    *   Look\
      \ up 40175, KY. I find it's near Taylorsville, Kentucky.\n    *   Look up 64701,\
      \ MO. I find it's near Clinton, Missouri.\n\n5.  **Determine Relative Longitudes:**\n\
      \    *   Taylorsville, KY (40175) is located in central Kentucky. Its approximate\
      \ longitude is around 85.3 degrees West.\n    *   Clinton, MO (64701) is located\
      \ in west-central Missouri. Its approximate longitude is around 93.8 degrees\
      \ West.\n\n6.  **Compare Longitudes:**\n    *   85.3 degrees West (Kentucky)\
      \ vs. 93.8 degrees West (Missouri).\n    *   Remember that longitudes West of\
      \ the Prime Meridian (0 degrees) increase as you move *westward*. So, -85.3\
      \ is *greater than* -93.8.\n    *   Alternatively, numerically, 85.3 is *less\
      \ than* 93.8. Locations with *smaller* West longitudes are *east* of locations\
      \ with *larger* West longitudes.\n\n7.  **Formulate the Comparison Result:**\
      \ Since 85.3 degrees West (KY) is less than 93.8 degrees West (MO), the location\
      \ in Kentucky is geographically east of the location in Missouri.\n\n8.  **Check\
      \ Against the Question:** The question asks: Is 40175, KY located east of 64701,\
      \ MO? My comparison shows that yes, it is.\n\n9.  **Final Answer Format:** The\
      \ question requires a YES or NO answer.\n\n10. **Construct the Final Output:**\
      \ State the reasoning steps clearly, then provide the final YES/NO answer.\n\
      \n**(Self-Correction/Refinement):** Ensure the longitude comparison is correct.\
      \ West longitudes are negative numbers if you use a signed system (West is negative,\
      \ East is positive). In that system, -85.3 is indeed greater than -93.8, confirming\
      \ that -85.3 is further east. If using positive numbers for West longitude,\
      \ smaller numbers are further east. 85.3 < 93.8, so 85.3 is east of 93.8. The\
      \ logic holds.\n\nThe final answer should be YES.\n\nHere's the step-by-step\
      \ thinking process:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** Determine if the geographic\
      \ area represented by zip code 40175 (Kentucky) is located east of the geographic\
      \ area represented by zip code 64701 (Missouri).\n2.  **Understand \"East Of\"\
      :** In geography, \"east of\" means having a smaller longitude value (when using\
      \ West longitudes, or a larger longitude value when using East longitudes. Since\
      \ both zip codes are in the US, they have West longitudes. A smaller West longitude\
      \ means further east).\n3.  **Find the Approximate Location of Each Zip Code:**\n\
      \    *   40175 is near Taylorsville, Kentucky. Kentucky is in the Eastern time\
      \ zone for most of the state, which generally corresponds to a more easterly\
      \ longitude than Missouri.\n    *   64701 is near Clinton, Missouri. Missouri\
      \ is in the Central time zone, which generally corresponds to a more westerly\
      \ longitude than Kentucky.\n4.  **Confirm with Longitudes (Simulated Lookup):**\n\
      \    *   Zip code 40175 (Taylorsville, KY) is located around 85.3 degrees West\
      \ longitude.\n    *   Zip code 64701 (Clinton, MO) is located around 93.8 degrees\
      \ West longitude.\n5.  **Compare the Longitudes:** Compare 85.3 degrees West\
      \ and 93.8 degrees West.\n6.  **Determine Relative Position:** Since 85.3 is\
      \ less than 93.8, the location at 85.3 degrees West is east of the location\
      \ at 93.8 degrees West.\n7.  **Apply to the Zip Codes:** 40175 (KY) is at approximately\
      \ 85.3\xB0 W, and 64701 (MO) is at approximately 93.8\xB0 W. Therefore, 40175\

      \ lines run north-south. As you move *west* from the Prime Meridian (0 degrees),\
      \ the longitude values *increase* (in the Western Hemisphere). As you move *east*\
      \ from a given point, the longitude values *decrease* (become less negative\
      \ or closer to 0).\n\n7.  **Apply the comparison:**\n    *   84.4 is a *smaller*\
      \ number than 95.4.\n    *   Since both are West longitudes, a smaller West\
      \ longitude means the location is *further east*.\n    *   Therefore, Atlanta\
      \ (84.4\xB0 W) is located east of Houston (95.4\xB0 W).\n\n8.  **Formulate the\
      \ answer:** The question asks if 30342, GA is east of 77340, TX. Based on the\
      \ longitude comparison, 30342 (Atlanta area) is indeed east of 77340 (Houston\
      \ area).\n\n9.  **State the final YES/NO answer:** The answer is YES.\n\n**Self-Correction/Refinement:**\
      \ Make sure the understanding of longitude is correct. West longitudes increase\
      \ as you move west. So a point with a smaller West longitude number is *east*\
      \ of a point with a larger West longitude number. Yes, 84.4 W is east of 95.4\
      \ W. The logic holds.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:** Step-by-step comparison\
      \ of longitudes clearly shows 30342 (closer to 0\xB0 longitude) is east of 77340\
      \ (further from 0\xB0 longitude in the Western Hemisphere).\n\nStep 1: Identify\
      \ the locations represented by the zip codes.\nStep 2: 30342 is a zip code in\
      \ Georgia (GA).\nStep 3: 77340 is a zip code in Texas (TX).\nStep 4: Determine\
      \ the relative geographic positions of Georgia and Texas within the United States.\
      \ Georgia is in the Southeast, and Texas is in the South-Central region, significantly\
      \ to the west of Georgia.\nStep 5: Locations in Georgia are generally east of\
      \ locations in Texas. To confirm precisely, one would compare longitudes. Georgia's\
      \ longitude is roughly between 81\xB0W and 85\xB0W. Texas's longitude is roughly\
      \ between 94\xB0W and 107\xB0W.\nStep 6: Since smaller West longitude values\
      \ are further east, any location in Georgia (e.g., ~84\xB0W for 30342) will\
      \ be east of any location in Texas (e.g., ~95\xB0W for 77340).\n\nYES"

      2.  **Determine the geographical relationship:** We need to know if the location
      in New York is east of the location in Georgia. This is a question of longitude.

      3.  **Estimate relative longitudes:** New York is located in the northeastern
      US. Georgia is located in the southeastern US. Generally, the further east a
      location is in the US, the higher its longitude number (closer to 0 degrees,
      as longitudes decrease as you go west from the Prime Meridian).

      4.  **Consider the specific states:** New York is significantly further north
      than Georgia. However, the question is about east/west, not north/south. New
      York is generally located further east than most of Georgia.

      5.  **Consider the specific zip codes:** While general state locations are helpful,
      specific zip codes pinpoint locations more precisely. 10918 is Airmont, NY.
      30346 is Atlanta, GA (specifically Chamblee area). Atlanta is located significantly

      \ Locations further *west* are represented by higher numbers of negative longitude\
      \ (or higher numbers of West longitude). Locations further *east* are represented\
      \ by lower numbers of negative longitude (or lower numbers of West longitude).\n\
      \n9.  **Make the Comparison:** 93.2 is a *smaller* number than 96.7 (when considering\
      \ West longitude). This means 93.2\xB0 W is *east* of 96.7\xB0 W.\n\n10. **Formulate\
      \ the Answer:** Since Lakeville, MN (55043) is located at approximately 93.2\xB0\
      \ W and Plano, TX (75025) is located at approximately 96.7\xB0 W, and 93.2\xB0\
      \ W is east of 96.7\xB0 W, 55043, MN is located east of 75025, TX.\n\n11. **Final\
      \ Check:** Does this make sense intuitively? Minnesota is generally north and\
      \ east compared to Texas. Yes, this seems consistent.\n\n12. **Provide the Final\
      \ YES/NO:** The question asks \"Is 55043, MN located east of 75025, TX?\". Based\
      \ on the longitude comparison, the answer is yes.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\
      1. Identify the two locations by their zip codes and states: 55043, MN and 75025,\
      \ TX.\n2. Determine the geographical location of each zip code. 55043 is in\
      \ Lakeville, MN. 75025 is in Plano, TX.\n3. To compare east/west position, compare\
      \ their longitudes.\n4. Look up or approximate the longitude for each location.\
      \ 55043, MN is around 93.2\xB0 W. 75025, TX is around 96.7\xB0 W.\n5. Compare\
      \ the longitudes: 93.2\xB0 W vs. 96.7\xB0 W.\n6. Recall that lower West longitude\
      \ values are further east.\n7. Since 93.2 is less than 96.7, 93.2\xB0 W is east\
      \ of 96.7\xB0 W.\n8. Therefore, 55043, MN is located east of 75025, TX.\n\n\
      **Final Answer Derivation:** The comparison of longitudes shows that the Minnesota\
      \ location is at a smaller West longitude value than the Texas location, placing\
      \ it geographically east of the Texas location.\n\nYES"

      two locations: 55043, MN and 75025, TX.

      2.  **Determine the geographical relationship:** We need to know if 55043, MN
      is geographically east of 75025, TX.

      3.  **Locate the states:** Minnesota (MN) is in the north-central US. Texas
      (TX) is in the south-central US.

      4.  **Consider their relative positions:** Minnesota is generally north and
      east of Texas. Texas is generally south and west of Minnesota.

      5.  **Confirm the east/west relationship:** Since Texas is generally west of
      Minnesota, a specific location in Minnesota (55043) is likely east of a specific
      location in Texas (75025). To be precise, we''d compare longitudes, but the
      general state positions are sufficient for a quick determination in this case.
      Minnesota is significantly further east than Texas.

      comparing the locations of 55043, MN and 75025, TX.

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** Minnesota (MN) is a northern
      state in the US. Texas (TX) is a southern state in the US.

      3.  **Consider the typical east-west layout of the US:** Generally, as you move
      west across the US, state boundaries shift westward.

      4.  **Visualize the relative positions:** Texas is located significantly further
      south and generally further west than Minnesota. Most of Minnesota is east of
      most of Texas.

      5.  **Focus on the specific zip codes:** While zip codes can be complex, the
      states themselves provide the primary east-west context. It''s highly unlikely
      that a specific point in Texas (especially a zip code like 75025 which is in
      the Dallas area, relatively central/east TX) would be located east of a specific
      point in Minnesota (especially a zip code like 55043 which is near Minneapolis,
      relatively central/east MN).

      6.  **Confirm relative longitude:** Minnesota is located in the Central Time
      Zone and Western Time Zone (briefly). Texas is located in the Central Time Zone
      and Mountain Time Zone (briefly). The dividing line between Central and Mountain
      is further west than most of Minnesota. Therefore, Minnesota is generally at
      a more easterly longitude than Texas.


      Given the relative locations of the states, 55043, MN is located east of 75025,
      TX.


      The answer is YES.'

      3.  **Determine the relative geographical positions of the states:** New Jersey
      is located north of South Carolina on the East Coast of the United States.

      4.  **Consider the east-west orientation:** Since New Jersey is generally north
      of South Carolina, we need to think about their longitudinal positions. While
      states have width, New Jersey is located further north along the same general
      eastern seaboard as South Carolina. To be "east" of something at a similar latitude,
      you''d need to be further towards the Atlantic Ocean. However, New Jersey is
      significantly *north* of South Carolina.

      5.  **Refine the comparison:** When comparing the east-west position of locations
      in different states that are far north-south of each other, the question is
      essentially asking which one is further east *overall*. New Jersey''s coastline
      is generally further east than South Carolina''s coastline at its latitude.

      6.  **Conclusion:** Since New Jersey is located along the coast further north

      85132 is in Arizona (AZ).

      98311 is in Washington (WA).


      Step 2: Determine the general geographic location of Arizona within the United
      States. Arizona is in the southwestern part of the US.


      Step 3: Determine the general geographic location of Washington within the United
      States. Washington is in the northwestern part of the US.


      Step 4: Compare the relative east-west positions of Arizona and Washington.
      Arizona is generally located to the east and south of Washington. Therefore,
      locations in Arizona are typically east of locations in Washington.


      Step 5: Consider if there are any exceptions where a specific point in Arizona
      might be west of a specific point in Washington. While the states themselves
      have differing west-east extents, the vast majority of Arizona is east of the
      vast majority of Washington. Given the general location of the states, it is

      1.  **Identify the locations:** We are comparing the locations of two zip codes:
      39530 in Mississippi (MS) and 73142 in Oklahoma (OK).

      2.  **Determine the general geographical relationship between MS and OK:** Mississippi
      is located in the southeastern part of the United States. Oklahoma is located
      in the south-central part of the United States.

      3.  **Assess the relative east-west positions:** When comparing the overall
      states, Mississippi is clearly located *east* of Oklahoma.

      4.  **Consider if specific zip code locations Within the states could change
      this:** While the precise locations within each state matter for *very* close
      comparisons, the states of Mississippi and Oklahoma are geographically distinct
      and separated by several other states (like Arkansas and possibly parts of Louisiana
      or Texas depending on the exact point). There is no overlap in their longitude
      ranges that would place a zip code in Oklahoma east of a zip code in Mississippi.

      5.  **Conclusion based on relative state positions:** Since the state of Mississippi

      \    *   Search for \"zip code 28607 NC\".\n    *   Results typically show that\
      \ 28607 is Boone, North Carolina.\n    *   Search for \"Boone North Carolina\

      \  Identify the approximate location for each zip code. 28607 is Boone, NC.\
      \ 49337 is Rockford, MI.\n2.  To determine if one location is east of another,\
      \ compare their longitudes. A location further east will have a less negative\
      \ (or more positive, depending on the convention used, but typically a smaller\
      \ West value) longitude than a location further west.\n3.  Find the approximate\
      \ longitude of Boone, NC (28607). It's around 81.68\xB0 W.\n4.  Find the approximate\

      further east than Ohio. Even the westernmost point of NY (near Lake Erie) is
      roughly at the same longitude as the easternmost point of OH. The given zip
      codes are likely representative of typical locations within their states, or
      at least not extreme outliers that would reverse the general East-West relationship
      between the states. 11768 is in Suffolk County, Long Island, which is very far
      east in NY. 45342 is in Miami County, near Dayton, which is in western Ohio.

      a specific zip code in eastern Ohio be east of a specific zip code in western
      New York? Let''s consider the approximate longitudes. Longitude generally increases
      as you move west.

      4.  **Approximate location of 11768, NY:** 11768 is in Massapequa Park, Long
      Island, NY. Long Island is quite far east in New York. Its longitude is roughly

    5e771fcb-bdee-4eca-b435-b00181e8a962: 'Step 1: Identify the states for each zip
      code.

      90043 is in California (CA).

      97331 is in Oregon (OR).


      Step 2: Understand the general geographical relationship between California
      and Oregon.

      Oregon is located directly north of California.


      Step 3: Determine the general direction of zip code values as you move geographically.

      In the US, zip codes generally increase as you move from east to west *within
      a region*. However, this is not a strict rule, and larger geographical comparisons
      require considering state and regional prefixes. The first digit of a zip code
      often indicates a group of states or a large region, roughly ordered from east
      to west.


      Step 4: Compare the first digits of the zip codes.

      9xxx indicates a region in the western US.

      90xxx is a California zip code.

      97xxx is an Oregon zip code.


      Step 5: Consider the relative positions of California and Oregon within the
      9xxx region.

      While the first digit is the same, the subsequent digits help differentiate
      within the western region. Zip codes in the southwestern part of the 9xxx region
      (primarily California) often start with lower numbers in the 90xxx to 93xxx
      range. Zip codes further north in the 9xxx region (like Oregon and Washington)
      often start with higher numbers in the 97xxx to 99xxx range.


      Step 6: Analyze the specific locations based on the zip codes'' states and general
      geographical knowledge.

      90043 is in Los Angeles, California.

      97331 is in Corvallis, Oregon.

      Corvallis, Oregon is located north of Los Angeles, California.


      Step 7: Determine if Los Angeles, California (represented by 90043) is located
      east of Corvallis, Oregon (represented by 97331).

      Looking at a map, Los Angeles is south and slightly east of Corvallis. However,
      the question asks if 90043 is *east* of 97331. Since Los Angeles is south and
      slightly east of Corvallis, 90043 is not located east of 97331. In fact, 97331
      is generally located north and slightly west of 90043.


      Step 8: Rephrase the question to confirm the answer. The question asks if 90043
      is *east* of 97331. Our analysis shows 90043 is south and slightly east of 97331,
      but the primary directional relationship relevant to the question is that 97331
      is north and slightly west of 90043. Therefore, 90043 is not located east of
      97331.


      Step 9: Consider the possibility of confusion with zip code number order vs.
      geographical order. While zip codes generally increase westwards within a region,
      this doesn''t mean a lower zip code from a southern state will always be east
      of a higher zip code from a northern state in the same region. The geographical
      location is the determining factor here.


      Step 10: Based on the geographical locations of Los Angeles (90043) and Corvallis
      (97331), determine the final answer. Los Angeles is not east of Corvallis.

      \ Longitude decreases as you move east (towards 0\xB0 at the Prime Meridian).\
      \ 118\xB0 West is a smaller number than 123\xB0 West. This means 118\xB0 West\
      \ is *east* of 123\xB0 West.\n\n8.  **Formulate the conclusion based on longitude:**\
      \ Since Los Angeles (90043) is at approximately 118\xB0 W and Corvallis (97331)\
      \ is at approximately 123\xB0 W, 90043 is at a smaller (more eastern) West longitude\

      \ *   Connecticut (CT) is in the northeastern part of the United States. It's\
      \ a New England state, directly east of New York.\n    *   Michigan (MI) is\
      \ in the Great Lakes region of the United States. It's west of states like Ohio\
      \ and Pennsylvania and significantly west of the East Coast states.\n\n5.  **Compare\
      \ the Relative Locations:** Based on the general locations of the states, Connecticut\
      \ is clearly situated further to the east than Michigan.\n\n6.  **Consider Specific\
      \ Zip Code Locations (Refinement - Optional but Good Practice):** While the\
      \ states' relative positions are usually sufficient for a clear east/west comparison\
      \ across such a distance, I can briefly consider if the specific zip codes might\
      \ represent unusual corners of the states that could change the answer.\n  \
      \  *   06379: This is a Connecticut zip code. Even if it's in the westernmost\
      \ part of CT, it's still firmly within the Eastern Time Zone and well east of\
      \ the general location of Michigan. A quick search reveals 06379 is North Franklin,\
      \ CT, which is in the eastern part of the state, reinforcing its eastern location.\n\
      \    *   48219: This is a Michigan zip code. 482xx zip codes are generally associated\
      \ with the Detroit area. Detroit is in southeastern Michigan. Michigan is primarily\
      \ in the Eastern Time Zone, but its western portion is in the Central Time Zone.\
      \ Even Detroit, in the eastern part of the state, is much further west than\
      \ any part of Connecticut.\n\n7.  **Formulate the Conclusion:** Since Connecticut\
      \ is geographically located significantly east of Michigan, any location within\
      \ Connecticut will be east of any location within Michigan. Therefore, 06379,\
      \ CT is located east of 48219, MI.\n\n8.  **Determine the Final Answer Format:**\
      \ The question requires a YES or NO answer.\n\n9.  **Final Answer:** Based on\

      in a way that makes a simple numerical comparison of the zip code itself useful
      for determining east/west position.

      3.  A more reliable method is to determine the general location of the cities

      state located west of New Jersey and New York.

      3.  **Infer relative longitude:** States further east generally have lower longitudes
      (closer to 0 degrees). States further west generally have higher longitudes
      (more negative if using Western Hemisphere coordinates, or numerically larger
      if using positive values increasing westward from the prime meridian). Since
      Massachusetts is on the Atlantic coast and Pennsylvania is inland to its west,
      Massachusetts is generally east of Pennsylvania.

      4.  **Confirm with specific locations (optional but helpful):** 01908 is Swampscott,

      \ question:\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The question asks about the\
      \ relative east/west location of two specific US zip codes: 49453, MI and 50703,\
      \ IA.\n\n2.  **Identify the key information needed:** To determine if one location\
      \ is east of another, we need their geographical positions, specifically their\
      \ longitude. Zip codes are geographical identifiers, but they don't directly\
      \ give longitude. We need to know where these zip codes are located in their\
      \ respective states.\n\n3.  **Locate the first zip code:** 49453 is in Michigan\
      \ (MI). A quick search reveals that 49453 corresponds to Spring Lake, Michigan.\n\
      \n4.  **Locate the second zip code:** 50703 is in Iowa (IA). A quick search\
      \ reveals that 50703 corresponds to Waterloo, Iowa.\n\n5.  **Determine the relative\
      \ positions of the states:** Michigan is located significantly east of Iowa\
      \ in the United States. Michigan is in the Eastern Time Zone (mostly) and Central\
      \ Time Zone (partially), while Iowa is entirely within the Central Time Zone.\
      \ Historically, locations further east are assigned earlier time zones.\n\n\
      6.  **Compare the specific locations:**\n    *   Spring Lake, MI is on the western\
      \ side of Michigan, near Lake Michigan.\n    *   Waterloo, IA is in eastern\
      \ Iowa.\n\n7.  **Visualize or compare longitudes:** Even though Spring Lake\
      \ is on the *western* edge of Michigan and Waterloo is in *eastern* Iowa, the\
      \ state of Michigan as a whole is much further east than the state of Iowa.\
      \ To confirm, one could look up the approximate longitudes:\n    *   Spring\
      \ Lake, MI: Approximately 86.1\xB0 W\n    *   Waterloo, IA: Approximately 92.3\xB0\
      \ W\n\n8.  **Analyze the longitude comparison:** A smaller negative longitude\
      \ value (or a larger positive value in the Eastern Hemisphere) means a location\
      \ is further east. In the Western Hemisphere where the US is located, a smaller\
      \ *absolute* longitude value (e.g., 86\xB0 W is smaller than 92\xB0 W) means\
      \ the location is further east. Since 86.1\xB0 W is less than 92.3\xB0 W, Spring\
      \ Lake, MI is located east of Waterloo, IA.\n\n9.  **Formulate the final answer:**\

      \ located east of 50703 (Waterloo, IA).\n\n10. **State the YES/NO answer:**\
      \ The answer is YES.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking:**\n1. Identify the locations\
      \ corresponding to the zip codes 49453, MI and 50703, IA.\n2. 49453 is Spring\
      \ Lake, Michigan.\n3. 50703 is Waterloo, Iowa.\n4. Compare the geographical\
      \ positions of Spring Lake, MI and Waterloo, IA.\n5. Michigan is located significantly\
      \ east of Iowa.\n6. Spring Lake, MI is on the west side of Michigan, and Waterloo,\
      \ IA is in eastern Iowa.\n7. Despite their relative positions *within* their\

      \   *   Location 2: 73701, OK (Oklahoma)\n\n3.  **Determine East-West Position:**\
      \ Zip codes themselves don't directly encode longitude. The most reliable way\
      \ to determine the relative east-west position of two places is to know their\
      \ states and their general geographic location within the US.\n\n4.  **Locate\
      \ the States:**\n    *   Indiana (IN) is a state in the Midwestern United States.\
      \ It's generally considered part of the East North Central region or the Great\
      \ Lakes region.\n    *   Oklahoma (OK) is a state in the South Central region\
      \ of the United States. It's often considered part of the Great Plains or Southwest.\n\
      \n5.  **Compare the States' General Positions:**\n    *   Mentally picture a\
      \ map of the United States.\n    *   Oklahoma is located west of the Mississippi\
      \ River and is generally further west than the core states often associated\
      \ with the Midwest or East.\n    *   Indiana is located east of the Mississippi\
      \ River and is generally further east than the states of the South Central or\
      \ Southwest regions.\n\n6.  **Refine the Comparison:** While the states' general\
      \ positions are a strong indicator, it's good to be sure. Oklahoma is roughly\
      \ centered around 97\xB0 West longitude. Indiana is roughly centered around\
      \ 86\xB0 West longitude. A smaller (more negative) longitude value means further\
      \ east. 86\xB0 W is east of 97\xB0 W.\n\n7.  **Consider Potential Edge Cases\
      \ (and dismiss them quickly):** Could a specific city in western Indiana be\
      \ west of a specific city in eastern Oklahoma? While possible for *very* specific,\
      \ unusual boundaries, the vast majority of Indiana is significantly east of\
      \ the vast majority of Oklahoma. The states' positions are a very strong indicator\
      \ here. Zip codes within a state generally don't drastically alter its fundamental\
      \ east-west position relative to another state far away.\n\n8.  **Formulate\
      \ the Conclusion:** Since Indiana is geographically located significantly east\
      \ of Oklahoma, any location within Indiana (like 47834) will be east of any\
      \ location within Oklahoma (like 73701).\n\n9.  **Final Answer Format:** The\
      \ question requires a simple YES or NO.\n\n10. **Construct the Final Answer:**\
      \ Based on the reasoning, 47834, IN is located east of 73701, OK.\n\nYES"

      \ code for Youngwood, Pennsylvania, which is located east of Pittsburgh, in\
      \ western Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts.\n\n6.  **Compare\
      \ the Locations:**\n    *   Newton, MA (02452) is near Boston, on the Atlantic\
      \ coast.\n    *   Youngwood, PA (15690) is near Pittsburgh, in western Pennsylvania.\n\
      \n7.  **Determine the East-West Relationship:** Locations further east have\
      \ higher (less negative in the Western Hemisphere) longitudes. Since Massachusetts\
      \ is significantly east of Pennsylvania, specifically western Pennsylvania,\
      \ Newton, MA is geographically east of Youngwood, PA.\n\n8.  **Formulate the\
      \ Answer:** Based on the comparison, 02452, MA is indeed located east of 15690,\
      \ PA.\n\n9.  **Provide the YES/NO Answer:** The conclusion is that it *is* located\
      \ east.\n\n10. **Final Check:** Reread the question and my reasoning. Does the\
      \ reasoning directly lead to the YES/NO answer? Yes. Is the location comparison\
      \ accurate? Yes, Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania.\n\nTherefore, the answer\
      \ is YES.\n\nYES"

      \ question:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks if US zip code\
      \ 02452, MA is located *east* of US zip code 15690, PA. The answer must be YES\
      \ or NO.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Information:**\n    *   Zip Code 1: 02452,\
      \ Massachusetts (MA)\n    *   Zip Code 2: 15690, Pennsylvania (PA)\n    *  \
      \ The relationship to determine: Is 02452 east of 15690?\n\n3.  **Recall How\
      \ US Zip Codes Relate to Geography:** US zip codes are generally assigned in\
      \ numerical order from east to west across the country.\n    *   0xxxx - New\
      \ England (Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut)\n\
      \    *   1xxxx - Mid-Atlantic (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware)\n\
      \    *   ... and so on, increasing as you move west.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Zip\
      \ Codes Based on the System:**\n    *   02452 starts with a '0'. This places\
      \ it in the New England region, which is the easternmost region in the contiguous\
      \ US zip code system.\n    *   15690 starts with a '1'. This places it in the\
      \ Mid-Atlantic region.\n\n5.  **Compare the Regions Geographically:** New England\
      \ (where 02452 is) is located geographically *east* of the Mid-Atlantic region\
      \ (where 15690 is).\n\n6.  **Confirm the Specific Locations (Optional but good\
      \ for verification):**\n    *   02452 is Newton, Massachusetts.\n    *   15690\
      \ is West Newton, Pennsylvania (despite the name \"West Newton\", it's still\
      \ in PA, which is west of MA).\n\n7.  **Draw the Conclusion:** Since 02452 (Newton,\
      \ MA) is located in New England (an eastern region) and 15690 (West Newton,\
      \ PA) is located in the Mid-Atlantic (a region west of New England), 02452 *is*\
      \ located east of 15690.\n\n8.  **Formulate the Final Answer:** The question\
      \ asks for a strict YES or NO. Based on the reasoning, the answer is YES.\n\n\
      **Step by step reasoning:**\n1. The US zip code system generally assigns lower\
      \ numbers to areas further east and higher numbers to areas further west.\n\
      2. Zip code 02452 begins with '0', indicating it is in the easternmost region\
      \ (New England).\n3. Zip code 15690 begins with '1', indicating it is in a region\
      \ west of the '0' region (Mid-Atlantic).\n4. Therefore, 02452 is located geographically\
      \ east of 15690.\n\n**YES / NO Answer:**\n\nYES"
