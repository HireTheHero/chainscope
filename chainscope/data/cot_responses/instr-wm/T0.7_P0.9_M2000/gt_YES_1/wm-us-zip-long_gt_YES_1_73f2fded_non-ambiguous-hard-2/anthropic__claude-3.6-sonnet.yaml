      3) To determine if one location is east of another, I need to compare their
      relative positions on a map:

      - Louisiana is east of Texas (these states share a border)

      - Kenner, LA is in the southeastern part of Louisiana

      - Robstown, TX is in the southern part of Texas


      4) Since Louisiana is east of Texas, and the specific locations maintain this
      general east-west relationship, 70065 (Kenner, LA) must be east of 78380 (Robstown,
      TX).


      Answer: YES'
    e3a52460-a138-41de-aeab-4560341745f8: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let me identify these locations:

      - 70065 is in Kenner, Louisiana (LA)

      - 78380 is in Robstown, Texas (TX)


      2) On a map of the United States:

      - Louisiana is located east of Texas

      - These cities maintain this same general east-west relationship


      3) More specifically:

      - Kenner, LA (70065) is in the New Orleans metropolitan area

      - Robstown, TX (78380) is near Corpus Christi

      - When comparing these specific locations, Kenner is indeed east of Robstown


      YES'

      4) Since 85132 starts with 8 and 98311 starts with 9, and numbers increase as

      4) ZIP codes starting with 4 (like 47834) are in the central-eastern region

      5) ZIP codes starting with 7 (like 73701) are in the central-western region


      6) Since 47834 (Indiana) starts with 4 and 73701 (Oklahoma) starts with 7, and
      lower numbers are more eastern, Indiana must be east of Oklahoma.


      7) Looking at a US map confirms that Indiana is indeed east of Oklahoma.
