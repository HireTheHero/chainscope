      Jersey is located east of 34994 in Florida, we need to consider the longitudinal
      positions of these locations.


      1. **Locate 08620, NJ**: This zip code is in Hamilton Township, New Jersey.
      New Jersey is on the East Coast of the United States.


      2. **Locate 34994, FL**: This zip code is in Stuart, Florida. Florida is also
      on the East Coast of the United States.


      3. **Compare longitudinal positions**: Generally, New Jersey is north and slightly
      east of Florida. While both locations are on the East Coast, New Jersey is farther
      east than most parts of Florida.


      Based on these steps, we can conclude that zip code 08620, NJ, is located east
      of 34994, FL.
