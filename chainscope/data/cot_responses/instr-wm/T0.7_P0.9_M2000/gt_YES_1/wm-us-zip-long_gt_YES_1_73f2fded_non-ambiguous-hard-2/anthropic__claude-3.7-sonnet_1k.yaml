      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two zip codes.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) 06438 is a zip code in Connecticut (CT)

      2) 29206 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)

      3) In the United States, locations further east have smaller longitude values

      4) Connecticut is located in the Northeast region of the United States

      5) South Carolina is located in the Southeast region of the United States

      6) When looking at a map of the US, Connecticut is positioned to the east of

      longitudes. In the US, eastern locations have lower longitude values than western
      locations.


      Let me think about where these zip codes might be:

      - 10927 is in New York (NY), which is in the northeastern United States

      - 33990 is in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United States


      New York is generally east of Florida on the US map, despite both being on the
      east coast. Florida extends further south but also further west than New York.


      To be more precise, I would need the exact longitude coordinates of these specific
      zip codes. But generally speaking, New York zip codes are typically east of
      Florida zip codes because New York is positioned more to the east on the Atlantic

      - 10927 is in New York (NY), which is in the northeastern United States.

      - 33990 is in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geography of the East Coast.

      - While both states are on the East Coast, New York is positioned farther northeast.

      - Florida extends southward but also westward as it forms the peninsula that
      separates the Atlantic Ocean from the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes.

      - New York is generally positioned more eastward along the Atlantic coast.

      - Florida, especially its western and southern portions, extends further west
      than New York.


      Step 4: Make a determination based on these geographic positions.

      - New York zip codes are typically east of Florida zip codes because of their
      position on the Atlantic seaboard.

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 11572 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 27604 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)


      In the United States, locations further east have lower longitude values than
      locations further west. So I need to compare the longitudes of these two locations.


      New York is generally on the northeastern coast of the United States, while
      North Carolina is on the southeastern coast. However, I need to be more precise
      about these specific zip codes.


      Zip code 11572 appears to be in the Long Island area of New York, which is quite
      far east in the state.

      Zip code 27604 is likely in the Raleigh area of North Carolina, which is in
      the central part of the state.


      Based on U.S. geography, Long Island, NY (where 11572 is located) is east of
      Raleigh, NC (where 27604 is located). The entire state of New York is generally

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 11572 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 27604 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)


      ## Step 2: Determine specific locations

      - 11572 is in Oceanside, Long Island, New York

      - 27604 is in Raleigh, North Carolina


      ## Step 3: Compare geographic positions

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States

      - On the east coast, locations further north are generally further east

      - Long Island extends eastward into the Atlantic Ocean

      - Raleigh is inland and in the middle of North Carolina


      ## Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on relative positions

      The entire state of New York, especially Long Island, is positioned east of
      North Carolina. When looking at a map of the United States, Long Island clearly
      extends further east than any part of North Carolina.

      To solve this, I should:

      1. Recognize these are zip codes with their respective states (CT = Connecticut,
      OH = Ohio)

      2. Determine the relative positions of Connecticut and Ohio geographically


      The United States is generally arranged with states getting more eastern as
      you move right on a map. Connecticut is a northeastern state, part of New England,
      while Ohio is in the Midwest.


      Connecticut is on the Atlantic coast in the northeast, while Ohio is more inland
      and west of Connecticut. On a west-to-east orientation (going from the Pacific
      toward the Atlantic), we have:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region

      - Connecticut is in the Northeast region, specifically in New England


      So Connecticut is east of Ohio. This means that any location in Connecticut
      (including 06076) would be east of any location in Ohio (including 45371).</think>To

      - 06076 is in Connecticut (CT)

      - 45371 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states

      Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States along the Atlantic
      coast, while Ohio is in the Midwest region of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      On a map of the United States, Connecticut is positioned to the east of Ohio.
      The entire state of Connecticut lies east of the entire state of Ohio.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      Since 06076 is in Connecticut and 45371 is in Ohio, and Connecticut is east
      of Ohio, it follows that 06076, CT is east of 45371, OH.

      NH (New Hampshire) is located east of 21209, MD (Maryland).


      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - New Hampshire (NH) is located in the New England region in the northeastern
      United States

      - Maryland (MD) is located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New Hampshire is further east on the map of the United States compared to
      Maryland

      - New Hampshire is on the Atlantic coast in the Northeast

      - Maryland is also on the Atlantic coast but further south and west of New Hampshire


      So generally speaking, New Hampshire is east of Maryland. This means that zip
      code 03303 in NH would be east of zip code 21209 in MD.</think>To determine
      if 03303, NH is located east of 21209, MD, I need to compare the geographic
      locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 03303 is in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 21209 is in Maryland (MD)


      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of these states on the US map.

      - New Hampshire is located in the northeastern part of the United States, in
      the New England region.

      - Maryland is located in the Mid-Atlantic region, south of New England.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - New Hampshire is positioned along the Atlantic coast in the Northeast.

      - Maryland is also on the eastern seaboard but is situated southwest of New
      Hampshire.

      - When looking at a map, New Hampshire is clearly east of Maryland.


      Since zip code 03303 is in New Hampshire and zip code 21209 is in Maryland,

      1. Determine the relative positions of New Hampshire (NH) and Maryland (MD)

      2. Confirm if this general state-level relationship holds for these specific

      First, let''s consider the states:

      - New Hampshire (NH) is in New England, in the northeastern part of the US

      - 21209 is in Maryland (MD)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      New Hampshire is located in the northeastern United States (New England region),
      while Maryland is in the Mid-Atlantic region. On a map of the United States,
      New Hampshire is positioned to the east of Maryland.

      "tail") reaches further west than much of North Carolina.


      I believe 28457, NC is likely east of 24354, VA, but I''m not completely certain
      without looking up the exact coordinates.</think># Is 28457, NC located east
      of 24354, VA?


      I''ll solve this step by step by determining the geographic locations of these
      zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 28457 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 24354 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)


      ## Step 2: Consider their geographic positions

      - 28457 (NC) is located in central North Carolina, in the Piedmont region

      - 24354 (VA) is located in the southwestern part of Virginia, in the Appalachian
      region


      ## Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      - Virginia is north of North Carolina, but their state borders aren''t aligned
      perfectly east-west

      - The southwestern portion of Virginia (where 24354 is located) extends significantly
      westward

      - Central North Carolina (where 28457 is located) lies to the east of southwestern
      Virginia


      ## Step 4: Conclusion based on longitude

      Based on the geographic arrangement of these regions, 28457 in North Carolina
      is indeed east of 24354 in Virginia.

      First, let me recall what I know about US geography:

      - North Carolina (NC) is a state on the east coast of the US

      - Virginia (VA) is also an east coast state, located north of North Carolina


      Generally, locations in the same region with lower zip codes tend to be in the

      Since I don''t have access to a map or geographic database to look up the exact
      coordinates of these zip codes, I''ll use my knowledge of the general geography

      Virginia is directly north of North Carolina. This means that for locations

      US zip codes generally follow patterns where:

      - Lower numbers tend to be in the eastern US

      - Higher numbers tend to be in the western US


      ## Step 2: Compare the zip codes

      ## Step 3: Analyze the relative positions

      The zip code 24354 (VA) has a lower number than 28457 (NC), suggesting that
      24354 is likely located further east.


      Additionally, while North Carolina is south of Virginia, the western part of
      North Carolina extends further west than much of Virginia, and these zip codes
      follow that pattern.

      The US states are arranged where the East Coast is on the eastern side of the
      country, and as you move west, you eventually reach the West Coast. So I need
      to determine the relative positions of Virginia and Mississippi.


      Virginia (VA) is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      Mississippi (MS) is located in the southern part of the United States, bordering
      the Gulf of Mexico.


      Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Virginia is on the East Coast

      - Mississippi is more inland and west of the East Coast states


      Looking at the map of the United States, Virginia is definitely east of Mississippi.
      So, any location in Virginia would be east of any location in Mississippi, regardless
      of the specific zip codes.


      Therefore, 24073, VA is located east of 38611, MS.</think># Is 24073, VA located
      east of 38611, MS?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographical positions
      of these zip codes based on their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 24073 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 38611 is in Mississippi (MS)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Virginia is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Mississippi is located in the southern part of the United States, west of
      Alabama and east of Louisiana and Arkansas


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east basis.

      - Virginia is significantly further east than Mississippi on the U.S. map

      - All locations in Virginia are east of all locations in Mississippi


      Therefore, regardless of the specific locations within these states, any zip
      code in Virginia (including 24073) would be east of any zip code in Mississippi
      (including 38611).

      Second, 38611 is in Mississippi (MS). Mississippi is located in the southern
      United States, along the Mississippi River.


      Geographically, Virginia is east of Mississippi. The entire state of Virginia

      Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while Mississippi
      is in the Deep South, bordering the Mississippi River in the central-southern
      part of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Looking at a US map, Virginia is significantly east of Mississippi. The entire
      state of Virginia lies east of Mississippi.


      Step 4: Make the determination about the specific ZIP codes.

      Since 24073 is in Virginia and 38611 is in Mississippi, and Virginia is east
      of Mississippi, it follows that 24073, VA is east of 38611, MS.

      91748 appears to be in the Los Angeles area of Southern California.

      97527 appears to be in southwestern Oregon.


      Generally, the California-Oregon border runs east-west, with Oregon being north

      However, if 91748 is in the Los Angeles area (Southern California), and 97527

      - 97527 is in Oregon (OR)


      ## Step 2: Determine their specific locations

      - 91748 corresponds to the City of Industry/Rowland Heights area in Los Angeles
      County, in southern California

      - 97527 corresponds to Grants Pass area in southwestern Oregon


      ## Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions

      - The west coast of the United States has a curved shape

      - Southern California (where 91748 is located) is significantly east of southwestern
      Oregon (where 97527 is located)

      - Southwestern Oregon is closer to the Pacific coast and further west than the
      Los Angeles area


      ## Step 4: Make the determination

      Looking at their positions on a map, 91748 in California is indeed located east
      of 97527 in Oregon, despite California generally being south of Oregon.

      the Western Hemisphere) is located east of a location with a larger longitude
      value.


      Step 1: Identify where 91748, CA is located.

      91748 is a zip code in California. Based on my knowledge, this appears to be
      in Southern California, likely in the Los Angeles area or nearby.


      Step 2: Identify where 97527, OR is located.

      97527 is a zip code in Oregon. Oregon is a state north of California on the
      west coast.


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      Generally, most of Oregon is west of the eastern parts of Southern California,
      but I need to be precise about these specific zip codes.


      91748, CA is likely in the inland areas of Southern California.

      97527, OR is somewhere in Oregon, which is typically west of the inland areas
      of Southern California.


      In terms of longitude, locations in Oregon typically have a larger negative

      I''ll solve this by determining the locations and comparing their east-west
      positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 91748 is a ZIP code in the City of Industry/Rowland Heights area in Los Angeles
      County, California

      - 97527 is a ZIP code in Grants Pass, Oregon


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic positioning

      - Oregon is located north of California along the Pacific coast

      - Both states are on the western side of the US

      - Generally, points in Oregon are west of points in Southern California


      ## Step 3: Compare the east-west positions (longitude)

      - Oregon''s position is further west along the Pacific coast

      - Southern California''s inland regions (like the LA area where 91748 is located)
      are positioned to the east of Oregon''s position


      Therefore, 91748, CA is located east of 97527, OR.

      2. Determine the location (especially longitude) of 97527, OR

      3. Compare the longitudes to see which is further east


      91748 is a zip code in California (CA). Specifically, it''s in the Los Angeles
      area, in a city called City of Industry or Rowland Heights.


      97527 is a zip code in Oregon (OR). I believe it''s in Grants Pass or that area
      in southern Oregon.


      In the United States, locations further east have lower longitude numbers. So
      if 91748 CA has a lower longitude than 97527 OR, then 91748 is east of 97527.


      California is generally west of Oregon on the US West Coast. Oregon is north
      of California, but they''re both coastal states on the Pacific. However, since
      California extends quite far east and Oregon extends quite far west, I need
      to look at the specific locations.


      91748 is in the eastern part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, while 97527
      is in southern Oregon.


      Based on my knowledge of US geography, southern Oregon is likely west of the
      Los Angeles area. This would mean that 91748, CA would be east of 97527, OR
      despite California generally being south of Oregon.


      So my assessment is that 91748, CA is likely east of 97527, OR.</think># Determining
      if 91748, CA is east of 97527, OR


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 91748 is a zip code in City of Industry/Rowland Heights area in eastern Los
      Angeles County, California

      - 97527 is a zip code in the Grants Pass area in southern Oregon


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic positions

      - Oregon is north of California on the west coast

      - However, east-west positioning depends on the specific locations within these
      states

      - Southern Oregon (where Grants Pass is) is in the western part of Oregon near
      the coast

      - The eastern Los Angeles area (where 91748 is) is relatively far inland in
      California


      ## Step 3: Compare longitudes

      - The Los Angeles area extends quite far east into California

      - Grants Pass, Oregon is closer to the Pacific coast

      - Despite California being south of Oregon, the eastern Los Angeles area is
      actually east of many parts of Oregon


      ## Conclusion

      YES, zip code 91748 in California is located east of zip code 97527 in Oregon.'

      relative geographic locations of two US zip codes. Specifically, it''s asking
      whether 07070, NJ (New Jersey) is located east of 26041, WV (West Virginia).


      To solve this, I need to consider the geographic locations of New Jersey and
      West Virginia in the United States.


      The United States is laid out such that, generally:

      - East Coast states are on the eastern side

      - West Coast states are on the western side

      - States in between follow a general west-to-east pattern


      New Jersey (NJ) is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      West Virginia (WV) is located inland, to the west of New Jersey.


      Since New Jersey is on the East Coast, and West Virginia is inland to the west
      of the East Coast states, New Jersey would be east of West Virginia.


      Therefore, zip code 07070 in New Jersey would be east of zip code 26041 in West
      Virginia.</think># Is 07070, NJ located east of 26041, WV?


      I need to think about the geographic locations of these zip codes based on their
      states.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1. 07070 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      2. 26041 is in West Virginia (WV)

      3. Looking at the US map, New Jersey is located on the East Coast

      4. West Virginia is an inland state, positioned to the west of New Jersey

      5. Geographically, New Jersey is east of West Virginia


      Since New Jersey is east of West Virginia, zip code 07070 in NJ would be east
      of zip code 26041 in WV.


      YES'

      east of 26041, WV, I need to know the relative geographic positions of these
      two zip codes.


      First, let me identify what states these zip codes are in:

      - 07070 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 26041 is in West Virginia (WV)


      Now, I need to think about the geographic relationship between New Jersey and
      West Virginia. The United States has states arranged roughly from west to east
      as you move from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean.


      West Virginia is an inland state in the Appalachian region, while New Jersey
      is on the Atlantic coast.


      In terms of their positions on the map of the United States, New Jersey is significantly
      east of West Virginia. New Jersey borders the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern
      edge, while West Virginia is several states away from the Atlantic.


      So geographically speaking, any location in New Jersey would generally be east
      of any location in West Virginia.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 07070 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 26041 is in West Virginia (WV)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      New Jersey is located on the Atlantic Coast in the eastern United States, while
      West Virginia is an inland state in the Appalachian region.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      Looking at a US map, New Jersey is positioned significantly east of West Virginia.
      New Jersey borders the Atlantic Ocean, while West Virginia is several states
      inland from the Atlantic Coast.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      Since 07070 is in New Jersey and 26041 is in West Virginia, and New Jersey is
      east of West Virginia, the zip code 07070 must be east of zip code 26041.

      is located east of 26041, WV.


      Step 1: Let me recall what I know about US zip codes and geography.

      - Zip codes in the US are 5-digit numbers assigned to regions.

      - New Jersey (NJ) is a state on the east coast of the United States.

      - West Virginia (WV) is a state inland, west of New Jersey.


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions.

      - New Jersey is east of West Virginia on a map.

      - Any location in New Jersey would be east of any location in West Virginia,
      because the entire state of New Jersey is east of the entire state of West Virginia.


      Step 3: Confirm with the specific zip codes.

      - 07070 is a zip code in New Jersey.

      - 26041 is a zip code in West Virginia.

      - Since New Jersey is east of West Virginia, zip code 07070, NJ is east of zip
      code 26041, WV.


      Therefore, 07070, NJ is located east of 26041, WV.</think>To determine if 07070,
      NJ is located east of 26041, WV, I need to analyze the geographic positions
      of these locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 07070 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 26041 is in West Virginia (WV)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positioning of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United States.

      - West Virginia is an inland state in the Appalachian region.


      Step 3: Determine relative positioning.

      - New Jersey is positioned entirely to the east of West Virginia.

      - The entire state of New Jersey sits east of West Virginia on the map.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 07070 is in New Jersey and 26041 is in West Virginia, the New Jersey
      zip code must be east of the West Virginia zip code.

      First, let me identify where these ZIP codes are located:

      - 07070 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 26041 is in West Virginia (WV)


      Now, in the United States, states that are on the East Coast are generally east
      of states that are inland. New Jersey is on the East Coast, while West Virginia
      is inland.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - New Jersey is on the Atlantic Coast

      - West Virginia is inland, west of states like Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania


      So geographically speaking, New Jersey is east of West Virginia. This means
      that locations in New Jersey, including ZIP code 07070, would generally be east
      of locations in West Virginia, including ZIP code 26041.


      However, to be even more precise, I should consider the specific locations within
      these states. But even without that level of detail, the state-level positioning
      is clear enough to answer this question confidently.</think># Is 07070, NJ located

      - 26041 is in West Virginia (WV)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United States

      - West Virginia is an inland state, positioned to the west of states like Maryland,
      Pennsylvania, and Virginia


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      On a west-to-east geographic orientation:

      - West Virginia is further inland (westward)

      - New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast (eastward)


      Therefore, any location in New Jersey (including 07070) would be east of locations

      - 28403 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)


      To determine which is further east, I''ll think about the general geography
      of the United States:


      1. Connecticut (CT) is located in the northeastern United States

      2. North Carolina (NC) is located in the southeastern United States


      When we consider the east-west positioning, Connecticut is generally located

      So Connecticut is north of North Carolina, but they''re both on the east coast.
      Connecticut is higher up (more northeast) on the east coast than North Carolina

      - 31210 is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Think about the general geography of the US states.

      Virginia is on the east coast of the United States, while Georgia is also on

      Georgia. The eastern parts of Virginia along the Atlantic coast are definitely
      east of Georgia.


      Zip code 22150 is in Springfield, Virginia, which is in the northern Virginia
      area near Washington DC.

      Zip code 31210 is in Macon, Georgia, which is in central Georgia.


      Looking at the geography of the US, northern Virginia (where Springfield is)
      is east of central Georgia (where Macon is).


      So 22150, VA is located east of 31210, GA.</think>I need to determine if the
      Virginia zip code is east of the Georgia zip code by figuring out their relative
      positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 22150 is in Springfield, Virginia (VA)

      - 31210 is in Macon, Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Virginia and Georgia.

      Virginia is on the Atlantic coast in the eastern United States.

      Georgia is also an eastern state, but is positioned southwest of Virginia.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations within these states.

      Springfield, VA (22150) is in northern Virginia, near Washington DC.

      Macon, GA (31210) is located in central Georgia.


      Step 4: Determine east-west positioning.

      Looking at a map of the United States, locations in Virginia are generally east
      of locations in Georgia. Springfield, VA is positioned to the east of Macon,
      GA on the map.


      YES, 22150, VA is located east of 31210, GA.'

      east of 31210, GA, I need to:


      1. Identify where these zip codes are located

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west) on the US map


      Let''s start with identifying the states:

      - 22150 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 31210 is in Georgia (GA)


      In terms of US geography:

      - Virginia is on the east coast of the United States

      - Georgia is also on the east coast, but south of Virginia


      When comparing east/west positions, we need to think about longitude:

      - Eastern locations have higher longitude values

      - Virginia is generally east of Georgia on the US map


      The specific zip codes:

      - 22150 appears to be in the Springfield area of Virginia, which is in the northeastern
      part of the state

      - 31210 appears to be in the Macon area of Georgia, which is in central Georgia


      Geography of the eastern US would indicate that Virginia is generally east of
      Georgia. So it''s likely that a zip code in Virginia would be east of one in
      Georgia, but I should be careful with zip codes near the borders.</think>I need
      to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 22150 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      - 31210 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Virginia is located on the mid-Atlantic coast

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Virginia is positioned to the east and north of Georgia

      - The entire state of Virginia lies east of Georgia on the US map


      Step 4: Specifically for these zip codes:

      - 22150 is in the Springfield area of Virginia (northern VA)

      - 31210 is in the Macon area of Georgia (central GA)


      Since Virginia is entirely east of Georgia on the US map, any location in Virginia
      (including 22150) would be east of any location in Georgia (including 31210).

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 22150 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 31210 is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while Georgia

      To answer this, I need to know the relative locations of these zip codes. I
      know that Virginia is located on the east coast of the United States, while
      Georgia is also on the east coast but further south. In terms of east-west positioning,
      Virginia is generally east of Georgia.


      Virginia is in the Mid-Atlantic region, while Georgia is in the Southeast. Looking

      - Virginia is on the east coast of the US

      - Georgia is also on the east coast but further south and west than Virginia


      Virginia is generally east of Georgia on the US map. So based on the states,
      I would expect 22150, VA to be east of 31210, GA. But let me think about the
      specific zip codes to be certain.


      22150 is in Springfield, Virginia, which is in the northern part of Virginia,
      near Washington DC.

      31210 is in Macon, Georgia, which is in central Georgia.

      - 22150 is a zip code in Springfield, Virginia (VA)

      - 31210 is a zip code in Macon, Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Virginia and Georgia.

      - Virginia is located on the mid-Atlantic east coast

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, but is west of Virginia


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Virginia is positioned to the northeast of Georgia on the US map. When comparing
      locations on the east coast, those further north tend to also be further east
      due to the curvature of the coastline.


      Step 4: Verify the specific zip codes.

      Springfield, VA (22150) is in northern Virginia near Washington DC, while Macon,

      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - North Dakota is in the northern central part of the US

      - Texas is in the southern part of the US


      Texas is generally southeast of North Dakota. So 77362, TX is likely to be east
      of 58501, ND.


      For more precision, I would need the exact longitude coordinates of these zip
      codes, but based on the general geographic positions of Texas (especially eastern
      Texas where many 7xxxx zip codes are located) relative to North Dakota, 77362,
      TX is almost certainly east of 58501, ND.</think># Reasoning Step by Step


      To determine whether 77362, TX is east of 58501, ND, I need to consider the
      geographic positions of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Understand the geographic position of the states.

      - North Dakota (ND) is in the northern central part of the United States.

      - Texas (TX) is in the south-central United States.


      Step 2: Consider the zip code patterns.

      - ZIP codes generally increase from east to west in the United States.

      - The 5xxxx series (like 58501) covers central northern states.

      - The 7xxxx series (like 77362) covers parts of Texas and other southern states.


      Step 3: Determine the specific locations.

      - 77362 appears to be in eastern Texas.

      - 58501 is in central North Dakota (Bismarck area).


      Step 4: Compare longitudes.

      - Eastern Texas is located east of central North Dakota on a map of the United
      States.

      77362 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      58501 is a zip code in North Dakota (ND)


      Generally speaking:

      - Texas is in the southern part of the United States

      - North Dakota is in the northern part of the United States


      But the question is about east-west positioning, not north-south.


      In terms of east-west geography:

      - Texas is generally in the south-central part of the United States

      - North Dakota is in the north-central part of the United States


      Looking at a mental map, Texas is slightly east of North Dakota in general.
      But I need to be more specific about these particular zip codes.


      77362 appears to be in eastern Texas (the first digit "7" suggests this is in
      the eastern part of the country)

      58501 appears to be in central North Dakota (the first digit "5" suggests this
      is in the central part of the country)


      Since Texas is already somewhat east of North Dakota, and 77362 is in eastern
      Texas, while 58501 is in central North Dakota, it''s very likely that 77362
      is east of 58501.


      Let me double-check my reasoning: The first digits of zip codes generally increase
      as you go from east to west in the US. So a zip code starting with 7 is generally
      east of a zip code starting with 5. This confirms my answer.</think># Is 77362,
      TX located east of 58501, ND?


      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to understand the general geographic positions of Texas (TX)
      and North Dakota (ND) within the United States.


      2) Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States, while North
      Dakota is in the north-central part.


      3) Looking at US zip code patterns, the first digit generally indicates geographic
      regions, with lower numbers being in the east and higher numbers in the west.


      4) 77362 starts with "7", which corresponds to the south-central region (specifically
      Texas).


      5) 58501 starts with "5", which corresponds to the west north-central region
      (including North Dakota).


      6) On an east-west axis, Texas (especially eastern Texas where 77362 would be
      located) is indeed east of North Dakota (where 58501 is located).


      YES, 77362, TX is located east of 58501, ND.'

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 77362 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      - 58501 is a zip code in North Dakota (ND)


      Now, I need to think about their general positions in the United States:

      - Texas is in the southern part of the United States

      - North Dakota is in the northern part of the United States


      But the question is about east/west positioning, not north/south. In the United
      States:

      - Texas is generally in the south-central part of the country

      - North Dakota is in the upper Midwest, along the Canadian border


      In terms of east/west positioning:

      - North Dakota is fairly far west in the US, though not as far west as states
      like Montana or Washington

      - Texas is also relatively western, though its eastern portions can extend further
      east than North Dakota


      Without exact coordinates, I can use general geographical knowledge. Texas extends
      further east than North Dakota. The easternmost parts of Texas are definitely
      east of the easternmost parts of North Dakota.


      However, I need to be specific about these zip codes. 77362 appears to be in
      the eastern part of Texas (as TX zip codes in the 77000s are typically in the
      eastern region near Houston). 58501 is likely in central North Dakota.


      Given that Texas overall is south and east of North Dakota, and 77362 is in
      eastern Texas, it''s highly likely that 77362, TX is east of 58501, ND.</think>#

      Houston area)

      - The 58xxx zip codes are typically in central North Dakota (around Bismarck)


      Step 4: Compare longitudes.

      - Eastern Texas is significantly further east than central North Dakota

      - The Houston area (where 77362 is located) lies east of the entire state of
      North Dakota


      YES, 77362, TX is located east of 58501, ND.'

      The two zip codes are:

      1. 61611, IL (Illinois)

      2. 76210, TX (Texas)


      The question is: Is 61611, IL located east of 76210, TX?


      To answer this, I need to think about the relative geographic positions of Illinois
      and Texas in the United States.


      The United States is organized such that, generally speaking:

      - Eastern states are closer to the Atlantic Ocean

      - Western states are closer to the Pacific Ocean


      Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States.

      Texas is located in the South/Southwest region of the United States.


      Geographically, Illinois is positioned east of Texas. On a map of the United
      States, Illinois is to the right (east) of Texas.


      Therefore, a zip code in Illinois (61611) would be east of a zip code in Texas
      (76210).</think># Is 61611, IL located east of 76210, TX?

      is in Texas (TX).


      2) Next, I need to consider the geographic positions of these states. In the
      United States, Illinois is located in the Midwest region, while Texas is in
      the South/Southwest region.


      3) When looking at a map of the United States, Illinois is positioned to the
      east (right) of Texas. The entire state of Illinois lies east of Texas.


      4) Therefore, any location in Illinois, including zip code 61611, would be east
      of any location in Texas, including zip code 76210.

      I need to determine if the zip code 30575 in Georgia (GA) is located east of
      the zip code 68147 in Nebraska (NE).


      First, I need to recall the relative positions of these states in the US:

      - Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Nebraska (NE) is located in the midwestern United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Georgia is on the eastern side of the United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean

      - Nebraska is in the middle of the country, much further west than Georgia


      Since the question is asking about zip codes specifically, I should note that
      zip codes within each state will be in the same general region as the state
      itself. While there might be variation within a state, the difference between
      states that are far apart (like GA and NE) will be much greater than any variation
      within states.


      Therefore, any zip code in Georgia (including 30575) would be east of any zip
      code in Nebraska (including 68147) because Georgia as a whole is east of Nebraska.</think>#
      Is 30575, GA located east of 68147, NE?


      I''ll solve this step by step by comparing the geographic locations of these
      zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 30575 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 68147 is in Nebraska (NE)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean

      - Nebraska is located in the central/midwestern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Georgia is positioned along the eastern seaboard of the US

      - Nebraska is positioned in the middle of the country

      - All of Georgia is east of all of Nebraska on the map


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 30575 is in Georgia and 68147 is in Nebraska, and Georgia is entirely
      east of Nebraska, the zip code 30575 must be east of 68147.

      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - Georgia (GA) is on the east coast of the United States, in the southeastern
      region.

      - Nebraska (NE) is in the central part of the United States, in the Midwest.


      Generally speaking, states on the east coast are east of the central states.
      So Georgia is east of Nebraska on a map of the United States.


      Given that 30575 is in Georgia and 68147 is in Nebraska, and Georgia is east

      - 30575 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 68147 is in Nebraska (NE)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states in the United States.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern part of the United States

      - Nebraska is located in the central part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Georgia is on the east coast region of the US

      - Nebraska is much farther west in the central plains


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Georgia is in the eastern part of the country and Nebraska is in the central
      part, any location in Georgia would be east of any location in Nebraska.

      - 30575 is a zip code in Georgia (GA), which is in the southeastern United States

      - 68147 is a zip code in Nebraska (NE), which is in the central United States


      Looking at a US map, Georgia is definitely located east of Nebraska. Georgia

      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, along the Atlantic coast.

      Nebraska is located in the central United States, in the Great Plains region.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      States on the East Coast (like Georgia) are east of central states (like Nebraska).


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on the states'' positions.

      Since Georgia is east of Nebraska, zip code 30575 in GA is east of zip code
      68147 in NE.

      To answer this question, I need to know the relative positions of these states.
      In the United States:

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern part of the country

      - Nebraska is located in the midwestern part of the country


      Geographically, Georgia is east of Nebraska. Georgia is on the Atlantic coast
      in the southeast, while Nebraska is in the middle of the country, far from the
      Atlantic coast.

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 30575 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 68147 is in Nebraska (NE)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these states

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic

      - Nebraska is located in the midwestern United States, far from the east coast


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east basis

      - The United States generally runs from west to east, with the Pacific coast
      on the west and the Atlantic coast on the east

      - Nebraska is positioned in the middle of the country

      - Georgia is positioned on the eastern side of the country


      Since Georgia is significantly east of Nebraska on the US map, any location

      (Georgia) is located east of 68147, NE (Nebraska). To solve this, I''ll determine
      the relative positions of Georgia and Nebraska in the United States.


      The United States has states spread from the east coast to the west coast. Georgia
      is a state located in the southeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean. Nebraska is a state located in the Midwestern United States, much further
      inland.


      Looking at the map of the US from west to east:

      - West Coast states (like California, Oregon, Washington)

      - Mountain states (like Colorado, Utah, Idaho)

      - Midwestern states (including Nebraska)

      - Southern and Eastern states (including Georgia)


      Georgia is definitely east of Nebraska. Georgia is on the eastern part of the
      US while Nebraska is more central/midwestern.


      The specific zip codes don''t change this geographic relationship. 30575 is
      in Georgia, and 68147 is in Nebraska. Since Georgia is east of Nebraska, 30575,
      GA is east of 68147, NE.</think>To determine if 30575, GA is east of 68147,

      - 68147 is in Nebraska (NE)


      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of these states on the US map.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean.

      - Nebraska is located in the Midwestern United States, far from the coast and
      more centrally positioned in the country.


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship.

      - States on the eastern side of the US (closer to the Atlantic) are generally
      "east of" states in the Midwest.

      - Georgia is significantly east of Nebraska on any US map.


      Step 4: Conclude about the specific zip codes.

      - Since Georgia is east of Nebraska, any zip code in Georgia (including 30575)

      First, let''s think about the geographical relationship between Arkansas and
      Texas. Arkansas is located to the east of Texas in the United States. So in
      general, locations in Arkansas tend to be east of locations in Texas.


      Now, let''s consider the specific zip codes:

      - 72023 is in Arkansas (AR)

      - 75033 is in Texas (TX)


      ZIP codes in the US generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the
      eastern part of the country and higher numbers are in the western part. However,

      Arkansas is a state that is generally located east of Texas in the United States.
      But I should verify the specific locations of these zip codes.


      72023 is a zip code in Arkansas. Arkansas is positioned east of Texas in the
      US map.

      75033 is a zip code in Texas.


      In the US, locations further east have lower longitude values, and locations
      further west have higher longitude values. So, if the longitude of 72023, AR
      is less than the longitude of 75033, TX, then 72023 is east of 75033.


      Without looking up the exact coordinates, I know that Arkansas is east of Texas,
      so generally speaking, a location in Arkansas should be east of a location in
      Texas. However, since Arkansas borders Texas on the northeast, there could be
      parts of Arkansas that are at the same longitude or even west of some parts
      of Texas, especially if we''re comparing locations in western Arkansas to locations
      in eastern Texas.


      But in this case, 72023 is likely in central or eastern Arkansas, and 75033

      - 72023 is in Arkansas (AR)

      - 75033 is in Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship

      - Arkansas is located to the east of Texas on the US map

      - The states share a border, with Arkansas on Texas''s eastern side


      ## Step 3: Examine the zip code patterns

      - US zip codes generally increase from east to west

      - 72xxx (Arkansas) has a lower number than 75xxx (Texas)

      - This pattern supports that the Arkansas location is east of the Texas location

      - Arkansas is located directly east of Texas

      - The entire state of Arkansas lies east of Texas


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 72023 is in Arkansas, and 75033 is in Texas, the Arkansas zip code must
      be east of the Texas zip code

      (Arkansas) is located east of 75033, TX (Texas).


      To answer this question, I need to think about the relative geographic positions
      of these two zip codes.


      First, let''s consider the states:

      - 72023 is in Arkansas (AR)

      - 75033 is in Texas (TX)


      Geographically, Arkansas is located to the east of Texas in the United States.
      Arkansas borders the eastern part of Texas.


      Now, let''s consider the specific zip codes. Zip codes in the US generally follow
      patterns where codes increase as you move from east to west. However, this isn''t
      a perfect rule for determining the exact location.


      Since I know that Arkansas as a state is east of Texas as a state, and these
      zip codes are in their respective states, it''s very likely that 72023, AR is
      east of 75033, TX.

      Arkansas is located directly to the east of Texas on the US map. Arkansas shares
      its western border with Texas''s eastern border.


      ## Step 3: Verify specific zip code locations

      While zip codes don''t perfectly correlate with west-to-east positioning, these
      particular zip codes are in their respective states. 72023 is in central Arkansas,
      while 75033 is in northeastern Texas.

      Step 1: I know that in general, Arkansas is located east of Texas in the United
      States. Arkansas borders the eastern part of Texas.


      Step 2: ZIP codes in the US often follow some geographical patterns. The first
      digit often indicates a large region, and as we move east, this digit tends
      to increase. However, there are exceptions and the boundaries aren''t perfectly
      aligned with longitude.


      Step 3: For 72023 (AR) and 75033 (TX), the first digits are 7 in both cases,
      indicating they''re in the same general postal region. But the second digit
      (2 vs 5) might give us a clue. Within the same first-digit region, lower second
      digits often indicate areas further east than higher second digits.


      Step 4: Arkansas is east of Texas geographically. Since 72023 is in Arkansas
      and 75033 is in Texas, and we know Arkansas is east of Texas, then 72023 should
      be east of 75033.


      So based on geography, 72023, AR should be east of 75033, TX.</think># Is 72023,

      - 72023 is in Arkansas (AR)

      - 75033 is in Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      - Arkansas is located directly east of Texas on the US map

      - The entire state of Arkansas is east of Texas


      ## Step 3: Apply this geographic knowledge to the zip codes

      - Since 72023 is in Arkansas, and 75033 is in Texas

      - And Arkansas is east of Texas

      - Therefore, 72023 must be east of 75033

      In the US, states that are further east generally have lower zip codes, and
      states that are further west have higher zip codes. But this is not always a
      reliable indicator since zip codes were not assigned strictly by longitude.


      Let me think about where Wyoming and Washington are located geographically:

      - Washington state is on the Pacific coast, in the northwest corner of the continental
      US

      - Wyoming is a landlocked state in the mountain west region, but it is definitely
      east of Washington


      So from a simple geographical perspective, Wyoming (WY) is east of Washington
      (WA).


      To confirm, Washington is bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west, Oregon
      to the south, Idaho to the east, and Canada to the north. Wyoming is bordered
      by Montana to the north, Idaho to the west, Utah and Colorado to the south,
      and Nebraska and South Dakota to the east.


      So Wyoming is definitely east of Washington state. Therefore, zip code 82609,

      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these zip codes by
      looking at their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 82609 is in Wyoming (WY)

      - 99207 is in Washington (WA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Washington state is located on the Pacific coast in the northwestern United
      States.

      - Wyoming is a landlocked state in the western/mountain region of the United

      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Washington is one of the westernmost states in the continental US.

      - Wyoming is located to the east of Washington (with Idaho in between them).


      Since Wyoming is east of Washington state geographically, zip code 82609, WY

      States in the US are generally arranged such that states further east have lower
      zip codes, but there are many exceptions. So I can''t just rely on comparing
      the zip codes directly.


      Instead, I need to think about the geographic positions of Wyoming and Washington:


      1. Washington state is on the West Coast of the United States, bordering the
      Pacific Ocean.

      2. Wyoming is an inland state in the Mountain West region.


      Looking at a US map, Washington is to the west of Wyoming. Therefore, Wyoming
      (and any location in it, including 82609) would be east of Washington (and any
      location in it, including 99207).


      To double check, I can recall that Washington is in the Pacific Northwest region,
      while Wyoming is several states inland. Moving from Washington to Wyoming, you
      would travel eastward.</think># Is 82609, WY located east of 99207, WA?

      1. 82609 is in Wyoming (WY)

      2. 99207 is in Washington (WA)

      3. Washington is located on the Pacific coast in the northwest corner of the
      contiguous United States

      4. Wyoming is an inland state in the western United States, but it lies to the
      east of Washington

      5. On a map of the US, you would need to travel eastward to get from any point
      in Washington to any point in Wyoming


      Since any location in Wyoming (including 82609) is east of any location in Washington

      3. Wyoming (WY) is located east of Washington (WA) in the United States. Washington
      is on the west coast, while Wyoming is more inland and to the east.


      4. Regardless of the exact zip code numbers, any location in Wyoming would be

      First, I need to identify the locations of these zip codes:

      - 99207 is in Washington (WA)


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to consider their relative
      positions on a map of the United States.


      Washington state is on the west coast of the United States, in the Pacific Northwest
      region. It''s one of the westernmost states.


      Wyoming is located in the western United States, but it''s inland and further

      negative numbers or closer to zero).


      Since Wyoming is east of Washington, zip code 82609 in Wyoming would be east

      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states

      - Washington is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Wyoming is an inland state in the western United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions

      Washington is one of the westernmost states in the continental US, bordering
      the Pacific Ocean. Wyoming is located inland and significantly east of Washington.


      Step 4: Make the determination

      Since Wyoming is positioned east of Washington state on the US map, zip code

      2. Wyoming (WY) is in the interior of the country, to the east of Washington


      Just based on the states, Wyoming is east of Washington. But let me think more
      carefully about the specific ZIP codes.


      The first digit of ZIP codes generally indicates a broad geographic region:

      - 8xxxx ZIP codes are typically in the western mountain states

      - 9xxxx ZIP codes are typically west coast states


      Since 82609 starts with 8, it''s in the mountain region, and 99207 starts with
      9, it''s in the west coast region. This confirms that 82609 (WY) would be east
      of 99207 (WA).


      Washington state is bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west, and Wyoming is
      an inland state to the east of Washington (though not directly adjacent - Idaho

      Washington (WA).


      2) Looking at US geography, Washington is located on the west coast of the United
      States.


      3) Wyoming is located in the interior of the country, in the Mountain West region.


      4) When comparing these states'' positions, Washington is west of Wyoming.


      5) The ZIP code numbering system also confirms this: ZIP codes beginning with
      9 (like 99207) are generally assigned to west coast states, while codes beginning
      with 8 (like 82609) are assigned to the Mountain West region.


      6) Since Wyoming is positioned to the east of Washington, any location in Wyoming
      would be east of any location in Washington.

      To answer this, I need to think about the geographic locations of these states
      and their zip codes.


      First, let''s consider the geographic positions of Wyoming and Washington states:

      - Washington state is on the west coast of the United States

      - Wyoming is an inland state, located to the east of Washington


      In terms of general geography:

      - States on the west have lower longitude values (more negative numbers in the
      western hemisphere)

      - States to the east have higher longitude values (less negative numbers in
      the western hemisphere)


      Since Wyoming is east of Washington state, it''s very likely that any zip code
      in Wyoming would be east of any zip code in Washington.


      The specific zip codes don''t change this fundamental geographic relationship.
      So zip code 82609 in Wyoming should be east of zip code 99207 in Washington.


      To verify this with absolute certainty, I would need the precise longitudes
      of these zip codes, but the state-level geography is sufficient for this question.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step by thinking about the geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these zip codes are located.

      - 82609 is in Wyoming (WY)

      - 99207 is in Washington (WA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Washington is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Wyoming is an inland state located to the east of Washington


      Step 3: Apply this knowledge to the specific zip codes.

      - Since Wyoming is entirely east of Washington state, any zip code in Wyoming
      (including 82609) must be east of any zip code in Washington (including 99207)

      - The specific zip codes don''t change this fundamental geographic relationship


      YES, 82609, WY is located east of 99207, WA.'

      is east of 99207, WA (Washington), I need to consider the relative positions
      of these two places on a map of the United States.


      The United States generally follows a pattern where zip codes increase as you
      go from east to west. However, this is not perfectly consistent across all states,
      so I should think about the actual geographic positions of Wyoming and Washington.


      Washington state is located in the Pacific Northwest, at the westernmost part
      of the contiguous United States, bordering the Pacific Ocean.


      Wyoming is located in the Mountain West region, east of Washington state.


      Since Wyoming is east of Washington state, a zip code in Wyoming (82609) would
      be east of a zip code in Washington (99207).


      To double-check, I can think about the longitude. Eastern locations have higher
      longitude values than western locations in the US. Wyoming is definitely at
      a more eastern longitude than Washington.</think>I need to determine the relative
      positions of these two zip codes by looking at their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states for each zip code.

      - 82609 is in Wyoming (WY)

      - 99207 is in Washington (WA)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - Washington is located in the Pacific Northwest, on the west coast of the United
      States.

      - Wyoming is located in the Mountain West region, inland from the coast.


      Step 3: Determine their relative east-west positions.

      - Washington is one of the westernmost states in the continental US.

      - Wyoming is several states east of Washington.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Wyoming is east of Washington state on a US map, zip code 82609 in Wyoming
      would be east of zip code 99207 in Washington.


      YES'

      step by step:


      1) We have two zip codes: 82609, WY (Wyoming) and 99207, WA (Washington)

      2) The question asks if 82609, WY is located east of 99207, WA

      3) I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two locations


      Wyoming (WY) is in the Mountain West region of the United States, while Washington
      (WA) is in the Pacific Northwest region.


      Looking at a US map, Washington state is located on the west coast of the US,
      bordering the Pacific Ocean. Wyoming is inland, to the east of Washington state.


      In terms of the general geography of US states: Washington is west of Wyoming,
      which means Wyoming is east of Washington.


      Since 82609 is in Wyoming, and 99207 is in Washington, the zip code 82609, WY
      would be east of 99207, WA.</think>To determine if 82609, WY is east of 99207,
      WA, I need to identify the locations of these zip codes and compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 82609 is in Wyoming (WY)

      - 99207 is in Washington (WA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Washington is located on the west coast of the United States, while Wyoming
      is located inland in the Mountain West region.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-east axis.

      Washington state is positioned west of Wyoming. On a map of the United States,
      Washington is closer to the Pacific Ocean, and Wyoming is further east.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 82609 is in Wyoming and 99207 is in Washington, the Wyoming zip code must
      be east of the Washington zip code.

      - Texas is in the south-central United States, west of Florida


      In terms of geography, any location in Florida would be east of any location

      - 75150 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Florida is located on the southeastern coast of the United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Florida is entirely east of Texas on the U.S. map

      - All locations in Florida are east of all locations in Texas


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      Since 33703 is in Florida and 75150 is in Texas, and Florida is east of Texas,
      the zip code 33703, FL must be east of 75150, TX.

      10598, NY is located east of zip code 43207, OH.


      To solve this, I''ll need to:

      1. Determine the location of 10598, NY

      2. Determine the location of 43207, OH

      3. Compare their east-west positions (longitudes)


      In the US, lower longitude numbers indicate more western locations, and higher
      longitude numbers indicate more eastern locations.


      Generally speaking, New York (NY) is located in the northeastern United States,
      while Ohio (OH) is in the midwestern United States. Geographically, New York
      is east of Ohio.


      Specifically:

      - 10598 is a zip code in New York state, likely in the eastern part of the state

      - 43207 is a zip code in Ohio state


      Based on the general geography of the United States, New York is east of Ohio.
      Therefore, zip code 10598, NY should be east of zip code 43207, OH.</think>#
      Is 10598, NY located east of 43207, OH?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions

      ## Step 1: Consider the states

      New York (NY) is located on the east coast of the United States, while Ohio
      (OH) is located in the Midwest region.


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic orientation

      Looking at a map of the United States, New York state is positioned entirely
      east of Ohio state. The western border of New York does not extend as far west
      as Ohio, and Ohio does not extend as far east as New York.


      ## Step 3: Apply to specific zip codes

      Since 10598 is in New York and 43207 is in Ohio, and New York is east of Ohio,
      it follows that 10598, NY must be east of 43207, OH.

      44030 in Ohio is located east of zip code 36107 in Alabama.


      To answer this question, I need to consider the general geographic locations
      of Ohio and Alabama in the United States:


      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Northeast region of the United States

      - Alabama is located in the Southeast region of the United States


      When comparing their east-west positions:

      - Ohio is generally located east of Alabama

      - On a map of the United States, Ohio is to the right (east) of Alabama


      Since zip code 44030 is in Ohio and zip code 36107 is in Alabama, and Ohio is
      east of Alabama, I can conclude that zip code 44030 in OH would be east of zip
      code 36107 in AL.</think>To determine if 44030, OH is located east of 36107,
      AL, I need to analyze the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 44030 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 36107 is in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states on the U.S. map.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region

      - Alabama is located in the Southeast region


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Alabama is positioned in the southern part of the eastern United States

      - Ohio is positioned further northeast

      - When looking at a map, Ohio is clearly east of Alabama


      Step 4: Apply this state-level knowledge to the zip codes.

      Since 44030 is in Ohio and 36107 is in Alabama, and Ohio is located east of
      Alabama, zip code 44030 would be east of zip code 36107.

      To solve this, I''ll identify where these locations are, and then determine
      their relative east-west positioning.


      First, let''s think about the states:

      - 44030 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 36107 is in Alabama (AL)


      Geographically speaking, Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, while Alabama
      is in the Southeast. Generally, Ohio is to the northeast of Alabama.


      When specifically considering east-west positioning:

      - Ohio is generally east of Alabama

      - Alabama is bordered by the Gulf of Mexico to the south, Georgia to the east,
      Tennessee to the north, and Mississippi to the west

      - Ohio is bordered by Pennsylvania to the east, Michigan to the north, Indiana
      to the west, and Kentucky to the south


      Since Ohio is east of Alabama in terms of longitude, zip code 44030 in OH would
      generally be east of zip code 36107 in AL.</think>To determine if 44030, OH

      Ohio (OH) is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States,
      while Alabama (AL) is in the Southeast.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positioning.

      On a US map, Ohio is positioned to the northeast of Alabama. When considering
      purely east-west orientation (longitude), Ohio is generally east of Alabama.


      Step 3: Verify specific zip code locations.

      44030 is in Ohio, which means it follows Ohio''s general positioning.

      36107 is in Alabama, which means it follows Alabama''s general positioning.


      Since Ohio is east of Alabama in terms of longitude, and these zip codes are
      within their respective states, 44030 in Ohio is east of 36107 in Alabama.

      First, I need to consider the general locations of Ohio and Alabama within the
      United States:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, bordering Pennsylvania to the east

      First, let''s identify the states:

      - NC is North Carolina

      - OH is Ohio


      In the United States, Ohio is west of North Carolina. North Carolina is on the

      - 28512 is a zip code in North Carolina

      - 44627 is a zip code in Ohio


      Based on general knowledge of US geography, North Carolina is east of Ohio,
      so it''s highly likely that 28512, NC is east of 44627, OH. But to be certain,
      I should consider the specific locations of these zip codes within their respective
      states.


      Given that Ohio is entirely west of North Carolina, and no part of Ohio extends
      east of any part of North Carolina, it''s safe to conclude that any location
      in North Carolina (including 28512) would be east of any location in Ohio (including
      44627).</think># Is 28512, NC located east of 44627, OH?


      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to understand the geographic relationship between North Carolina
      (NC) and Ohio (OH).

      2) Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States.

      3) North Carolina is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      4) When looking at a map of the United States, North Carolina is positioned
      entirely east of Ohio.

      5) Since 28512 is a zip code in North Carolina, and 44627 is a zip code in Ohio,
      their relative positions would follow the same geographic relationship as their
      states.

      6) No part of Ohio extends eastward beyond any part of North Carolina.


      Therefore, 28512, NC is indeed located east of 44627, OH.

      To solve this, I''ll need to:

      - North Carolina is located on the east coast of the United States

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region, inland from the east coast

      - Generally, states on the east coast like North Carolina are east of Midwest
      states like Ohio


      Without looking up the exact coordinates, I can confidently say that any location

      if 28512, NC is east of 44627, OH


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states'' locations

      North Carolina (NC) is located on the Atlantic coast in the eastern United States.

      Ohio (OH) is located inland in the Midwest region.


      ## Step 2: Compare general state positions

      Looking at a US map, the entire state of North Carolina is positioned east of
      Ohio. Even the westernmost part of North Carolina is still east of Ohio.


      ## Step 3: Apply to specific zip codes

      Since 28512 is in North Carolina and 44627 is in Ohio, the geographic relationship

      To answer this, I need to know the relative geographical positions of these
      two locations.


      In the United States, generally:

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is located in the northeastern part of the country

      - Kentucky (KY) is located in the southeastern/central part of the country


      In terms of east-west positioning, Pennsylvania is generally east of Kentucky.

      of a location in KY. But to be more precise, I should consider the specific
      zip codes.


      However, without specific data on the exact longitudes of these zip codes, I
      can rely on the general geographic knowledge that Pennsylvania is east of Kentucky
      on the US map. Pennsylvania''s western border is still generally east of Kentucky''s

      Therefore, it''s very likely that 18951, PA is east of 42431, KY.</think># Is

      1) First, I need to consider the geographic locations of Pennsylvania (PA) and
      Kentucky (KY).


      2) On a map of the United States, Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern
      part of the country, while Kentucky is in the south-central/southeastern region.


      3) In terms of east-west positioning, Pennsylvania is entirely east of Kentucky.
      Pennsylvania borders the Atlantic coast (via Delaware Bay), while Kentucky is

      Let me find the approximate locations of these zip codes:


      1. 18951, PA (Pennsylvania)

      2. 42431, KY (Kentucky)


      In general, Pennsylvania is in the northeastern US while Kentucky is more centrally

      Pennsylvania is generally east of Kentucky on the US map. Pennsylvania borders
      the Atlantic Ocean area (through New Jersey) while Kentucky is more inland.

      Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States, while Kentucky is
      in the east-central part of the country. Generally, Pennsylvania is east of
      Kentucky.


      ## Step 2: Specific zip code locations

      - 18951 is in Pennsylvania (PA), specifically in the eastern part of the state

      - 42431 is in Kentucky (KY), in the western/central part of that state


      ## Step 3: Comparing longitudes

      When comparing locations in the United States, places with more eastern positions
      have higher longitude values (less negative numbers).


      Since Pennsylvania is significantly east of Kentucky on the US map, and these
      specific zip codes don''t contradict the general state positions (both are not

      1. Pennsylvania (PA) is located in the northeastern United States

      2. Kentucky (KY) is located in the east-central/southeastern United States

      3. Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is east of Kentucky

      18951 is a zip code in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is entirely east of Kentucky
      on the US map.

      42431 is a zip code in Kentucky.


      Since Pennsylvania is east of Kentucky on the US map, and these zip codes are

      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States

      - Kentucky is located in the east-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      - On a US map, Pennsylvania is positioned entirely east of Kentucky

      - The entire state of Pennsylvania has a more eastern longitude than the entire
      state of Kentucky


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      - Since 18951 is in Pennsylvania and 42431 is in Kentucky, and Pennsylvania
      is east of Kentucky, zip code 18951 must be east of zip code 42431

      of the country have lower zip codes than states in the western part. But I shouldn''t
      rely solely on that pattern.


      Instead, I need to think about the geographic locations of Pennsylvania and
      Kentucky:


      Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern part of the United States, bordering
      New Jersey and New York to the east.


      Kentucky is located more centrally, to the west of Pennsylvania, roughly in
      the south-central part of the country.


      Geographically, Pennsylvania is definitely east of Kentucky. Any location in

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States, while Kentucky is
      located in the east-central part of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Pennsylvania is positioned to the east of Kentucky on the map of the United
      States. The entire state of Pennsylvania lies east of Kentucky.


      Step 4: Conclude based on state positions.

      Since 18951 is in Pennsylvania and 42431 is in Kentucky, and Pennsylvania is
      east of Kentucky, the zip code 18951, PA must be east of 42431, KY.

      Since the US generally has states arranged from west to east, and Kentucky (KY)
      is west of Pennsylvania (PA), it''s likely that the Pennsylvania zip code is
      east of the Kentucky one.


      But let me be more precise about this. The eastern United States generally has
      states arranged like this, from west to east:

      - Kentucky is in the east-central part of the US

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern part of the US


      Pennsylvania borders the Atlantic Ocean (via the Delaware River to Delaware
      Bay), while Kentucky is inland. Pennsylvania is definitely east of Kentucky

      - While specific zip codes can vary within states, the geographic relationship
      between Pennsylvania and Kentucky remains consistent

      - No matter where in Pennsylvania zip code 18951 is located, it will be east
      of any location in Kentucky

      2. The location of 42431, KY (Kentucky)


      The US is generally organized with states on the east coast being further east
      than states in the middle of the country. Pennsylvania is on the east coast,
      while Kentucky is more inland and to the west.


      Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean via the Delaware River.


      Kentucky is located more centrally, in what''s sometimes called the Upper South
      or Midwest region.


      Geographically, Pennsylvania is east of Kentucky. So any location in Pennsylvania

      Pennsylvania is entirely east of Kentucky on a map of the United States. The
      westernmost point of Pennsylvania is still east of the easternmost point of
      Kentucky.


      Step 3: Confirm specific zip code locations.

      Since all of Pennsylvania is east of all of Kentucky, it follows that any zip
      code in Pennsylvania (including 18951) must be east of any zip code in Kentucky

      48624 is a zip code in Michigan (MI)

      63670 is a zip code in Missouri (MO)


      Let me think about the general geographic layout of these states:

      - Michigan is in the Great Lakes region in the northern United States

      - Missouri is more centrally located in the US


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Michigan is generally east of Missouri

      - Looking at a mental map of the US, Michigan is positioned to the east of Missouri


      To be more precise about these specific zip codes:

      - 48624 appears to be in central/northern Michigan

      - 63670 appears to be in eastern Missouri


      Even without knowing the exact locations, I can be confident that any location

      The US states are arranged such that Louisiana is to the east of Texas. So generally
      speaking, locations in Louisiana are east of locations in Texas. But I should
      confirm this by checking the specific locations.


      Zip code 70065 is in Louisiana (LA).

      Zip code 78380 is in Texas (TX).


      Looking at the geography of the United States:

      1. Texas is in the south-central part of the United States.

      2. Louisiana is located directly to the east of Texas.


      Since 70065 is in Louisiana and 78380 is in Texas, and Louisiana is east of
      Texas, it''s likely that 70065 is east of 78380. However, there could be exceptions
      if these zip codes are in unusual locations within their states (e.g., if 70065
      is in western Louisiana and 78380 is in eastern Texas).

      determine if 70065, LA is located east of 78380, TX, I need to analyze the geographic
      locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 70065 is in Louisiana (LA)

      - 78380 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      - Louisiana is located directly to the east of Texas on the US map.


      Step 3: Check if there are any unusual geographic situations.

      - 70065 is in Kenner, Louisiana, in the eastern part of the state, near New
      Orleans.

      - 78380 is in Robstown, Texas, which is in the southern part of Texas.

      - Even the easternmost parts of Texas are still west of most of Louisiana.


      Step 4: Make a determination based on the relative positions.

      - Since Louisiana is east of Texas, and these particular zip codes don''t present
      any geographic anomalies that would reverse this relationship, 70065 is east
      of 78380.

      Let me break down the steps:


      1. 70065 is in LA (Louisiana)

      2. 78380 is in TX (Texas)


      Geographically, Louisiana is located east of Texas in the United States. The

      Since 70065 is in Louisiana and 78380 is in Texas, and Louisiana is east of
      Texas, it''s likely that 70065 is east of 78380.


      However, I should be careful because zip codes near the border could potentially
      break this general rule. Let me think about this more specifically:

      New Orleans area).

      Zip code 78380 appears to be in the southern part of Texas.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Louisiana is located to the east of Texas on the US map. The states share a
      border, with Texas on the west and Louisiana on the east.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip code locations.

      - 70065 is in Kenner, Louisiana (in the southeastern part of Louisiana)

      - 78380 is in Kingsville, Texas (in the southern part of Texas)


      Step 4: Compare the locations.

      70065 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA). Louisiana is in the southeastern part
      of the United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico.


      78380 is a zip code in Texas (TX). Texas is in the south-central part of the

      70065 appears to be in the southeastern part of Louisiana, likely in the New
      Orleans metropolitan area.

      78380 appears to be in the southern part of Texas, possibly near Corpus Christi.

      78380 is a zip code in Texas (TX)


      In the United States, locations in Louisiana are generally east of locations

      - 78380 is in Texas (TX), specifically in the Kingsville area in southern Texas.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Louisiana and Texas.

      - Louisiana borders Texas on Texas''s eastern side.

      - This means that generally, locations in Louisiana are east of locations in

      solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 11218 is a zip code in Brooklyn, New York (NY)

      - 48069 is a zip code in Pleasant Ridge, Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of New York and Michigan.

      - New York state is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest region, significantly west of New York


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Even the westernmost parts of New York state are generally east of the easternmost
      parts of Michigan

      - Brooklyn, where 11218 is located, is in the eastern part of New York state


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      - All of New York, including Brooklyn (11218), is east of all of Michigan, including
      Pleasant Ridge (48069)

      10973 is a zip code in New York state (NY).

      33901 is a zip code in Florida state (FL).


      In general, New York is located in the northeastern United States, while Florida
      is in the southeastern United States. On a map of the US, New York is positioned
      to the northeast of Florida.


      When we talk about "east" in geography, we''re referring to longitude. Eastern
      locations have higher longitude values (or less negative values if in the western
      hemisphere).


      Without looking up the exact coordinates, I know that:

      - New York is generally east of Florida on the US Atlantic coast

      - The East Coast of the US curves, with Florida extending southward and somewhat
      eastward

      - However, New York is still typically east of Florida


      Let me think about the specific zip codes:

      - 10973 appears to be in southeastern New York

      - 33901 appears to be in southwestern Florida (likely Fort Myers area)


      The eastern part of Florida might be at a similar longitude to parts of New
      York, but 33901 being in southwestern Florida means it''s likely west of 10973
      in New York.


      So 10973, NY should be east of 33901, FL.</think>I need to determine the relative
      positions of these two zip codes by examining their geographical locations.

      - 33901 is a zip code in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - Florida is in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Look more specifically at these zip codes.

      - 10973 is in southeastern New York (in Orange County)

      - 33901 is in southwestern Florida (Fort Myers area)


      Step 4: Compare their east-west positions (longitude).

      - While Florida extends southward, even the easternmost parts of Florida do
      not extend as far east as New York

      - The entire state of New York lies east of the longitude of Fort Myers, Florida


      Step 5: Make the comparison.

      - 10973 NY is positioned farther east on the map than 33901 FL

    a8342cb8-955b-4222-9589-e05b59ea2ea7: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine whether 10973, NY is located east of 33901, FL.


      First, let me identify where these zip codes are located:

      - 10973 is a zip code in New York state (NY)

      - 33901 is a zip code in Florida state (FL)


      In the United States, locations are generally considered "east" or "west" based
      on their longitude coordinates. A location with a smaller longitude value (more
      negative in the Western Hemisphere) is located further east.


      The eastern United States generally has smaller longitude values than the western
      United States. New York is in the northeastern part of the US, while Florida
      is in the southeastern part.


      In general, New York is roughly on the same longitude as Florida or slightly
      east of it, depending on the exact locations. The east coast of the US curves,
      with Florida extending further east in the south.


      Let me think about their approximate positions:

      - New York is in the northeastern US

      - Florida is in the southeastern US, but the state extends quite far to the
      east</think># Is 10973, NY located east of 33901, FL?


      I need to determine the locations of these zip codes and compare their east-west
      positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 10973 corresponds to Slate Hill, New York, in the southeastern part of New
      York state

      - 33901 corresponds to Fort Myers, Florida, on the western Gulf Coast of Florida


      ## Step 2: Consider geographical positions

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - Fort Myers is on Florida''s west coast (Gulf side, not Atlantic side)


      ## Step 3: Compare longitude positions

      - Locations in the eastern United States have smaller (more negative) longitude
      values

      - New York locations are generally further east than western Florida locations

      - Fort Myers (33901) is on Florida''s western side, placing it significantly
      west of southeastern New York


      ## Step 4: Make determination

      - Slate Hill, NY (10973) is positioned well to the east of Fort Myers, FL (33901)


      YES'

      \ in NY are east of the easternmost zip codes in FL\n\n4) Therefore, zip code\
      \ 10973 in NY must be east of zip code 33901 in FL.\n\nYES"

      to determine the relative geographic positions of two zip codes:

      1. 90650, CA (California)

      2. 97229, OR (Oregon)


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to compare their longitudes.
      In the United States, locations further east have lower longitude numbers (since
      longitude decreases as you move eastward across the US).


      Let me recall the general geographic relationship of California and Oregon:

      - Oregon is north of California

      - Both states are on the west coast of the US

      - Oregon is generally in line with or slightly east of California


      Now for the specific zip codes:

      - 90650 is in California and appears to be in the Los Angeles area (based on
      the number pattern of SoCal zip codes)

      - 97229 is in Oregon and appears to be in the Portland area (based on the number
      pattern of OR zip codes)


      Looking at these locations:

      - Portland, OR is in the northwestern part of Oregon

      - Los Angeles area is in the southwestern part of California


      Given that Oregon is north of California, and both locations are relatively
      close to the Pacific coast, 90650 CA would not be east of 97229 OR. In fact,
      90650 is likely slightly west of 97229 because the California coastline tends
      to curve more westward than Oregon''s coastline.


      So my answer is NO, 90650 CA is not east of 97229 OR.</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 90650 is in California (CA)

      - 97229 is in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between California and
      Oregon.

      - Oregon is located north of California

      - Both states are on the west coast of the US


      Step 3: Determine more specific locations.

      - 90650 is in Norwalk, which is in the Los Angeles area in southern California

      - 97229 is in the Portland area in northern Oregon


      Step 4: Compare their east-west positions (longitude).

      - The west coast of the US generally runs north-south

      - Portland, OR (97229) is in northwestern Oregon

      - Norwalk, CA (90650) is in southwestern California

      - The California coastline actually curves eastward as it extends south, meaning
      southern California locations are generally east of locations in Oregon


      Step 5: Make the final determination.

      - 90650 (Norwalk, CA) is indeed east of 97229 (Portland, OR)

    e9ffef5f-46bb-402f-864a-2a95f56a7da1: '<think>To determine if 60137, IL is located
      east of 79331, TX, I need to figure out the geographical locations of these
      two zip codes.


      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - 60137 is a zip code in Illinois (IL)

      - 79331 is a zip code in Texas (TX)


      Now, I need to think about the geographical positions of these states. The United
      States generally has states arranged such that:

      - Eastern states have lower longitude numbers

      - Western states have higher longitude numbers


      Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States, while Texas is in the
      South/Southwest region. Generally, Illinois is east of Texas.


      To be more specific about these zip codes:

      - 60137 is likely in the Chicago metropolitan area of Illinois, in the eastern
      part of the Midwest

      - 79331 is somewhere in Texas, which extends further west than Illinois


      Since Illinois is east of Texas, 60137, IL would be east of 79331, TX. When
      looking at a map of the United States, points in Illinois are always east of
      points in Texas because the entire state of Illinois is east of the entire state
      of Texas.</think># Reasoning Step by Step


      To determine if 60137, IL is located east of 79331, TX, I need to understand
      the geographical relationship between these locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 60137 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 79331 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Texas is located in the South/Southwest region


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Illinois sits entirely east of Texas on the US map

      - The westernmost point of Illinois is still east of the easternmost point of
      Texas


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 60137 is in Illinois and 79331 is in Texas, the geographical relationship
      between the states applies to these zip codes as well.


      # Answer: YES


      60137, IL is located east of 79331, TX.'
    fa9b4ead-cfa9-42c0-872e-fd8ba9bd4b85: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the locations of these two zip codes and then determine which one
      is further east.


      60137 is a zip code in Illinois (IL).

      79331 is a zip code in Texas (TX).


      In the US, longitude decreases as you move east (i.e., eastern locations have
      lower longitude values than western locations). So I need to compare the longitudes
      of these two zip codes.


      Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States, while Texas is in the
      South/Southwest region. Generally speaking, Illinois is east of Texas. But I
      should verify this for the specific zip codes.


      60137 is in Glen Ellyn, IL which is near Chicago in the northeastern part of
      Illinois.

      79331 seems to be in western Texas.


      Given their general locations, 60137 in Illinois should be east of 79331 in
      Texas, because Illinois is east of Texas on the US map.


      So my answer is YES, 60137, IL is located east of 79331, TX.</think>I need to
      determine whether 60137, IL is east of 79331, TX by finding their relative positions.


      Step 1: Identify the general geographical locations of these states.

      - Illinois (IL) is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Texas (TX) is located in the South/Southwest region of the United States


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on the map.

      - Illinois is significantly east of Texas on the US map

      - The entire state of Illinois is east of all of Texas


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - 60137 is in Glen Ellyn, a suburb of Chicago in northeastern Illinois

      - 79331 is in western Texas

      - The longitude of locations in Illinois will be lower (more eastern) than locations
      in Texas


      YES, 60137, IL is located east of 79331, TX.'

      determine the relative geographical positions of the two zip codes.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 29405 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 60626 is in Illinois (IL)


      Now, to determine which is east of the other, I need to consider the relative
      positions of these states in the US:


      - South Carolina is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States


      On a map of the US, South Carolina is positioned to the east of Illinois. The
      East Coast states (including South Carolina) are farther east than the Midwest
      states (including Illinois).


      So geographically, any location in South Carolina would be east of any location
      in Illinois. Therefore, zip code 29405 in South Carolina would be east of zip
      code 60626 in Illinois.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the states where these zip codes are located.

      - 29405 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 60626 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical positions of these states.

      - South Carolina is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - The East Coast (where South Carolina is) is geographically east of the Midwest
      (where Illinois is)

      - South Carolina''s western border is still hundreds of miles east of Illinois


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      - Since SC is entirely east of IL, any zip code in SC (including 29405) must
      be east of any zip code in IL (including 60626)

      this problem. We need to determine if 22936, VA is located east of 70444, LA.


      Step 1: Let''s identify what states VA and LA are.

      - VA is Virginia

      - LA is Louisiana


      Step 2: Let''s think about the geographic positions of these states in the United
      States.

      - Virginia is on the east coast of the United States.

      - Louisiana is in the southern part of the United States, along the Gulf of
      Mexico.


      Step 3: In terms of east-west positioning, Virginia is generally east of Louisiana.
      The eastern United States includes states along the Atlantic coast, while Louisiana
      is more central/southern.


      Step 4: To be more precise, I would need to compare the specific longitudes
      of these zip codes. But based on general geographic knowledge, any location
      in Virginia would be east of any location in Louisiana, because the entire state
      of Virginia is east of the entire state of Louisiana.

      need to determine if 22936, VA is located east of 70444, LA.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - VA is Virginia

      - LA is Louisiana


      Step 2: Consider the geographic locations of these states.

      - Virginia is located on the east coast of the United States, bordering the
      Atlantic Ocean.

      - Louisiana is located in the southern United States, bordering the Gulf of
      Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Virginia is positioned much further east in the country than Louisiana.

      - The entire state of Virginia lies east of Louisiana.


      Step 4: Therefore, any zip code in Virginia (including 22936) would be east
      of any zip code in Louisiana (including 70444).


      YES, 22936, VA is located east of 70444, LA.'
    4afa1e8c-7ae3-4ce1-be84-8e8b9f3b0eaa: '<think>To determine if 22936, VA is located
      east of 70444, LA, I need to find the approximate locations of these zip codes

      22936 is a zip code in Virginia (VA).

      70444 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA).


      In the United States, states on the east coast (like Virginia) are generally
      located east of states in the southern central region (like Louisiana). Looking
      at a mental map of the US:


      - Virginia is on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Louisiana is in the south-central part of the US, bordering the Gulf of Mexico


      Virginia is definitely east of Louisiana on a map. So any location in Virginia
      (including zip code 22936) would be east of any location in Louisiana (including
      zip code 70444).


      Therefore, 22936, VA is located east of 70444, LA.</think># Is 22936, VA located
      east of 70444, LA?


      I need to determine the geographical relationship between these two zip codes

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 22936 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 70444 is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Recall the geographical positions of these states.

      - Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Louisiana is located in the south-central United States along the Gulf of
      Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Virginia lies significantly east of Louisiana on the US map

      - All locations in Virginia are east of all locations in Louisiana


      Since 22936 is in Virginia and 70444 is in Louisiana, and Virginia is entirely
      east of Louisiana, the zip code 22936, VA must be east of 70444, LA.

      22936, VA (Virginia) is located east of 70444, LA (Louisiana).


      To solve this, I''ll need to think about the geographic locations of these zip
      codes. In the United States, states on the east coast are considered to be more
      "east" than states in the central or western parts of the country.


      Virginia (VA) is located on the east coast of the United States.

      Louisiana (LA) is located in the southern part of the United States, along the
      Gulf of Mexico, and is significantly west of Virginia.


      So generally speaking, Virginia is east of Louisiana. However, I should be more
      precise and consider the specific zip codes:


      22936 is a zip code in Virginia

      70444 is a zip code in Louisiana


      Since Virginia as a whole is east of Louisiana as a whole, and zip codes within
      each state maintain the same general geographic relationship, I can conclude
      that 22936, VA is located east of 70444, LA.</think>I need to determine if 22936,
      VA is located east of 70444, LA by comparing their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 22936 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 70444 is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states

      - Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Louisiana is located in the south-central United States along the Gulf of
      Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      - Virginia is significantly east of Louisiana on the US map

      - All locations in Virginia are east of all locations in Louisiana


      Step 4: Consider the specific zip codes

      - Since the entire state of Virginia is east of the entire state of Louisiana,
      any zip code in Virginia (including 22936) must be east of any zip code in Louisiana
      (including 70444)

      Step 1: Identify what we''re comparing.

      - 22936, VA (Virginia)

      - 70444, LA (Louisiana)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical locations.

      Virginia is on the east coast of the United States.

      Louisiana is in the southern part of the United States, along the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning.

      If we look at a map of the United States, Virginia is significantly east of
      Louisiana. The entire state of Virginia is east of the entire state of Louisiana.


      Step 4: Verify with general zip code knowledge.

      US zip codes generally increase as you go from east to west. Lower numbers tend
      to be in the east, higher numbers in the west. 22936 is a much lower number
      than 70444, which supports that the Virginia location is east of the Louisiana
      location.


      So, 22936, VA is located east of 70444, LA.</think>To determine if 22936, VA

      - 70444 is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Virginia is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Louisiana is located in the southern part of the United States, bordering
      the Gulf of Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      Virginia is significantly east of Louisiana on the US map. The entire state
      of Virginia lies east of Louisiana.


      Step 4: Verify with zip code patterns.

      US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to be assigned
      to the eastern parts of the country, and higher numbers to the western parts.
      The Virginia zip code (22936) has a much lower number than the Louisiana zip
      code (70444), which supports the conclusion.

      if a zip code 43952 in Ohio (OH) is located east of zip code 60087 in Illinois
      (IL).


      To answer this, I need to know the relative positions of these two states and
      the specific locations of these zip codes within their states.


      First, I know that Ohio is generally east of Illinois in the United States.
      Illinois is in the Midwest and borders the Mississippi River on its western
      edge, while Ohio is further east, bordering Pennsylvania which is on the eastern
      side of the Midwest.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Illinois is positioned in the Midwest

      - Ohio is positioned east of Illinois


      So generally speaking, any location in Ohio would be east of any location in
      Illinois. This is because the entire state of Ohio is east of the entire state
      of Illinois.


      Therefore, zip code 43952 in Ohio would be located east of zip code 60087 in
      Illinois.</think># Is 43952, OH located east of 60087, IL?


      To solve this, I need to analyze the geographic positions of these zip codes

      ## Step-by-Step Analysis

      1. First, let''s consider the states: Ohio (OH) and Illinois (IL)

      2. Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States, along the
      Mississippi River

      3. Ohio is located east of Illinois, in the eastern part of the Midwest

      4. The entire state of Ohio is positioned east of the entire state of Illinois


      ## Conclusion

      Since all locations in Ohio are east of all locations in Illinois (due to the
      states'' relative positions), zip code 43952 in Ohio must be east of zip code
      60087 in Illinois.

      - Illinois is in the midwest of the United States


      In terms of the geographic arrangement of the United States, states on the east

      Let me recall what I know about US geography:

      - Illinois (IL) is in the Midwest, roughly in the middle of the country

      - Texas (TX) is in the South/Southwest, and extends fairly far west


      The conventional understanding of US geography would suggest that Illinois is

      - Illinois is positioned significantly east of Texas on the US map

      - All of Illinois, including any zip code within it, lies east of most of Texas


      ## Step 4: Specific zip code locations

      - 60652 is likely in the Chicago area of Illinois

      (New Hampshire) is located east of 32095, FL (Florida).


      To determine this, I need to consider the relative geographic positions of these
      two ZIP codes.


      New Hampshire is in the northeastern United States, on the East Coast.

      Florida is in the southeastern United States, also on the East Coast.


      When comparing east-west positions, we need to think about longitude. Lower
      longitude numbers represent more eastern positions in the United States.


      NH is further north than FL, but that''s not what we''re asked about. The question
      is specifically about east-west positioning.


      New Hampshire is generally northeast of Florida. While both states are on the
      eastern coast of the US, New Hampshire is actually further east than Florida.


      To be completely sure, I''d need the exact longitude coordinates of these specific
      ZIP codes, but generally:

      - New Hampshire ZIP codes are around 71-72 degrees west longitude

      - Florida ZIP codes are around 80-87 degrees west longitude


      Since lower west longitude numbers mean further east, New Hampshire (with lower
      west longitude) is east of Florida.


      So 03079, NH would be east of 32095, FL.</think># Is 03079, NH located east

      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 03079 is in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 32095 is in Florida (FL)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions

      - New Hampshire is located in the northeastern United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      - In the United States, east-west positioning corresponds to longitude

      - New Hampshire is generally positioned around 71-72 degrees west longitude

      - Florida is generally positioned around 80-87 degrees west longitude

      - Lower west longitude numbers indicate more easterly locations


      ## Step 4: Make the comparison

      - Since New Hampshire has a lower west longitude than Florida, it is located
      further east


      YES, 03079, NH is located east of 32095, FL.'

      1. I need to determine the relative east-west positions of two zip codes.

      2. The zip codes are 03784 (in New Hampshire) and 14206 (in New York).

      3. To determine which is further east, I need to know their approximate longitudes.


      Generally speaking, on a map of the United States:

      - New Hampshire (NH) is located in New England, in the northeastern part of
      the country

      - New York (NY) is west of New Hampshire


      Looking at their relative positions, New Hampshire is east of New York state.
      This is because New Hampshire is closer to the Atlantic coast, while New York
      extends further inland to the west.


      So geographically, locations in New Hampshire tend to be east of locations in
      New York. Since 03784 is in NH and 14206 is in NY, it''s likely that 03784 is
      east of 14206.


      However, to be certain, I should consider that NY is a large state and parts
      of eastern NY could potentially be further east than parts of western NH. But
      given the standard geography of the US, New Hampshire is generally east of New
      York.</think># Determining if 03784, NH is east of 14206, NY


      I need to figure out the relative positions of these two zip codes on the east-west
      axis.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states and their geographic positions

      - 03784 is in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 14206 is in New York (NY)


      ## Step 2: Analyze the geographic relationship between these states

      New Hampshire is located in New England, in the northeastern United States.
      New York is located west of New Hampshire. All of New Hampshire is east of most
      of New York state.


      ## Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes

      - NH zip code 03784 would be somewhere in New Hampshire

      - NY zip code 14206 is in Buffalo, New York, which is in the western part of
      New York state


      ## Step 4: Make the determination

      Since all of New Hampshire is east of Buffalo, NY, zip code 03784 must be east
      of zip code 14206.


      YES'
    df89356e-ad6a-40ca-8c68-b1a870df8c2c: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to figure out the locations of two zip codes and determine their relative positions
      east-west.


      1. 03784 is a zip code in New Hampshire (NH)

      2. 14206 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Generally speaking, New Hampshire is located east of New York state. NH is in
      New England, on the eastern seaboard, while NY extends from the eastern seaboard
      westward.


      Let me think about the geography more precisely:

      - New Hampshire is entirely east of New York state

      - New Hampshire shares no border with New York (Vermont is between them)

      - Any point in NH would be east of any point in NY based on their relative geographic
      positions


      Since 03784 is in NH and 14206 is in NY, and NH is east of NY, it follows that
      03784, NH is located east of 14206, NY.</think>I need to determine the relative
      east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 03784 is in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 14206 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      New Hampshire is located in New England on the eastern seaboard of the United
      States, while New York is located to the west of New Hampshire. In fact, New
      Hampshire doesn''t even directly border New York (Vermont sits between them).


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the zip codes

      Since New Hampshire is entirely east of New York state, any location in NH (including
      03784) would be east of any location in NY (including 14206).

      01430 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA).

      31636 is a zip code in Georgia (GA).


      The United States is organized such that:

      - Massachusetts is in the northeastern part of the country

      - Georgia is in the southeastern part of the country


      Looking at the relative positions, Massachusetts is clearly east of Georgia
      on a map of the United States. The eastern states tend to have lower zip codes,
      and we can see 01xxx for Massachusetts versus 31xxx for Georgia.


      Massachusetts is on the Atlantic coast in New England, while Georgia is also
      on the Atlantic but further south and further west.


      Since 01430, MA is in Massachusetts and 31636, GA is in Georgia, and Massachusetts

      - 01430 is in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 31636 is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Determine their geographic positions.

      Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States, along the Atlantic
      coast.

      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, also along the Atlantic
      coast but further south.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Massachusetts is positioned significantly
      to the east of Georgia. The entire state of Massachusetts is east of Georgia''s
      eastern border.


      Step 4: Conclude based on the states'' positions.

      Since 01430 is in Massachusetts and 31636 is in Georgia, and Massachusetts is

      east-west positions of two zip codes:

      1. 01430, MA (Massachusetts)

      2. 31636, GA (Georgia)


      First, let me consider their geographical locations in the US:

      - Massachusetts is in the northeastern part of the United States

      - Georgia is in the southeastern part of the United States


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Massachusetts is significantly east of Georgia.
      The entire east coast runs roughly north-south, with Massachusetts being further
      north than Georgia, but they''re both coastal states. In terms of longitude
      (east-west position), Massachusetts is east of Georgia.


      So zip code 01430 in MA would be east of zip code 31636 in GA.</think># Is 01430,
      MA located east of 31636, GA?


      To determine this, I need to consider the geographic positions of Massachusetts
      (MA) and Georgia (GA) within the United States.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' locations.

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Both states are on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      - Massachusetts is positioned further northeast.

      - Georgia is positioned further southeast.


      Step 3: Consider longitude (east-west measurement).

      - Massachusetts is generally positioned to the east of Georgia on the map.

      - The eastern coast of the US curves, with Massachusetts jutting out more toward
      the east than Georgia.


      YES, zip code 01430, MA is located east of 31636, GA.'
    bdf1af93-9817-493b-8ead-03a7ce4eebf8: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative locations of two zip codes:

      - 01430, MA (Massachusetts)

      - 31636, GA (Georgia)


      I need to determine if the first zip code is located east of the second one.


      Step 1: Recall the geographical positions of Massachusetts and Georgia in the
      United States.

      Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States, on the East Coast.

      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, also on the East Coast
      but further south.


      Step 2: Consider the east-west positioning.

      When comparing east-west positions in the US, we''re essentially comparing longitudes.
      Lower longitude numbers correspond to more eastern locations (within the contiguous
      US).


      Massachusetts is generally east of Georgia. Massachusetts is one of the easternmost
      states, while Georgia, although on the East Coast, is further west than Massachusetts.


      Step 3: Zip code patterns can also give clues.

      US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to be in the
      northeast and higher numbers in the south and west. 01xxx zip codes are typically
      in Massachusetts and other New England states, while 3xxxx are typically in
      southeastern states.


      The zip code 01430 (MA) has a much lower first digit than 31636 (GA), which
      is consistent with Massachusetts being in the Northeast and Georgia being in
      the Southeast.


      Based on the geographical knowledge of US states, Massachusetts is east of Georgia,
      so 01430, MA should be east of 31636, GA.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 01430 is in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 31636 is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical positions of these states

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      Massachusetts is positioned further east than Georgia along the Atlantic coast.
      On a map of the United States, Massachusetts is clearly to the east of Georgia.


      Step 4: Consider zip code patterns

      The lower first digits in 01430 (compared to 31636) also reflect the general
      pattern of US zip codes, where lower numbers tend to be assigned to the northeastern
      states.


      YES, 01430, MA is located east of 31636, GA.'

      relative geographical positions of two zip codes: 01810, MA and 15468, PA.


      Let me break this down:

      1. 01810 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA)

      2. 15468 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      The question is whether 01810, MA is located east of 15468, PA.


      In the United States, states on the East Coast are generally east of states
      that are more inland. Massachusetts is on the East Coast, while Pennsylvania
      is also an eastern state but not as far east as Massachusetts.


      Looking at their relative positions:

      - Massachusetts is located to the northeast of Pennsylvania

      - Massachusetts is definitely east of Pennsylvania


      So any location in Massachusetts would generally be east of any location in
      Pennsylvania. There might be some exceptions if we''re talking about locations
      on the far western edge of MA and the far eastern edge of PA, but given standard
      zip code distributions:


      01810 appears to be a zip code for Andover, MA, which is in northeastern Massachusetts.

      15468 appears to be a zip code in Pennsylvania which, based on its prefix (154xx),
      is likely in western Pennsylvania.


      So 01810, MA (Andover) should definitely be east of 15468, PA.</think># Is 01810,
      MA located east of 15468, PA?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 01810 is in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 15468 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography

      Massachusetts is located on the East Coast of the US, while Pennsylvania is
      west of Massachusetts.


      ## Step 3: Analyze the specific zip codes

      - The 018xx zip code range covers northeastern Massachusetts

      - The 154xx zip code range covers western Pennsylvania


      ## Step 4: Determine relative positioning

      Since Massachusetts is entirely east of Pennsylvania, and specifically these
      zip codes represent locations in northeastern MA and western PA, the location
      in Massachusetts must be east of the location in Pennsylvania.


      YES'

      to determine the locations of these two zip codes and then figure out which
      one is more east (has a larger longitude).


      01810, MA refers to a zip code in Massachusetts (MA), which is a state in the
      northeastern United States.

      15468, PA refers to a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA), which is also in the northeastern
      US but more inland than Massachusetts.


      Generally speaking, Massachusetts is on the Atlantic coast and is east of Pennsylvania.
      Massachusetts is one of the easternmost states in the US, while Pennsylvania
      is more inland.


      So just based on the states, 01810, MA would be east of 15468, PA. But let me
      think about the specific zip codes to be sure.


      Zip code 01810 is in Andover, Massachusetts.

      Zip code 15468 is somewhere in Pennsylvania.


      Massachusetts is definitely east of Pennsylvania on the US map, so a location
      in Massachusetts would be east of a location in Pennsylvania.</think># Is 01810,

      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 01810 is in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 15468 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic positions

      - Massachusetts is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United
      States

      - Pennsylvania is located inland, west of Massachusetts


      ## Step 3: Verify the specific zip codes

      - 01810 is in Andover, Massachusetts (northeastern MA)

      - 15468 is in Fayette County, Pennsylvania (southwestern PA)


      ## Step 4: Compare east-west positions

      The entire state of Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania on the map. Looking
      at the specific locations makes this even clearer - Andover, MA is in the eastern
      part of Massachusetts, while zip code 15468 is in the western part of Pennsylvania.

      01810 is a ZIP code in Massachusetts (MA). Massachusetts is located in the northeastern
      United States.

      15468 is a ZIP code in Pennsylvania (PA). Pennsylvania is also in the northeastern

      15468 is in Pennsylvania (PA).


      2) Looking at the geography of the United States, Massachusetts is located on
      the eastern seaboard, while Pennsylvania is inland from Massachusetts.


      3) Massachusetts is entirely east of Pennsylvania on the map. The westernmost
      point of Massachusetts is still east of the easternmost point of Pennsylvania.


      4) Therefore, any location in Massachusetts (including zip code 01810) would
      be east of any location in Pennsylvania (including zip code 15468).


      YES, 01810, MA is located east of 15468, PA.'
    7c510c83-a9d7-4faf-973a-a8955555376c: '<think>To solve this problem, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine which one is further east


      Let''s start with identifying the locations:


      01810 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA)

      15468 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Generally speaking, Massachusetts is located east of Pennsylvania in the United
      States. Massachusetts is on the eastern seaboard of the US, while Pennsylvania
      is more inland, though still in the eastern part of the country.


      In terms of US geography, states further east have lower longitude values (closer
      to 0 or even negative/western longitude values). Massachusetts is definitely
      east of Pennsylvania on a map of the United States.


      So by state location alone, it''s likely that 01810, MA is east of 15468, PA.
      But to be thorough, I should consider the specific locations within these states,
      as a western part of MA could potentially be similar in longitude to an eastern
      part of PA.


      However, the general geography of these states makes it very likely that any
      point in MA would be east of any point in PA, given their relative positions.</think>#
      Is 01810, MA located east of 15468, PA?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 01810 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 15468 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions

      Massachusetts is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while
      Pennsylvania is more inland and west of Massachusetts.


      ## Step 3: Analyze specific zip codes

      - MA zip codes starting with 01 are typically in northeastern Massachusetts

      - PA zip codes starting with 15 are generally in western Pennsylvania


      ## Step 4: Determine relative position

      Given that even the westernmost parts of Massachusetts are generally east of
      most of Pennsylvania, and these specific zip codes reinforce that positioning
      (northeastern MA vs western PA), the location represented by 01810 must be east
      of the location represented by 15468.


      YES'
    7ea594c5-ea53-44a9-b433-95a1c40bdb2d: '<think>I need to figure out if the zip
      code 01810, MA is east of the zip code 15468, PA. Let me break this down.


      First, let me understand what these zip codes correspond to:

      - 01810 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 15468 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      In the United States, zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers
      tend to be in the eastern part of the country, and higher numbers tend to be
      in the western part. The first digit of the zip code usually indicates the general
      region:

      - 0 and 1 are typically for the Northeast

      - 2 and 3 are typically for the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic

      - 4 and 5 are typically for the Midwest

      - 6 and 7 are typically for the Central/South

      - 8 and 9 are typically for the West


      Given that:

      - 01810 starts with 0, which corresponds to the Northeast

      - 15468 starts with 1, which also corresponds to the Northeast, but as a higher
      number, it should be slightly more western than zip codes starting with 0


      Additionally, Massachusetts (MA) is a state in the northeastern United States,
      while Pennsylvania (PA) is a state to the west of Massachusetts.


      So based on both the zip code patterns and the states'' geographical positions,
      01810 in Massachusetts should be east of 15468 in Pennsylvania.</think>To determine
      if 01810, MA is east of 15468, PA, I need to analyze these locations geographically.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 01810 is in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 15468 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      Massachusetts is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United States,
      while Pennsylvania is located inland, west of Massachusetts.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code patterns

      In the US zip code system, lower numbers generally indicate more eastern locations.
      The first digit "0" (as in 01810) typically represents the northeasternmost
      region, while "1" (as in 15468) represents areas further west.


      Step 4: Combine this information

      Since Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania geographically, and the zip code
      pattern (01xxx vs 15xxx) confirms this directional relationship, 01810, MA must
      be east of 15468, PA.

      Step 3: Compare their longitudes.

      - Massachusetts (including zip code 01107) generally lies around 71-73 degrees
      west longitude.

      - Florida (including zip code 33715) generally lies around 80-87 degrees west
      longitude.

    fe4f79f4-c47f-4b26-9609-95909607f0ab: '<think>Let me break this down step by step:


      1. I need to determine if one zip code is east of another.

      2. The zip codes are 01107 in Massachusetts (MA) and 33715 in Florida (FL).

      3. To determine which is east of the other, I need to consider their geographical
      locations.


      In the US, Massachusetts is in the northeastern part of the country, while Florida
      is in the southeastern part.


      When considering east/west positioning in the US:

      - Massachusetts is further east than Florida

      - Massachusetts is on the Atlantic coast in New England

      - Florida is also on the Atlantic coast but extends south and west into the
      Gulf of Mexico


      Since Massachusetts is generally east of Florida on a map, zip code 01107, MA
      should be east of 33715, FL.


      However, I should be careful here because zip codes within states can vary widely
      in their east/west positioning. But given that MA as a state is entirely east
      of FL, it''s safe to conclude that any MA zip code will be east of any FL zip
      code.</think># Is 01107, MA located east of 33715, FL?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 01107 is in Massachusetts (MA), which is in the northeastern United States.

      - 33715 is in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Compare the geographical positions.

      - Massachusetts is positioned along the Atlantic coast in New England.

      - Florida is also along the Atlantic coast, but is significantly further south
      and west compared to Massachusetts.

      - Looking at a map of the United States, Massachusetts is located entirely east
      of Florida''s longitude.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - All of Massachusetts (including zip code 01107) lies east of Florida''s easternmost
      points.

      - Florida zip code 33715 is on the Gulf Coast side of Florida (St. Petersburg
      area), which puts it even further west than Florida''s Atlantic coast.


      Therefore, 01107, MA is definitely located east of 33715, FL.


      YES'

      - The entirety of Ohio is east of Texas

      - Even the westernmost point of Ohio is still east of the easternmost point

      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      - Since 44116 is in Ohio, and 77045 is in Texas, the Ohio zip code must be east

      - Texas is in the Southern/Southwestern part of the United States

      - Generally, Ohio is east of Texas on a map of the United States


      Since zip codes within a state can vary in their exact locations, I should ideally

      Since Utah (84056) is east of California (91360), the answer should be YES.

    53327c06-4d03-44ec-ae87-8227843c20c4: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the locations of both zip codes and decide if one is east of the
      other.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 01364, MA: This is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 23702, VA: This is a zip code in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Think about the general geographic relationship between Massachusetts
      and Virginia.

      The US East Coast runs roughly northeast to southwest. Massachusetts is in New
      England, in the northeastern part of the country. Virginia is in the Mid-Atlantic
      region, south of Massachusetts.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Massachusetts is generally east of Virginia.
      The East Coast curves, with New England (including Massachusetts) jutting out
      further east into the Atlantic Ocean compared to the Mid-Atlantic states like
      Virginia.


      Step 3: Check if this general relationship applies to these specific zip codes.

      Without looking up the exact coordinates, I can rely on the general geography.
      Massachusetts zip codes (especially those starting with 01) are typically in
      the central or western part of Massachusetts, but even western Massachusetts
      is generally east of most of Virginia. Virginia zip codes in the 23000s are
      typically in the eastern part of Virginia (closer to the coast), but Massachusetts
      extends further east into the Atlantic than Virginia does.


      The specific zip code 01364 appears to be in western Massachusetts, while 23702
      appears to be in eastern Virginia (likely near Norfolk or Portsmouth area).
      Even though 01364 is in western MA, Massachusetts as a whole is east of Virginia,
      and western Massachusetts is still likely east of eastern Virginia.</think>#
      Determining if 01364, MA is east of 23702, VA


      Let me solve this step by step:


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 01364 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 23702 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic positions

      Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States, while Virginia is
      in the mid-Atlantic region, south of Massachusetts.


      ## Step 3: Consider east-west positioning

      On the US East Coast, Massachusetts extends further east into the Atlantic Ocean
      than Virginia does. The coastline curves, with New England (including Massachusetts)
      jutting out eastward.


      ## Step 4: Analyze specific zip codes

      - 01364 is in western Massachusetts (likely in the Franklin County area)

      - 23702 is in eastern Virginia (Portsmouth area)


      ## Step 5: Compare longitudes

      Even though 01364 is in western Massachusetts, the entire state of Massachusetts
      is generally east of Virginia on a map. Western Massachusetts is still east
      of eastern Virginia in terms of longitude.

      how to determine if one zip code is east of another.


      First, I need to identify what locations these zip codes correspond to:

      - 01364, MA is a zip code in Massachusetts

      - 23702, VA is a zip code in Virginia


      To determine which is further east, I need to compare their longitudes. In the
      US, lower longitude numbers indicate more eastern locations (since longitudes
      in the US are negative, with the east coast having values closer to 0).


      Massachusetts is generally east of Virginia on the US map. Massachusetts is
      on the northeastern coast of the US, while Virginia is on the mid-Atlantic coast
      but further west than Massachusetts.


      So geographically speaking, locations in Massachusetts tend to be east of locations
      in Virginia. But to be certain, I''d need the specific longitudes of these zip
      codes.

      - 01364 is in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 23702 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia is located in the mid-Atlantic region


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on the east-west axis.

      - Massachusetts is positioned further east on the Atlantic coast

      - Virginia is positioned southwest of Massachusetts


      Step 4: Determine relative positions of specific zip codes.

      - Zip code 01364 (in MA) would follow the general east-west positioning of its
      state

      - Zip code 23702 (in VA) would follow the general east-west positioning of its

      by step:


      1) I need to determine if 62207, IL (Illinois) is located east of 77388, TX
      (Texas).


      2) In the United States, states further east have locations with lower longitude
      values, and states further west have higher longitude values.


      3) Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States, while Texas is in
      the South/Southwest region.


      4) Geographically, Illinois is positioned to the east of Texas on the US map.


      5) The specific zip codes won''t change this fundamental east-west relationship
      between the two states.


      6) Therefore, 62207, IL would be east of 77388, TX.</think>I''ll solve this
      by determining the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 62207 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 77388 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Texas
      is located in the South/Southwest region.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      On a map of the United States, Illinois is positioned significantly to the east
      of Texas. The entire state of Illinois lies east of Texas.


      Step 4: Consider specific zip code locations

      While specific zip codes might be in different parts of their respective states,
      the easternmost point of Texas is still west of the westernmost point of Illinois,
      so any Illinois zip code (including 62207) must be east of any Texas zip code
      (including 77388).

      the location corresponding to zip code 62207 in Illinois (IL) is east of the
      location corresponding to zip code 77388 in Texas (TX).


      To solve this, I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these
      two locations. In the US, locations further east have lower longitude values,
      while locations further west have higher longitude values.


      Let me think about the general locations:

      - Illinois (IL) is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Texas (TX) is in the south-central region of the United States


      Generally speaking, Illinois is east of Texas on a map of the United States.
      But I should be more specific about these particular zip codes.


      Zip code 62207 is in Illinois, specifically in the East St. Louis area.

      Zip code 77388 is in Texas, likely in the Houston metropolitan area.


      Since Illinois is generally east of Texas, and these specific zip codes don''t
      appear to be in unusual locations within their respective states, 62207, IL
      should be east of 77388, TX.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west

      Illinois (IL) is in the Midwest region of the United States, while Texas (TX)
      is in the south-central region.


      Step 2: Consider the general geographical relationship.

      Illinois is located entirely east of Texas. The entire state of Illinois is
      east of the eastern border of Texas.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      62207 is in Illinois, specifically in the East St. Louis area in the southwestern
      part of the state.

      77388 is in Texas, in the Spring area north of Houston.


      Step 4: Determine relative positioning.

      Even though 62207 is in western Illinois and 77388 is in eastern Texas, the
      geography of the United States is such that all of Illinois is still east of
      all of Texas.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 10457 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 29067 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the US.

      New York state is in the northeastern part of the United States, while South
      Carolina is in the southeastern part of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      In terms of longitude (east-west position), New York is generally located to
      the east of South Carolina. The East Coast of the US curves, with the northeastern
      states (like NY) being further east than the southeastern states (like SC).


      To be more specific:

      - New York zip codes typically have longitudes around 74-79 degrees West

      - South Carolina zip codes typically have longitudes around 79-83 degrees West


      Lower longitude numbers (less negative) in the Western Hemisphere indicate more
      easterly positions.

      Step 2: Consider the geography of the eastern United States.

      - New York is in the Northeast

      - South Carolina is in the Southeast


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes (east-west positions).

      The East Coast of the US curves, with northeastern states generally lying east
      of southeastern states. New York is positioned further east than South Carolina
      on a map.


      Step 4: More specifically, New York zip codes are typically around 74-76 degrees
      west longitude, while South Carolina zip codes are typically around 79-83 degrees
      west longitude. Lower longitude numbers (less negative) in the Western Hemisphere

      67218 is a zip code in Kansas (KS), which is a state in the central United States.


      Geographically speaking, the United States is oriented so that:

      - The East Coast is along the Atlantic Ocean

      - The West Coast is along the Pacific Ocean

      - The central states are in the middle

      locations further west have higher numbers. The first digit of the zip code
      generally indicates the region from east to west:


      0: Northeast

      1: Northeast

      2: Mid-Atlantic/Southeast

      3: Southeast

      4: Midwest

      5: Midwest

      6: Central/Midwest

      7: Central

      8: Mountain West

      9: West Coast/Pacific


      So from the first digits:

      - 30354 (GA) starts with 3, indicating Southeast region

      - 67218 (KS) starts with 6, indicating Central/Midwest region


      The Southeast region (Georgia) is indeed east of the Central/Midwest region
      (Kansas). This makes sense geographically as well, since Georgia is on the Atlantic
      coast, while Kansas is in the interior of the country.</think># Is 30354, GA
      located east of 67218, KS?


      To solve this problem, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 30354 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 67218 is in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Georgia is located on the southeastern Atlantic coast of the United States

      - Kansas is located in the central United States, far from either coast


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Georgia is positioned much further east than Kansas

      - Looking at a US map, Georgia is approximately 1,000 miles east of Kansas


      Step 4: Verify with zip code patterns.

      - US zip codes generally follow an east-to-west pattern in their first digits

      - The "3" prefix for Georgia indicates southeast region

      - The "6" prefix for Kansas indicates central region


      YES - 30354, GA is located east of 67218, KS.'

      located east of 67218, KS, I need to analyze the geographic locations of these
      zip codes.


      First, let me identify the states:

      - 30354 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 67218 is in Kansas (KS)


      In the United States, Georgia is located on the east coast, while Kansas is
      in the central part of the country. Geographically speaking, Georgia is east
      of Kansas.


      To be even more specific:

      - Georgia is in the southeastern United States

      - Kansas is in the central United States


      Since Georgia is east of Kansas on the map of the United States, and zip codes
      within these states maintain this relative positioning, 30354 in GA would be
      east of 67218 in KS.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: First, I need to identify the states where these zip codes are located.

      - 30354 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 67218 is in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Now I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these states.

      - Georgia (GA) is located on the southeastern coast of the United States

      - Kansas (KS) is located in the central United States


      Step 3: Comparing their positions on a map:

      - Georgia is substantially east of Kansas on any US map

      - The easternmost point of Kansas is still west of the westernmost point of
      Georgia


      Since Georgia is east of Kansas, and these zip codes are within their respective
      states, 30354 in GA must be east of 67218 in KS.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, along the Atlantic coast.

      - Kansas is located in the central United States, in the Great Plains region.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on the east-west axis.

      - Georgia is significantly east of Kansas on the US map.

      - All of Georgia is east of all of Kansas geographically.


      Step 4: Confirm that these specific zip codes don''t change this relationship.

      - The specific zip codes don''t alter the fundamental east-west relationship
      between these states.


      YES, 30354, GA is located east of 67218, KS.'

      of 17202, PA, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their longitudinal positions (east-west positioning)


      For 11563, NY:

      This is a zip code in New York state. Based on my knowledge, this appears to
      be Lynbrook, NY, which is on Long Island in the eastern part of New York state.


      For 17202, PA:

      This is a zip code in Pennsylvania. I believe this is in the south-central part
      of Pennsylvania, possibly near Chambersburg.


      Now, for geographical positioning in the US:

      - Eastern locations have lower longitude numbers

      - Western locations have higher longitude numbers

      - New York is generally east of Pennsylvania

      - Long Island (where Lynbrook is) is especially far east in New York state

      - South-central Pennsylvania is in the middle/western part of PA

      Is 11563, NY located east of 17202, PA?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 11563 is a zip code in New York, specifically for Lynbrook on Long Island

      - 17202 is a zip code in Pennsylvania, located in the south-central part of
      PA near Chambersburg


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic layout of the eastern US

      - New York state is generally east of Pennsylvania

      - Long Island extends further east from New York''s mainland

      - Lynbrook (11563) is on Long Island, placing it in the eastern portion of New
      York

      - Chambersburg area (17202) is in the central/southern part of Pennsylvania


      ## Step 3: Compare positions

      - Long Island''s position on the Atlantic coast places it significantly east
      of central Pennsylvania

      - The entire state of New Jersey lies between these two locations


      YES, 11563 (Lynbrook, NY) is located east of 17202 (Chambersburg area, PA).'

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their relative positions on a map (specifically their longitude,
      where a lower longitude value is further east in the US)


      For 11563, NY:

      This is a zip code in New York state. Based on my knowledge, this is likely
      a zip code on Long Island. New York is in the northeastern United States, and
      Long Island extends eastward into the Atlantic Ocean.


      For 17202, PA:

      This is a zip code in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is west of New York state,
      especially west of Long Island.


      In the eastern United States, locations further east have lower longitude values
      than locations further west. So if 11563, NY is east of 17202, PA, then 11563
      should have a lower longitude value.

      on Long Island.

      - 17202 is a zip code in Pennsylvania. It''s in Franklin County, PA.


      Step 2: Consider their geographic positions.

      - New York is generally east of Pennsylvania.

      - Long Island (where Lynbrook is located) extends eastward into the Atlantic
      Ocean.

      - Franklin County, PA is in south-central Pennsylvania, near the Maryland border.


      Step 3: Compare their positions more precisely.

      - Long Island locations are significantly east of central Pennsylvania.

      - Lynbrook, NY (11563) is on the western portion of Long Island, but this is

      First, let me identify these zip codes:

      - 11563 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 17202 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      In the United States, locations generally follow this pattern:

      - Eastern states have lower zip codes

      - Western states have higher zip codes


      However, this is not a perfect rule, and within states the pattern varies. Since
      we''re comparing zip codes in different states (NY vs PA), I need to think about
      the geographical locations of these states.


      New York is located to the east of Pennsylvania. NY is on the east coast, while
      PA is more inland.


      So geographically speaking, locations in NY would generally be east of locations
      in PA.


      To be more certain, let me think about specific areas:

      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - Zip code 11563 corresponds to Lynbrook, NY, which is on Long Island in the
      eastern part of New York state.

      - Zip code 17202 corresponds to Chambersburg, PA, which is in south-central
      Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these locations.

      - New York is generally east of Pennsylvania.

      - Long Island specifically is on the eastern edge of New York state.

      - Chambersburg, PA is in the south-central part of Pennsylvania, not on the
      eastern edge bordering New Jersey.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Locations on Long Island (like Lynbrook) are significantly further east than
      central Pennsylvania locations.

      - Lynbrook, NY is much closer to the Atlantic Ocean than Chambersburg, PA.


      YES, 11563 (Lynbrook, NY) is located east of 17202 (Chambersburg, PA).'

      parts of Louisiana

      - Texas zip codes in the 76xxx range are typically in the north central and

      Now, let''s consider the specific zip codes:

      - 70712 is in Louisiana (LA)

      - 76008 is in Texas (TX)


      In the U.S. zip code system:

      - Generally, zip codes start with lower numbers in the east and increase as
      you move west

      - The first digit of a zip code roughly corresponds to a geographical region


      70712 starts with "7", which typically covers parts of Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma,
      and Arkansas.

      to determine if 70712, LA (Louisiana) is located east of 76008, TX (Texas).


      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - Louisiana is a state that''s located east of Texas

      - Louisiana is on the Gulf Coast, while Texas is to its west


      Now for the specific zip codes:

      - 70712 is in Louisiana (LA)

      - 76008 is in Texas (TX)


      Since Louisiana is east of Texas, generally any location in Louisiana would
      be east of any location in Texas. There could be exceptions if we''re looking
      at complex borders or unusual geographic situations, but in general, Louisiana
      is east of Texas on the map of the United States.


      So, 70712, LA is likely located east of 76008, TX.</think>I need to determine
      if 70712, LA is east of 76008, TX by examining their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 70712 is in Louisiana (LA)

      - 76008 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Louisiana is located directly east of Texas on the US map. The entire state
      of Louisiana lies east of the eastern border of Texas.


      Step 3: Verify if there are any geographic anomalies.

      While some states have complex borders or enclaves, the Louisiana-Texas border
      is relatively straightforward, with Louisiana consistently positioned east of
      Texas.


      Step 4: Examine the specific zip codes.

      70712 is in Louisiana, so it follows the state''s general position.

      76008 is in Texas, so it follows Texas''s general position.


      Since Louisiana is east of Texas, and these zip codes follow their respective
      state positions, 70712 in Louisiana is east of 76008 in Texas.

      to determine the locations of the two zip codes and then figure out their relative
      positions.


      First, I need to identify where 70712, LA is located. The "LA" indicates Louisiana.
      Louisiana is a state in the southeastern United States.


      Next, I need to identify where 76008, TX is located. The "TX" indicates Texas.
      Texas is a state in the south-central United States.


      In terms of geography, Louisiana is east of Texas. The entire state of Louisiana
      is positioned to the east of Texas on a map of the United States.


      Since 70712 is in Louisiana (LA) and 76008 is in Texas (TX), and Louisiana is
      east of Texas, it follows that 70712, LA is located east of 76008, TX.</think>#

      is in Texas (TX).


      2) Looking at US geography, Louisiana is positioned to the east of Texas. The
      entire state of Louisiana sits east of Texas on the map.


      3) Since 70712 is in Louisiana and 76008 is in Texas, and Louisiana is east
      of Texas, 70712 must be east of 76008.

      by step.


      1. I need to determine whether zip code 70712 in Louisiana (LA) is located east
      of zip code 76008 in Texas (TX).


      2. I know that in the United States, states that are further east generally
      have lower zip code numbers, but this is not always reliable for comparing individual
      zip codes across different states.


      3. However, I do know that Louisiana is located east of Texas in terms of geography.
      Texas is in the south-central part of the US, while Louisiana borders Texas
      on its eastern side.


      4. So regardless of the specific zip codes, any location in Louisiana should
      be east of any location in Texas (with possibly some exceptions at the border
      regions).


      5. To confirm: 70712 is indeed a Louisiana zip code (the 707XX range is in Louisiana),
      and 76008 is indeed a Texas zip code (the 760XX range is in Texas).


      Therefore, since 70712 is in Louisiana and 76008 is in Texas, and Louisiana
      is east of Texas, 70712 LA is located east of 76008 TX.</think># Is 70712, LA

      1) First, I need to identify the states: 70712 is in Louisiana (LA) and 76008
      is in Texas (TX).


      2) Looking at the geographic layout of the United States, Louisiana is positioned
      directly east of Texas. Louisiana shares its western border with eastern Texas.


      3) While specific zip codes within states can have varied positions, the entire
      state of Louisiana lies east of most of Texas.


      4) Zip code 70712 is in Louisiana, so it must be east of any location in Texas,
      including zip code 76008.


      Therefore, YES, 70712, LA is located east of 76008, TX.'

      - Colorado is located in the western/mountain region of the US


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Texas is generally east of Colorado

      Now, let''s consider the specific zip codes:

      - Colorado is located in the western central United States.

      - Texas is located in the south central United States.

      - Colorado lies directly west of Kansas and Nebraska.

      - Texas lies south of Oklahoma, which is east of Colorado.

      - The entirety of Texas is east of Colorado on a map of the United States.

      - Even the westernmost parts of Texas are generally east of the easternmost
      parts of Colorado.

      determine if 27009, NC is located east of 72114, AR.


      Let me break this down:

      1. 27009 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      2. 72114 is a zip code in Arkansas (AR)

      3. I need to determine if NC is east of AR on the US map


      Looking at the US map:

      - North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States

      - Arkansas is in the south-central part of the United States

      - North Carolina is definitely east of Arkansas


      The numbering of zip codes in the US generally follows a pattern where lower
      numbers tend to be in the northeast and higher numbers in the southwest, but
      I should rely on the actual state locations rather than zip code numbers.


      Since North Carolina (where 27009 is located) is east of Arkansas (where 72114
      is located), the answer would be YES.</think>I''ll think about this step by
      step.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these zip codes are located.

      - 27009 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 72114 is in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states on the US map.

      - North Carolina is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions in terms of east-west orientation.

      - North Carolina is significantly east of Arkansas on the US map

      - Arkansas is west of the Mississippi River, while North Carolina is several
      states to the east


      Therefore, zip code 27009 in NC is located east of zip code 72114 in AR.


      YES'

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative positions (east-west relationship)


      First, let''s identify what states these are in:

      - 27009 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 72114 is in Arkansas (AR)


      Now, I need to think about the geographical positions of these states. The United
      States generally has states arranged with the East Coast on the Atlantic Ocean
      and states get more western as you move toward the Pacific.


      North Carolina (NC) is a state on the East Coast of the United States.

      Arkansas (AR) is located in the south-central region of the United States.


      Looking at a mental map of the US, North Carolina is definitely east of Arkansas.
      North Carolina borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east, while Arkansas is several
      states inland from the Atlantic.


      So generally, any location in North Carolina would be east of any location in
      Arkansas.</think># Is 27009, NC located east of 72114, AR?

      - 27009 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 72114 is in Arkansas (AR)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      North Carolina is located on the East Coast of the United States, bordering
      the Atlantic Ocean.

      Arkansas is located in the south-central region of the United States, well inland
      from the East Coast.


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      On a west-to-east axis across the United States, Arkansas is significantly west
      of North Carolina. Any location in North Carolina would be east of any location
      in Arkansas.


      Therefore, 27009, NC is located east of 72114, AR.

      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      Looking at the map of the United States, North Carolina is significantly east
      of Arkansas. The entire state of North Carolina is east of Arkansas, with several
      states between them (like Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, etc.).


      Since 27009 is in North Carolina, and 72114 is in Arkansas, and North Carolina

      on a map of the United States.


      First, let me identify the states:

      - 17970, PA: This zip code is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 70062, LA: This zip code is in Louisiana (LA)


      In the United States, Pennsylvania is located in the eastern part of the country,
      while Louisiana is located in the southern part, towards the Gulf of Mexico.


      Geographically speaking, Pennsylvania is definitely east of Louisiana. Looking
      at the map of the United States:

      - Pennsylvania is in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region

      - Louisiana is in the Deep South/Gulf Coast region


      Since the Earth is spherical and we use longitude to describe east-west positioning
      (with lower numbers being further west and higher numbers being further east
      in the Western Hemisphere), Pennsylvania has a higher longitude (less negative)
      than Louisiana, making Pennsylvania east of Louisiana.


      Therefore, 17970, PA would be east of 70062, LA.</think># Is 17970, PA located

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) 17970 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      2) 70062 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA)

      3) On a map of the United States, Pennsylvania is located in the eastern part
      of the country

      4) Louisiana is located in the southern part of the country, near the Gulf of
      Mexico

      5) Looking at the geography of the US, Pennsylvania is positioned significantly

      6) In terms of longitude (which measures east-west position), Pennsylvania has
      more easterly coordinates than Louisiana

      1. Determine the location of zip code 10958, NY

      2. Determine the location of zip code 27705, NC

      3. Compare their east-west positions (longitude)


      In the United States, locations farther east have smaller longitude values,

      I know that New York state is generally located in the northeastern United States,
      while North Carolina is in the southeastern United States. Geographically, New
      York is generally east of North Carolina.


      So from a state perspective, NY is east of NC. But I should confirm the specific
      zip codes.


      Zip code 10958 appears to be in New York state. New York is on the east coast
      of the US.

      Zip code 27705 appears to be in North Carolina, which is also on the east coast
      but south of New York.

      New York is located in the northeastern United States, while North Carolina
      is in the southeastern United States. On the east-west axis, New York is generally
      east of North Carolina.

      - 10958 is a zip code in New York state (specifically in the Hudson Valley region)

      - 27705 is a zip code in North Carolina (in the Durham area)


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Carolina. The eastern edge of North Carolina is on the Atlantic coast, but New
      York extends further east than North Carolina''s easternmost point.

      First, I know that:

      - 08080 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 28107 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Generally speaking, New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard of the United
      States, while North Carolina is also on the east coast but further south.


      In terms of east-west positioning (longitude):

      - New Jersey is typically further east than North Carolina

      - The US east coast curves, with the northeastern states (like NJ) being further
      east than southeastern states (like NC)


      So geographically, New Jersey locations are almost always east of North Carolina
      locations. But to be more precise, I should think about the specific zip codes.


      08080 appears to be a New Jersey zip code, and New Jersey is on the eastern
      coast.

      28107 is a North Carolina zip code, and North Carolina is also on the eastern
      coast but further south and west.


      Given the geography of the US eastern seaboard, locations in New Jersey are
      generally east of locations in North Carolina. This is because the coastline
      curves, with NJ extending further east into the Atlantic Ocean than NC.

      To solve this, I''ll determine the relative east-west positioning of these two
      locations:


      1. First, I need to recall the general geographic positions of New Jersey and
      North Carolina:

      - New Jersey is a state on the northeastern Atlantic coast of the United States

      - North Carolina is a state on the southeastern Atlantic coast of the United
      States

      - Geographically, New Jersey is located northeast of North Carolina


      2. More specifically regarding east-west positioning:

      - New Jersey is generally east of North Carolina

      - The east coast of the US runs roughly northeast to southwest

      - States further north on the east coast tend to be further east than states
      south of them


      3. For the specific zip codes:

      - 08080 is a zip code in South Jersey (likely Camden County area)

      - 28107 is a zip code in North Carolina


      Since New Jersey is east of North Carolina in terms of longitude, and these

      - 28107 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Specifically, it''s asking if the New Jersey zip code is located east of the
      North Carolina zip code.


      To answer this, I need to consider the geographic locations of these states
      and zip codes.


      First, I know that New Jersey (NJ) is located on the East Coast of the United
      States, and North Carolina (NC) is also on the East Coast but further south.


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New Jersey is generally located to the east of North Carolina.

      - The entire state of New Jersey is east of North Carolina on a map of the United
      States.


      Since 08080 is a zip code in New Jersey, and 28107 is a zip code in North Carolina,
      and I know that New Jersey is east of North Carolina, I can conclude that 08080,

      28107, NC?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 08080 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 28107 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic positioning of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the northeastern Atlantic coast of the United States

      - North Carolina is also on the Atlantic coast, but further south


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Looking at a map of the United States, New Jersey is positioned entirely to
      the east of North Carolina

      - This is because the Atlantic coastline curves, with the northeastern states
      (including NJ) extending further east than the southeastern states (including
      NC)


      YES, 08080, NJ is located east of 28107, NC.'

      08080 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ).

      28107 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC).


      In terms of US geography, New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard of the

      south.


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New Jersey is generally located to the east of North Carolina.

      - Looking at the map of the US, the entire state of New Jersey is east of North
      Carolina.


      So based on the locations of these states, 08080, NJ would be east of 28107,

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      - 08080 is a ZIP code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 28107 is a ZIP code in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic locations of these states.

      - New Jersey is on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - North Carolina is also on the eastern seaboard, but south of New Jersey


      Step 3: Consider the east-west relationship.

      In general, on the US east coast, the states tend to be arranged such that the
      more northern states (like NJ) are also slightly more eastward than southern
      states (like NC) because the coastline curves. New Jersey is northeast of North
      Carolina.

      - 28107 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the northeastern Atlantic coast of the United States

      - North Carolina is also on the Atlantic coast, but further south


      Step 3: Examine east-west positioning.

      The eastern coastline of the United States curves, with the northeastern states
      (including New Jersey) extending further east into the Atlantic Ocean than the
      southeastern states (including North Carolina).


      Step 4: Conclude based on state positions.

      Since New Jersey is positioned east of North Carolina on the map of the United
      States (due to the curvature of the coastline), any location in New Jersey (including
      08080) would be east of any location in North Carolina (including 28107).

      I need to determine if the Mississippi zip code is east of the Oklahoma zip

      The United States is laid out such that states in the eastern part of the country
      have lower longitude values than states in the western part. Mississippi is
      in the southeastern part of the US, while Oklahoma is more centrally located
      but west of Mississippi.


      If we look at a map of the United States, Mississippi is definitely east of
      Oklahoma. Looking at their geographic positions:

      - Mississippi is on the Gulf Coast in the southeastern US

      - Oklahoma is in the south-central US


      Given the general geography of the US, any location in Mississippi would be
      east of any location in Oklahoma. This is because Mississippi as a state is
      entirely east of Oklahoma.

      - 73801 is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship of these states.

      Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States along the Gulf Coast,
      while Oklahoma is in the south-central United States.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Mississippi is entirely east of Oklahoma.
      The Mississippi River roughly forms Mississippi''s western border, and Oklahoma
      is several states west of this.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Since Mississippi is geographically east of Oklahoma, any location in Mississippi

      Then I need to determine their relative positions (east/west) on the US map.


      Mississippi is a state in the southeastern United States, bordering the Gulf
      of Mexico to the south, Alabama to the east, Tennessee to the north, Arkansas
      to the northwest, and Louisiana to the west.


      Oklahoma is a state in the south central United States, bordered by Kansas to
      the north, Missouri to the northeast, Arkansas to the east, Texas to the south
      and west, New Mexico to the west, and Colorado to the northwest.


      Looking at the US map, Mississippi is clearly east of Oklahoma. So in general,

      First, I need to identify the locations:

      - 06712 is a zip code in Connecticut (CT)

      - 33330 is a zip code in Florida (FL)


      Now, to determine if one location is east of another, I need to consider their
      relative positions on a map of the United States.


      Connecticut (CT) is located in the northeastern United States.

      Florida (FL) is located in the southeastern United States.


      When comparing east-west positions in the US, we need to consider longitude.
      Eastern locations have lower longitude values than western locations.


      Connecticut is generally positioned to the east of Florida on a map of the United
      States. Connecticut is on the Atlantic coast in New England, while Florida extends
      southward with its eastern coast also on the Atlantic, but at a more western
      longitude than Connecticut.


      So zip code 06712 in CT would be east of zip code 33330 in FL.</think>To determine
      if 06712, CT is east of 33330, FL, I need to consider the geographic positions

      Connecticut (CT) is in the Northeast region of the United States.

      Florida (FL) is in the Southeast region of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      On a map of the United States, Connecticut is positioned significantly to the
      east of Florida. While both states have coastlines on the Atlantic Ocean, Connecticut
      is further east in terms of longitude.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      While specific zip codes within states can vary in position, the distance between
      Connecticut and Florida is significant enough that any zip code in CT would
      be east of any zip code in FL.


      Therefore, 06712, CT is indeed located east of 33330, FL.

      33330 is a zip code in Florida. Florida extends quite far to the southeast of
      the US mainland.


      In general, locations in Connecticut would be east of locations in Florida because
      Connecticut is further east on the US map. Connecticut is in the northeastern
      part of the US while Florida is in the southeastern part and extends south into
      the Atlantic.


      So yes, 06712, CT is east of 33330, FL.</think>To determine if 06712, CT is

      - 06712 is in Connecticut (CT), which is in the northeastern United States.

      - 33330 is in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geography of the US east coast.

      - Connecticut lies along the northeastern Atlantic coast.

      - Florida extends south along the southeastern coast, forming a peninsula.


      Step 3: Compare longitudinal positions.

      - Connecticut is positioned further east in terms of longitude compared to the
      Florida mainland.

      - Even the easternmost parts of Florida are generally west of Connecticut.


      Step 4: Make the comparison specific to these zip codes.

      - 06712 (CT) is in the western part of Connecticut but still east of Florida.

      - 33330 (FL) is in the southern part of Florida (in the Fort Lauderdale area).

      this problem.


      I need to determine if 06712, CT (Connecticut) is located east of 33330, FL
      (Florida).


      Step 1: I need to know the relative geographical positions of Connecticut and
      Florida within the US.

      Connecticut is a New England state in the northeastern United States.

      Florida is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: In terms of east-west positioning, I need to consider longitude.

      - Connecticut is generally farther east than Florida

      - The eastern US coastline angles such that New England states are east of southeastern
      states


      Step 3: While specific zip codes could potentially be in unusual parts of each
      state, this wouldn''t change the general relationship between CT and FL. Connecticut
      as a whole is east of Florida.


      So 06712, CT should be east of 33330, FL.</think># Is 06712, CT located east
      of 33330, FL?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these zip codes by examining their
      states'' locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 06712 is in Connecticut (CT)

      - 33330 is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      - While both states are on the eastern seaboard, Connecticut is significantly
      farther north

      - The US Atlantic coastline angles from southwest to northeast

      - This means northeastern states like Connecticut are positioned east of southeastern
      states like Florida


      Therefore, 06712, CT is indeed located east of 33330, FL.


      YES'

      \nTo determine which one is more easterly, I need to consider their relative\

      east of 77340, TX, I need to figure out where these zip codes are located geographically,
      and then determine their relative positions (east/west).


      Step 1: Locate the zip codes.

      - 30342 is in Georgia (GA), which is in the southeastern United States.

      - 77340 is in Texas (TX), which is in the south-central United States.


      Step 2: Consider their general geographic positions.

      Georgia is located to the east of Texas on a US map. The entire state of Georgia
      is east of the entire state of Texas.


      Step 3: Verify specific zip code locations.

      While I don''t have the exact coordinates of these specific zip codes, I know
      that:

      - Georgia is entirely east of Texas

      - 30342 is in Georgia

      - 77340 is in Texas


      Therefore, 30342, GA must be located east of 77340, TX based on the general
      geographic layout of the United States.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the geographic locations of these zip codes.

      - 30342 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)

      - 77340 is a zip code in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, while Texas is in the
      south-central United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      On a US map, Georgia is entirely east of Texas. The easternmost point of Texas
      is still west of the westernmost point of Georgia.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 30342 is in Georgia and 77340 is in Texas, and Georgia is east of Texas,
      it follows that 30342 must be east of 77340.

      30342 in Georgia (GA) is located east of zip code 77340 in Texas (TX).


      To solve this, I need to consider the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      First, let''s think about the general geographic position of Georgia and Texas
      within the United States:

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, on the Atlantic coast

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States, bordering the Gulf of
      Mexico


      Generally speaking, Georgia is east of Texas. The entire state of Georgia is
      east of the entire state of Texas.


      Now, let''s consider the specific zip codes:

      - 30342 is in GA, which is likely in or near Atlanta (since 303xx zip codes
      are often in that area)

      - 77340 is in TX, which could be in various parts of Texas


      Since Georgia is entirely east of Texas, any location in Georgia (including
      30342) would be east of any location in Texas (including 77340).


      Therefore, yes, 30342, GA is located east of 77340, TX.</think># Is 30342, GA
      located east of 77340, TX?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 30342 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 77340 is in Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States, bordering the Gulf of
      Mexico

      - On a map of the United States, Georgia is positioned entirely east of Texas


      ## Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      - Since Georgia is entirely east of Texas, any location in Georgia (including
      30342) must be east of any location in Texas (including 77340)

      - The specific locations within each state don''t change this east-west relationship

      30342, GA is located east of zip code 77340, TX.


      To answer this, I need to determine the geographic locations of these zip codes
      and compare their longitude coordinates. Lower longitude values are further
      east in the United States.


      Let''s think about what I know about US geography:

      - Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States, on the Atlantic
      coast

      - Texas (TX) is located in the south-central United States, bordering the Gulf
      of Mexico


      Generally speaking, Georgia is east of Texas in the United States. But to be
      precise about these specific zip codes:


      30342 is a zip code in Georgia, likely in or near Atlanta which is in the northern
      part of the state.

      77340 is a zip code in Texas, but I don''t immediately know where in Texas it''s
      located.


      However, the entire state of Georgia is east of the entire state of Texas. Since
      30342 is in Georgia and 77340 is in Texas, it''s almost certainly the case that
      30342 is east of 77340.


      So yes, 30342, GA should be located east of 77340, TX.</think># Is 30342, GA

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these
      zip codes based on their geographic locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 30342 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 77340 is in Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States along the Atlantic coast

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States, bordering the Gulf of
      Mexico

      - On a map of the United States, Georgia is positioned entirely east of Texas


      ## Step 3: Apply this to specific zip codes

      Since Georgia is completely east of Texas, any location in Georgia (including
      zip code 30342) would be east of any location in Texas (including zip code 77340).


      YES, 30342, GA is located east of 77340, TX.'

      Let me analyze:


      Zip code 30342 is in Georgia (GA). Georgia is located in the southeastern United
      States.

      Zip code 77340 is in Texas (TX). Texas is located in the south-central United

      In terms of geography, Georgia is east of Texas. The United States generally
      has states arranged with Pacific coastal states in the west, and Atlantic coastal
      states in the east. Texas borders the Gulf of Mexico, while Georgia is on the
      Atlantic coast side of the country.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States, extending from the Gulf
      of Mexico in the southeast to the southwest of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Georgia is positioned to the east of Texas on the U.S. map.

      - All of Georgia is east of all of Texas.


      Step 4: Since the zip codes are in their respective states, 30342 in GA must
      be east of 77340 in TX.

      Connecticut (CT) is in the northeastern US, specifically in New England.

      Ohio (OH) is in the midwestern US.


      Geographically, Connecticut is east of Ohio. The entire state of Connecticut

      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Recall the general geographic positions of New York state and Georgia state

      2. Consider that "east" in the US generally means closer to the Atlantic coast


      New York state is in the northeastern United States, while Georgia is in the
      southeastern United States. When looking at a map of the US, New York is positioned
      to the east and north of Georgia.


      Specifically:

      - New York is on the east coast of the US

      - Georgia is also on the east coast, but further south

      - In terms of east-west positioning, New York is generally east of Georgia

      New York is located in the northeastern United States, while Georgia is in the
      southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Think about east-west positioning specifically.

      On a map of the United States, New York is positioned to the east of Georgia.
      The East Coast states generally follow the Atlantic coastline, with the northeastern
      states (including New York) being further east than the southeastern states
      (including Georgia).


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      While specific zip codes might vary in exact longitude within their states,
      the overall state positions determine that any location in New York would be
      east of any location in Georgia.

      Based on this pattern:

      - 10918 starts with "1", which is in the Northeast region

      - 30346 starts with "3", which is in the South region


      New York is definitely in the Northeast, and Georgia is in the South. On a map

      in the southeastern part. On a map of the US, New York would be to the right
      (east) of Georgia.


      Since 10918 is in New York, and 30346 is in Georgia, it follows that 10918,
      NY is east of 30346, GA.</think># Is 10918, NY located east of 30346, GA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states and their locations

      - 10918 is in New York (NY), which is in the northeastern United States

      - 30346 is in Georgia (GA), which is in the southeastern United States


      ## Step 2: Compare their positions on the east-west axis

      - In the United States, longitude determines east-west position (lower longitude
      = more east)

      - New York is located significantly east of Georgia on the US map

      - All of New York state is east of all of Georgia state


      ## Step 3: Specific zip codes

      - Since 10918 is in NY and 30346 is in GA, the NY zip code must be east of the
      GA zip code

      - The specific locations within their states don''t change this east-west relationship


      YES'

      - 75025 is in Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Analyze the geographic positions

      In the United States, Minnesota is located in the upper Midwest, while Texas
      is in the south-central part of the country.


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positions

      Looking at a map of the United States, Minnesota is positioned to the northeast
      of Texas. The entire state of Minnesota is east of Texas on the east-west axis.


      ## Step 4: Verify with zip code logic

      US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to be assigned
      to the eastern parts of the country and higher numbers to the western parts.
      The first digit "5" for Minnesota versus "7" for Texas supports that Minnesota
      is east of Texas.


      Therefore, YES, 55043, MN is located east of 75025, TX.'

      Let me break this down:

      1. 08628 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      2. 38834 is a zip code in Mississippi (MS)

      3. I need to determine if the NJ location is east of the MS location


      The United States generally has states arranged with the East Coast states (like
      New Jersey) being east of the central and southern states (like Mississippi).
      Looking at a mental map of the US:


      - New Jersey is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Mississippi is in the southern part of the United States, bordering the Gulf
      of Mexico, and is significantly west of New Jersey


      Since the US mainland spans from west to east, and New Jersey is on the East
      Coast while Mississippi is much further west, it''s clear that any location
      in New Jersey would be east of any location in Mississippi.


      Therefore, 08628, NJ is indeed east of 38834, MS.</think>To determine if 08628,

      - 08628 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 38834 is in Mississippi (MS)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Mississippi is located in the southern United States, considerably west of
      New Jersey


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      - All of New Jersey is east of all of Mississippi on the US map

      - The easternmost point of Mississippi is still west of the westernmost point
      of New Jersey


      Therefore, zip code 08628 in New Jersey must be east of zip code 38834 in Mississippi.

      whether one zip code location in NJ is east of another location in MS.


      Let me break this down:

      1. 08628 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      2. 38834 is a zip code in Mississippi (MS)

      3. I need to determine if the NJ location is east of the MS location


      The United States geography is such that:

      - New Jersey is on the East Coast

      - Mississippi is in the South/Southeast, west of New Jersey


      Looking at the relative positions of these states:

      - New Jersey is approximately at the eastern edge of the United States

      - Mississippi is considerably west of New Jersey


      Since New Jersey is on the East Coast and Mississippi is further inland and
      west, any location in New Jersey would be east of any location in Mississippi.


      Therefore, 08628, NJ is east of 38834, MS.</think>To determine if 08628, NJ
      is located east of 38834, MS, I need to consider the geographic positions of
      these locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 08628 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 38834 is in Mississippi (MS)


      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of these states on the US map.

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Mississippi is located in the southern United States, much further west than
      New Jersey


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Since New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast and Mississippi is several states
      inland to the west, any location in New Jersey would be east of any location
      in Mississippi.


      YES, 08628, NJ is located east of 38834, MS.'

      of 44012, OH, I need to know the geographical locations of these zip codes.


      07052 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ), specifically in West Orange, NJ.

      44012 is a zip code in Ohio (OH), specifically in Avon, OH.


      Now I need to think about the relative positions of these states:

      - New Jersey is on the east coast of the United States

      - Ohio is in the Midwest, west of New Jersey


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - New Jersey borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east

      - Ohio is several states inland from the Atlantic coast

      - Ohio is west of Pennsylvania, which is west of New Jersey


      Since New Jersey is east of Ohio on a map of the United States, any location
      in New Jersey (including West Orange, 07052) would be east of any location in
      Ohio (including Avon, 44012).</think># Is 07052, NJ east of 44012, OH?


      I need to identify the locations and compare their east-west positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 07052 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 44012 is in Ohio (OH)


      ## Step 2: Determine relative geographic positions

      New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States, while Ohio is
      in the Midwest region. On a map of the United States, New Jersey is significantly
      east of Ohio.


      ## Step 3: Compare zip code locations

      Since these zip codes are in their respective states, and New Jersey as a whole
      is east of Ohio, it follows that any location in New Jersey (including 07052)
      would be east of any location in Ohio (including 44012).

      07052 is a ZIP code in New Jersey (NJ).

      44012 is a ZIP code in Ohio (OH).


      In the United States, states along the east coast are generally more eastern
      than inland states. New Jersey is on the east coast of the United States, while
      Ohio is more inland.


      Specifically:

      - New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast

      - Ohio is in the Midwest, to the west of New Jersey


      Since New Jersey is east of Ohio on the map of the United States, and ZIP codes
      within these states maintain this general east-west relationship, 07052 in NJ
      would be east of 44012 in OH.


      So my answer is YES, 07052, NJ is located east of 44012, OH.</think>I''ll solve

      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast in the eastern United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region, west of New Jersey


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, New Jersey is clearly east of
      Ohio

      - All of New Jersey is east of all of Ohio


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific ZIP codes.

      - Since 07052 is in New Jersey, and 44012 is in Ohio, the New Jersey ZIP code
      must be east of the Ohio ZIP code

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 07052 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 44012 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      Now, I need to think about the geographical positions of these states. The United
      States is oriented such that the East Coast is on the eastern edge of the country
      bordering the Atlantic Ocean, and states generally become more western as you
      move inland.


      New Jersey (NJ) is a state located on the East Coast of the United States.

      Ohio (OH) is a state in the Midwest region, located inland from the East Coast.


      Geographically speaking, New Jersey is east of Ohio. Since zip code 07052 is
      in New Jersey and zip code 44012 is in Ohio, it follows that 07052, NJ is east
      of 44012, OH.</think>I need to determine if a zip code in New Jersey is east
      of a zip code in Ohio by considering their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 07052 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 44012 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states within the United
      States.

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States, bordering the
      Atlantic Ocean.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region, inland from the East Coast.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, New Jersey is clearly east of
      Ohio.

      - All locations in New Jersey are east of all locations in Ohio, regardless
      of the specific zip codes within these states.


      Therefore, zip code 07052 in New Jersey is indeed east of zip code 44012 in
      Ohio.

      is located east of 29388, SC. This is a geographic question about the relative
      positions of two zip codes.


      First, let me identify the states:

      - 08062 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 29388 is in South Carolina (SC)


      Next, I need to think about the general geographic positions of these states
      in the US:

      - New Jersey is on the east coast of the United States

      - South Carolina is also on the east coast, but is south of New Jersey


      In terms of east/west positioning:

      - New Jersey is typically further east than South Carolina on a map of the United
      States

      - The east coast of the US curves, with the northeastern states (like NJ) generally
      being further east than southeastern states (like SC)


      So based on the general geographic knowledge of US states, I would say that
      locations in New Jersey are typically east of locations in South Carolina. The
      specific zip codes might matter for very close cases, but given that these are
      in different states with clear relative positioning, it''s reasonable to conclude
      that 08062, NJ is east of 29388, SC.</think>To determine if 08062, NJ is located

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 08062 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 29388 is in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic position of these states

      - New Jersey is located on the northeastern Atlantic coast of the United States

      - South Carolina is located on the southeastern Atlantic coast of the United
      States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning

      - The east coast of the US curves, with northeastern states being further east
      than southeastern states

      - New Jersey is positioned more to the east than South Carolina on the map

      - All of New Jersey is east of all of South Carolina in terms of longitude


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion

      Since New Jersey is entirely east of South Carolina geographically, any zip
      code in NJ (including 08062) would be east of any zip code in SC (including
      29388).

      on the West Coast.


      New Jersey is a state on the East Coast of the United States, while South Carolina
      is also on the East Coast but further south.


      When comparing east-west positions, I need to consider their longitudes. Lower
      (more negative) longitude values in the western hemisphere represent more western
      locations, while higher (less negative or closer to zero) longitude values represent
      more eastern locations.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United States

      - South Carolina is also on the Atlantic coast, but further south


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes (east-west positioning).

      - New Jersey is generally positioned more to the east than South Carolina

      - The eastern edge of NJ extends further into the Atlantic Ocean than SC

      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Understand the relative geographical positions of New Jersey and South Carolina

      2. Confirm if this relationship holds for these specific zip codes


      In terms of US geography, New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard of the
      United States, while South Carolina is also on the eastern seaboard but further

      In terms of east-west positioning, New Jersey is generally east of South Carolina.
      The entire state of New Jersey is east of the entire state of South Carolina.


      Since zip code 08062 is in New Jersey, and zip code 29388 is in South Carolina,
      and given that New Jersey as a whole is east of South Carolina as a whole, it
      follows that 08062, NJ would be east of 29388, SC.</think># Is 08062, NJ located

      - 29388 is in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Think about the geography of the United States.

      New Jersey is located on the east coast of the United States, while South Carolina
      is also on the east coast but further south.


      In terms of east-west positioning, I need to consider their relative longitudes.
      States on the eastern seaboard generally run from northeast to southwest, so
      the northern states tend to be further east than southern states along the coast.


      New Jersey is significantly north of South Carolina. Given the shape of the
      US east coast, New Jersey tends to be further east than South Carolina. The
      eastern part of NJ would definitely be east of SC.


      Step 3: To be more precise, zip code 08062 appears to be in southern New Jersey.
      Even southern NJ is generally east of South Carolina due to the curvature of

      - 29388 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider their positions on the map.

      New Jersey is located on the northeastern Atlantic coast of the United States,
      while South Carolina is also on the Atlantic coast but further south.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      The Atlantic coastline of the United States curves in a northeasterly direction.

      88048 in New Mexico is located east of zip code 91352 in California.


      In the United States, states are positioned such that:

      - California (CA) is on the west coast

      - New Mexico (NM) is in the southwestern part of the country, but east of California


      Generally, states follow this rough west-to-east ordering:

      Hawaii -> Alaska -> Washington/Oregon/California -> Nevada/Idaho/Arizona/Utah
      -> Montana/Wyoming/Colorado/New Mexico -> and so on eastward


      So geographically, New Mexico is east of California. Now, the specific zip codes
      might matter if they were very close to the border, but given that these are
      in different states with California and New Mexico not even sharing a border
      (Arizona is between them), I can confidently say that any location in New Mexico
      would be east of any location in California.


      Therefore, 88048, NM is east of 91352, CA.</think>To determine if 88048, NM
      is located east of 91352, CA, I need to consider the geographic positions of
      these locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 88048 is in New Mexico (NM)

      - 91352 is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      California is located on the west coast of the United States, while New Mexico
      is located in the southwestern part of the country. Importantly, New Mexico
      is positioned east of California (with Arizona in between them).


      Step 3: Consider if specific zip code locations might change this relationship.

      Even though zip codes represent specific areas within states, the entire state
      of New Mexico lies east of California. There''s no part of New Mexico that extends
      west of any part of California.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      Since New Mexico is entirely east of California, any location in New Mexico
      (including zip code 88048) must be east of any location in California (including
      zip code 91352).

      to determine if the zip code 88048 in New Mexico (NM) is located east of zip
      code 91352 in California (CA). I''ll need to figure out the locations of these
      zip codes and compare their relative positions.


      1. First, let''s establish the general geography: New Mexico is a state located
      east of California. In the United States, states on the east have larger longitude
      values (less negative, since US longitudes are in the western hemisphere) than
      states on the west.


      2. 88048 is a zip code in New Mexico (NM)

      3. 91352 is a zip code in California (CA)


      Since California is on the west coast and New Mexico is several states to the
      east, geographically speaking, any location in New Mexico would be east of any
      location in California.


      So zip code 88048 in NM is located east of zip code 91352 in CA.</think># Is
      88048, NM located east of 91352, CA?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 88048 is in New Mexico (NM)

      - 91352 is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New Mexico is located inland, to the east of California


      Step 3: Consider the relative positioning.

      Since New Mexico is entirely east of California on the US map, any location
      in New Mexico (including zip code 88048) would be east of any location in California
      (including zip code 91352).

      88048 is a zip code in New Mexico (NM).

      91352 is a zip code in California (CA).


      Generally, New Mexico is located east of California in the United States. The
      entire state of New Mexico is east of California, as California is on the west
      coast of the US, while New Mexico is inland, in the southwestern part of the
      country.


      Since 88048 is in New Mexico and 91352 is in California, and New Mexico is east
      of California, that would mean that 88048, NM is located east of 91352, CA.


      Let me double-check this by thinking about the general layout of the US. Going
      from west to east:

      - Pacific Ocean

      - California (west coast)

      - Arizona

      - New Mexico

      - (then other states further east)

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New Mexico is located inland, in the southwestern United States

      - In terms of relative positioning, New Mexico is east of California


      Since 88048 is in New Mexico and 91352 is in California, and New Mexico is east
      of California geographically, the zip code in New Mexico must be east of the

      step.


      First, let me identify these zip codes:

      - 85132 is in Arizona (AZ)

      - 98311 is in Washington state (WA)


      To determine if one location is east of another, I need to consider their relative
      positions on a map of the United States.


      Washington state is located in the Pacific Northwest, at the northwestern corner
      of the contiguous United States.


      Arizona is located in the southwestern United States.


      If we consider positions from west to east:

      - Washington is on the west coast

      - Arizona is inland from the west coast, but still in the western United States


      Generally speaking, Arizona is east of Washington state. This is because Washington
      is right on the Pacific coast, while Arizona is several states inland.


      So a zip code in Arizona (85132) would typically be east of a zip code in Washington
      (98311).</think>To determine if 85132, AZ is east of 98311, WA, I need to consider
      the geographic positions of these locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 85132 is in Arizona (AZ)

      - 98311 is in Washington state (WA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Washington is located in the Pacific Northwest, at the northwestern corner
      of the contiguous United States.

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Washington state is on the west coast directly along the Pacific Ocean. Arizona
      is inland from the west coast but still in the western United States.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Washington is at the far western edge of the country, and Arizona is positioned
      to the east of Washington''s longitude, zip code 85132 in Arizona would be east
      of zip code 98311 in Washington.

      85132 in Arizona is east of zip code 98311 in Washington. Let me think about
      this in terms of US geography.


      The US zip code system generally follows patterns where:

      - Lower numbers tend to be in the eastern US

      - Higher numbers tend to be in the western US


      However, this pattern isn''t perfect for determining relative east-west positioning.


      What I do know:

      - AZ (Arizona) is in the southwestern US

      - WA (Washington) is in the northwestern US


      Looking at US geography, Washington state is on the Pacific coast in the northwest
      corner of the contiguous United States, while Arizona is in the southwest, bordering
      Mexico.


      When comparing east-west positioning, Washington is definitely west of Arizona.
      Washington is right on the Pacific coast, while Arizona is inland and east of
      California.


      So if 85132 is in Arizona, and 98311 is in Washington, then 85132 would be east
      of 98311 regardless of where exactly in those states they are located.</think>I''ll
      think through this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the states where these zip codes are located.

      - 85132 is in Arizona (AZ)

      - 98311 is in Washington (WA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these states.

      - Washington is in the northwestern United States, bordering the Pacific Ocean

      - Arizona is in the southwestern United States, but inland (not on the coast)


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Washington is at the western edge of the continental US

      - Arizona is east of California, Nevada, and other western coastal states

      - On a map, Arizona is clearly east of Washington


      Step 4: Confirm the relative positions of the specific zip codes.

      - While specific zip codes might be in different parts of their states, the
      entire state of Arizona lies east of the entire state of Washington


      Therefore, 85132, AZ is indeed east of 98311, WA.

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 85132 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ)

      - 98311 is a zip code in Washington state (WA)


      To determine which is further east, I need to think about the relative positions
      of these states in the US:


      - Washington state is on the west coast of the United States, in the Pacific
      Northwest. It''s one of the westernmost states.

      - Arizona is in the southwestern United States, east of California.


      In terms of longitude (east-west position):

      - Washington state is further west than Arizona

      - Arizona is further east than Washington


      Therefore, any location in Arizona would generally be east of any location in
      Washington state. This includes the zip codes 85132 (AZ) and 98311 (WA).


      So 85132, AZ is located east of 98311, WA.</think># Is 85132, AZ located east

      - 85132 is in Arizona (AZ)

      - 98311 is in Washington (WA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Washington is located on the far northwestern coast of the contiguous United
      States

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States


      ## Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      - Washington lies along the Pacific coast, making it one of the westernmost
      states

      - Arizona is considerably inland from the Pacific coast and is east of Washington


      ## Step 4: Conclusion about the zip codes

      Since Arizona is east of Washington state, any zip code in Arizona (including
      85132) would be east of any zip code in Washington (including 98311).

      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - Arizona (AZ) is in the southwestern United States

      - Washington (WA) is in the northwestern United States


      Generally speaking, Washington is located on the west coast, while Arizona is
      more inland and to the southeast of Washington.


      In terms of longitude:

      - Washington state is on the Pacific coast, so it has western longitudes

      - Arizona is inland but still in the western United States, also with western
      longitudes

      - However, since Washington is further west on the map than Arizona, Arizona
      would be east of Washington


      So zip code 85132 in Arizona would be east of zip code 98311 in Washington.


      Let me double-check this thinking: If I were to travel from Washington to Arizona,

      4) Arizona is an inland state located southeast of Washington

      5) In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), Washington is further west

      1. Find the general location of 12549, NY

      2. Find the general location of 43160, OH

      3. Compare their east-west positions (longitude)


      In the US, locations further east have smaller longitude values. New York (NY)
      is a state on the east coast, while Ohio (OH) is more in the midwest. Generally
      speaking, NY is east of OH.


      Let''s be more specific about these zip codes:


      12549 is a zip code in New York state. New York is on the eastern seaboard of
      the United States.

      43160 is a zip code in Ohio state. Ohio is in the midwest, west of New York

      In the United States, states on the east coast are generally east of states

      Since this is about US geography, I know that generally speaking, New York state

      specific locations of these zip codes.


      12549 is a zip code in New York (NY).

      43160 is a zip code in Ohio (OH).


      In the United States, states that are more eastern generally have lower first
      digits in their zip codes, and states that are more western have higher first
      digits. However, this is not always perfectly accurate, so I should be careful.


      New York zip codes typically start with 1, while Ohio zip codes typically start
      with 4. This is consistent with New York being east of Ohio, since the general
      pattern of the first digit of zip codes in the US increases as you move west.


      Given that:

      1. New York is east of Ohio on the US map

      2. Zip code 12549 (NY) starts with 1, which is consistent with eastern states

      3. Zip code 43160 (OH) starts with 4, which is consistent with more central

      - 43160 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of New York and Ohio in the

      of states can have different relative positions.

      12549 is in NY, which is entirely east of Ohio.

      43160 is in OH, which is entirely west of New York.

      The United States is arranged such that eastern states are generally to the
      right on a map, and western states are to the left. Texas is located in the
      south-central part of the US, while Indiana is in the Midwest, more toward the
      eastern part of the country.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region, bordering Illinois, Michigan, Ohio,
      and Kentucky

      - Texas is located in the south-central region, bordering New Mexico, Oklahoma,
      Arkansas, and Louisiana


      When comparing their relative positions on a US map, Indiana is indeed east

      - Indiana is positioned significantly east of Texas on the US map

      - Texas is west of Indiana in terms of longitude


      Since Indiana (where 46567 is located) is positioned east of Texas (where 78229

      is located east of 45439, OH.


      First, let me identify where these ZIP codes are located:

      - 23834 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 45439 is in Ohio (OH)


      In the United States, Virginia is located on the East Coast, while Ohio is more
      inland and west of Virginia. Generally speaking, locations in Virginia will
      be east of locations in Ohio.


      To confirm this, I can think about the general geography of the US:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region

      - Virginia is on the Atlantic coast in the Mid-Atlantic region


      So geographically, Virginia is east of Ohio on a map of the United States. Without
      looking at the specific cities associated with these ZIP codes, the state-level
      information is sufficient to determine that 23834 in Virginia would be east
      of 45439 in Ohio.</think>To determine if 23834, VA is located east of 45439,
      OH, I need to analyze the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 23834 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 45439 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Virginia is located on the East Coast of the United States, while Ohio is further
      inland in the Midwest region.


      Step 3: Determine the directional relationship.

      On a map of the United States, Virginia is positioned to the east of Ohio. The
      entire state of Virginia lies east of Ohio.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 23834 is in Virginia and 45439 is in Ohio, and Virginia is east of Ohio,
      it follows that 23834, VA is east of 45439, OH.

      First, I''ll think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Virginia (VA) is on the east coast of the United States

      - Ohio (OH) is in the Midwest, inland from the east coast

      - Generally speaking, states on the east coast are east of states in the Midwest


      So geographically speaking, Virginia is generally east of Ohio. However, I should
      be careful because zip codes near the border of states could potentially change
      this relationship.


      Let me think about the specific zip codes:

      - 23834 is in VA (Virginia)

      - 45439 is in OH (Ohio)


      Since Virginia as a whole state is east of Ohio, and these zip codes don''t

      - Virginia is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest, inland from the East Coast


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east axis

      - Ohio is west of Virginia

      - Even the easternmost parts of Ohio are generally west of the westernmost parts
      of Virginia


      Step 4: Consider the specific zip codes

      - 23834 is in Chesterfield County, VA, in the eastern part of Virginia

      - 45439 is in the Dayton area of Ohio, in the western half of Ohio


      Since Virginia is entirely east of Ohio, and these specific zip codes don''t

      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east axis.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Ohio is positioned to the west of Virginia.
      The entire state of Virginia lies east of Ohio.

      to determine the geographical locations of these two zip codes and compare them.


      80130, CO refers to a zip code in Colorado.

      85255, AZ refers to a zip code in Arizona.


      Now I need to figure out their relative east-west positions. On a map of the
      United States:

      - Colorado is to the east of Arizona (Arizona borders California on the west,
      while Colorado is one state to the east of Arizona, with New Mexico in between)

      - Therefore, generally speaking, locations in Colorado tend to be east of locations
      in Arizona


      To be more specific about these particular zip codes:

      - 80130 is likely in the eastern part of Colorado (zip codes in western states
      often start with lower numbers in the west and increase as you go east)

      - 85255 is likely in the central or eastern part of Arizona


      Even if 80130 is in western Colorado and 85255 is in eastern Arizona, Colorado
      as a whole is still east of Arizona, so the Colorado zip code would be east
      of the Arizona zip code.


      So, 80130, CO should be east of 85255, AZ.</think>I need to determine the relative
      east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 80130 is in Colorado (CO)

      - 85255 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - On a U.S. map, Colorado is located directly east of Utah, which borders Arizona.

      - Arizona is in the southwestern United States, while Colorado is more centrally
      located.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - All of Colorado is east of Arizona on a map.

      - Even the westernmost part of Colorado is still east of the easternmost part
      of Arizona.


      Step 4: Therefore, any location in Colorado (including 80130) would be east
      of any location in Arizona (including 85255).


      YES'

      zip code 80130, CO (Colorado) is located east of 85255, AZ (Arizona).


      First, let me recall the general geographic orientation of these states:

      - Colorado is located east of Arizona in the United States

      - Arizona is in the southwestern US, while Colorado is more central/mountain
      west


      Since we''re dealing with specific zip codes, I should consider their locations
      within their states:

      - 80130 is in Colorado, which appears to be in the central/eastern part of the
      state (possibly near Denver)

      - 85255 is in Arizona, likely in the Phoenix metropolitan area


      Given that Colorado as a whole is east of Arizona, and without any unusual geographic
      anomalies where these specific zip codes would reverse this relationship, the
      zip code in Colorado (80130) should be east of the zip code in Arizona (85255).


      So 80130, CO should be located east of 85255, AZ.</think># Is 80130, CO located
      east of 85255, AZ?


      I need to determine the relative locations of these zip codes by examining their
      states and positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 80130 is in Colorado (CO)

      - 85255 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States

      - Colorado is located directly to the east of Arizona


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes within their states.

      - 80130 appears to be in the Denver metropolitan area of Colorado

      - 85255 is in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area of Arizona


      Step 4: Determine relative position.

      Since Colorado is east of Arizona, and these particular zip codes follow the
      general geographic relationship of their states, 80130 (CO) is indeed east of
      85255 (AZ).


      YES'

      these zip codes.


      80130 is a zip code in Colorado (CO).

      85255 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ).


      Now, I need to think about the relative positions of these states. In the United
      States:

      - Colorado is located to the east of Arizona.

      - Arizona is in the southwestern United States, while Colorado is in the Rocky
      Mountain region.


      When looking at a map of the United States, Arizona is to the west of Colorado.
      Since 80130 is in Colorado and 85255 is in Arizona, it follows that 80130, CO
      would be east of 85255, AZ.


      To be even more precise:

      - 80130 appears to be in the Highlands Ranch area, south of Denver in Colorado

      - 85255 appears to be in the Scottsdale area of Arizona


      Looking at the relative positions, the Colorado zip code is definitely east
      of the Arizona zip code.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these zip codes are located.

      - 80130 is in Colorado (CO)

      - 85255 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Colorado is located directly east of Arizona in the United States. You can verify
      this on any US map - Arizona borders the western edge of the Four Corners region,
      while Colorado forms the northeastern part of that region.


      Step 3: Determine if these specific zip codes maintain that same east-west relationship.

      80130 is in the Highlands Ranch area south of Denver, which is in the eastern
      half of Colorado.

      85255 is in the Scottsdale area of Arizona, which is in the central part of
      Arizona.


      Since Colorado as a whole is east of Arizona, and these specific zip codes are
      not in positions within their states that would reverse this relationship, 80130
      is indeed east of 85255.

      First, I should identify what states these zip codes are in:

      - 80130 is in Colorado (CO)

      - 85255 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Geographically, Colorado is located to the east of Arizona. Both states are
      in the western United States, but Colorado is one state to the east of Arizona
      (with New Mexico in between their southern portions).


      More specifically:

      - 80130 is in Colorado, likely in the Denver metropolitan area

      - 85255 is in Arizona, likely in the Phoenix metropolitan area


      Since Colorado is east of Arizona in general, and these zip codes are in their
      respective states, it''s very likely that 80130, CO is east of 85255, AZ.


      To be even more precise, I would need to know the exact longitude of these zip
      codes, but based on the general geography of the United States, the answer is

      - 85255 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      Colorado is located to the east of Arizona on the US map. Arizona borders California
      to its west, while Colorado is positioned one state east of Arizona (with New
      Mexico between their southern portions).


      Step 3: Consider zip code patterns.

      In the US zip code system, generally (though not always) lower numbers tend
      to be used in the eastern parts of the country, with higher numbers in the western
      parts. The fact that the Arizona zip code (85255) has a higher number than the
      Colorado zip code (80130) is consistent with Colorado being east of Arizona.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on geographic knowledge.

      Since Colorado as a state is definitively east of Arizona, a zip code in Colorado
      (80130) would be east of a zip code in Arizona (85255).

      85255 is a zip code in Scottsdale, Arizona, which is in the Phoenix metropolitan
      area in the central-southern part of Arizona.


      Since Colorado is east of Arizona, and these particular zip codes are in standard

      4) 80130 corresponds to Highlands Ranch, Colorado, which is in the eastern half
      of Colorado

      5) 85255 corresponds to Scottsdale, Arizona, which is in central Arizona

      6) Since Colorado is east of Arizona, and these zip codes are in standard locations

      the relative positions of two zip codes: 39530 in Mississippi (MS) and 73142
      in Oklahoma (OK).


      First, let me consider the geographical positions of these states:

      - Mississippi (MS) is in the southeastern United States, bordering the Gulf
      of Mexico

      - Oklahoma (OK) is in the south-central United States


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Mississippi is definitely east of Oklahoma.
      The entire state of Mississippi is east of Oklahoma, with states like Arkansas
      generally lying between them.


      Since zip code 39530 is in MS and 73142 is in OK, and Mississippi is east of
      Oklahoma, we can conclude that 39530, MS is located east of 73142, OK.


      So the answer is YES.</think>I need to determine if a zip code in Mississippi
      is east of a zip code in Oklahoma.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 39530 is in Mississippi (MS)

      - 73142 is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States along the Gulf Coast.

      Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States.


      Step 3: Determine their east-west relationship.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Mississippi is positioned entirely east
      of Oklahoma. The states are not adjacent - Arkansas lies between them.


      Step 4: Apply this state-level relationship to the zip codes.

      Since 39530 is in Mississippi, and 73142 is in Oklahoma, and Mississippi is
      east of Oklahoma, then 39530 must be east of 73142.


      YES'

      1. Identify the states: MS is Mississippi, OK is Oklahoma

      2. Identify the general geographic positions of these states

      3. Determine specifically where these zip codes are within their states

      4. Compare their east-west positioning


      Generally speaking, Mississippi (MS) is located east of Oklahoma (OK) in the
      United States. Mississippi is along the Gulf Coast in the southeastern US, while
      Oklahoma is in the south-central US.


      Let''s be more specific about these zip codes:

      - 39530 is a zip code in MS (Mississippi)

      - 73142 is a zip code in OK (Oklahoma)


      Since Mississippi as a state is entirely east of Oklahoma as a state (Mississippi
      is much further east on the map than Oklahoma), any location in Mississippi
      would be east of any location in Oklahoma.


      Therefore, 39530 in Mississippi would be east of 73142 in Oklahoma.</think>I''ll

      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States along the Gulf Coast,
      while Oklahoma is in the south-central United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Looking at a U.S. map, Mississippi is positioned entirely east of Oklahoma.
      The westernmost point of Mississippi is still east of the easternmost point
      of Oklahoma.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 39530 is in Mississippi and 73142 is in Oklahoma, and Mississippi is east
      of Oklahoma, it follows that 39530 must be east of 73142.

      I''ll think about US geography. The US states are organized roughly as follows
      from west to east:

      - West Coast: Washington, Oregon, California

      - Mountain West: Idaho, Nevada, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, New
      Mexico

      - North Carolina is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest, specifically in the Great Lakes region.


      Step 2: Compare the longitudinal positions (east-west).

      - States on the East Coast (like North Carolina) are generally east of Midwestern
      states (like Michigan).

      - Geographically speaking, North Carolina is east of Michigan.


      Step 3: To be more precise, I should consider the specific zip codes.

      - 28607 is in North Carolina, which would place it in the western part of NC
      (as lower zip codes in the east tend to be in the eastern parts of states)

      - 49337 is in Michigan, which would place it somewhere in Michigan

      Step 2: Consider their relative positions

      - Looking at the US map, North Carolina is positioned to the east and south
      of Michigan

      - Michigan is further west than North Carolina


      Step 3: Compare the specific zip codes

      - While specific zip codes can vary within states, the entire state of North

    a4cb587a-542a-45f8-ab14-fe100922243c: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the geographical locations of the two zip codes and then determine
      which one is further east.


      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - 28607 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 49337 is in Michigan (MI)


      In the US, states in the eastern part of the country have lower zip codes, and
      those in the western part have higher zip codes. However, this isn''t precise
      enough for this question, since we need to compare specific locations.


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - North Carolina is located on the east coast of the US

      - Michigan is in the Midwest, specifically around the Great Lakes


      Looking at a mental map of the US, North Carolina is generally east of Michigan.
      North Carolina borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east, while Michigan is farther
      inland, bordering the Great Lakes.


      So geographically speaking, a location in North Carolina (28607) would typically
      be east of a location in Michigan (49337).</think># Is 28607, NC located east
      of 49337, MI?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 28607 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 49337 is in Michigan (MI)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - North Carolina is located on the Atlantic coast in the eastern United States

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region, situated around the Great Lakes


      ## Step 3: Compare their longitudes

      In the United States, eastern locations have lower longitude values than western
      locations. North Carolina is considerably east of Michigan on the map. North
      Carolina sits along the Atlantic Ocean, while Michigan is further inland.


      ## Step 4: Reach a conclusion

      Any location in North Carolina (including zip code 28607) would be east of any
      location in Michigan (including zip code 49337).


      YES'

      if one zip code is located east of another.


      28607 is in North Carolina (NC).

      49337 is in Michigan (MI).


      To determine which is further east, I need to consider their relative geographical
      positions. The eastern United States has lower longitude values than the western
      United States (since longitude decreases as you move east in the US).


      North Carolina is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while
      Michigan is in the Midwest region. Generally speaking, North Carolina is east
      of Michigan.


      Specifically for these zip codes:

      - 28607 is in North Carolina, which is in the eastern part of the US

      - 49337 is in Michigan, which is more centrally located in the US


      Given their states'' positions, it''s very likely that 28607, NC is east of
      49337, MI.</think># Is 28607, NC located east of 49337, MI?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.

      - 28607 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 49337 is in Michigan (MI)


      ## Step 2: Consider geographical positions

      North Carolina is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while
      Michigan is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region.


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      North Carolina is significantly east of Michigan on the US map. Even the westernmost
      parts of North Carolina are generally east of Michigan''s easternmost points.


      ## Step 4: Conclusion about specific zip codes

      While specific zip codes can sometimes have surprising locations, the general
      state positions make it clear that a zip code in North Carolina (28607) would
      be east of a zip code in Michigan (49337).

      To determine which is east of the other, I need to compare their longitudes.
      The eastern United States has lower (more negative) longitude values than the
      western United States.


      North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States, while Michigan is
      in the midwest. Generally speaking, North Carolina is east of Michigan.


      So my reasoning suggests that 28607, NC is east of 49337, MI.


      Let me double-check my understanding of US geography:

      - North Carolina is on the Atlantic coast in the southeastern US

      - Michigan is in the Great Lakes region in the northern Midwest


      Yes, North Carolina is definitely east of Michigan. So 28607, NC would be east

      - North Carolina is located on the Atlantic coast in the southeastern United
      States

      - Michigan is located in the Great Lakes region in the northern Midwest


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - States on the Atlantic coast (like North Carolina) are generally further east
      than Midwestern states (like Michigan)

      - North Carolina''s position is significantly east of Michigan''s position


      Therefore, 28607, NC is indeed located east of 49337, MI.

      2) 48085 is a zip code in MI (Michigan)


      The question asks whether 08750, NJ is located east of 48085, MI.


      To determine this, I need to know the geographical positions of these states,
      particularly their east-west relationship.


      The United States broadly has:

      - East Coast states (Atlantic Ocean)

      - Midwest states

      - West Coast states (Pacific Ocean)


      New Jersey (NJ) is an East Coast state, located on the Atlantic seaboard.

      Michigan (MI) is a Midwest state, located around the Great Lakes.


      Geographically, New Jersey is positioned to the east of Michigan on a US map.
      States on the East Coast like New Jersey are generally east of Midwest states
      like Michigan.


      So regardless of the specific locations within these states, any location in

      2) 48085 is a zip code in MI (Michigan)


      To determine which is further east, I need to consider the geographical location
      of these states. The United States is oriented so that:

      - East Coast states border the Atlantic Ocean

      - Midwest states are in the interior of the country


      New Jersey is located on the Atlantic Coast (East Coast) of the United States.

      Michigan is a Midwest state located around the Great Lakes.


      On a map of the United States, New Jersey is positioned significantly to the

      east of 48085, MI, I need to know the geographical positions of these zip codes.


      08750 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ). New Jersey is on the east coast of the
      United States.


      48085 is a zip code in Michigan (MI). Michigan is in the midwest of the United
      States.


      Generally speaking, states on the east coast like New Jersey are east of midwestern
      states like Michigan. This is because the United States is oriented such that
      the east coast faces the Atlantic Ocean, and as you move west, you encounter
      the midwestern states, then the western states that face the Pacific Ocean.


      So geographically speaking, any location in New Jersey would be east of any
      location in Michigan.


      Therefore, 08750, NJ is east of 48085, MI.</think>I need to determine if 08750,
      NJ is located east of 48085, MI by considering the geographic positions of these
      zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states these zip codes are in.

      - 08750 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 48085 is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the east coast of the United States

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on a west-to-east basis.

      - The United States generally extends from west to east with the west coast
      on the Pacific Ocean and the east coast on the Atlantic Ocean

      - New Jersey, being on the east coast, is farther east than Michigan, which
      is in the Midwest


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Any location in New Jersey would be east of any location in Michigan

      08750 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ). New Jersey is located on the East Coast
      of the United States.


      48085 is a zip code in Michigan (MI). Michigan is located in the Midwest region
      of the United States.


      Geographically speaking, when comparing states on a west-to-east basis in the
      continental United States:

      - Michigan is in the Midwest

      - New Jersey is on the East Coast


      Since New Jersey is on the East Coast and Michigan is in the Midwest, New Jersey
      is generally east of Michigan.


      Therefore, zip code 08750 in NJ would be east of zip code 48085 in MI.</think>To
      determine if 08750, NJ is east of 48085, MI, I need to analyze their geographical

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 08750 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 48085 is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east basis.

      - The East Coast (where NJ is) is further east than the Midwest (where MI is)

      - All of New Jersey is east of all of Michigan on a map of the United States


      Therefore, zip code 08750 in NJ is located east of zip code 48085 in MI.

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 08750 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 48085 is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states

      - New Jersey is located on the eastern coast of the United States

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      In the United States, states on the eastern coast (like New Jersey) are generally
      east of the Midwest states (like Michigan). So geographically, New Jersey is
      east of Michigan.


      Since 08750 is in New Jersey and 48085 is in Michigan, and New Jersey is east
      of Michigan, it follows that 08750, NJ is located east of 48085, MI.</think>I''ll

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast on the eastern seaboard of the
      United States

      - Michigan is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, significantly west of New Jersey


      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      The United States generally follows a west-to-east orientation from the Pacific
      coast to the Atlantic coast. Michigan is in the interior of the country, while
      New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast and Michigan is in the Midwest, any
      location in New Jersey (including 08750) would be east of any location in Michigan
      (including 48085).

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United States


      Looking at a map of the United States, New Jersey is significantly east of Indiana.
      The entire state of New Jersey is east of Indiana. So any zip code in New Jersey
      would be east of any zip code in Indiana.

      First, let''s identify what these zip codes represent:

      - 11768 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 45342 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      Geographically speaking, I need to consider the east-west positioning of these
      states and locations. In the United States:

      - New York is on the east coast

      - Ohio is in the Midwest, west of New York


      Given the geography of the US, New York is east of Ohio. Any location in New
      York would be east of any location in Ohio on a map of the United States.


      Therefore, 11768, NY would be east of 45342, OH.</think>I''ll determine whether
      the New York zip code is east of the Ohio zip code by examining their geographic
      positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states these zip codes are in.

      - 11768 is in New York (NY)

      - 45342 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region, west of New York


      Step 3: Determine the relative positioning.

      - All of New York state is east of Ohio state

      - Therefore, any zip code in New York would be east of any zip code in Ohio


      Since 11768 is in New York, and 45342 is in Ohio, and New York is east of Ohio,
      the answer is:

      45342 is a ZIP code in Ohio. Ohio is in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Looking at the geographical positions of these states:

      - New York is located east of Ohio

      - All of New York state is east of all of Ohio state


      Since 11768 is in New York and 45342 is in Ohio, and New York is east of Ohio,

      - Geographically, all of New York state is east of all of Ohio state

      - The entire state of New York lies east of Ohio on a map of the United States


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      - Since 11768 is in NY, and 45342 is in OH, and NY is east of OH, the zip code
      11768 must be east of zip code 45342

      11768 is a zip code in New York state (NY).

      45342 is a zip code in Ohio state (OH).


      In the United States, the states are arranged with the east coast on the right
      (east) and the west coast on the left (west) when looking at a map. New York
      is on the east coast, while Ohio is more inland, to the west of New York.


      In general, locations in New York state are east of locations in Ohio state.
      This is because New York is further east in the country than Ohio.


      So, without even needing to find the exact locations of these specific zip codes,

      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region, west of New York


      Step 3: Compare the geographic positions

      - All of New York state is east of all of Ohio state

      - Therefore, any zip code in NY would be east of any zip code in OH


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion

      - Since 11768 is in NY, and 45342 is in OH, the NY zip code must be east of

      2. Determine where 45342, OH is located (which city in Ohio)

      3. Compare their geographical positions (east/west)


      In the United States, generally:

      - New York state is located in the northeastern part of the country

      Since 11768 is in NY and 45342 is in OH, we can reasonably conclude that 11768,
      NY is east of 45342, OH.


      Let me double-check my reasoning: The contiguous United States is organized
      such that states on the East Coast (like New York) are east of inland states

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      New York is located in the northeastern United States, while Ohio is in the
      midwestern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Looking at a map of the United States, New York is clearly east of Ohio. The
      entire state of New York lies to the east of the entire state of Ohio.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      Since 11768 is in NY and 45342 is in OH, and NY is east of OH, it follows that

      step.


      First, I need to understand what these zip codes represent.

      - 20121, VA is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      - 30534, GA is a zip code in Georgia (GA)


      To determine which is east of the other, I''ll need to understand their relative
      geographic positions.


      The eastern United States generally follows this pattern: states on the Atlantic
      coast are the easternmost, and as you move west, you encounter more inland states.


      Virginia (VA) is located on the Atlantic coast and is in the mid-Atlantic region.

      Georgia (GA) is also on the Atlantic coast but is further south and slightly
      more western than Virginia.


      In general, Virginia is east and north of Georgia. However, I need to be careful
      because specific zip codes within these states could have different relative
      positions if they''re at the edges of their respective states.


      That said, Virginia as a whole state is generally east of Georgia. The longitude
      lines run north-south, and locations with lower longitude numbers are further
      east in the US. Virginia typically has lower longitude values (more eastern)
      than Georgia.


      So, based on the general geographic positions of these states, 20121, VA (a
      zip code in Virginia) should be east of 30534, GA (a zip code in Georgia).</think>#

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 20121 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 30534 is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Virginia is located on the mid-Atlantic coast

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, also with Atlantic coastline
      but further south


      Step 3: Compare the general east-west positioning.

      - Virginia is positioned to the northeast of Georgia

      - Looking at the US map, Virginia lies entirely east of Georgia''s longitude


      Step 4: While specific zip codes could potentially change this relationship
      if they were at extreme edges of their states, 20121 (Centreville, VA) is in
      northern Virginia, and 30534 (Ellijay, GA) is in northern Georgia. This maintains
      the same east-west relationship as their states.

      east of 30534, GA, I need to:


      1. Determine the geographic locations of both ZIP codes

      2. Compare their positions to see which one is more easterly


      Let me break this down:


      20121 is a ZIP code in Virginia (VA). Virginia is on the eastern seaboard of
      the United States.


      30534 is a ZIP code in Georgia (GA). Georgia is also in the eastern part of
      the US, but generally Georgia is southwest of Virginia.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Virginia is on the Atlantic coast, in the Mid-Atlantic region

      - Georgia is further south and generally west of Virginia


      In the US, states further east typically have lower first digits in their ZIP
      codes, while states further west have higher first digits. Virginia ZIP codes
      often start with 2, while Georgia ZIP codes often start with 3, which is consistent
      with Virginia being east of Georgia.


      Based on this knowledge of US geography and ZIP code patterns, 20121, VA should
      be east of 30534, GA.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two ZIP codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 20121 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 30534 is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Virginia is located on the mid-Atlantic coast

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern US, southwest of Virginia


      Step 3: Examine the ZIP code pattern.

      - In the US ZIP code system, lower first digits generally correspond to more
      easterly locations

      - ZIP codes starting with 2 (like 20121) are typically east of those starting
      with 3 (like 30534)


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on both state geography and ZIP code patterns.

      - Virginia is east of Georgia on a map

      - The ZIP code 20121 (starting with 2) should be east of 30534 (starting with
      3)


      YES, 20121, VA is located east of 30534, GA.'
    c058dced-7ed1-4355-84e4-aaf19ee4ab9d: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine whether the location with zip code 20121 in Virginia (VA) is east
      of the location with zip code 30534 in Georgia (GA).


      In the US, zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the
      east and higher numbers are in the west. The first digit of the zip code typically
      divides the country into regions:

      - 0 and 1: Northeastern states

      - 2 and 3: Southeastern and Gulf Coast states

      - 4 and 5: Midwest and Plains states

      - 6 and 7: South-central and Mountain states

      - 8 and 9: Western states and Pacific Coast


      Looking at the zip codes:

      - 20121 in VA starts with "2", which indicates it''s in the eastern/southeastern
      region

      - 30534 in GA starts with "3", which also indicates it''s in the southeastern
      region


      Since Virginia (20121) is generally northeast of Georgia (30534), and the zip
      code''s first digit (2 vs 3) also suggests that the Virginia location is further
      east, I can determine that 20121, VA is indeed east of 30534, GA.</think>To
      determine if 20121, VA is east of 30534, GA, I''ll analyze the geographic locations
      of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 20121 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 30534 is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while Georgia
      is located further south and west of Virginia.


      Step 3: Look at the zip code patterns.

      In the US zip code system, lower numbers generally indicate more eastern locations.
      Zip codes starting with "2" (like 20121) are typically more eastern than those
      starting with "3" (like 30534).


      Step 4: Confirm the specific locations.

      Zip code 20121 is in the Centreville area of Virginia, in the eastern part of
      the state.

      Zip code 30534 is in north Georgia, which is west of Virginia.


      YES, 20121, VA is located east of 30534, GA.'
    d323f9e2-b37f-4dc9-8ada-1ec1fc06dfef: '<think>To solve this problem, I need to
      determine whether 20121, VA (in Virginia) is east of 30534, GA (in Georgia).


      First, let me establish the relative positions of Virginia and Georgia. Virginia
      is on the east coast of the United States, and Georgia is located south of Virginia.
      In terms of east-west positioning, Virginia is generally east of Georgia.


      Now, to be more precise, I need to consider the specific zip codes:

      - 20121 is a zip code in Virginia

      - 30534 is a zip code in Georgia


      U.S. zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are assigned to
      the eastern and northeastern parts of the country, and higher numbers to the
      western and southwestern areas. The first digit of the zip code usually follows
      this pattern:

      0, 1 = Northeast

      2 = Mid-Atlantic (including Virginia)

      3 = Southeast (including Georgia)

      4 = Midwest

      etc.


      Based on the first digits alone (2 for Virginia vs 3 for Georgia), this suggests
      that 20121, VA would be east of 30534, GA.


      So based on both the general geographic locations of the states and the zip
      code numbering system, 20121, VA should be east of 30534, GA.</think># Is 20121,
      VA located east of 30534, GA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 20121 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 30534 is in Georgia (GA)


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic positions

      Virginia is located on the east coast of the United States, while Georgia is
      located in the southeastern United States but further west than Virginia.


      ## Step 3: Check zip code patterns

      The U.S. zip code system generally assigns lower numbers to eastern areas and
      higher numbers to western areas. The first digit shows:

      - Zip codes starting with 2 (like 20121) cover mid-Atlantic states including
      Virginia

      - Zip codes starting with 3 (like 30534) cover southeastern states including
      Georgia


      ## Step 4: Determine relative position

      Since Virginia is geographically east of Georgia, and this is also reflected
      in their zip code numbering (2-series vs 3-series), zip code 20121 in VA is
      east of zip code 30534 in GA.

      Let me break this down:

      1. First, I need to identify where these zip codes are located

      2. Then I''ll determine their relative east-west positions

      3. Finally, I''ll conclude with a YES or NO answer


      For 90043, CA:

      - This is a zip code in California (CA)

      - Specifically, 90043 is in the Los Angeles area in southern California


      For 97331, OR:

      - This is a zip code in Oregon (OR)

      - 97331 is in Corvallis, Oregon, which is in the western part of Oregon


      Now for their east-west relationship:

      - In the US, states on the west coast generally run north-south along similar
      longitudes

      - Oregon is directly north of California

      - However, due to the angle of the west coast, Oregon is generally east of California


      To be more precise:

      - Los Angeles (90043) is in Southern California, near the Pacific coast

      - Corvallis (97331) is in Western Oregon, but Oregon itself is entirely north
      of the Los Angeles area

      - The west coast angles such that northern areas (like Oregon) are further east
      than southern areas (like Southern California)

      - 90043 is a zip code in Los Angeles, California (southwest part of the US)

      - 97331 is a zip code in Corvallis, Oregon (northwest part of the US)


      ## Step 2: Determine their east-west relationship

      - California is located south of Oregon on the west coast

      - Due to the angle of the US west coast, locations in Oregon are generally east

      is located east of 85621, AZ (Arizona), I need to understand the relative positions
      of these states and their zip code regions.


      The United States is generally laid out with:

      - Eastern states on the right side of the map

      - Western states on the left side of the map


      Oklahoma (OK) is in the central part of the United States, while Arizona (AZ)
      is in the southwestern part of the United States.


      On a west-to-east orientation:

      - Arizona is farther west

      - Oklahoma is farther east


      Therefore, Oklahoma is east of Arizona. So a zip code in Oklahoma would be east
      of a zip code in Arizona.


      73505 is a zip code in Oklahoma (specifically in the Lawton area).

      85621 is a zip code in Arizona (specifically in the Nogales area).


      Since Oklahoma is east of Arizona, 73505, OK is located east of 85621, AZ.</think>#
      Is 73505, OK located east of 85621, AZ?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes by looking
      at their states.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 73505 is in Oklahoma (OK)

      - 85621 is in Arizona (AZ)


      ## Step 2: Determine relative geographic positions

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States

      - On a west-to-east orientation, Arizona is significantly farther west than
      Oklahoma

      - Oklahoma is positioned to the east of Arizona on any US map


      ## Conclusion

      YES - 73505, OK is located east of 85621, AZ.'

      To determine this, I need to know the relative positions of Oklahoma and Arizona
      within the United States.


      In the United States, states are generally arranged such that:

      - East Coast states are on the eastern side

      - West Coast states are on the western side


      Oklahoma (OK) is located in the central part of the United States, while Arizona
      (AZ) is located in the southwestern part of the United States.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Arizona borders California to its west, and New Mexico to its east

      - Oklahoma is several states to the east of Arizona, located between Texas (to
      its south), Kansas (to its north), Arkansas (to its east), and New Mexico (to
      its west)


      So Oklahoma is positioned east of Arizona in the United States.


      Therefore, a zip code in Oklahoma (73505) would be east of a zip code in Arizona
      (85621).</think>To determine if 73505, OK is east of 85621, AZ, I need to examine
      the geographical positions of these states.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the two states involved.

      - OK = Oklahoma

      - AZ = Arizona


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Oklahoma is located in the central part of the United States, while Arizona
      is in the southwestern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Arizona is positioned in the far west,
      just east of California. Oklahoma is positioned much further east, in the central
      plains region.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Oklahoma is positioned to the east of Arizona in the United States, any
      location in Oklahoma (including zip code 73505) would be east of any location
      in Arizona (including zip code 85621).

      First, let''s identify these locations:

      - 06379, CT: This is a zip code in Connecticut (CT)

      - 48219, MI: This is a zip code in Michigan (MI)


      Now, let''s think about the geography of the United States. Connecticut is located
      on the east coast of the United States, specifically in the New England region
      in the northeastern part of the country. Michigan is located in the Midwest
      region, specifically in the Great Lakes region.


      Generally speaking, states on the east coast (like Connecticut) are east of
      states in the Midwest (like Michigan). So geographically, Connecticut is east
      of Michigan.


      Therefore, zip code 06379, CT should be east of zip code 48219, MI.</think>To
      determine if 06379, CT is east of 48219, MI, I''ll need to compare their geographic
      locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 06379 is in Connecticut (CT)

      - 48219 is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - Connecticut is located on the East Coast of the United States in the New England
      region.

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east basis.

      - Connecticut sits much further east in the United States compared to Michigan.

      - All of Connecticut is east of Michigan on the map.


      Step 4: Conclude based on state positions.

      Since all locations in Connecticut are east of locations in Michigan, zip code
      06379 in CT must be east of zip code 48219 in MI.

      Let me think step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the states: CT is Connecticut and MI is Michigan.


      2) In terms of US geography, Connecticut is located in the northeastern part
      of the United States, specifically in New England. Michigan is located in the
      Midwest/Great Lakes region.


      3) When considering east-west positioning in the US, states further east have
      lower longitude values (since longitude decreases as you move east in the US).


      4) Connecticut is definitely east of Michigan on a US map. Connecticut is on
      the Atlantic coast in the Northeast, while Michigan is in the Midwest.


      5) Since 06379 is in Connecticut and 48219 is in Michigan, the Connecticut zip
      code must be east of the Michigan zip code.


      So 06379, CT is indeed east of 48219, MI.</think>To determine if 06379, CT is
      east of 48219, MI, I need to analyze the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 06379 is in Connecticut (CT)

      - 48219 is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States, along the Atlantic
      coast.

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - States in the northeastern US (like Connecticut) are positioned east of midwestern
      states (like Michigan).

      - On a map of the United States, Connecticut clearly lies to the east of Michigan.


      Step 4: Since zip codes within these states maintain the same general geographic
      relationship, 06379 in Connecticut must be east of 48219 in Michigan.

      The United States is arranged such that states on the east coast are more eastern
      than states in the midwest. Connecticut is located on the east coast of the
      United States, while Michigan is in the midwest.


      Specifically:

      - Connecticut is one of the northeastern states, part of New England

      - Michigan is in the Great Lakes region of the midwest


      In terms of geography, Connecticut is definitely located east of Michigan on
      a map of the United States. Therefore, any zip code in Connecticut would be
      east of any zip code in Michigan.</think># Is 06379, CT located east of 48219,

      3) Connecticut is located on the east coast of the United States

      4) Michigan is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      5) When looking at a map of the United States, Connecticut is positioned to
      the east of Michigan

      and compare their longitudes. In the US, locations further east have lower longitude
      values.


      First, let''s identify the states:

      - 05677 is in Vermont (VT)

      - 40109 is in Kentucky (KY)


      Generally speaking, Vermont is in the northeastern United States, while Kentucky
      is more central/south. Looking at a mental map of the US, Vermont is definitely
      east of Kentucky.


      Vermont is on the east coast of the US, bordering New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
      and New York, as well as Canada to the north.


      Kentucky is much further west, in the eastern part of the central US, bordering
      states like Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee, Missouri, and
      Illinois.


      Since Vermont as a whole is east of Kentucky, it''s very likely that any zip
      code in Vermont (including 05677) is east of any zip code in Kentucky (including
      40109).


      So yes, 05677, VT should be located east of 40109, KY.</think># Is 05677, VT
      located east of 40109, KY?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two zip codes based on their states.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 05677 is in Vermont (VT)

      - 40109 is in Kentucky (KY)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Vermont is located in the northeastern United States

      - Kentucky is located in the east-central United States


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      Vermont is positioned along the eastern edge of the country, bordering New Hampshire
      and the Atlantic Ocean (via the Gulf of Maine). Kentucky is positioned much
      further west in the central part of the country.


      Since all of Vermont lies east of all of Kentucky on a US map, any zip code
      in Vermont (including 05677) would be east of any zip code in Kentucky (including
      40109).

      05677 in Vermont (VT) is located east of zip code 40109 in Kentucky (KY).


      To determine this, I need to think about the geographic locations of Vermont
      and Kentucky within the United States.


      The United States is oriented such that:

      - The East Coast is on the right side of the map

      - The West Coast is on the left side of the map


      Vermont (VT) is a state located in the northeastern United States, specifically
      in the New England region. It borders New York to the west, Massachusetts to
      the south, New Hampshire to the east, and Canada to the north.


      Kentucky (KY) is located in the east-central United States, but it''s more inland
      and further west than Vermont. Kentucky is west of the Appalachian Mountains.


      On a west-to-east basis:

      - Kentucky is located in the eastern portion of the United States but is more
      western than Vermont

      - Vermont is one of the easternmost states in the country, located in New England


      So geographically speaking, Vermont is east of Kentucky. Therefore, zip code
      05677 in Vermont would be east of zip code 40109 in Kentucky.</think># Is 05677,
      VT located east of 40109, KY?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions
      of these two zip codes based on their states.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1) Zip code 05677 is in Vermont (VT)

      2) Zip code 40109 is in Kentucky (KY)

      3) Vermont is located in the northeastern United States (New England region)

      4) Kentucky is located in the east-central United States

      5) On a west-to-east orientation of the US map, Vermont is further east than
      Kentucky


      Since Vermont is geographically east of Kentucky on the US map, zip code 05677
      in Vermont is east of zip code 40109 in Kentucky.

      Let me start with some basic geography knowledge:

      - Florida (FL) is on the southeastern coast of the United States

      - Oklahoma (OK) is in the central part of the United States


      This already suggests that Florida is likely east of Oklahoma, but let me be

      On a map of the United States, Florida is definitely east of Oklahoma. The entire

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Florida is located on the southeastern coast of the United States

      - Oklahoma is located in the central part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Oklahoma is significantly west of Florida

      - All of Florida, including Gainesville, is east of all of Oklahoma, including
      Tulsa


      Step 4: Make the determination based on these locations.

      Since Gainesville, FL (32603) is in a state that is entirely east of Oklahoma,
      it must be east of Tulsa, OK (74105).

      4) Oklahoma is located in the south-central region of the United States

      5) When comparing states on an east-west axis, Florida is considerably east

      7) More specifically, 32603 is in the Gainesville area of Florida, and 74105
      is in the Tulsa area of Oklahoma

      8) Regardless of the specific locations within these states, any point in Florida

      First, I''ll recall the general geographic positions of these two states:

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States, on the east coast

      - Oklahoma is located in the central United States


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Florida is definitely east of Oklahoma. Florida
      borders the Atlantic Ocean on its east, while Oklahoma is in the central part
      of the country.


      To verify specifically about these zip codes:

      - 32603 is in FL (Florida)

      - 74105 is in OK (Oklahoma)


      Since the entire state of Florida is east of the entire state of Oklahoma, it
      follows that any location in Florida (including 32603) would be east of any
      location in Oklahoma (including 74105).


      So yes, 32603, FL is located east of 74105, OK.</think># Is 32603, FL located
      east of 74105, OK?


      To answer this question, I need to consider the geographic locations of these
      zip codes.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) 32603 is a zip code in Florida (FL)

      2) 74105 is a zip code in Oklahoma (OK)

      3) Florida is located on the southeastern coast of the United States

      4) Oklahoma is located in the central part of the United States

      5) When looking at a map of the United States, Florida is positioned entirely
      east of Oklahoma

      6) Since 32603 is in Florida and 74105 is in Oklahoma, the Florida zip code
      must be east of the Oklahoma zip code

      2. 18218, PA - This is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Now I need to determine if the first location is east of the second location.


      In the US, states that are on the east coast include (from north to south):
      Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New
      Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,
      and Florida.

      is west of most of the New England states including Massachusetts.


      Massachusetts is located in New England on the east coast, while Pennsylvania
      is more inland and to the west of Massachusetts.


      So generally speaking, any location in Massachusetts would be east of any location

      In the United States, states on the east coast are more easterly than those

      Massachusetts is generally east of Pennsylvania on a map of the United States.

      19363, PA is located east of zip code 44095, OH.


      Step 1: Let me identify the states these zip codes are in.

      - 19363 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 44095 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the relative geographical positions of Pennsylvania and Ohio.

      Pennsylvania is located east of Ohio. Ohio borders Pennsylvania on Pennsylvania''s
      western border.


      Step 3: Now I need to consider the specific locations of these zip codes within
      their states.

      - Zip codes in the 193xx range in Pennsylvania are typically in the southeastern
      part of the state

      - Zip codes in the 440xx range in Ohio are typically in the northeastern part
      of the state


      Step 4: Even though 44095 is in northeastern Ohio (which is the part of Ohio

      Pennsylvania (PA) is located directly east of Ohio (OH) on the US map. The entire
      state of Pennsylvania is east of Ohio.


      Step 2: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - 19363 is a zip code in Pennsylvania, specifically in the southeastern region
      of the state (19xxx zip codes are generally in eastern PA)

      - 44095 is a zip code in Ohio, located in the northeastern part of Ohio (440xx
      codes are in northeast Ohio)


      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      Even though 44095 is in northeastern Ohio (the part closest to Pennsylvania),
      any location in Pennsylvania must be east of any location in Ohio due to the
      states'' geographical arrangement.

      1. 19363, PA (Pennsylvania)

      2. 44095, OH (Ohio)


      I need to find if the first is east of the second.


      Let me reason through this:


      1. Pennsylvania (PA) is generally east of Ohio (OH) in the United States. Ohio
      borders Pennsylvania on Pennsylvania''s western border.


      2. ZIP codes in the US are roughly organized geographically, with lower numbers
      generally in the eastern parts of the country and higher numbers in the western
      parts.


      3. The ZIP code 19363 in PA starts with "193" which is a relatively low number,
      suggesting it''s in the eastern part of Pennsylvania.


      4. The ZIP code 44095 in OH starts with "440" which is a higher number, suggesting
      it''s in the northeastern part of Ohio.


      5. Since Pennsylvania is east of Ohio, and considering the general pattern of
      ZIP codes, it''s very likely that 19363, PA is east of 44095, OH.

      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) First, I need to consider the states: Pennsylvania (PA) and Ohio (OH).


      2) Geographically, Pennsylvania is located directly east of Ohio on the US map.
      They share a border, with Ohio on the west and Pennsylvania on the east.


      3) ZIP code 19363 is in Pennsylvania. ZIP codes beginning with "19" are typically

      4) ZIP code 44095 is in Ohio. ZIP codes beginning with "44" are typically in
      the northeastern part of Ohio.


      5) Even though both are in the northern parts of their respective states, the
      fundamental east-west relationship between Pennsylvania and Ohio means that

      to determine the geographic locations of these two zip codes and then determine
      if one is east of the other.


      19363, PA refers to a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      44095, OH refers to a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is east of Ohio in the United States. The states
      border each other, with Pennsylvania being to the east of Ohio.


      Let me think more specifically about these zip codes:


      19363 is a zip code in Pennsylvania. I believe it''s in the southeastern part
      of Pennsylvania.

      44095 is a zip code in Ohio. I believe it''s in the northeastern part of Ohio.


      Even though 44095 might be in the northeastern part of Ohio (which would make
      it closer to Pennsylvania), Pennsylvania as a whole is east of Ohio. So a location
      in Pennsylvania is very likely to be east of a location in Ohio.


      Therefore, 19363, PA should be east of 44095, OH.</think>I''ll solve this step

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Pennsylvania is located directly east of Ohio on the US map. The entire state
      of Pennsylvania is east of Ohio.


      Step 3: Even though these are specific zip codes, their state locations determine
      their east-west relationship.

      Since 19363 is in Pennsylvania and 44095 is in Ohio, and Pennsylvania is east
      of Ohio, it follows that 19363, PA must be east of 44095, OH.

      east of 15139, PA, I need to find the locations of these zip codes and compare
      their positions on a map.


      US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the eastern
      parts of the country and higher numbers are in the western parts. So just from
      the numbers (07432 vs 15139), I would expect the NJ zip code to be further east,
      since New Jersey is on the east coast and Pennsylvania is more inland, and the
      NJ zip code starts with a lower number (07 vs 15).


      Let me confirm this:

      - 07432 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 15139 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      In general, New Jersey is located to the east of Pennsylvania on the US map.
      Pennsylvania borders New Jersey on New Jersey''s western border, and Pennsylvania
      itself is more inland while New Jersey is a coastal state on the Atlantic Ocean.


      So geographically speaking, locations in New Jersey tend to be east of locations
      in Pennsylvania. There might be some exceptions if we''re looking at the extreme
      eastern edge of PA compared to the extreme western edge of NJ, but given the
      zip codes, that doesn''t seem to be the case here.


      07432 appears to be in northern NJ, and 15139 appears to be in western PA (near
      Pittsburgh). So 07432, NJ should definitely be east of 15139, PA.</think># Is
      07432, NJ located east of 15139, PA?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states

      New Jersey (NJ) is located on the Atlantic coast, while Pennsylvania (PA) is
      more inland. In general, New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania.


      ## Step 2: Analyze the zip codes

      US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to be in the
      eastern United States. The fact that the NJ zip code (07432) starts with a much
      lower number than the PA zip code (15139) supports the eastern position.


      ## Step 3: Specific locations

      - 07432 is in northern New Jersey (likely Bergen County)

      - 15139 is in western Pennsylvania (likely in the greater Pittsburgh area)


      The relative positions confirm that the New Jersey location is indeed east of
      the Pennsylvania location, as the entire state of New Jersey lies east of western
      Pennsylvania.


      YES'
    259044c4-68cf-4979-979f-af01e9225ec9: '<think>I need to determine whether 07432,
      NJ is located east of 15139, PA. Let me break this down into steps:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 07432 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 15139 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of NJ and PA on a map.

      New Jersey is located on the eastern coast of the United States. Pennsylvania
      is located west of New Jersey. In general, New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Check if this general relationship holds for these specific zip codes.

      US zip codes tend to be organized geographically where lower numbers are generally
      in the eastern US and higher numbers in the western US. The zip code for NJ
      (07432) starts with "0" which is typically for the easternmost states, while
      the PA zip code (15139) starts with "1" which is typically for states a bit
      more west.


      So based on both the state locations and the zip code prefixes, 07432 in NJ
      should be east of 15139 in PA.</think>To determine if 07432, NJ is located east
      of 15139, PA, I need to analyze the geographical positions of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 07432 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 15139 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between NJ and PA

      New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast, while Pennsylvania is located inland.
      On a map of the United States, New Jersey is positioned to the east of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Verify with zip code patterns

      US zip codes follow a general west-to-east pattern, with lower numbers typically
      in the northeast. The NJ zip code starting with "07" is in the first zip code
      region, while the PA zip code starting with "15" is in a region further west.


      Step 4: Conclusion

      Since New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania, and these specific zip codes follow
      the standard geographical arrangement (with the NJ zip code using a lower first
      digit than the PA zip code), 07432, NJ is indeed east of 15139, PA.

      1) I need to figure out where 07432, NJ is located

      2) I need to figure out where 15139, PA is located

      3) Then I need to determine if 07432, NJ is east of 15139, PA


      For US zip codes:

      - New Jersey (NJ) is on the east coast

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is west of New Jersey


      07432 is a zip code in New Jersey

      15139 is a zip code in Pennsylvania


      Since New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania on the US map, generally a New Jersey
      zip code would be east of a Pennsylvania zip code.


      However, I should be careful as states have irregular shapes and border areas
      might not follow this general pattern. But given that:

      - 07432 appears to be in northern New Jersey (based on the first digit 0, which
      typically covers the northeastern states)

      - 15139 appears to be in western Pennsylvania (based on the first digit 1, which
      typically covers parts of the mid-Atlantic)


      This confirms that 07432, NJ would be east of 15139, PA.</think>To determine
      if 07432, NJ is located east of 15139, PA, I need to consider the geographic
      relationship between these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 07432 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 15139 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between NJ and PA

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast

      - Pennsylvania is located inland, directly west of New Jersey


      Step 3: Examine the zip code patterns

      - The 074xx zip codes are typically in northeastern New Jersey

      - The 151xx zip codes are typically in western Pennsylvania (around the Pittsburgh
      area)


      Step 4: Determine the east-west relationship

      Since New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania, and specifically 07432 is in northeastern
      NJ while 15139 is in western PA, this means 07432 is definitely east of 15139.

      To figure this out, I need to understand the general geography of these two
      states and the locations of these specific zip codes.


      Generally speaking, New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania since Pennsylvania is
      inland and New Jersey borders the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side.


      Let''s think about the zip codes more specifically:

      - 07432 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 15139 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      US zip codes are roughly geographically organized. The first digit generally
      indicates a region of the country:

      - Zip codes starting with 0 are in the northeastern U.S.

      - Zip codes starting with 1 are also in the northeastern U.S., generally slightly
      more western than those starting with 0


      Since 07432 starts with 0 and 15139 starts with 1, this suggests that 07432
      is in the more eastern part of the northeast, while 15139 is in a more western
      part of the northeast.


      Given that New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania, and the zip code pattern reinforces
      this (0xxxx being more eastern than 1xxxx), I can conclude that 07432, NJ is
      indeed east of 15139, PA.</think># Is 07432, NJ located east of 15139, PA?


      I need to determine the relative locations of these zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states

      New Jersey (NJ) is located on the Atlantic coast, while Pennsylvania (PA) is
      an inland state that borders New Jersey on its eastern side. Generally, New
      Jersey is east of Pennsylvania.


      ## Step 2: Analyze the zip codes

      - US zip codes follow geographical patterns

      - 07xxx zip codes cover northern New Jersey

      - 15xxx zip codes cover western Pennsylvania (around Pittsburgh)


      ## Step 3: Determine relative positions

      Since 07432 is in northern New Jersey, and 15139 is in western Pennsylvania,
      and given that New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania, the zip code 07432 must be
      east of 15139.

      15139 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA).


      Geographically speaking, New Jersey is located to the east of Pennsylvania on
      the US map. Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey. This is a general geographic
      fact about these two states.


      To be more precise, I should consider that sometimes border areas can have exceptions

      Pennsylvania. Zip code 15139 appears to be in western Pennsylvania, which makes
      it even more certain that 07432, NJ is east of 15139, PA.

      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      Without needing to know the exact towns, I can use the general state positions.
      Since all of New Jersey is east of most of Pennsylvania (particularly the areas

      15139 is a zip code for Oakmont, Pennsylvania (PA).


      Now, I need to think about the general geographic layout of New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
      New Jersey is located on the eastern coast of the United States, while Pennsylvania

      - 07432 is a zip code in New Jersey (specifically Fair Lawn area)

      - 15139 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (near Pittsburgh area)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between NJ and PA.

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast

      - Pennsylvania is inland, directly west of New Jersey


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      - Lower zip code numbers (0xxxx) are generally assigned to the northeastern
      states

      - The "074xx" range is in northern New Jersey

      - The "151xx" range is in western Pennsylvania


      Step 4: Compare specific locations.

      - Any location in New Jersey will be east of western Pennsylvania locations

      - 15139 (near Pittsburgh) is in western Pennsylvania

      - 07432 in New Jersey would be significantly east of this location


      YES, 07432, NJ is located east of 15139, PA.'

    72be7586-5beb-4af2-851c-be676ccb6480: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine if 07440, NJ (New Jersey) is located east of 35954, AL (Alabama).


      Step 1: Let me first understand the geographical context. The United States
      has states on the East Coast and states more inland and to the west. In general,
      states on the East Coast are further east than states that aren''t on the East
      Coast.


      Step 2: New Jersey (NJ) is a state located on the East Coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Alabama (AL) is a state located in the southeastern region of the United
      States, but it''s not directly on the East Coast - it''s west of Georgia, which
      borders the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 4: Because New Jersey is on the East Coast and Alabama is further inland,
      New Jersey is generally east of Alabama.


      Step 5: When comparing specific zip codes, I should still find that a zip code
      in New Jersey is east of a zip code in Alabama, as this relationship holds for
      the states as a whole.


      Therefore, 07440, NJ should be located east of 35954, AL.</think>To determine
      if 07440, NJ is east of 35954, AL, I need to consider the geographical positions
      of New Jersey and Alabama.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States, bordering the
      Atlantic Ocean.

      Alabama is located in the southeastern United States, but it''s inland compared
      to New Jersey.


      Step 2: Consider longitude (east-west positioning).

      States further east have lower (more negative) longitude values in the Western
      Hemisphere.

      New Jersey is considerably east of Alabama on any US map.


      Step 3: While specific zip codes might have different positions within their
      states, the easternmost point of Alabama is still west of the westernmost point
      of New Jersey.


      Step 4: The zip code 07440 is in New Jersey (likely in the Pequannock Township
      area), and 35954 is in Alabama (likely in Blount County).


      Given these geographical facts, 07440, NJ is definitely located east of 35954,

      The US uses a coordinate system where:

      - Lower longitude values indicate more eastern locations

      - Higher longitude values indicate more western locations


      Let me reason through this:


      1) 07440 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ), which is on the east coast of the
      United States.

      2) 35954 is a zip code in Alabama (AL), which is in the southeastern United
      States, but west of New Jersey.


      Generally speaking, New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast and is one of
      the easternmost states, while Alabama is several states inland from the Atlantic.


      The entire state of New Jersey is east of Alabama. So regardless of the specific
      locations of these zip codes within their respective states, a zip code in NJ
      would be east of a zip code in AL.


      Therefore, 07440, NJ would be located east of 35954, AL.</think>I need to determine
      if 07440, NJ is east of 35954, AL by comparing their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the general locations of these states.

      New Jersey (NJ) is located on the eastern Atlantic coast of the United States.

      Alabama (AL) is located in the southeastern United States, but is inland and
      west of New Jersey.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positioning of the United States.

      In the US, eastern locations have lower longitude values than western locations.

      The entire state of New Jersey lies east of the entire state of Alabama.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 07440 is in New Jersey and 35954 is in Alabama, and New Jersey is entirely
      east of Alabama, the zip code 07440 must be east of zip code 35954.

      07440 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ).

      35954 is a zip code in Alabama (AL).


      In the United States, locations are generally positioned as follows on the east-west

      - The East Coast states (including New Jersey) are on the eastern side of the
      country

      - The southeastern states (including Alabama) are more centrally located but
      still in the eastern half of the country


      New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast and is one of the easternmost states in
      the US.

      Alabama is in the southeastern US, but is west of New Jersey.


      If we consider longitude (the east-west measurement), New Jersey has a more
      eastern longitude (smaller negative number, since US longitudes are west of
      the prime meridian) than Alabama.

      1) 19043 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      2) 46222 is a zip code in Indiana (IN)

      3) I need to determine if the location in PA is east of the location in IN


      The United States is laid out such that Pennsylvania is in the eastern part
      of the country, while Indiana is more in the midwest. Generally speaking, Pennsylvania
      is east of Indiana.


      To be more precise:

      - Pennsylvania is on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region

      - Geographically, Pennsylvania is definitively east of Indiana on a map


      Since 19043 is in Pennsylvania and 46222 is in Indiana, and Pennsylvania is
      east of Indiana, the zip code 19043, PA would be east of 46222, IN.</think>To
      determine if 19043, PA is located east of 46222, IN, I need to consider the

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 19043 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 46222 is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Pennsylvania is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while
      Indiana is in the Midwest region. On a U.S. map, Pennsylvania is positioned
      to the east of Indiana.


      Step 3: Since zip codes follow geographical patterns, and Pennsylvania is east
      of Indiana, it follows that any zip code in Pennsylvania would be east of any
      zip code in Indiana.


      YES, 19043, PA is located east of 46222, IN.'

      08221 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ).

      24486 is a zip code in Virginia (VA).


      Geographically speaking, New Jersey is generally east of Virginia on the US
      map. The entire state of New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast, while Virginia
      is more inland (though it does have some coastal areas).

      exceptions), and given that New Jersey as a whole is east of Virginia, it is
      very likely that 08221, NJ is east of 24486, VA.


      To be completely certain, I would need the exact coordinates, but based on the

      - 08221 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 24486 is in Virginia (VA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between NJ and VA

      New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United States,
      while Virginia is located south of New Jersey and extends from the Atlantic
      coast inland to the west.


      ## Step 3: Consider zip code patterns

      In the US postal system, zip codes generally increase from east to west. The
      lower first digits of the NJ zip code (08xxx) compared to the VA zip code (24xxx)
      suggest the NJ location is further east.


      ## Step 4: Geographic confirmation

      New Jersey is entirely east of most of Virginia. The specific zip code 08221
      is in southern NJ (likely in the Atlantic City area), while 24486 is likely
      in the western part of Virginia, farther from the coast.


      YES'

      of 24486, VA, I need to identify the geographic locations of these two zip codes
      and compare their east-west positioning.


      08221 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ).

      24486 is a zip code in Virginia (VA).


      Geographically, on the US east coast:

      - New Jersey is located to the northeast of Virginia

      - In terms of east-west positioning, New Jersey is generally east of Virginia


      Let me be more specific about these particular zip codes:

      - 08221 appears to be in the Atlantic County area of New Jersey

      - 24486 appears to be in western Virginia


      The entire state of New Jersey is east of Virginia. Even the westernmost point
      of New Jersey is still east of the easternmost point of Virginia.


      So, 08221, NJ would indeed be located east of 24486, VA.</think>I need to determine
      the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the general geographic positions of New Jersey and Virginia.

      New Jersey (NJ) is located on the Atlantic coast, while Virginia (VA) is southwest
      of New Jersey.


      Step 2: Consider the specific zip codes.

      08221 is a zip code in New Jersey, likely in the Atlantic County area.

      24486 is a zip code in Virginia, likely in the western/central part of the state.


      Step 3: Compare east-west positioning.

      On a map of the United States, New Jersey lies entirely east of Virginia. Even
      the westernmost point of NJ is east of the easternmost point of VA.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since 08221 is in New Jersey, and 24486 is in Virginia, and New Jersey is east
      of Virginia, it follows that 08221, NJ is east of 24486, VA.


      YES'

      1. 08221 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      2. 24486 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)


      I need to determine if the location corresponding to the NJ zip code is east
      of the location corresponding to the VA zip code.


      I''ll think about the geography of the US East Coast:

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic Coast

      - Virginia is also on the East Coast but is generally west of New Jersey


      Looking at the US map, the states from east to west in this region would be:

      - Atlantic Ocean

      - New Jersey (along with other coastal states like Delaware, Maryland)

      - Virginia (and West Virginia)


      Since New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast and Virginia is inland/west of New
      Jersey, generally locations in New Jersey would be east of locations in Virginia.


      So yes, 08221, NJ should be east of 24486, VA based on the general geographic
      arrangement of these states.</think>I need to determine the geographic relationship
      between these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 08221 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 24486 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast of the United States

      - Virginia is also an East Coast state, but is positioned southwest of New Jersey


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning.

      - New Jersey is generally east of Virginia

      - All of New Jersey is east of the western parts of Virginia

      - Specific zip codes in eastern Virginia might be similar in longitude to parts
      of New Jersey, but 24486 is in western Virginia


      Step 4: Confirm the specific zip codes.

      - 08221 appears to be in the Atlantic County area of New Jersey, near the coast

      - 24486 is in western Virginia, in the Shenandoah Valley region


      YES, 08221, NJ is located east of 24486, VA.'

      08221 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ).

      24486 is a zip code in Virginia (VA).


      Geographically, in the United States:

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast

      - Virginia is also on the East Coast, but generally south and west of New Jersey


      Looking at the map of the eastern United States, New Jersey is positioned to
      the east of Virginia. This is generally true for most locations in these states.


      To be even more specific:

      - ZIP code 08221 appears to be in Ocean City, NJ, which is on the Atlantic coast
      of New Jersey

      - ZIP code 24486 appears to be in Vesuvius, VA, which is in western Virginia
      (in the Shenandoah Valley region)


      Since Ocean City, NJ is on the Atlantic coast, and Vesuvius, VA is in western
      Virginia (in the inland part of the state), the NJ location is definitely east
      of the VA location.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their general geographic positions.

      - 08221 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 24486 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic Coast in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia is also an East Coast state, but is positioned southwest of New Jersey


      Step 3: Look at the specific zip codes.

      - 08221 appears to be in Ocean City, NJ, which is directly on the Atlantic Ocean

      - 24486 is in Vesuvius, VA, which is in the western part of Virginia, near the
      Shenandoah Valley and Blue Ridge Mountains


      Step 4: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      Since Ocean City, NJ is on the Atlantic coastline and Vesuvius, VA is in the
      western, inland portion of Virginia, the New Jersey location is clearly east
      of the Virginia location.


      YES'
    8ebe70ae-885d-4bb4-8a10-38ff8be5533b: '<think>To determine if 08221, NJ is located
      east of 24486, VA, I need to find the geographical locations of these zip codes.


      First, let me recall what I know about US zip codes:

      - The first digit generally represents a geographical region from east to west

      - Lower first digits tend to be in the eastern US

      - Higher first digits tend to be in the western US


      08221 has a first digit of 0, which typically represents areas in the northeastern
      US.

      24486 has a first digit of 2, which typically represents areas in the eastern
      US, but likely more southern than areas with first digit 0.


      Based on the zip codes:

      - 08221 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 24486 is in Virginia (VA)


      Now, geographically:

      - New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern US

      - Virginia is also on the Atlantic coast but south of New Jersey


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New Jersey is generally east of Virginia, as the coastline of the eastern
      US runs in a northeastern direction

      - So locations in New Jersey tend to be east of locations in Virginia


      Therefore, 08221, NJ is likely east of 24486, VA.</think># Is 08221, NJ located
      east of 24486, VA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 08221 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 24486 is in Virginia (VA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia is also on the Atlantic coast, but further south


      ## Step 3: Analyze the east-west relationship

      - The eastern U.S. coastline runs in a northeastern direction

      - This means that locations in New Jersey are generally east of locations in
      Virginia

      - The lower first digit in NJ''s zip code (0) versus VA''s (2) also supports
      this, as lower first digits in zip codes typically represent more eastern regions


      ## Conclusion

      YES, 08221, NJ is located east of 24486, VA.'
    987c774f-c61f-4229-be76-de2cee6bb581: '<think>To determine if 08221, NJ is located
      east of 24486, VA, I need to figure out where these two zip codes are located
      geographically and compare their east-west positions.


      Let me think about US geography:

      - New Jersey (NJ) is on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia (VA) is south of New Jersey, also on the Atlantic coast but extending
      further west


      In the US, zip codes generally increase as you go from east to west, but since
      these are different states, that pattern may not directly apply for comparison.


      What I do know with certainty:

      - New Jersey is generally east of Virginia on a map

      - The eastern part of Virginia borders the Atlantic Ocean, but much of Virginia
      extends inland to the west

      - New Jersey is a much smaller state that is primarily on the Atlantic coast


      Since 08221 is in New Jersey, and 24486 is in Virginia, and New Jersey is generally
      east of Virginia, it''s very likely that 08221, NJ is east of 24486, VA. But
      to be completely sure, I''d need to know the specific locations of these zip
      codes within their states.


      Given that lower zip codes in the first three digits tend to be more eastern,
      and 082xx is a lower number than 244xx, this also suggests the NJ location is
      east of the VA location.


      Based on general US geography, I can conclude that 08221, NJ is almost certainly
      east of 24486, VA.</think># Is 08221, NJ located east of 24486, VA?


      I need to determine the geographic locations of these two zip codes and compare
      their east-west positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 08221 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 24486 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia is southwest of New Jersey, also partly on the Atlantic coast but
      extending much further inland to the west


      Step 3: Consider the zip code patterns.

      - Lower zip codes in the eastern US generally indicate more eastern locations

      - 08xxx codes are in New Jersey''s system

      - 24xxx codes are in Virginia''s western/central regions


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      The New Jersey zip code (08221) is in a state that is entirely east of most
      of Virginia, and the specific Virginia zip code (24486) is not in Virginia''s
      easternmost region.

      this problem.


      The question is asking whether 08221, NJ (a zip code in New Jersey) is located
      east of 24486, VA (a zip code in Virginia).


      To answer this, I need to recall the relative locations of New Jersey and Virginia
      on the US east coast.


      On the US east coast, going from north to south, we have:

      - Maine

      - New Hampshire

      - Massachusetts

      - Rhode Island

      - Connecticut

      - New York

      - New Jersey

      - Delaware

      - Maryland

      - Virginia

      - North Carolina

      - etc.


      So New Jersey is northeast of Virginia.


      However, the question specifically asks about "east of" - meaning we need to
      consider the east-west positioning, not north-south.


      In general, New Jersey is east of Virginia because New Jersey is on the Atlantic
      coast, while Virginia is more inland (though Virginia also has some coastline
      on its eastern edge).


      Without knowing the exact locations of these specific zip codes, I can make
      an educated guess: 08221 in NJ is likely on or near the Atlantic coast, while
      24486 in VA is likely in the more western part of Virginia.


      So based on the general geography of the US east coast, it''s very likely that
      08221, NJ is east of 24486, VA.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 08221 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 24486 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states

      New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United States,
      while Virginia is south of New Jersey and extends further inland from the coast.


      Step 3: Consider typical zip code distributions

      - New Jersey zip codes beginning with "08" are typically in the southern/coastal
      regions of NJ

      - Virginia zip codes beginning with "24" are typically in the western/central
      regions of VA, away from the coast


      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison

      The eastern edge of New Jersey (on the Atlantic) is generally east of most of
      Virginia, especially the western parts of Virginia where the 24486 zip code
      is likely located.


      YES, 08221, NJ is located east of 24486, VA.'

      2. I need to determine if 08221, NJ is located east of 24486, VA


      Looking at the geography of the United States:

      - New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard of the US

      - Virginia is also on the eastern seaboard but is southwest of New Jersey


      In general, New Jersey is east of Virginia. However, I should be careful because
      zip codes within states can sometimes have unusual arrangements. But given that
      these are in different states and we''re looking at the general position, New
      Jersey locations will typically be east of Virginia locations.


      New Jersey is positioned along the Atlantic coast, and Virginia, while also
      having some coastal areas, extends much further inland west than New Jersey
      does. The easternmost parts of Virginia might be comparable to the westernmost
      parts of New Jersey, but a typical NJ location will be east of a typical VA

      part of Virginia (inland)


      ## Step 4: Compare east-west positions

      - New Jersey coastal areas (like Cape May) are generally farther east than inland
      Virginia areas

      - The Shenandoah Valley is in the western portion of Virginia, far from the
      coast

      - Texas is in the southern central part of the country


      Wisconsin is clearly east of Texas. The entire state of Wisconsin is east of
      the entire state of Texas.


      So zip code 53209 in Wisconsin would be east of zip code 76155 in Texas, regardless
      of the exact locations within those states.</think>To answer whether 53209,
      WI is located east of 76155, TX, I need to think about the geographic positions
      of Wisconsin and Texas.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' locations.

      Wisconsin (WI) is located in the upper Midwest region of the United States,
      bordering Lake Michigan on its eastern side.

      Texas (TX) is located in the south-central part of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      Wisconsin is significantly east of Texas on the U.S. map. The entire state of
      Wisconsin lies to the east of the entire state of Texas.


      Step 3: Since the zip codes are in these respective states, the relationship
      holds true for them as well. Zip code 53209 in Wisconsin must be east of zip
      code 76155 in Texas.

      located east of 76155, TX, I need to know the geographical positions of these
      zip codes.


      The US zip code system generally follows a pattern where lower numbers are in
      the east and higher numbers are in the west. The first digit of the zip code
      roughly divides the country into regions:

      - 0-1: Northeast

      - 2-3: Southeast and Mid-Atlantic

      - 4-5: Midwest

      - 6-7: Central/South

      - 8-9: West


      53209 starts with 5, which indicates it''s in the Midwest region. This is confirmed
      by it being in Wisconsin (WI).


      76155 starts with 7, which indicates it''s in the Central/South region. This
      is confirmed by it being in Texas (TX).


      Geographically, Wisconsin is located in the Midwest of the United States, while
      Texas is located in the South-Central part of the United States.


      When comparing the east-west positioning of states, Wisconsin is definitely
      east of Texas. The Mississippi River roughly divides the eastern and western
      parts of the US, and Wisconsin is east of the Mississippi while Texas is west
      of it.


      So, 53209, WI would be east of 76155, TX.</think>I need to determine the east-west
      relationship between these two zip codes by examining their geographical locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states these zip codes belong to.

      - 53209 is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - 76155 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Determine the relative east-west positions of Wisconsin and Texas.

      - Wisconsin is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Texas is located in the South-Central region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a map.

      - Wisconsin sits along the Great Lakes region in the northern central part of
      the country

      - Texas is positioned much further southwest

      - Wisconsin is clearly east of Texas on a map of the United States


      Step 4: Make the final determination about the specific zip codes.

      - Since the zip codes are within their respective states, 53209 (WI) must be
      east of 76155 (TX)


      YES'

      First, let me think about the general geographic locations of Wisconsin and
      Texas within the United States:

      - Wisconsin is in the northern part of the U.S., in the Midwest region

      - Texas is in the southern part of the U.S., in the South/Southwest region


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Wisconsin is generally located east of Texas in the United States


      Now, let''s confirm this with the specific zip codes:

      - 53209 is in Wisconsin (specifically in Milwaukee area)

      - 76155 is in Texas (likely in the Dallas-Fort Worth area)


      Since Wisconsin is east of Texas on the map of the United States, zip code 53209
      in Wisconsin would be east of zip code 76155 in Texas.</think>To determine if
      53209, WI is east of 76155, TX, I need to consider the geographic positions
      of these locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' general positions.

      Wisconsin is located in the Upper Midwest of the United States, while Texas
      is in the South/Southwest region.


      Step 2: Consider their positions on an east-west axis.

      The continental United States generally spans from the Pacific Ocean (west)
      to the Atlantic Ocean (east). Wisconsin is in the eastern half of the country,
      while Texas is more centrally located but extends toward the western half.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      Zip code 53209 is in the Milwaukee area of Wisconsin, in the eastern part of
      the state.

      Zip code 76155 is in the Dallas-Fort Worth area of Texas, roughly in the northern
      central part of Texas.


      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison.

      Wisconsin is clearly east of Texas on the map. Even the westernmost parts of
      Wisconsin are still east of the easternmost parts of Texas.


      YES, 53209, WI is located east of 76155, TX.'

      Looking at the US map, Wisconsin is definitely east of Texas. Wisconsin borders
      Lake Michigan on its eastern side and is much closer to the Atlantic coast than
      Texas is. Texas is far more western, bordering the Gulf of Mexico on its southeast

      1) I need to determine whether zip code 45801 in Ohio is east of zip code 77008

      2) The United States generally has states arranged with eastern states to the
      right (east) and western states to the left (west) on a typical map.


      3) Ohio is in the Midwest/Eastern part of the United States, while Texas is

      step:


      1) I need to determine if 49453, MI (Michigan) is east of 50703, IA (Iowa).


      2) To answer this question, I need to understand the geographic relationship
      between Michigan and Iowa. In the United States, Michigan is located in the
      eastern part of the Midwest region, while Iowa is located in the western part
      of the Midwest.


      3) Michigan is definitely east of Iowa. The entire state of Michigan is east
      of the entire state of Iowa.


      4) ZIP codes don''t change this fundamental geographic relationship. While specific
      ZIP codes refer to specific areas within these states, the fact that 49453 is
      in Michigan means it must be east of any location in Iowa (including 50703).


      5) To verify: Michigan borders Lake Michigan to the west, with Wisconsin on
      the other side of the lake. Iowa is west of Wisconsin. So any location in Michigan
      must be east of any location in Iowa.</think>I''ll think about this step by
      step:


      1) First, I need to identify which states these ZIP codes are in. The question
      indicates that 49453 is in Michigan (MI) and 50703 is in Iowa (IA).


      2) Next, I need to consider the geographic relationship between these two states.
      In the United States, Michigan is located in the eastern part of the Midwest,
      while Iowa is located in the western part of the Midwest.


      3) Looking at a map of the US, Michigan is entirely east of Iowa. The two states
      don''t border each other - Wisconsin is between them.


      4) Since 49453 is in Michigan and 50703 is in Iowa, and Michigan is east of
      Iowa, it follows that 49453, MI must be east of 50703, IA.

      east of 50703, IA, I need to:


      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west)


      First, let me break down what these codes represent:

      - 49453, MI: A zip code in Michigan (MI)

      - 50703, IA: A zip code in Iowa (IA)


      In the United States, Michigan is located in the Midwest region, bordering the
      Great Lakes. Iowa is also in the Midwest, but is situated more to the west.


      Geographically, Michigan is positioned east of Iowa. The entire state of Michigan
      lies east of the entire state of Iowa.


      Without looking at the specific cities these zip codes represent, I can determine
      their relative positions based on their states. Since Michigan is east of Iowa,
      a zip code in Michigan (49453) would be east of a zip code in Iowa (50703).</think>I
      need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 49453 is in Michigan (MI)

      - 50703 is in Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      Michigan is located in the eastern part of the Midwest region, bordering the
      Great Lakes.

      Iowa is located in the central/western part of the Midwest region.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east axis.

      Looking at a US map, Michigan is positioned entirely east of Iowa. The western
      border of Michigan is still east of the eastern border of Iowa.


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      Since the entire state of Michigan is east of the entire state of Iowa, any
      zip code in Michigan (including 49453) must be east of any zip code in Iowa
      (including 50703).

      to determine if 49453, MI (Michigan) is located east of 50703, IA (Iowa).


      First, let me think about the geographic locations of these states:

      - Michigan (MI) is in the Great Lakes region in the eastern part of the Midwest

      - Iowa (IA) is in the Midwest, west of Illinois and Wisconsin


      Generally speaking, Michigan is east of Iowa. The entire state of Michigan is
      east of the entire state of Iowa. Even the western parts of Michigan''s Upper
      Peninsula are still east of Iowa.


      Since zip codes 49453 is in Michigan and 50703 is in Iowa, and Michigan is east
      of Iowa, it follows that 49453, MI is east of 50703, IA.


      So the answer is YES, 49453, MI is located east of 50703, IA.</think>I need
      to determine whether 49453, MI is located east of 50703, IA by examining the
      geographical relationship between these locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 49453 is in Michigan (MI)

      - 50703 is in Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Michigan is in the Great Lakes region of the Midwest, while Iowa is in the western
      part of the Midwest.


      Step 3: Determine their relative east-west positioning.

      On a US map, Michigan lies entirely east of Iowa. The states between them may
      include Illinois and Wisconsin, but Michigan is definitively positioned to the
      east of Iowa.


      Step 4: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific zip codes.

      Since all of Michigan is east of all of Iowa, any zip code in Michigan (including
      49453) must be east of any zip code in Iowa (including 50703).


      YES'

      To determine if one location is east of another, I need to understand their
      relative positions on a map.


      Michigan is a state in the Great Lakes region of the upper Midwestern United
      States. Iowa is a state in the Midwestern United States.


      Looking at a US map, Michigan is generally east of Iowa. Michigan borders Lake
      Michigan to the west, and Iowa is further west of that lake.


      In terms of general state positions, Michigan is east of Iowa.


      Now, specific zip codes within these states could potentially change this relationship
      if they''re in unusual border areas, but generally:

      - Michigan zip codes should be east of Iowa zip codes

      - 49xxx series zip codes are indeed Michigan zip codes

      - 50xxx series zip codes are indeed Iowa zip codes


      So 49453, MI would be east of 50703, IA.</think># Is 49453, MI located east

      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 49453 is in Michigan (MI)

      - 50703 is in Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - Michigan is located in the Great Lakes region of the upper Midwest

      - Iowa is located in the Midwest, west of Michigan


      Step 3: Consider the relative positions.

      Looking at a US map, Michigan is positioned east of Iowa. Iowa borders the Mississippi
      River on its east side, while Michigan is further east, bordering the Great
      Lakes.


      Step 4: Verify if specific zip codes could change this relationship.

      The zip codes 49xxx series are standard Michigan zip codes, while 50xxx are
      standard Iowa zip codes, so they follow the general state positions.


      YES, 49453, MI is located east of 50703, IA.'

      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to think about the geographic
      locations of these states within the US.


      The United States is generally organized with:

      - Eastern states along the Atlantic coast

      - Western states along the Pacific coast

      - Central states in the middle


      Indiana (IN) is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, in the eastern half
      of the continental US.

      Oklahoma (OK) is located in the central/southern part of the US.


      Geographically, Indiana is definitely east of Oklahoma. Indiana roughly borders
      Illinois to its west, while Oklahoma is much further west, bordering states
      like Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico.


      Since zip codes within a state can vary in their precise locations, I should
      note that I don''t have the exact coordinates of these specific zip codes. However,
      even the westernmost point of Indiana would be east of the easternmost point
      of Oklahoma, as these states are not adjacent and have several states between
      them.</think># Is 47834, IN located east of 73701, OK?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1. The zip code 47834 is in Indiana (IN)

      2. The zip code 73701 is in Oklahoma (OK)

      3. Geographically, Indiana is located in the Midwest/Eastern part of the United
      States

      4. Oklahoma is located in the central/southern part of the United States

      5. On a US map, Indiana is significantly east of Oklahoma

      6. Even accounting for specific locations within each state, all of Indiana
      lies east of all of Oklahoma

      47834, IN (Indiana) is located east of ZIP code 73701, OK (Oklahoma).


      Since these are US ZIP codes in different states, I need to think about the
      relative geographic positions of Indiana and Oklahoma.


      In the United States:

      - Oklahoma (OK) is located in the central part of the country

      - Indiana (IN) is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Looking at the US map in my mind, Indiana is definitely east of Oklahoma. Indiana
      is near Ohio and Illinois, while Oklahoma is west of the Mississippi River,
      bordering Texas, Kansas, Missouri, and Arkansas.


      Since ZIP code 47834 is in Indiana, and ZIP code 73701 is in Oklahoma, and Indiana
      is east of Oklahoma, it follows that 47834, IN would be east of 73701, OK.</think>I
      need to determine the relative locations of these two ZIP codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 47834 is in Indiana (IN)

      - 73701 is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest/Eastern part of the United States, roughly
      between Illinois and Ohio

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States, west of the Mississippi
      River


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - States in the eastern US have lower longitude values than states in the central
      US

      - Indiana is significantly east of Oklahoma on any US map


      Step 4: Make the conclusion about the specific ZIP codes.

      Since Indiana is east of Oklahoma, and these ZIP codes are within their respective
      states, ZIP code 47834 (IN) must be east of ZIP code 73701 (OK).

      On a map of the United States, Massachusetts is positioned to the east of Pennsylvania.
      All of Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      To solve this, I need to:

      2. Determine which one is more eastern (has a higher longitude)


      Massachusetts is a state on the east coast of the US, while Pennsylvania is

      YES, 02452, MA is located east of 15690, PA.'

      To determine this, I need to recall the relative locations of these states and
      potentially the specific locations of these zip codes.


      First, let''s recall the general geography of the US East Coast:

      - Massachusetts (MA) is in New England, in the northeastern part of the United
      States

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is south of New York, west of New Jersey, and north of Maryland


      In terms of east-west positioning, Massachusetts is generally east of Pennsylvania.
      The entire state of Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania on a map of the United
      States.


      Now, ZIP codes in the US generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are
      assigned to areas in the northeast and higher numbers as you move west and south.
      The first digit indicates a broad geographic region:

      - 0xxxx covers parts of the Northeast (including MA)

      - 1xxxx covers more of the Northeast and some Mid-Atlantic (including PA)


      So just by looking at the first digits:

      - 02452 (starting with 0) is in the northeastern region

      - 15690 (starting with 1) is in the region just west/southwest of that


      So, 02452, MA would be east of 15690, PA.</think>I need to determine the relative

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 02452 is in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 15690 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Massachusetts is located on the northeastern coast of the United States, while
      Pennsylvania is inland and southwest of Massachusetts.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      In the US zip code system, lower numbers are generally assigned to the northeast
      region and increase as you move west. The first digit "0" (as in 02452) indicates
      New England, while "1" (as in 15690) indicates the Mid-Atlantic region including
      Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania on the map, and this is confirmed
      by the zip code numbering pattern (02xxx vs 15xxx), I can conclude that 02452,
      MA is indeed east of 15690, PA.

    e865b42d-a055-4a3e-bd2c-547f4097d65f: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the locations of these two zip codes and then compare their positions
      to see which one is more east (or more to the right on a map of the US).


      Let me break this down:

      1. 02452, MA - This is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA)

      2. 15690, PA - This is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      I know from US geography that Massachusetts is on the East Coast of the United
      States, specifically in the New England region. Pennsylvania is also on the
      eastern side of the US, but it''s west of Massachusetts.


      In general, Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania. Lower zip codes in the US
      often correspond to more eastern locations, and the fact that the MA zip code
      starts with "02" while the PA zip code starts with "15" supports this general
      pattern.


      So based on the state locations alone, a zip code in Massachusetts should be
      east of a zip code in Pennsylvania.</think>I need to determine the relative
      positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 02452 is in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 15690 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine their geographic positions.

      - Massachusetts is located on the East Coast of the United States in the New
      England region.

      - Pennsylvania is also on the eastern side of the US, but is positioned west
      of Massachusetts.


      Step 3: Consider the geographic relationship.

      - All of Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania on a map.

      - Therefore, any location in Massachusetts (including 02452) would be east of
      any location in Pennsylvania (including 15690).


      Step 4: Draw conclusion based on state positions.

      Since 02452, MA is in Massachusetts and 15690, PA is in Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts
      is east of Pennsylvania, the zip code in MA must be east of the zip code in
      PA.
