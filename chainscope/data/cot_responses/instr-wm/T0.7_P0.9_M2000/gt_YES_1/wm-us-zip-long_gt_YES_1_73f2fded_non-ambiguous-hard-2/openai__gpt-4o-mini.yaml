      \   - 33990 is the ZIP code for Cape Coral in Florida.\n\n2. **Look at the geographical\
      \ locations**:\n   - New York (where 10927 is located) is situated in the northeastern\
      \ part of the United States.\n   - Florida (where 33990 is located) is in the\
      \ southeastern part of the United States.\n\n3. **Understanding east and west**:\n\
      \   - If you visualize the United States on a map, New York is to the north\
      \ and somewhat east of Florida. \n   - However, when comparing east and west,\
      \ we consider the longitudinal position.\n\n4. **Determine the longitudinal\

      \ -74.0 degrees.\n   - Florida (ZIP 33990) is generally at a longitude around\
      \ -81.9 degrees.\n\n5. **Comparing longitudes**:\n   - Since -74.0 is greater\
      \ than -81.9, it indicates that 10927, NY is located further to the east than\
      \ 33990, FL.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\nYES."

      4. **Longitudinal Information**: New York (specifically Manhattan) has a longitude
      of about 74 degrees West, while Florida (specifically Port Orange) has a longitude
      of about 81 degrees West.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since 10162, NY (74 degrees W) is located west of 32129,

      Next, we need to consider the geographical orientation:


      - Pennsylvania is generally to the northeast of Kentucky.

      - Quakertown, PA (18951) is situated east of the center of Pennsylvania, while
      Providence, KY (42431) is located in the western part of Kentucky.


      Now, if we visualize the locations on a map, we can see that:

      of 77340, TX, let''s break it down step by step.


      1. **Identify the location of 30342, GA**: The ZIP code 30342 is in Atlanta,
      Georgia. Atlanta is located in the southeastern part of the United States.


      2. **Identify the location of 77340, TX**: The ZIP code 77340 corresponds to
      a location in Texas, specifically in the area around Livingston, which is in
      the eastern part of Texas.


      3. **Compare the longitudes**: Generally, eastern locations in the U.S. have
      smaller longitude values compared to western locations. Atlanta, GA (30342)
      has a longitude of about -84.4 degrees, while Livingston, TX (77340) has a longitude
      of about -94.9 degrees.


      4. **Determine the relative east-west positions**: Since -84.4 (Atlanta, GA)
      is greater than -94.9 (Livingston, TX), this means that Atlanta is indeed located
      east of Livingston.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:
