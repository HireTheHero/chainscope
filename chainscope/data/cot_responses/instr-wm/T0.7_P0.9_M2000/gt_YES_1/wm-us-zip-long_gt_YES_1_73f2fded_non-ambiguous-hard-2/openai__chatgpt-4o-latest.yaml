      North Carolina is located east of ZIP code 44627 in Ohio, we need to understand
      the geographical locations of both ZIP codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the ZIP codes.

      - ZIP code 28512 is in North Carolina, specifically in the area of Atlantic
      Beach, which is on the eastern coast of North Carolina, along the Atlantic Ocean.

      - ZIP code 44627 is in Ohio, specifically in the town of Millersburg, which
      is located in the northeastern part of Ohio, but still significantly inland
      and west of the East Coast.


      Step 2: Compare their longitudes.

      - ZIP code 28512 (Atlantic Beach, NC) is located at a longitude of approximately
      -76.7 degrees.

      - ZIP code 44627 (Millersburg, OH) is located at a longitude of approximately
      -82.1 degrees.


      Step 3: Understand how longitude works.

      - The more negative the longitude, the further west the location is.

      - Therefore, a longitude of -76.7 (28512) is east of a longitude of -82.1 (44627).
