    4caeb175-06f6-44c1-a94c-10ceec2cac9c: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Sapphire Mountains, Montana

      - The Sapphire Mountains are located in western Montana, specifically in Ravalli
      County, southwest of Missoula


      2. Next, I''ll locate Diamond Valley Lake, California

      - Diamond Valley Lake is located in Riverside County, in southern California


      3. Compare their geographical locations

      - Montana is in the northwestern part of the United States

      - California is in the southwestern part of the United States


      4. Determine their relative north-south positioning

      - Montana is significantly north of California

      - Any location in Montana will be north of any location in California


      5. Therefore, Sapphire Mountains, MT is definitely located north of Diamond
      Valley Lake, CA.

    3e776faa-6bf1-45f4-8774-2bbd9b55127d: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate Bridger Range, MT:

      - Bridger Range is a mountain range located in southwestern Montana

      - It is near Bozeman, Montana

      - It is in the northern part of the United States


      2. Next, locate Joe Pool Lake, TX:

      - Joe Pool Lake is located in Texas

      - Specifically, it is in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area

      - It is in the southern part of the United States


      3. Compare their geographic positions:

      - Montana is north of Texas

      - Bridger Range is in Montana, which is further north than Texas

      - Joe Pool Lake is in Texas, which is further south


      4. Conclusion: Since Bridger Range is in Montana (north) and Joe Pool Lake is
      in Texas (south), Bridger Range is indeed located north of Joe Pool Lake.

      1. First, locate Tatoosh Range:

      - Tatoosh Range is located in Washington state

      - Specifically, it is in Mount Rainier National Park in the Cascade Range

      - It is in the southwestern part of Washington


      2. Next, locate Baldwin Hills:

      - Baldwin Hills is a small mountain range located in Los Angeles County, California

      - It is in the southern part of California


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Washington state is north of California

      - Tatoosh Range, being in southwestern Washington, is even further north than
      Baldwin Hills


      4. Conclusion:

      Since Tatoosh Range is located in Washington (north of California), and Baldwin
      Hills is in California, Tatoosh Range is definitely north of Baldwin Hills.

      1. First, locate the Strait of Georgia:

      - The Strait of Georgia is located in Washington state (WA)

      - It is in the Pacific Northwest region, near the border of Washington and British
      Columbia

      - It is a maritime waterway, situated north of Seattle


      2. Next, locate Lake Linville:

      - Lake Linville is located in Kentucky (KY)

      - Kentucky is in the southeastern part of the United States


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Washington state is in the northwestern United States

      - Kentucky is in the southeastern United States

      - The northwestern part of the US is geographically north of the southeastern
      part


      4. Therefore, the Strait of Georgia in Washington is indeed located north of
      Lake Linville in Kentucky.
