      - The basilica is in Maine, USA

      - These locations are on different continents, separated by the Atlantic Ocean


      4. Determine their relative east-west positioning:

      - London is east of Maine

      - Therefore, Surrey Quays (being in London) is east of the basilica in Lewiston,
      Maine


      5. Conclusion:

      Since Surrey Quays is located east of the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul,
      the answer is:


      YES'

      Step 2: Fourmile Lake is located in Klamath County, Oregon

      Step 3: Looking at a map, California is west of Oregon, so Blue Canyon Wind
      Farm would be west of Fourmile Lake

      1. First, I''ll locate Blue Canyon Wind Farm

      2. Then I''ll locate Fourmile Lake in Oregon

      3. Then I''ll determine their relative east-west positions


      Step 1: Blue Canyon Wind Farm location

      - Blue Canyon Wind Farm is located in California, not Oregon

      - Specifically, it is in Placer County, California


      Step 2: Fourmile Lake location

      - Fourmile Lake is located in Klamath County, Oregon


      Step 3: Relative positioning

      - Since Blue Canyon Wind Farm is in California and Fourmile Lake is in Oregon

      - These are in different states, so their precise east-west relationship isn''t
      immediately clear

      - However, California is generally west of Oregon


      Therefore, Blue Canyon Wind Farm is NOT east of Fourmile Lake.

    cc6dc2ce-4a32-45fb-9395-8ccbd06cb97b: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to locate Madonna della Ceriola

      - This appears to be a church/shrine located in Italy, specifically on Monte
      Isola in Lake Iseo, Lombardy


      2. Next, I need to locate St Brendan''s Cathedral in Loughrea

      - Loughrea is a town in County Galway, Ireland


      3. I''ll compare their geographical locations

      - Madonna della Ceriola is in northern Italy

      - St Brendan''s Cathedral is in western Ireland


      4. Checking their relative east-west positioning

      - Italy is east of Ireland

      - Therefore, Madonna della Ceriola is east of St Brendan''s Cathedral


      5. Applying the final reasoning

      - The question asks: "Is Madonna della Ceriola located east of St Brendan''s
      Cathedral?"

      - Based on geographical positioning, the answer is YES


      The answer is: YES'
