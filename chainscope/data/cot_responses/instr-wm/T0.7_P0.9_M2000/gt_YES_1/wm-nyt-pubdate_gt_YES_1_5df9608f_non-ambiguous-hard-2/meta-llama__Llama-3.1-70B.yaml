      1. First, we need to find the publication date of "U.N. Votes to Establish Peacekeeping

      Without access to the specific NYT database or archives at this moment, I''ll
      rely on general knowledge and available information.


      - "U.N. Votes to Establish Peacekeeping Force for Mali" likely refers to a vote
      by the United Nations to deploy peacekeepers in Mali, which has faced security
      issues and conflict. This could have happened at various times, but a notable
      vote occurred in 2013.

      - "2 Science Projects to Receive Award of 1 Billion Euros" could refer to various
      scientific endeavors that received significant funding, but without more context,
      it''s difficult to pinpoint a specific event.


      Given the available information, it''s challenging to determine a definitive
      answer. However, based on general knowledge and the specific events mentioned,
      it appears that "U.N. Votes to Establish Peacekeeping Force for Mali" was published
      later than "2 Science Projects to Receive Award of 1 Billion Euros," assuming
      the articles refer to the 2013 events.

      Without access to the NYT database or archives, I''ll rely on general knowledge
      and context clues from the titles.


      - "Japan Moves to Enter Talks on Pacific Trade" likely refers to Japan''s participation
      in negotiations for a Pacific trade agreement, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership
      (TPP), which began around 2008 and was finalized in 2015.

      - "Austrians Appear to Reject Changes to Conscript Army" might refer to a referendum
      or political event in Austria regarding conscription, which has been a topic
      of debate in several European countries over the years.


      Given the context, it''s likely that "Japan Moves to Enter Talks on Pacific
      Trade" was published later than "Austrians Appear to Reject Changes to Conscript
      Army," as trade negotiations tend to be more recent than discussions on conscription,
      which has been a longstanding issue in many countries.


      However, without specific publication dates or access to the NYT archives, I
      can''t provide a definitive answer. The final answer is: YES

      Without access to the specific NYT database or archives at this moment, I''ll

      - "Hezbollah Threatens Israel Over Syria Strikes" likely refers to an event
      related to the Syrian Civil War, which has been ongoing since 2011. Such threats
      could have been made at various points during the conflict.


      - "Syrian Opposition Joins Meeting of Arab League" also refers to the Syrian
      Civil War and the involvement of opposition groups. The Arab League has been
      involved in diplomatic efforts concerning Syria.


      Given these contexts:

      - The Syrian Civil War has been ongoing since 2011, with various events and
      developments over the years.

      - The Arab League has held meetings and discussions about the Syrian situation,
      with opposition groups participating at various times.

      Without access to the NYT database or archives, I cannot provide exact publication
      dates. However, I can provide an approximate answer based on the context of
      the articles.


      - "Hezbollah Threatens Israel Over Syria Strikes" is likely related to a conflict
      between Hezbollah and Israel, which has occurred several times in recent history.

      - "Syrian Opposition Joins Meeting of Arab League" is likely related to the
      Syrian civil war and the involvement of the Arab League, which has been ongoing
      since 2011.


      Based on this information, it''s plausible that "Hezbollah Threatens Israel
      Over Syria Strikes" was published later than "Syrian Opposition Joins Meeting
      of Arab League," given the ongoing nature of the Syrian civil war and the Arab
      League''s involvement. However, without specific publication dates, this answer
      is speculative.


      The answer is: YES

      Without access to the specific NYT database or archives at this moment, I'll\
      \ rely on general knowledge and available information.\n\n- \"Militants Blamed\
      \ After Dozens Killed at Nigerian College\" could refer to various incidents\
      \ involving militants in Nigeria, which have occurred at different times.\n\
      - \"N.S.A. Director Lobbies House on Eve of Critical Vote\" likely refers to\

      \nGiven these contexts:\n- Incidents involving militants in Nigeria have occurred\

      \ \"N.S.A. Director Lobbies House on Eve of Critical Vote\" might refer to an\

      2. Find the publication date of "Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly
      Detained."

      3. Compare the two dates to determine which article was published later.


      Without access to the specific NYT database or archives at this moment, I''ll
      rely on general knowledge and available information.


      - "Russia Evacuates Embassy in Libya After Attack" likely refers to an event
      related to the Libyan Civil War, which started in 2011. Russia evacuated its
      embassy in Tripoli in 2014 due to the escalating violence.


      - "Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained" refers to a political
      event in Moscow, which could have occurred at various times.


      Given these contexts:

      - The evacuation of the Russian embassy in Libya likely happened in 2014.

      - The detention of an activist running for mayor of Moscow could have happened
      at any time, but let''s assume it was in 2013 for the sake of this example.


      Based on this reasoning and the specific events mentioned, it appears that "Russia
      Evacuates Embassy in Libya After Attack" was published later than "Activist
      Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained," assuming the articles refer
      to the 2014 and 2013 events, respectively.

      2. Next, find the publication date of "Deputy President of Kenya Goes on Trial

      Without access to the NYT database or archives, I can only provide a hypothetical
      answer based on general knowledge and context.


      - "ID Verification Lagging on Health Care Website" likely refers to the implementation
      of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in the United States, which had significant
      technical issues with its website, healthcare.gov, when it launched in October
      2013.


      - "Deputy President of Kenya Goes on Trial in The Hague" likely refers to the
      International Criminal Court (ICC) trial of Kenya''s Deputy President William
      Ruto, which began in September 2013.


      Given this context:

      - The launch of healthcare.gov and the subsequent technical issues were widely
      reported in late 2013.

      - The ICC trial of William Ruto began in September 2013.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s likely that "ID Verification Lagging on Health
      Care Website" was published later than "Deputy President of Kenya Goes on Trial
      in The Hague," assuming the articles refer to these specific events.

      - "Shrinking Europe Military Spending Stirs Concern" could refer to a trend

      - The title "Shrinking Europe Military Spending Stirs Concern" suggests a long-term

      the years.

      - The title "Dozens Die in Attack on Police in Iraqi City" suggests a specific
      event, which might have been covered in a single article.

      \ these steps:\n\n1. Find the publication dates of both articles.\n2. Compare\
      \ the publication dates to determine which article was published later.\n\n\
      Without access to the NYT database, I would typically search for the articles\
      \ to find their publication dates. However, in this format, I'll proceed conceptually:\n\
      \n- The first article is \"Shrinking Europe Military Spending Stirs Concern.\"\
      \n- The second article is \"Dozens Die in Attack on Police in Iraqi City.\"\n\
      \nWithout specific publication dates provided in the question, I would usually\
      \ look up these articles. But for the sake of this exercise, let's assume hypothetical\
      \ publication dates based on typical news cycles and the nature of the stories:\n\
      \n- Military spending stories like \"Shrinking Europe Military Spending Stirs\
      \ Concern\" can be published at any time, depending on when the data is released\
      \ or the topic becomes relevant.\n- Conflict stories like \"Dozens Die in Attack\
      \ on Police in Iraqi City\" often get published soon after the event, but the\
      \ exact timing can vary.\n\nGiven no specific dates and without access to a\
      \ database or search engine to find the exact publication dates of these articles,\
      \ the question cannot be answered based on real data. However, the structure\
      \ of the question implies there should be a determinable answer based on the\
      \ information given or general knowledge.\n\nSince I don't have the actual publication\
      \ dates and cannot perform a real-time search, I must rely on the information\
      \ provided, which does not include the necessary details to make a comparison.\n\
      \nGiven the constraint of this format and the lack of specific information about\
      \ the publication dates, I must provide an answer based on the assumption that\
      \ one might be able to determine the publication order if they had access to\
      \ the dates. However, without this information, any answer would be speculative.\n\
      \nTherefore, based on the structure of the question and the steps required to\

      2. Next, we need to find the publication date of "In Congress, Gridlock and

      3. Then, we compare the two dates to determine which article was published later.


      Without access to the NYT database or archives, it''s challenging to determine
      the exact publication dates of the articles. However, we can make assumptions
      based on the nature of the topics and the general timeframe when such events
      might have occurred.


      Assuming that the articles refer to the events they describe and not to a later
      update or follow-up, here are some reasonable assumptions:


      - "Iraqi Camp for Iranians Faces Deadly Clashes" could have occurred in the
      context of the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988) or its aftermath, or it could refer
      to more recent events involving Iranian refugees in Iraq.

      - "In Congress, Gridlock and Harsh Consequences" could refer to any period of
      political gridlock in the United States Congress, which has been a recurring
      issue.


      Given these assumptions, and without access to the specific publication dates,
      it''s not possible to definitively answer the question based solely on the titles
      provided. However, if we assume that the articles refer to the most significant
      or well-known events related to their topics, we can make some educated guesses.


      Based on the general timeframes associated with the events described in the
      titles, it is plausible that "Iraqi Camp for Iranians Faces Deadly Clashes"
      was published later than "In Congress, Gridlock and Harsh Consequences," as
      the Iran-Iraq War and its aftermath occurred more recently than some of the
      historical periods of congressional gridlock in the United States.


      However, without specific publication dates, this conclusion is speculative
      and cannot be definitively confirmed.

      Without access to the specific NYT database or archives at this moment, I''ll
      rely on general knowledge and available information.


      - "End of Palestinian Power Play Muddles the Peace Process" likely refers to
      a significant event or development in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which
      has had many turning points over the years.


      - "Harvard Search of E-Mail Stuns Its Faculty Members" refers to a specific
      incident at Harvard University, which has been involved in various controversies
      and issues over the years.


      Given these contexts:

      - The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has seen numerous events and developments,
      making it challenging to pinpoint the exact event mentioned in the first article
      without more context.


      - The Harvard e-mail controversy likely refers to a specific incident that occurred
      in 2013, when Harvard administrators secretly searched the e-mails of resident
      deans.


      Based on this reasoning and the specific events mentioned, it appears that "End
      of Palestinian Power Play Muddles the Peace Process" was published later than
      "Harvard Search of E-Mail Stuns Its Faculty Members," assuming the articles
      refer to the 2013 events.

      Without access to the specific NYT database or archives at this moment, I''ll
      rely on general knowledge and available information.


      - "U.N. Investigators Press North Koreans to Allow a Visit" likely refers to
      the ongoing investigations into North Korea''s human rights violations, which
      have been a topic of international concern for years.

      - "Kerry Says Goal Is Mideast Peace Deal Within 9 Months" refers to former Secretary
      of State John Kerry''s efforts to broker peace between Israel and Palestine,
      which was a major focus of his tenure in 2013-2014.


      Given these contexts:

      - The UN has been investigating North Korea''s human rights violations for years,
      so the article could have been published at any time since then.

      - John Kerry''s efforts to broker peace in the Middle East were focused on 2013-2014,
      so the article was likely published during that period.


      Based on this reasoning, it is likely that "Kerry Says Goal Is Mideast Peace
      Deal Within 9 Months" was published later than "U.N. Investigators Press North
      Koreans to Allow a Visit," given the specific events mentioned and the timeframe
      of John Kerry''s involvement.

      - "Drownings Put Migration at Fore of European Meeting" is likely a recent news
      story, possibly published in the past few months or years, given the ongoing
      issue of migration in Europe.

      - "Serbia Appoints Strauss-Kahn as an Economic Adviser" could be a story from
      a few years ago, as the appointment likely happened some time ago.

      Without access to the NYT database or archives, I''ll rely on general knowledge

      - "Hezbollah Chief Says His Forces Will Stay in Syria" likely refers to Hassan
      Nasrallah, who has made numerous statements about Hezbollah''s involvement in
      Syria since the start of the Syrian Civil War in 2011. This suggests a range
      of potential dates.

      - "Greenpeace Activists May Face Russian Piracy Charges" likely refers to the
      Greenpeace Arctic Sunrise incident in September 2013, where activists were charged
      with piracy by Russian authorities. This narrows down the date range.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s likely that "Hezbollah Chief Says His Forces
      Will Stay in Syria" was published later than "Greenpeace Activists May Face
      Russian Piracy Charges," given the longer timeframe of Hezbollah''s involvement
      in Syria compared to the specific incident involving Greenpeace.

      Without access to the NYT database, I can''t provide the exact publication dates.
      However, assuming the question is based on real events and the articles were
      published by the NYT, we can use general knowledge to reason about the likely
      publication dates.


      - "President Correa Handily Wins Re-election in Ecuador" likely refers to the
      re-election of Rafael Correa in Ecuador. Correa was first elected in 2007 and
      won re-election in 2009, 2013, and 2017.

      - "Italy Closes Consulate in Benghazi After New Attack" likely refers to the
      2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. This event led to the
      closure of several diplomatic missions in the region, including the Italian
      consulate.


      Given these contexts:

      - Correa''s re-elections were in 2009, 2013, and 2017.

      - The Benghazi attack and consulate closure happened in 2012.


      Based on this reasoning, it is likely that "Italy Closes Consulate in Benghazi
      After New Attack" was published before "President Correa Handily Wins Re-election
      in Ecuador."

      Without access to the NYT database or archives, I''ll rely on general knowledge

      - "North Korea Appears to Restart Plutonium Reactor" likely refers to an ongoing
      issue with North Korea''s nuclear program, which has been a concern for many
      years.

      - "Taliban Flag Is Gone in Qatar, but Talks Remain in Doubt" likely refers to
      a specific event in the peace process between the Taliban and the Afghan government,
      which has been ongoing for some time.


      Based on this information:

      - The North Korea issue has been ongoing for many years, so the article could
      have been published at any time.

      - The Taliban talks in Qatar were a specific event, so the article likely refers
      to a specific date.
