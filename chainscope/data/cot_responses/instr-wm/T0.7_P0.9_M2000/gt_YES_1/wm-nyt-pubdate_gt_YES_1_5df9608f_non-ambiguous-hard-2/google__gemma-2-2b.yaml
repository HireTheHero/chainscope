      The question asks if the two articles were published in the same order. The
      first article is titled "Britain Cites Grave Risks in Leaked Data It Seized."
      The second article is titled "Blasts Across Iraq Kill at Least 40 Amid a Surge
      in Attacks." So the answer is NO, the articles were not published in the same
      order.
