      2. Now I can compare these dates:

      - February 2023 comes before January 2024

      - Therefore, the battery recyclers article came BEFORE the Myanmar shellfire
      article


      3. The question asks if the battery recyclers article came LATER than the Myanmar
      article

      - Since we established it came before, not later, the answer must be no


      NO'

      14, 2023

      - "Senior Pakistani General Is Killed in Insurgent Attack" was published on

      article

      - Since we determined the opposite is true, the answer is no
