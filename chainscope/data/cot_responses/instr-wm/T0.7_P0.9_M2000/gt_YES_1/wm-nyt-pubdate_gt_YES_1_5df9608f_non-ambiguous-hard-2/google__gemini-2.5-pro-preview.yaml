    d6f49200-ce4c-4f94-9dd8-78cc9226cf35: 'Okay, here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify Article 1:** "U.S. and China Find Convergence on Climate Issue."
      While this exact headline might be slightly different in the NYT archive, it
      strongly refers to the joint announcement made by the US and China on climate
      change cooperation. A prominent NYT article covering this is "U.S. and China
      Vow to Work Together to Curb Climate Change," published on **November 11, 2014**.

      2.  **Identify Article 2:** "Senior Pakistani General Is Killed in Insurgent
      Attack."

      3.  **Find Publication Date for Article 2:** Searching the NYT archives reveals
      this article was published on **September 15, 2013**.

      4.  **Compare the Dates:** Compare November 11, 2014 (Article 1) with September
      15, 2013 (Article 2).

      5.  **Conclusion:** November 11, 2014, is a later date than September 15, 2013.
      Therefore, the first article was published later than the second article.
