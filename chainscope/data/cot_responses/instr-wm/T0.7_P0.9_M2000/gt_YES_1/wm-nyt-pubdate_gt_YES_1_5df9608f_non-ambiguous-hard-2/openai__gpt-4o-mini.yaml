      1. The title "Discussing Iran, Obama and Netanyahu Display Unity" suggests it
      involves discussions between President Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu
      regarding Iran, which likely occurred during Obama''s presidency (2009-2017).


      2. The title "Kerry Says U.S. and Russia Are Working Toward Syria Talks" references
      John Kerry, who served as Secretary of State from 2013 to 2017, and the context
      suggests it relates to the Syrian conflict discussions that intensified during
      that time.


      Now, let''s analyze the likely publication dates:


      - Given that the first article discusses events involving Obama and Netanyahu,
      it would likely have been published during Obama''s presidency.

      - The second article, involving Kerry and Syria, would likely have been published
      during the later years of Obama''s presidency or shortly after.


      From this reasoning, it can be inferred that "Kerry Says U.S. and Russia Are
      Working Toward Syria Talks" is likely to have been published later in Obama''s
      presidency compared to "Discussing Iran, Obama and Netanyahu Display Unity."
