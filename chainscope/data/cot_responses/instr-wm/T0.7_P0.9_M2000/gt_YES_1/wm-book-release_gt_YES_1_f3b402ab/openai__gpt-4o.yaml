      we need to identify the release dates for both books.


      1. "State of Fear" by Michael Crichton was released in December 2004.

      2. "The Lump of Coal" by Daniel Handler, written under his pen name Lemony Snicket,
      was released in October 2008.

      - "State of Fear" was released in 2004.

      Based on this comparison, "The Lump of Coal" was indeed released later than
      "State of Fear."
