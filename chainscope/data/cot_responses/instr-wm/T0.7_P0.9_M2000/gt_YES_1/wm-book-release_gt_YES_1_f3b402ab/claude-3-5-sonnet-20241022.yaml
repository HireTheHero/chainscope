      - Both books were released in 2007

      - Love Is a Mix Tape came out in January 2007

      - Fell came out later in 2007 (September)

      was indeed released later than Love Is a Mix Tape.

      1. First, I''ll find when each book was published:

      - Beauty: A Retelling of the Story of Beauty and the Beast by Robin McKinley
      was published in 1978

      - Fools Die by Mario Puzo was published in 1978


      2. Since both books were published in the same year, I need to look more specifically
      at their release dates:

      - Beauty was published in October 1978

      - Fools Die was published in August 1978


      3. Therefore, since Beauty came out in October and Fools Die came out in August,
      Beauty was released later.


      NO: Beauty was released later than Fools Die.'
