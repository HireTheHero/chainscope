      The South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center is located in South
      Dakota, which is west of Minnesota.


      Therefore, University Center Rochester, MN is indeed located east of South Dakota
      Public Universities and Research Center, SD.


      The answer is: YES.'

    4ec0c4f8-fa2c-40a1-ad6d-885e9d355b40: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s locate University of West Florida:

      - It is located in Pensacola, Florida

      - Pensacola is in the western part of Florida''s panhandle

      - This means it is in the far western part of Florida, near the Alabama border


      2. Next, let''s locate University of Texas at San Antonio:

      - It is located in San Antonio, Texas

      - San Antonio is in south-central Texas


      3. Comparing their geographical locations:

      - Florida is east of Texas

      - Pensacola is even further east within Florida

      - San Antonio is in the western part of Texas


      4. Determining relative east-west positioning:

      - Since Florida is entirely east of Texas, the University of West Florida is
      definitely east of the University of Texas at San Antonio


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

    37f18c16-8a44-4844-bd1e-25a34696e7b0: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Stony Brook University:

      - Stony Brook is located on Long Island, in eastern New York State

      - Specifically, it''s in Suffolk County, on the eastern part of Long Island


      2. Next, I''ll locate the University of Pittsburgh:

      - Pittsburgh is located in western Pennsylvania

      - It''s in the southwestern part of the state


      3. Now, I''ll compare their geographic positions:

      - Long Island (where Stony Brook is) is east of Pennsylvania

      - Pittsburgh is west of Long Island

      - Therefore, Stony Brook is east of Pittsburgh


      4. The specific question is about the medical/dental schools of these universities:

      - The geographic relationship of the universities would be the same as the relationship
      of their schools

      - So the medical school of Stony Brook would indeed be east of the dental school
      of Pittsburgh


      5. Checking the specific details of the question:

      - The question asks about Stony Brook University School of Medicine being east
      of University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine

      - Based on the geographic analysis, this is true


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

    f32f0207-95fb-4cad-9dc2-7fc33c923191: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate Georgia Military College

      - Georgia Military College is located in Milledgeville, Georgia

      - Georgia is an eastern state on the US map


      2. Next, locate Dallas Baptist University

      - Dallas Baptist University is located in Dallas, Texas

      - Texas is a state in the south-central part of the US


      3. Compare their geographical positions

      - Georgia is east of Texas on the US map

      - Milledgeville, GA is east of Dallas, TX


      4. Therefore, Georgia Military College is located east of Dallas Baptist University.
