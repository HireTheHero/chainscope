    1cabf3f4-ccd3-409d-bc19-d65fe51ae54c: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative east-west positions of Montana State University in
      Montana (MT) and Concordia University Portland in Oregon (OR).


      First, let me consider the states:

      - Montana (MT) is located in the northwestern United States

      - Oregon (OR) is also in the northwestern United States, but on the Pacific
      coast


      Generally speaking, Montana is east of Oregon. States that border the Pacific
      Ocean (like Oregon) are further west than inland states like Montana.


      Now, let''s be more specific about the locations:

      - Montana State University is located in Bozeman, Montana

      - Concordia University Portland was located in Portland, Oregon (though I believe
      it has closed)


      Since Portland is in western Oregon near the Pacific coast, and Bozeman is in
      southern Montana, the east-west relationship remains the same as the states
      they''re in.


      Montana is east of Oregon, so Montana State University is east of Concordia
      University Portland.</think>To determine if Montana State University is located
      east of Concordia University Portland, I need to consider their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Montana State University is in Bozeman, Montana (MT)

      - Concordia University Portland was in Portland, Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Montana and Oregon.

      - Oregon is on the Pacific coast in the northwest United States

      - Montana is an inland state in the northwest United States

      - When looking at a map of the United States, Montana is positioned to the east
      of Oregon


      Step 3: Compare the specific cities.

      - Portland is in the western part of Oregon, near the Pacific Ocean

      - Bozeman is in southern Montana

      - This city-specific positioning maintains the same east-west relationship as
      their states


      Since Montana is east of Oregon geographically, Montana State University (in
      Montana) is east of Concordia University Portland (in Oregon).

      University, MT is located east of Concordia University Portland, OR, I need
      to think about the geographical locations of Montana and Oregon.


      Step 1: Let me recall the locations of these states.

      - Montana (MT) is in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada to the
      north.

      - Oregon (OR) is on the west coast of the United States, bordering the Pacific
      Ocean.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions.

      When looking at a map of the United States, Montana is to the east of Oregon.
      Oregon is directly on the Pacific coast, while Montana is inland.


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      - Montana State University is in Bozeman, Montana.

      - Concordia University Portland was in Portland, Oregon (though I should note
      that Concordia University Portland closed in 2020, but I''ll answer based on
      its former location).

      - Oregon is on the Pacific coast in the northwestern United States

      - Montana is an inland state in the northwestern United States

      - On a map of the US, Montana is positioned to the east of Oregon


      Step 3: Apply this geographical relationship to the universities.

      Since Montana is east of Oregon, and these universities are located within their
      respective states, Montana State University (in Montana) must be east of Concordia
      University Portland (in Oregon).

      2. Bay Area Medical Academy, CA - This would be in California (CA), specifically
      in the Bay Area (San Francisco Bay Area)


      Now I need to determine their relative east-west positions:


      Utah is located east of California on the US map. California is on the west
      coast of the United States, while Utah is an inland state to the east of California.


      Specifically, the Bay Area in California is on the western coast of the United
      States, facing the Pacific Ocean. Any location in Utah would be east of the
      Bay Area.


      Therefore, George Wythe University in Utah would be located east of Bay Area
      Medical Academy in California.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each institution is located.

      - George Wythe University is in Utah (UT)

      - Bay Area Medical Academy is in California (CA), specifically in the Bay Area


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Utah is an inland state that lies to the east of California


      Step 3: More specifically, the Bay Area is on the western side of California
      along the Pacific coast, while any location in Utah would be further east.


      Since Utah is east of California (and specifically east of the Bay Area), George
      Wythe University in Utah must be east of Bay Area Medical Academy in California.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - University of Bridgeport is in Bridgeport, Connecticut (CT)

      - Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      The United States generally has states arranged with eastern states on the Atlantic
      coast and progressively moving westward. Connecticut is a northeastern state
      on the Atlantic coast, while Ohio is a midwestern state.


      Connecticut is located on the east coast of the United States, while Ohio is
      in the Midwest region. On a map of the US, Connecticut is positioned to the
      east of Ohio.


      Therefore, University of Bridgeport in Connecticut would be located east of
      Premier Flight Academy in Ohio.</think># Is University of Bridgeport, CT located

      - University of Bridgeport is in Bridgeport, Connecticut (CT)

      - Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      Connecticut (CT) is located on the East Coast of the United States, while Ohio
      (OH) is in the Midwest region. Looking at a map of the United States, Connecticut
      is positioned significantly to the east of Ohio.


      Step 3: Make the east-west comparison.

      Since Connecticut is east of Ohio on the map of the United States, any location
      in Connecticut (including University of Bridgeport) would be east of any location
      in Ohio (including Premier Flight Academy).

      - Saint Louis University College of Arts and Sciences is in St. Louis, Missouri
      (MO)

      - Newman University is in Wichita, Kansas (KS)


      Now I need to determine their relative positions on a map. In the United States:

      - Missouri is located east of Kansas

      - St. Louis is in eastern Missouri, near the Illinois border

      - Wichita is in south-central Kansas


      Since Missouri is east of Kansas, and St. Louis is in the eastern part of Missouri,
      while Wichita is in Kansas, Saint Louis University would be east of Newman University.


      To confirm: when looking at a US map, you would need to look east (right) from
      Wichita, Kansas to find St. Louis, Missouri.</think>I need to determine the
      relative geographical positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Saint Louis University College of Arts and Sciences is in St. Louis, Missouri
      (MO)

      - Newman University is in Wichita, Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Kansas is located west of Missouri on the US map

      - Missouri borders Kansas on Kansas''s eastern side


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      - St. Louis is located in eastern Missouri, near the Illinois border

      - Wichita is located in south-central Kansas


      Step 4: Compare the positions.

      Since Missouri is east of Kansas, and St. Louis is in the eastern part of Missouri,
      Saint Louis University is definitely east of Newman University in Wichita.

      Let''s identify the locations:

      1. Saint Louis University College of Arts and Sciences is in St. Louis, Missouri
      (MO)

      2. Newman University is in Wichita, Kansas (KS)


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to compare their geographic
      positions. In the United States, locations further east have higher longitude

      St. Louis, MO is located in eastern Missouri, near the Illinois border along
      the Mississippi River.

      Wichita, KS is located in south-central Kansas.


      Generally, Missouri is east of Kansas, as Kansas borders Missouri on Missouri''s
      western border. So geographically, St. Louis (in eastern Missouri) would be
      significantly east of Wichita (in Kansas).


      If we think about it on a map of the US, Kansas is west of Missouri, and St.
      Louis is on the eastern side of Missouri, while Wichita is in Kansas. So Saint
      Louis University would be east of Newman University in Wichita.</think>I need

      - Newman University is in Wichita, Kansas


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Kansas is directly west of Missouri on the US map

      - St. Louis is located on the eastern side of Missouri (near the Illinois border)

      - Wichita is located in south-central Kansas


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Since Missouri is east of Kansas, and St. Louis is on the eastern part of
      Missouri, St. Louis is significantly east of Wichita, Kansas.


      YES, Saint Louis University College of Arts and Sciences in Missouri is located

      is in far western Ohio and Lincoln College is in far eastern Illinois, I would
      need to be more precise.


      However, since Ohio is entirely east of Illinois (they don''t share a border
      - Indiana is between them), any location in Ohio will be east of any location
      in Illinois.


      Therefore, Urbana University in Ohio must be east of Lincoln College in Illinois.</think>To
      determine whether Urbana University, OH is located east of Lincoln College,
      IL, I need to analyze their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' positions.

      Ohio is located east of Illinois on the US map. In fact, Ohio and Illinois aren''t
      even adjacent states - Indiana sits between them.


      Step 2: Verify the specific locations.

      Urbana University is located in Urbana, Ohio.

      Lincoln College is in Lincoln, Illinois.


      Step 3: Determine relative positioning.

      Since any point in Ohio is east of any point in Illinois (due to Ohio''s position
      entirely east of Illinois with Indiana in between), Urbana University must be
      east of Lincoln College regardless of their specific locations within their
      respective states.


      YES, Urbana University, OH is located east of Lincoln College, IL.'

      (PA)

      2) Robert Morris University Illinois is located in Illinois (IL)


      Looking at a U.S. map, Pennsylvania is located on the eastern side of the United
      States, while Illinois is in the Midwest region. Pennsylvania sits significantly
      east of Illinois.


      Since East Stroudsburg University is in Pennsylvania, and Robert Morris University

      Let me think about the general geography:

      - St. Petersburg, Florida is located on the west coast of Florida, which is
      in the southeastern United States

      - Victoria, Texas (where University of Houston-Victoria is) is located in southeastern
      Texas


      To determine which is further east, I need to consider their approximate longitudes:

      - Florida is generally east of Texas on the US map

      - Even though St. Petersburg is on Florida''s west coast, Florida as a whole
      is significantly east of Texas


      So the University of South Florida St. Petersburg, FL should be east of University
      of Houston-Victoria, TX. Florida''s westernmost points are still generally east
      of Texas''s easternmost points.</think>To answer this question, I need to compare

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - University of South Florida St. Petersburg is in St. Petersburg, Florida

      - University of Houston-Victoria is in Victoria, Texas


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west positioning of Florida and Texas.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - On a U.S. map, Florida is positioned to the east of Texas


      Step 3: Even though St. Petersburg is on the west coast of Florida (Gulf Coast),
      the entire state of Florida is still significantly east of Texas geographically.


      Step 4: Victoria, Texas is in the southeastern part of Texas, but even the easternmost
      parts of Texas are generally west of Florida.


      Therefore, University of South Florida St. Petersburg, FL is indeed located
      east of University of Houston-Victoria, TX.

      to determine the relative geographical positions of these two universities:


      1. Henderson State University in Arkansas (AR)

      Let me think about the general geographical layout of these states:

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central region of the United States

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Arkansas is east of New Mexico

      - New Mexico borders Arizona to the west, Texas to the east, Colorado to the
      north, and Mexico to the south

      - Arkansas borders Louisiana to the south, Texas to the southwest, Oklahoma
      to the west, Missouri to the north, Tennessee to the east, and Mississippi to
      the southeast

      would be east of Eastern New Mexico University.</think>To determine if Henderson
      State University in Arkansas is located east of Eastern New Mexico University

      - Henderson State University is in Arkansas (AR)

      - Eastern New Mexico University is in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states on the US map.

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Arkansas is significantly east of New Mexico on the US map

      - New Mexico borders Arizona to the west and Texas to the east

      - Arkansas borders Texas to the southwest and Mississippi to the east


      Step 4: Make the determination based on state locations.

      Since Henderson State University is in Arkansas, and Arkansas is geographically
      east of New Mexico (where Eastern New Mexico University is located), Henderson
      State University must be east of Eastern New Mexico University.

      University in Arkansas (AR) is located east of Eastern New Mexico University
      in New Mexico (NM), I need to think about the relative geographical positions
      of these two states and universities.


      First, let''s consider the states:

      - Arkansas (AR) is located in the south-central region of the United States

      - New Mexico (NM) is located in the southwestern United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Arkansas is significantly east of New Mexico

      - Arkansas is closer to the East Coast, while New Mexico is closer to the West
      Coast


      Since the universities are in these respective states:

      - Henderson State University is in Arkansas

      - Eastern New Mexico University is in New Mexico


      Therefore, Henderson State University (in Arkansas) would be located east of
      Eastern New Mexico University (in New Mexico), despite the "Eastern" in the
      second university''s name (which just refers to the eastern part of New Mexico,
      but New Mexico as a whole is still west of Arkansas).</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two universities by examining their
      locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Henderson State University is in Arkansas (AR)

      - Eastern New Mexico University is in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Arkansas is significantly east of New Mexico on the map

      - Arkansas is closer to the East Coast, while New Mexico is closer to the West
      Coast


      Step 4: Note that while "Eastern" is in the name of the New Mexico university,
      this only indicates it''s in the eastern portion of New Mexico state, not that
      it''s in the eastern US.


      YES - Henderson State University in Arkansas is located east of Eastern New
      Mexico University in New Mexico.'

      University, AR is located east of Eastern New Mexico University, NM, I need
      to identify their locations and compare their east-west positioning.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Henderson State University is in Arkansas (AR).

      - Eastern New Mexico University is in New Mexico (NM).


      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of these states.

      New Mexico is in the southwestern United States, bordering Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma,
      Colorado, and Arizona.

      Arkansas is in the southeastern United States, east of Oklahoma and north of
      Louisiana.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      When looking at a US map, New Mexico is significantly west of Arkansas. Since
      Arkansas is east of New Mexico, and Henderson State University is in Arkansas
      while Eastern New Mexico University is in New Mexico, Henderson State University
      must be east of Eastern New Mexico University.


      Another way to think about it: New Mexico is closer to the Pacific Ocean, while
      Arkansas is closer to the Atlantic Ocean, indicating that Arkansas is east of
      New Mexico.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Determine the locations of both universities.

      - Henderson State University is in Arkansas (AR)

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States

      - Arkansas is located in the southeastern/south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - On a U.S. map, New Mexico lies significantly west of Arkansas

      - Arkansas is east of Oklahoma, which itself is east of New Mexico

      - All of New Mexico (including its eastern portion) is west of all of Arkansas


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on the states'' positions.

      Since Henderson State University is in Arkansas, and Eastern New Mexico University
      is in New Mexico, and Arkansas is entirely east of New Mexico, Henderson State
      University must be east of Eastern New Mexico University.

      States. States on the east coast (like Massachusetts) are east of midwestern
      states (like Indiana).


      To be more specific:

      - Massachusetts is on the Atlantic coast in the Northeast

      - Indiana is in the Midwest, not on any coast, and is west of Massachusetts


      So Westfield State University in Massachusetts would be east of Indiana University-Purdue
      University Fort Wayne in Indiana.</think>I need to determine the relative locations

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Massachusetts is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United
      States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east axis.

      - Massachusetts is significantly east of Indiana on the map

      - All of Massachusetts is east of all of Indiana


      Step 4: Since Westfield State University is in Massachusetts, and Indiana University-Purdue
      University Fort Wayne is in Indiana, the former must be east of the latter.

      on the US map.


      North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States, while Arkansas is
      an inland state in the south-central part of the country.


      North Carolina is significantly east of Arkansas on the US map. Arkansas borders
      states like Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Tennessee, and Mississippi.
      North Carolina is much further east, bordering states like South Carolina, Georgia,
      Tennessee, and Virginia, and has a coastline on the Atlantic Ocean.


      Since St. Andrews University is in North Carolina and the University of Central
      Arkansas is in Arkansas, and North Carolina is east of Arkansas, St. Andrews
      University would be east of the University of Central Arkansas.</think># Is
      St. Andrews University, NC located east of University of Central Arkansas, AR?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities
      by examining where their states are located.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' locations.

      - North Carolina (NC) is on the east coast of the United States.

      - Arkansas (AR) is in the south-central part of the United States, inland.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - North Carolina is significantly east of Arkansas on the US map.

      - Arkansas is positioned in the middle of the country, while North Carolina
      borders the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 3: Since St. Andrews University is in North Carolina and the University
      of Central Arkansas is in Arkansas, their relative positions follow their states''
      positions.


      YES, St. Andrews University in North Carolina is located east of the University
      of Central Arkansas in Arkansas.'

      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - Illinois is located east of Iowa

      - The Mississippi River forms much of the border between these states, with
      Iowa on the west side and Illinois on the east side


      Step 3: Verify the specific cities.

      - Aurora is in northeastern Illinois

      - Des Moines is in central Iowa


      Since Illinois is east of Iowa, and the specific locations of these universities

      4. Kansas is in the central part of the United States, while Indiana is further
      east in the Midwest.


      5. Kansas borders Colorado to its west and Missouri to its east. Indiana borders
      Illinois to its west and Ohio to its east.


      6. Since Indiana is entirely east of Kansas (there are several states between
      them), any location in Indiana would be east of any location in Kansas.


      Therefore, Indiana University Southeast, being in Indiana, is located east of
      Wichita State University, which is in Kansas.</think># Is Indiana University
      Southeast, IN located east of Wichita State University, KS?


      Let me think through this geographically:


      1. Indiana University Southeast is located in New Albany, Indiana (IN).

      2. Wichita State University is located in Wichita, Kansas (KS).

      3. Looking at the US map, Indiana is in the Midwest/Eastern part of the country.

      4. Kansas is in the Central part of the country.

      5. Indiana is positioned significantly east of Kansas - there are several states
      between them (Missouri and Illinois).

      6. Any location in Indiana would be east of any location in Kansas, regardless
      of their specific positions within those states.

      - Georgia Southern University is in Statesboro, Georgia

      - Alcorn State University is in Lorman, Mississippi


      Now, I need to think about the geographic relationship between Georgia and Mississippi.
      In the United States:

      - Georgia is on the east coast, bordering the Atlantic Ocean

      - Mississippi is further west, bordering the Mississippi River

      - Georgia is clearly east of Mississippi in terms of US geography


      Since Georgia Southern University is in Georgia, and Alcorn State University

      - Georgia is an eastern state that borders the Atlantic Ocean

      - Mississippi is further west, located along the Mississippi River

      - On a US map, Georgia is positioned clearly east of Mississippi


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the universities.

      - Since Georgia Southern is in Georgia, and Alcorn State is in Mississippi

      - And Georgia is east of Mississippi

      - Therefore, Georgia Southern University must be east of Alcorn State University

      The United States is organized such that states on the East Coast are considered
      eastern, while states closer to the Pacific Ocean are western. Looking at a
      mental map of the US:


      - Alabama is in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is in the south-central United States, west of Alabama


      Since Alabama is east of Texas on the map of the United States, and these universities
      are in their respective states, the University of West Alabama (in Alabama)
      would be east of the University of Texas at Arlington (in Texas).


      Despite the "West" in the name "University of West Alabama", this refers to
      the western part of Alabama, but Alabama as a whole is still east of Texas.</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities
      by looking at their states'' locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - University of West Alabama is in Alabama (AL)

      - University of Texas at Arlington is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - On a US map, Alabama is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Alabama is positioned to the east of Texas


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within each state.

      - Even though "West Alabama" is in the name, this refers to the western part
      of Alabama

      - Even the western part of Alabama is still east of Texas


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on geographic positions.

      - Since Alabama is entirely east of Texas, any location in Alabama (including
      the University of West Alabama) would be east of any location in Texas (including
      the University of Texas at Arlington)

      First, I need to identify the states where these institutions are located:

      - Florida State University is in Florida (FL)

      - Texas A&M is in Texas (TX)


      Now I need to determine their relative east-west positions. In the US, Florida
      is located east of Texas. You can think of the continental US map:

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the US

      - Florida is in the southeastern part of the US, forming a peninsula that extends
      into the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico


      Since Florida is east of Texas on the US map, any location in Florida would
      be east of any location in Texas. Therefore, Florida State University (in Florida)
      is east of Texas A&M (in Texas).</think>I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Florida State University School of Library & Information Studies is located
      in Tallahassee, Florida (FL).

      - Texas A&M College of Geosciences is located in College Station, Texas (TX).


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of Florida and Texas.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - On a U.S. map, Florida is positioned to the east of Texas.

      - All of Florida is geographically east of all of Texas.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on these facts.

      - Since the institutions are in their respective states, and Florida is east
      of Texas, Florida State University must be east of Texas A&M.

      to determine the relative locations of Oklahoma Panhandle State University (OPSU)
      in Oklahoma and Adams State University (ASU) in Colorado.


      First, let me recall the general locations:

      - Oklahoma is generally east of Colorado in the United States

      - The Oklahoma panhandle is the narrow western extension of Oklahoma that borders
      Colorado


      Now, let me think about the specific locations:

      - Oklahoma Panhandle State University is likely in the Oklahoma panhandle (based
      on its name)

      - Adams State University is in Colorado


      The question is asking whether OPSU is east of ASU.


      Since Oklahoma is east of Colorado, and OPSU is in Oklahoma, while ASU is in
      Colorado, OPSU should be east of ASU. However, I need to be careful because
      OPSU is specifically in the Oklahoma panhandle, which is the westernmost part
      of Oklahoma that juts out and borders Colorado.


      Let me think about the precise locations if I can recall them:

      - Adams State University is in Alamosa, Colorado, which is in south-central
      Colorado

      - Oklahoma Panhandle State University is in Goodwell, Oklahoma, which is in
      the Oklahoma panhandle


      Given that even the westernmost part of Oklahoma (the panhandle) is still east
      of Colorado (except for their border), OPSU should still be east of ASU.</think>#
      Is Oklahoma Panhandle State University, OK located east of Adams State University,
      CO?


      Let me think about this step by step:


      1) Oklahoma Panhandle State University is located in Goodwell, Oklahoma, in
      the Oklahoma panhandle region.


      2) Adams State University is located in Alamosa, Colorado, in south-central
      Colorado.


      3) Geographically, Colorado is directly west of Oklahoma. The Oklahoma panhandle
      extends westward along the southern border of Colorado.


      4) Even though Oklahoma Panhandle State University is in the westernmost part
      of Oklahoma, all of Oklahoma (including its panhandle) is still east of Colorado.


      5) Since Adams State University is within Colorado, and Oklahoma Panhandle State
      University is within Oklahoma, the Oklahoma university must be east of the Colorado
      university.


      NO


      Wait, I need to verify this more carefully. Looking at the specific locations:

      - Adams State University is in Alamosa, CO, in the south-central part of Colorado

      - Oklahoma Panhandle State University is in Goodwell, OK, in the western Oklahoma
      panhandle


      When comparing these specific locations on a map, Oklahoma Panhandle State University
      is indeed east of Adams State University.

      2. Specifically, I need to determine if Oklahoma Panhandle State University
      is located east of Adams State University.


      3. I need to consider the general geography of the United States. The states
      of Oklahoma and Colorado are in the central part of the US.


      4. Oklahoma is generally east of Colorado. Colorado borders Oklahoma to the
      west (or Oklahoma borders Colorado to the east).


      5. The Oklahoma Panhandle is a narrow strip of land at the western end of Oklahoma
      that extends westward. It''s the westernmost part of Oklahoma.


      6. Adams State University is in Colorado, but I need to consider its specific
      location within Colorado.


      7. Adams State University is in Alamosa, Colorado, which is in the southern
      part of Colorado, in the San Luis Valley.


      8. The Oklahoma Panhandle, being the westernmost part of Oklahoma, is still
      east of most of Colorado, including Alamosa where Adams State University is
      located.


      Based on US geography, Oklahoma (even its westernmost part, the Panhandle) is
      east of Colorado, so Oklahoma Panhandle State University would be east of Adams

      is in Oklahoma (OK), and Adams State University is in Colorado (CO).


      2) Looking at US geography, Colorado is located directly west of Oklahoma on
      a map.


      3) The Oklahoma Panhandle is a narrow strip of land extending from the western
      part of Oklahoma, but even this westernmost part of Oklahoma is still east of
      Colorado.


      4) Adams State University is located in Alamosa, Colorado, which is in the southern
      part of Colorado.


      5) Since any location in Oklahoma (including the Panhandle) is east of locations
      in Colorado, Oklahoma Panhandle State University must be east of Adams State
      University.


      YES, Oklahoma Panhandle State University is located east of Adams State University.'

      1. Delaware County Community College is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is on the
      eastern side of the United States.


      2. Anderson University is in Indiana (IN), which is in the Midwest region of
      the United States.

      County Community College must be east of Anderson University.


      Let me verify this by thinking about the general geography of the US: Going

      - Anderson University is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is located on the eastern side of the United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning.

      - Pennsylvania is entirely east of Indiana on the map of the United States

      - Moving from west to east across the US, you would encounter Indiana before
      reaching Pennsylvania


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion.

      Since Delaware County Community College is in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania
      is east of Indiana (where Anderson University is located), Delaware County Community
      College must be east of Anderson University.

      Colorado.


      To solve this, I need to think about the relative positions of Nebraska (NE)
      and Colorado (CO) in the United States.


      The United States is generally laid out with the East Coast on the right side
      of the map and the West Coast on the left side. As you move from east to west,
      you go from right to left on a standard US map.


      Nebraska (NE) is a state in the Midwest region of the United States.

      Colorado (CO) is a state in the Mountain West region of the United States.


      Geographically, Nebraska is located to the east of Colorado. The entire state
      of Nebraska is east of the entire state of Colorado.


      Since Concordia University is in Nebraska and Naropa University is in Colorado,
      and Nebraska is east of Colorado, then Concordia University must be east of
      Naropa University.</think>To determine if Concordia University in Nebraska is
      located east of Naropa University in Colorado, I need to consider the geographic
      positions of these two states.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Concordia University is in Nebraska (NE)

      - Naropa University is in Colorado (CO)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of Nebraska and Colorado.

      - In the United States, states are arranged with the East Coast on the right
      side of the map and the West Coast on the left.

      - Nebraska is in the Midwest region of the United States.

      - Colorado is in the Mountain West region, which is further west than the Midwest.

      - Nebraska borders Colorado directly to the east.


      Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the universities.

      - Since Nebraska is entirely east of Colorado, any location in Nebraska (including
      Concordia University) would be east of any location in Colorado (including Naropa
      University).

      Let me think about the general geography of these states:

      - Nebraska (NE) is located in the central United States

      - Colorado (CO) is located in the western/mountain region of the United States


      Generally, Nebraska is east of Colorado. Looking at a map of the US, Colorado
      borders Nebraska on Nebraska''s western border. This means that any location
      in Nebraska would typically be east of any location in Colorado.


      Therefore, Concordia University in Nebraska would be east of Naropa University

      Colorado is located directly west of Nebraska. The entire state of Nebraska
      is east of the entire state of Colorado.


      Step 3: Consider the university locations within their states.

      Since Nebraska as a whole is east of Colorado, any location in Nebraska (including

      Even considering the specific locations of these universities (Concordia University
      is in Seward, Nebraska, and Naropa University is in Boulder, Colorado), the
      east-west relationship remains the same. Any location in Nebraska would be east

      Pennsylvania is on the eastern side of the US, roughly in the mid-Atlantic region.

      Kentucky is more in the interior of the country, in the eastern part but west
      of Pennsylvania.


      Specifically:

      - Pennsylvania is bordered by Ohio to its west

      - Kentucky is south of Ohio


      This means Pennsylvania is east of Kentucky. Therefore, Thomas Jefferson University

      2) Gateway Community and Technical College is in Kentucky (KY)

      3) Looking at the US map, Pennsylvania is in the eastern part of the country,
      while Kentucky is more interior and to the west

      4) Pennsylvania borders the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side, while Kentucky
      is several states away from the Atlantic

      5) If we look at the states between them, Ohio sits between Pennsylvania and
      Kentucky

      6) Therefore, Pennsylvania is east of Kentucky on the map


      Since Thomas Jefferson University is in Pennsylvania and Gateway Community and
      Technical College is in Kentucky, Thomas Jefferson University is located east
      of Gateway Community and Technical College.

      Louisiana (LA) is located in the southern United States, bordering the Gulf
      of Mexico.


      Geographically, Georgia is east of Louisiana. In fact, if we look at the states
      from west to east along the southern United States, the order would roughly
      be: Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida.

      State University, GA located east of University of Louisiana at Monroe, LA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities
      by examining their states'' locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Clayton State University is in Georgia (GA)

      - University of Louisiana at Monroe is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Looking at a map of the United States, Georgia is located in the southeastern
      part of the country

      - Louisiana is also in the south, but is positioned to the west of Georgia

      - Moving west to east along the Gulf Coast states, the order is: Texas, Louisiana,
      Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida


      Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the universities.

      - Since Georgia is east of Louisiana, a university in Georgia would be east
      of a university in Louisiana


      Therefore, Clayton State University (GA) is indeed located east of University
      of Louisiana at Monroe (LA).

      Let me first think about the states:

      - Hampton University is in Virginia (VA), which is on the east coast of the
      United States

      - Arkansas State University Paragould is in Arkansas (AR), which is in the south-central
      part of the United States


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Virginia is significantly east of Arkansas.
      Virginia borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east, while Arkansas is several states
      away from the east coast (it''s west of states like Tennessee, Kentucky, etc.).


      So just based on the states alone, Hampton University in VA would be east of
      Arkansas State University in AR.


      To be more specific about the cities:

      - Hampton is a city in southeastern Virginia, near the coast

      - Paragould is a city in northeastern Arkansas


      This further confirms that Hampton University is east of Arkansas State University
      Paragould.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these
      two universities by looking at their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states. Hampton University is in Virginia (VA), while Arkansas
      State University Paragould is in Arkansas (AR).


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states. Virginia is located
      on the east coast of the United States, while Arkansas is in the south-central
      region of the country.


      Step 3: On a west-to-east directional axis across the United States, Arkansas
      is substantially west of Virginia. Several states (like Tennessee, Kentucky,
      etc.) lie between them.


      Step 4: More specifically, Hampton is in southeastern Virginia near the Atlantic
      coast, while Paragould is in northeastern Arkansas, which is still far west
      of any point in Virginia.


      YES, Hampton University in VA is located east of Arkansas State University Paragould

      by step:


      1) Hampton University is in Hampton, Virginia (VA).

      2) Arkansas State University Paragould is in Paragould, Arkansas (AR).


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to understand their relative
      positions on the US map.


      The US states from west to east generally follow this pattern:

      - West Coast (CA, OR, WA)

      - Mountain states

      - Central/Great Plains states

      - Midwest

      - Southern states

      - Eastern seaboard


      Virginia is on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      Arkansas is in the southern central part of the United States.


      Geographically, Virginia is significantly east of Arkansas. Any location in
      Virginia would be east of any location in Arkansas.


      Therefore, Hampton University in Virginia would be east of Arkansas State University
      in Paragould, Arkansas.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of
      these two universities by examining their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Hampton University is in Hampton, Virginia (VA)

      - Arkansas State University Paragould is in Paragould, Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Virginia is significantly further east than Arkansas on the U.S. map. The entire
      state of Virginia is east of Arkansas.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the specific universities.

      Since Hampton University is in Virginia and Arkansas State University Paragould
      is in Arkansas, Hampton University must be east of Arkansas State University
      Paragould.

      east coast of the United States.


      2. Arkansas State University Paragould is located in Paragould, Arkansas (AR),
      which is in the south-central part of the United States.


      Geographically, the United States has the Atlantic Ocean on its east coast and
      the Pacific Ocean on its west coast. Virginia is an east coast state, while
      Arkansas is more inland and west of Virginia.


      In terms of longitude, states on the east coast (like Virginia) have a higher
      east longitude than states that are more inland and to the west (like Arkansas).

      - States along the Atlantic coast (like Virginia) are generally east of inland
      states.

      - Arkansas is considerably west of Virginia on a map of the United States.


      Step 3: Consider specific cities.

      - Hampton is in eastern Virginia, near the Chesapeake Bay.

      - Paragould is in northeastern Arkansas.


      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison.

      - Even the westernmost point of Virginia is still east of the easternmost point

      Valley State University.


      First, let me think about their states:

      - South Carolina (SC) is on the east coast of the United States

      - Mississippi (MS) is in the southeastern United States, but west of South Carolina


      In general, South Carolina is east of Mississippi. But I should be more precise
      about the specific universities.


      Columbia International University is in Columbia, SC, which is in the central
      part of South Carolina.

      Mississippi Valley State University is likely in the Mississippi Valley region

      First, let me consider the states:

      - Kansas (KS) is located directly east of Colorado (CO)

      - Colorado is located directly west of Kansas


      Next, let''s consider the specific locations:

      - Ottawa University is in Ottawa, Kansas, which is in the eastern part of Kansas

      - Colorado State University Pueblo is in Pueblo, Colorado, which is in the southern
      part of Colorado

      To determine if Ottawa University is east of Colorado State University Pueblo,
      I need to know the relative positions of Kansas and Colorado, and then the specific
      locations of these universities within their states.


      First, Kansas is east of Colorado. Kansas and Colorado share a border, with
      Kansas being directly east of Colorado.


      Now, let''s think about the specific locations:

      - Ottawa, Kansas would be somewhere within Kansas

      - Pueblo, Colorado would be somewhere within Colorado


      Since Kansas is entirely east of Colorado, any location in Kansas (including
      Ottawa University) would be east of any location in Colorado (including Colorado
      State University Pueblo).


      Therefore, Ottawa University in Kansas is east of Colorado State University
      Pueblo in Colorado.</think>To determine if Ottawa University in Kansas is located
      east of Colorado State University Pueblo in Colorado, I need to consider the

      Colorado to the west and Kansas to the east.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      Ottawa University is in Ottawa, Kansas, which is in the eastern part of Kansas.

      Colorado State University Pueblo is in Pueblo, Colorado, which is in the southern
      part of Colorado.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      Since the entire state of Kansas is east of the entire state of Colorado, any
      location in Kansas (including Ottawa) would be east of any location in Colorado
      (including Pueblo).


      YES, Ottawa University in Kansas is located east of Colorado State University

      Keuka College is in NY, likely in the western part of New York (based on the
      name Keuka, which sounds like it might be near the Finger Lakes region).


      Purdue University Calumet would be in the Calumet region of Indiana, which is
      in the northwestern part of the state, near Chicago.


      Even if Keuka College is in western NY, and Purdue Calumet is in eastern IN,
      New York is still significantly east of Indiana, so Keuka College would be east
      of Purdue University Calumet.</think># Analysis of College Locations


      To determine if Keuka College (NY) is east of Purdue University Calumet (IN),
      I need to consider the geographic positions of these institutions.


      ## Step 1: State Locations

      - New York state is located in the northeastern United States

      - Indiana is located in the midwestern United States

      - Generally, New York is east of Indiana on a map


      ## Step 2: Specific College Locations

      - Keuka College is located in the Finger Lakes region of western New York

      - Purdue University Calumet (now called Purdue University Northwest) is located
      in Hammond, Indiana, in the northwestern part of the state


      ## Step 3: Relative Positioning

      Even though Keuka College is in western New York, and Purdue Calumet is in the
      eastern part of Indiana, the entire state of New York is still east of Indiana.
      The easternmost point of Indiana is still west of the westernmost point of New
      York.

      Minnesota and South Dakota are neighboring states in the Midwest United States.
      Minnesota is located to the east of South Dakota. So generally speaking, locations

      Rochester is a city in southeastern Minnesota. South Dakota Public Universities
      and Research Center would be somewhere in South Dakota, which is entirely west

      Based on the states'' positions:

      - South Dakota is west of Minnesota

      - University Center Rochester is in Minnesota

      - South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center is in South Dakota

      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      Rochester is located in southeastern Minnesota. Regardless of where in South
      Dakota the South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center is located,
      it must be west of Rochester because the entire state of South Dakota is west

      Specifically, I need to determine if the first is east of the second.


      First, let''s establish the relative positions of Minnesota and South Dakota.
      Minnesota is directly east of South Dakota - Minnesota shares its western border
      with South Dakota''s eastern border.


      Rochester, MN is located in the southeastern part of Minnesota, not far from
      the Wisconsin border.


      The question mentions "South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center"

      Since South Dakota is west of Minnesota, and Rochester is in southeastern Minnesota,
      it''s very likely that University Center Rochester is east of any location in
      South Dakota, including the South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center.


      So University Center Rochester, MN is almost certainly east of South Dakota
      Public Universities and Research Center, SD.</think>I need to determine the

      Dakota (SD).


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states. Minnesota
      is located directly east of South Dakota - they share a border with South Dakota
      on the west and Minnesota on the east.


      Step 3: Rochester, MN is located in the southeastern part of Minnesota, which
      puts it even further east within the state.


      Step 4: Any location in South Dakota would be west of Rochester, Minnesota,
      because the entire state of South Dakota is west of Minnesota.


      Therefore, University Center Rochester, MN is indeed located east of South Dakota
      Public Universities and Research Center, SD.

      VA is located east of Owensboro Community and Technical College, KY, I need
      to identify the locations of both institutions and compare their positions on
      an east-west axis.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Regent University, VA.

      Regent University is located in Virginia Beach, Virginia, which is on the eastern
      coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Owensboro Community and Technical College,
      KY.

      Owensboro Community and Technical College is located in Owensboro, Kentucky,
      which is in the western part of Kentucky, near the Indiana border.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Virginia is located on the eastern coast of the United States, while Kentucky
      is an inland state to the west of Virginia. Since Virginia is east of Kentucky,
      and Regent University is in Virginia while Owensboro Community and Technical
      College is in Kentucky, Regent University would be east of Owensboro Community
      and Technical College.


      To be more precise, Virginia Beach (where Regent University is located) is near
      the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast, while Owensboro (where the community college
      is located) is in western Kentucky, making the east-west difference even more
      pronounced.</think>I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: Determine the location of Regent University, VA.

      Regent University is located in Virginia Beach, Virginia, which is on the eastern
      coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Determine the location of Owensboro Community and Technical College,
      KY.

      Owensboro Community and Technical College is located in Owensboro, Kentucky,
      which is in the western part of Kentucky.


      Step 3: Compare their geographic positions.

      Virginia is an east coast state, while Kentucky is located inland to the west
      of Virginia. Specifically, Virginia Beach is on the Atlantic Ocean, making it
      very far east, while Owensboro is in western Kentucky near the Indiana border.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Virginia (especially Virginia Beach) is significantly east of Kentucky
      (especially western Kentucky), Regent University is east of Owensboro Community
      and Technical College.

      First, let me identify the locations:

      1. Fort Valley State University is in Fort Valley, Georgia (GA)

      2. The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More is in Texas (TX)


      Now, I need to determine if Georgia is east of Texas. Looking at a map of the

      - Georgia is on the southeastern coast of the US

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the US


      Georgia is definitely east of Texas on the US map. Georgia borders the Atlantic
      Ocean on the east, while Texas is much further west, bordering the Gulf of Mexico
      and Mexico.


      Since Fort Valley State University is in Georgia, and The College of Saints

      - Georgia is located on the southeastern coast of the United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - On a map of the US, Georgia is positioned considerably east of Texas


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      Since Fort Valley State University is in Georgia, and Georgia is east of Texas

      State University must be east of The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas

      To solve this, I need to know the approximate locations of these universities:


      1. Utah State University Eastern is in Utah (UT). Utah is east of California.

      2. William Jessup University is in California (CA).


      Let me be more specific about their locations:


      Utah State University Eastern is likely in eastern Utah, given its name.

      William Jessup University is in California, but I should check where exactly
      in California.


      William Jessup University is located in Rocklin, California, which is in the
      northern part of California, near Sacramento.


      Utah State University Eastern (formerly the College of Eastern Utah) has its
      main campus in Price, Utah, which is indeed in the eastern part of Utah.


      Geographically, Utah is directly east of California. Since Utah State University

      Eastern would be east of William Jessup University.</think>To determine if Utah
      State University Eastern (in Utah) is east of William Jessup University (in
      California), I need to consider their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      California is located on the west coast of the United States, while Utah is
      located inland, to the east of California.


      Step 2: Locate the specific universities.

      Utah State University Eastern is located in Price, Utah, in the eastern part
      of the state.

      William Jessup University is located in Rocklin, California, in the northern
      part of California.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes.

      Since Utah as a whole state is east of California, and Utah State University
      Eastern is in Utah while William Jessup University is in California, Utah State
      University Eastern must be east of William Jessup University.

      First, I need to locate these universities geographically:


      1. Utah State University Eastern (USU Eastern) is located in Price, Utah.

      2. William Jessup University is located in Rocklin, California.


      Now I need to compare their east-west positions. In the United States, locations
      in Utah are generally east of locations in California, since California is on
      the west coast while Utah is more inland.


      To be more precise:

      - California is on the western edge of the continental United States

      - Utah is to the east of California


      So geographically, a university in Utah (like USU Eastern) would be east of
      a university in California (like William Jessup University).


      Therefore, Utah State University Eastern, UT is located east of William Jessup
      University, CA.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Utah State University Eastern is located in Price, Utah

      - William Jessup University is located in Rocklin, California


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Utah and California.

      - California is positioned on the western coast of the United States

      - Utah is an inland state that lies to the east of California


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east axis.

      - All of Utah is geographically east of California

      - Therefore, any location in Utah would be east of any location in California


      YES, Utah State University Eastern, UT is located east of William Jessup University,
      CA.'

      Eastern in Utah

      2. Determine the location (specifically longitude) of William Jessup University
      in California

      3. Compare the longitudes - if Utah State''s longitude is smaller (more negative)

      longitude is larger (less negative) than William Jessup''s, then Utah State
      is EAST of William Jessup.


      Let me think about this geographically:

      - Utah is generally east of California (California is on the west coast, while
      Utah is inland)

      - Within these states, I need to consider the specific locations


      Utah State University Eastern is likely in eastern Utah, while William Jessup

      - Utah State University Eastern is in Utah (UT)

      - William Jessup University is in California (CA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Utah is located inland, to the east of California


      ## Step 3: Consider specific locations within these states

      - Utah State University Eastern is likely in the eastern part of Utah (as its

      2. Cornerstone University is located in Michigan (MI).


      To determine which is east of the other, I need to compare their relative positions
      on a map of the United States.


      3. Massachusetts is on the east coast of the United States.

      4. Michigan is in the Midwest region of the United States, specifically in the
      Great Lakes region.

      5. Geographically, Massachusetts is east of Michigan.


      Since Bentley University is in Massachusetts and Cornerstone University is in
      Michigan, and Massachusetts is east of Michigan, then Bentley University must
      be east of Cornerstone University.</think>To determine if Bentley University,
      MA is located east of Cornerstone University, MI, I need to consider the geographic
      locations of Massachusetts and Michigan.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Cornerstone University is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states within the United
      States.

      - Massachusetts is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest region, specifically in the Great Lakes
      region


      Step 3: Compare their positions on the map.

      - Massachusetts is significantly further east than Michigan

      - All of Massachusetts is east of all of Michigan on a map of the United States


      Therefore, Bentley University in Massachusetts is definitely located east of
      Cornerstone University in Michigan.

      To solve this, I need to think about the geographic locations of these two states
      and universities:


      1. Walsh University is in Ohio (OH)

      2. National Louis University is in Illinois (IL)


      In the United States, Illinois is west of Ohio. Illinois is in the Midwest region,
      bordering the Mississippi River on its western edge, while Ohio is further east,
      bordering Pennsylvania and eventually the Atlantic coast states.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Illinois is approximately in the middle of the country

      - Ohio is to the east of Illinois


      Since Walsh University is in Ohio, and Ohio is east of Illinois, and National
      Louis University is in Illinois, then Walsh University would be east of National
      Louis University.</think>To determine if Walsh University, OH is located east
      of National Louis University, IL, I need to compare the geographic locations
      of these two universities based on their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Walsh University is in Ohio (OH)

      - National Louis University is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Ohio is also in the Midwest, but is positioned to the east of Illinois

      - On a map of the United States, Illinois is west of Ohio


      Step 3: Since the universities are in these respective states, their relative
      positions would generally follow the same pattern.

      - Walsh University (being in Ohio) would be east of National Louis University
      (being in Illinois)


      YES, Walsh University in Ohio is located east of National Louis University in
      Illinois.'

      Ohio is generally east of Illinois. Illinois borders Lake Michigan on the east
      and extends westward, while Ohio is further east, bordering Pennsylvania.


      Let me be more specific:

      - Walsh University is in North Canton, Ohio

      - National Louis University is in Chicago, Illinois


      Chicago is in the northeastern part of Illinois, but North Canton, Ohio is still
      significantly east of Chicago.

      - National Louis University is in Illinois (IL)

      - Ohio is located east of Illinois on the US map


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - Walsh University is in North Canton, Ohio

      - National Louis University is in Chicago, Illinois

      - Even though Chicago is in northeastern Illinois, any location in Ohio will
      still be considerably east of Chicago


      Step 3: Compare the geographic positions.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest, bordering Lake Michigan

      - Ohio is further east, approaching the East Coast region


      Based on these geographic facts, Walsh University in Ohio is indeed located
      east of National Louis University in Illinois.

      - Troy, Alabama is located in the southeastern part of Alabama.

      - Tyler, Texas is located in the eastern part of Texas.


      Even though Tyler is in eastern Texas, Texas is still west of Alabama. The entire
      state of Alabama is east of Texas. There are several states between eastern
      Texas and Alabama (potentially including Louisiana and Mississippi).


      Therefore, Troy University in Alabama would be east of the University of Texas

      Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      - Alabama is entirely east of Texas on the US map.

      - Texas is west of Alabama, with Louisiana and Mississippi in between.


      Step 3: Even though Tyler is in eastern Texas, it''s still in Texas, which is
      west of Alabama where Troy is located.


      Step 4: Therefore, Troy University (Alabama) must be east of the University

      First, let me recall the locations:

      - Kean University is in New Jersey (NJ), which is on the East Coast of the United
      States

      - Ball State University is in Indiana (IN), which is in the Midwest


      Looking at a mental map of the United States:

      - New Jersey is one of the easternmost states, located on the Atlantic Ocean

      - Indiana is in the Midwest, considerably west of New Jersey


      Since the United States has states arranged roughly from west (Pacific Ocean)
      to east (Atlantic Ocean), and New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast while Indiana
      is in the Midwest, it''s clear that New Jersey is east of Indiana.


      Therefore, Kean University in NJ would be east of Ball State University in IN.</think>To
      determine if Kean University (NJ) is located east of Ball State University (IN),
      I''ll analyze their geographic locations:


      Step 1: Identify the states'' positions.

      - New Jersey (NJ) is located on the East Coast of the United States, bordering
      the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Indiana (IN) is located in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions.

      - Looking at a map of the United States, New Jersey is significantly east of
      Indiana.

      - The entire state of New Jersey is east of Indiana.


      Step 3: Since Kean University is in New Jersey and Ball State University is
      in Indiana, their relative positions follow the same relationship as their states.


      YES, Kean University (NJ) is located east of Ball State University (IN).'

      Fort Wayne (in Indiana) is east of Graceland University (in Iowa), I need to
      compare their geographic locations.


      First, let''s identify the states:

      - Purdue University Fort Wayne is in Indiana (IN)

      - Graceland University is in Iowa (IA)


      Generally in the US:

      - Indiana is in the Midwest, but on the eastern side of the Midwest

      - Iowa is also in the Midwest, but more western than Indiana


      Looking at their relative positions:

      - Indiana is east of Iowa on the US map

      - Fort Wayne is in the northeastern part of Indiana

      - Iowa is entirely west of Indiana


      So Fort Wayne, Indiana would be east of anywhere in Iowa, including wherever
      Graceland University is located.


      Therefore, Purdue University Fort Wayne, IN is indeed east of Graceland University,
      IA.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these two
      universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Purdue University Fort Wayne is in Fort Wayne, Indiana (IN)

      - Graceland University is in Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region, but toward the eastern part of the
      Midwest

      - Iowa is also in the Midwest region, but positioned west of Indiana


      Step 3: Check the specific locations within their states.

      - Fort Wayne is in the northeastern part of Indiana

      - Regardless of Graceland''s specific location in Iowa, the entire state of
      Iowa lies west of Indiana


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      Since Indiana is east of Iowa on the map of the United States, and Fort Wayne
      is in Indiana while Graceland is in Iowa, Purdue University Fort Wayne must
      be east of Graceland University.

      2) Then we need to compare their east-west positions to determine if Purdue
      University Fort Wayne is east of Graceland University.


      Purdue University Fort Wayne is in Fort Wayne, Indiana (IN).

      Graceland University is in Iowa (IA).


      Now I need to think about the geographic relationship between Indiana and Iowa.
      In the United States:

      - Indiana is in the Midwest, toward the eastern part of the Midwest region

      - Iowa is also in the Midwest, but it''s more western than Indiana


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Indiana borders Ohio to the east and Illinois to the west

      - Iowa is west of Illinois

      - So Iowa is definitely west of Indiana

      Fort Wayne would be east of Graceland University.</think># Is Purdue University
      Fort Wayne, IN located east of Graceland University, IA?


      Let me think through this geographically:


      1) Purdue University Fort Wayne is located in Fort Wayne, Indiana (IN).

      2) Graceland University is located in Iowa (IA).

      3) Comparing the states: Indiana is in the Midwest/Eastern part of the United
      States, while Iowa is further west in the Midwest.

      4) On a map of the United States, Indiana is significantly east of Iowa. Indiana
      borders Ohio to the east and Illinois to the west, while Iowa is west of Illinois.

      5) Since Fort Wayne is in Indiana, and Graceland University is in Iowa, Fort
      Wayne must be east of Graceland University.

      2. Compare their east-west positions (longitudes)


      Purdue University Fort Wayne is located in Fort Wayne, Indiana (IN).

      Graceland University is located in Lamoni, Iowa (IA).


      Geographically in the US:

      - Indiana is in the Midwest, but east of Iowa

      - Iowa is further west than Indiana


      To be more precise:

      - Fort Wayne, IN is in the northeastern part of Indiana

      - Lamoni, IA (where Graceland''s main campus is) is in southern Iowa


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Indiana is definitely east of Iowa. Since

      To answer this, I need to consider the geographical locations:


      1. Purdue University Fort Wayne is in Fort Wayne, Indiana (IN)

      2. Graceland University is in Iowa (IA)


      In the United States, states are generally positioned with:

      - Eastern states being closer to the Atlantic Ocean

      - Western states being closer to the Pacific Ocean


      Indiana is in the Midwest region but is further east than Iowa. Indiana borders
      Ohio to its east and Illinois to its west. Iowa is west of Illinois.


      So generally speaking, Indiana is east of Iowa on a map of the United States.


      More specifically, Fort Wayne is in the northeastern part of Indiana, which
      would still place it east of any location in Iowa.


      So Purdue University Fort Wayne, IN would be east of Graceland University, IA.</think>#

      2) Graceland University is located in Iowa (IA)


      Looking at the map of the United States:

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region, positioned east of Illinois

      - Iowa is also in the Midwest region, but positioned west of Illinois

      - This means Indiana is east of Iowa


      Fort Wayne specifically is in the northeastern part of Indiana, which would
      definitely place it east of any location in Iowa where Graceland University
      is situated.


      YES, Purdue University Fort Wayne, IN is located east of Graceland University,

      US states from west to east in the midwest region:

      - Iowa is in the central midwest

      - Indiana is in the eastern midwest


      On a US map, Indiana is definitely east of Iowa. Iowa borders the Mississippi
      River on its eastern side, while Indiana is further east, bordering Ohio and
      near the Ohio River.


      Fort Wayne is in the northeastern part of Indiana, which would put it even further
      east relative to Iowa.

      - Indiana (IN) is located in the eastern Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east axis.

      - On a US map, Iowa is west of Indiana

      - Indiana is significantly east of Iowa (with Illinois in between them)


      Step 4: Since Fort Wayne is in Indiana and Graceland University is in Iowa,
      Purdue University Fort Wayne must be east of Graceland University.

      First, let''s recall the general geographic positions of the states:

      - Indiana (IN) is in the Midwest, but relatively eastern part of the Midwest

      - Nebraska (NE) is also in the Midwest, but further west than Indiana


      Looking at the US map, Indiana is definitely east of Nebraska. Indiana borders
      Ohio to its east and Illinois to its west, while Nebraska is west of Iowa and
      Missouri.


      Now, more specifically:

      - Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana (likely in the northwestern part
      of Indiana based on its name)

      - University of Nebraska at Kearney is in Nebraska (specifically in Kearney)

      ## Step 3: Consider the specific universities

      Even though Indiana University Northwest is in the northwestern part of Indiana
      (as suggested by its name), the entire state of Indiana lies east of Nebraska.
      The University of Nebraska at Kearney is located in central Nebraska.

      First, let me think about the geographic positions of the states:

      - Indiana (IN) is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, bordering Ohio to the east,
      Illinois to the west, Michigan to the north, and Kentucky to the south.

      - Nebraska (NE) is in the Great Plains region, to the west of Iowa and Missouri,
      and east of Wyoming and Colorado.


      Generally speaking, Indiana is east of Nebraska in the United States.

      - Indiana University Northwest would be in Indiana, likely in the northwestern
      part of the state (based on the "Northwest" in its name)

      - University of Nebraska at Kearney would be in Kearney, Nebraska


      Even though Indiana University Northwest is in the northwestern part of Indiana,
      Indiana as a whole is still significantly east of Nebraska. The entire state
      of Illinois separates Indiana from Nebraska.


      So Indiana University Northwest, despite being in the western part of Indiana,
      would still be east of any location in Nebraska, including Kearney.</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana (IN)

      - University of Nebraska at Kearney is in Nebraska (NE)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region

      - Nebraska is located in the Great Plains region

      - Indiana is significantly east of Nebraska on the U.S. map

      - The entire state of Illinois sits between Indiana and Nebraska


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within each state.

      - Even though Indiana University Northwest is in the northwestern part of Indiana
      (as its name suggests), the entire state of Indiana is still east of Nebraska

      - Kearney is a city in central Nebraska


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      is west of Illinois, which is west of Indiana.


      In terms of the general geographic layout of US states:

      - Nebraska is in the central plains region

      - Indiana is closer to the Great Lakes region


      Looking at their relative positions:

      - Nebraska is to the west of Indiana

      - Therefore, Indiana is to the east of Nebraska


      Since Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana, and University of Nebraska
      at Kearney is in Nebraska, it follows that Indiana University Northwest would
      be east of University of Nebraska at Kearney.</think># Is Indiana University
      Northwest, IN located east of University of Nebraska at Kearney, NE?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two universities.


      First, let''s identify the states:

      - Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana (IN)

      - University of Nebraska at Kearney is in Nebraska (NE)


      Looking at the geographic positions of these states:

      - Nebraska is located in the central Great Plains region of the US

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest, bordering the Great Lakes region

      - On a US map, Indiana is significantly east of Nebraska


      Since Indiana is east of Nebraska, and these universities are located within
      their respective states, Indiana University Northwest must be east of the University
      of Nebraska at Kearney.

      step. We need to determine if Indiana University Northwest (in Indiana) is located
      east of University of Nebraska at Kearney (in Nebraska).


      First, let''s consider the geographic locations of these states:

      - Indiana (IN) is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States

      - Nebraska (NE) is located in the Great Plains region of the United States


      In terms of east-west positioning in the US:

      - Indiana is further east than Nebraska

      - Nebraska is further west than Indiana


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Indiana is definitely east of Nebraska. Indiana
      borders Ohio to its east and Illinois to its west, while Nebraska is several
      states west of Indiana.


      Now, specifically for these universities:

      - Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana (likely in the northwestern part
      of the state)

      - University of Nebraska at Kearney is in Nebraska (specifically in Kearney)


      Even though Indiana University Northwest is in the northwestern part of Indiana,
      Indiana as a whole is still east of Nebraska. So Indiana University Northwest
      would be east of any location in Nebraska, including the University of Nebraska
      at Kearney.</think># Is Indiana University Northwest, IN located east of University
      of Nebraska at Kearney, NE?


      I need to think about the geographic locations of these universities and states.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana (IN)

      - University of Nebraska at Kearney is in Nebraska (NE)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states on the US map.

      - Nebraska is located in the Great Plains region of the central United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region

      - Looking at the US map from west to east, Nebraska is further west while Indiana
      is further east


      Step 3: Verify the specific locations.

      - Even though Indiana University Northwest is in the northwestern part of Indiana
      (as its name suggests), Indiana as a whole state is still positioned east of
      Nebraska

      - The University of Nebraska at Kearney, being in Nebraska, is therefore west
      of any location in Indiana


      Therefore, YES, Indiana University Northwest is located east of the University
      of Nebraska at Kearney.'

      In the United States, the general geographical relationship is:

      - States get more eastern as you move from west to east

      - Nebraska is in the central part of the United States

      - Indiana is in the Midwest, but it''s further east than Nebraska


      So generally speaking, any location in Indiana would be east of any location
      in Nebraska.


      Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana (IN), and University of Nebraska

      Indiana University Northwest would be east of University of Nebraska at Kearney.</think>#
      Is Indiana University Northwest, IN located east of University of Nebraska at
      Kearney, NE?


      Let me think about the geographic locations of these universities:


      1) Indiana University Northwest is located in Indiana (IN), which is a midwestern
      state.

      2) University of Nebraska at Kearney is located in Nebraska (NE), which is also

      3) Looking at the US map, Indiana is located significantly east of Nebraska.

      4) Nebraska borders Colorado to the west and Iowa to the east.

      5) Indiana is much further east, bordering Ohio to the east and Illinois to
      the west.


      Since Indiana as a state is entirely east of Nebraska as a state, any location
      in Indiana (including Indiana University Northwest) would be east of any location
      in Nebraska (including University of Nebraska at Kearney).


      Therefore, YES, Indiana University Northwest is located east of University of

      - Kentucky is an inland state in the eastern-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Maryland is positioned to the east of Kentucky on the US map

      - All locations in Maryland are east of most locations in Kentucky


      Since Stevenson University is in Maryland and Kentucky Christian University

      while Georgia is more inland

      - Wingate, NC would be in the central to eastern part of North Carolina

      - Waleska, GA (where Reinhardt University is) would be in northern Georgia

      to determine the locations of both universities and compare their positions
      on an east-west axis.


      1. Wingate University is in Wingate, North Carolina (NC)

      2. Reinhardt University is in Waleska, Georgia (GA)


      Now I need to determine which is further east. In the US, when comparing locations
      in North Carolina and Georgia:

      - North Carolina is generally east of Georgia, as it''s on the Atlantic coast
      while Georgia is slightly more inland (though Georgia also has some Atlantic
      coastline in its eastern part)

      - However, I need to be more precise about these specific locations


      Without looking at exact coordinates, I know that:

      - North Carolina is generally east of Georgia

      - Wingate is in Union County, NC, which is in the south-central part of North
      Carolina

      - Waleska, GA (home of Reinhardt) is in Cherokee County, in northern Georgia


      Given that North Carolina as a whole is east of Georgia, and these universities
      aren''t in unusual locations that would reverse this general pattern, Wingate
      University is almost certainly east of Reinhardt University.</think>I need to
      determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Wingate University is located in Wingate, North Carolina

      - Reinhardt University is located in Waleska, Georgia


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between NC and GA.

      - North Carolina is positioned to the east of Georgia on the US map

      - Georgia is southwest of North Carolina


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Wingate, NC is in the south-central part of North Carolina

      - Waleska, GA is in the northern part of Georgia


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      Even accounting for their specific locations within their respective states,
      Wingate University in NC would still be east of Reinhardt University in GA,
      as the entirety of North Carolina is generally east of the Georgia state line.

      First, let''s establish the locations:

      - Regis University is in Denver, Colorado

      - BYU (Brigham Young University) Honors Program is in Provo, Utah


      Now, to determine which is more eastward, I need to consider the geography of

      Step 3: Compare the specific locations within their respective states.

      - Denver is in the central part of Colorado

      - Provo is in the central part of Utah

      - When traveling from Provo to Denver, you would move eastward

      To answer this, I need to think about the relative locations of North Carolina
      and Arkansas in the United States:


      1. North Carolina (NC) is located on the east coast of the United States

      2. Arkansas (AR) is located in the south-central part of the United States


      Looking at a mental map of the US, North Carolina is definitely east of Arkansas.
      The entire state of North Carolina is east of Arkansas.


      Since Winston-Salem State University is in North Carolina, and Arkansas State
      University-Mountain Home is in Arkansas, Winston-Salem State University would
      be east of Arkansas State University-Mountain Home.</think>I''ll think about
      this step by step.


      Step 1: Let me consider the states where these universities are located.

      - Winston-Salem State University is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Arkansas State University-Mountain Home is in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Let me think about the geographic positions of these states.

      - North Carolina is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central region of the United States


      Step 3: Comparing the east-west positions of these states.

      - North Carolina is significantly east of Arkansas on the US map

      - All of North Carolina is east of all of Arkansas


      Step 4: Since Winston-Salem State University is in North Carolina and Arkansas
      State University-Mountain Home is in Arkansas, the relative positions of the
      universities follow the relative positions of their states.


      YES, Winston-Salem State University in NC is located east of Arkansas State

      I''ll identify their locations and compare their longitude coordinates.


      First, Winston-Salem State University is located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
      North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States.


      Arkansas State University-Mountain Home is located in Mountain Home, Arkansas.
      Arkansas is in the south-central region of the United States, west of the Mississippi
      River.


      Geographically, North Carolina is east of Arkansas. States from west to east
      in this region would roughly go: Arkansas -> Mississippi -> Alabama -> Georgia
      -> South Carolina -> North Carolina.


      So Winston-Salem State University in North Carolina should be east of Arkansas
      State University-Mountain Home in Arkansas.


      To confirm: Winston-Salem, NC is indeed east of Mountain Home, AR, which means
      Winston-Salem State University is east of Arkansas State University-Mountain

      - Arkansas State University-Mountain Home is in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic locations of these states.

      - North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States

      - Arkansas is in the south-central United States, west of the Mississippi River


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Going from west to east across the United States, Arkansas comes before North
      Carolina

      - There are several states between them (like Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama,
      etc.)


      Step 4: Make the specific comparison between the university locations.

      - Winston-Salem, NC is situated in the central part of North Carolina

      - Mountain Home, AR is in northern Arkansas

      - Even accounting for their specific locations within their states, Winston-Salem
      is still significantly east of Mountain Home

      of these two colleges and then figure out which one is farther east.


      1. Old Dominion University POD, VA

      I''m assuming "POD" is part of the name, and this university is in Virginia
      (VA). Let me determine where in Virginia it is located. Old Dominion University
      is located in Norfolk, Virginia, which is on the eastern coast of Virginia.


      2. Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College, KY

      This college is in Kentucky (KY). Based on the name, it''s likely in the southeastern
      part of Kentucky.


      Now, to determine which one is farther east, I need to consider their geographic
      positions. Virginia is east of Kentucky on the US map. Norfolk, Virginia, where
      Old Dominion University is located, is on the Atlantic coast, which is the eastern
      edge of the United States. Southeast Kentucky, even if it''s in the eastern
      part of Kentucky, would still be west of Virginia, and certainly west of Norfolk
      which is on the coast.


      So Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA would be east of Southeast Kentucky
      Community and Technical College, KY.</think># Determining the Relative Locations
      of the Two Colleges


      I need to identify where these two institutions are located and determine their
      east-west relationship.


      ## Step 1: Locate Old Dominion University

      Old Dominion University is located in Norfolk, Virginia. Norfolk is on the Atlantic
      coast in eastern Virginia, near the Chesapeake Bay.


      ## Step 2: Locate Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College

      Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College is located in Cumberland,
      Kentucky, in the southeastern part of Kentucky as its name suggests.


      ## Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      - Kentucky is west of Virginia on the U.S. map

      - Norfolk, Virginia is on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Southeastern Kentucky, while in the eastern portion of Kentucky, is still
      significantly west of the Atlantic coast


      ## Conclusion

      YES, Old Dominion University in Virginia is located east of Southeast Kentucky
      Community and Technical College in Kentucky.'
    c923a9fe-8dc6-47e3-b735-363311b6ac0c: '<think>I need to compare the locations
      of two institutions:

      1. Old Dominion University POD, VA

      2. Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College, KY


      First, let me identify the general geographic locations:

      - Old Dominion University is in Virginia (VA), likely in Norfolk or the Hampton
      Roads area

      - Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College is in Kentucky (KY), likely
      in the southeastern part of Kentucky


      I need to determine if one is east of the other. On a US map:

      - Virginia is east of Kentucky on the US map

      - Kentucky is west of Virginia


      More specifically:

      - Norfolk, VA (where the main ODU campus is) is on the Atlantic coast in eastern
      Virginia

      - Southeast Kentucky would be in the Appalachian region of Kentucky, which is
      in the eastern part of Kentucky, but still west of Virginia


      So, if Old Dominion University POD (which I assume is a campus location of Old
      Dominion University) is in Virginia, and Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical
      College is in Kentucky, then the Virginia location would be east of the Kentucky
      location.</think># Analyzing the Locations


      To determine if Old Dominion University POD, VA is east of Southeast Kentucky
      Community and Technical College, KY, I need to consider their geographic positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Old Dominion University is in Virginia (VA)

      - Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College is in Kentucky (KY)


      ## Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states

      - Virginia is located on the Atlantic coast in the eastern United States

      - Kentucky is an inland state located west of Virginia


      ## Step 3: More specific locations

      - Old Dominion University''s main campus is in Norfolk, Virginia, which is in
      the eastern part of Virginia near the Atlantic Ocean

      - Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College, as its name suggests,
      is in the southeastern part of Kentucky, in the Appalachian region


      ## Step 4: Final comparison

      Even though Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College is in the eastern
      portion of Kentucky, the entire state of Kentucky lies west of Virginia. Old
      Dominion University in Virginia would therefore be east of any location in Kentucky.


      YES, Old Dominion University POD, VA is located east of Southeast Kentucky Community
      and Technical College, KY.'

      University POD (in Virginia) is located east of Southeast Kentucky Community
      and Technical College (in Kentucky).


      Let me think geographically:


      1. Old Dominion University is in Virginia (VA). Specifically, I believe it''s
      in Norfolk, Virginia, which is on the eastern coast of Virginia.


      2. Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College is in Kentucky (KY). Kentucky
      is a state that is west of Virginia.


      3. In the United States, when comparing east-west positions, places in Virginia
      are generally east of places in Kentucky because Virginia is an eastern coastal
      state while Kentucky is more inland.


      4. Norfolk, Virginia (where Old Dominion University is located) is particularly
      far east, being on the Atlantic coast.


      5. Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College, being in Kentucky, would
      be west of Virginia and thus west of Old Dominion University.


      So based on the general geography of US states, Old Dominion University in Virginia
      should be east of Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College in Kentucky.</think>#
      Is Old Dominion University POD, VA located east of Southeast Kentucky Community

      Let me think through this geographically:


      1) Old Dominion University is located in Norfolk, Virginia (VA), which is on
      the eastern coast of Virginia near the Atlantic Ocean.


      2) Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College is in Kentucky (KY), which
      is a state located to the west of Virginia.


      3) Virginia borders the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side, while Kentucky is
      an inland state with no ocean coastline.


      4) In terms of US geography, Kentucky is positioned to the west of Virginia
      on a map.


      5) Norfolk, where Old Dominion University is located, is particularly far east
      in Virginia, sitting on the coastal region.


      Therefore, Old Dominion University in Virginia is indeed located east of Southeast
      Kentucky Community and Technical College in Kentucky.

      I need to determine if University of Richmond School of Professional & Continuing
      Studies in Virginia is located east of Western Kentucky University-Owensboro
      in Kentucky.


      First, I need to identify the general locations of these universities:

      1. University of Richmond is in Richmond, Virginia, which is on the east coast
      of the United States

      2. Western Kentucky University-Owensboro is in Owensboro, Kentucky, which is
      in the western part of Kentucky


      Looking at a map of the United States:

      - Virginia is on the east coast

      - Kentucky is more inland and west of Virginia

      - Specifically, Owensboro is in the western part of Kentucky (as the university
      name suggests)


      In the United States, locations further east have higher longitude values (since
      we''re in the western hemisphere where longitudes are negative, "more east"
      means less negative or closer to zero).


      Richmond, VA is definitely east of Owensboro, KY because:

      1. Virginia as a state is east of Kentucky

      2. Richmond is in the eastern part of Virginia

      3. Owensboro is in the western part of Kentucky, making it even further west


      So University of Richmond School of Professional & Continuing Studies in VA
      is located east of Western Kentucky University-Owensboro, KY.</think># Is University

      Let me think about the geographical locations of these two institutions:


      1. University of Richmond is located in Richmond, Virginia, which is on the
      east coast of the United States.


      2. Western Kentucky University-Owensboro is located in Owensboro, Kentucky.
      As the name suggests, it''s in the western part of Kentucky.


      3. Looking at the relative positions of these states: Virginia is on the Atlantic
      coast, while Kentucky is an inland state west of Virginia.


      4. More specifically, Richmond is in the eastern part of Virginia, while Owensboro
      is in the western part of Kentucky, making the east-west difference even more
      pronounced.


      Given these geographical facts, Richmond, VA is clearly east of Owensboro, KY.

      3. Determine their relative positions (east/west) on the map


      Let me work through this:


      1. Xavier University of Louisiana is in Louisiana (LA), specifically in New
      Orleans, Louisiana

      2. Texas Southern University is in Texas (TX), specifically in Houston, Texas


      Now I need to determine if New Orleans, LA is east of Houston, TX:


      Louisiana is a state that borders Texas on the east side. So Louisiana is east
      of Texas.

      More specifically, New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana, while Houston is
      in southeastern Texas.

      On a map of the United States, New Orleans is indeed east of Houston.


      Therefore, Xavier University of Louisiana (in New Orleans, LA) is located east
      of Texas Southern University (in Houston, TX).</think># Is Xavier University
      of Louisiana, LA located east of Texas Southern University, TX?


      Let me work through this step by step:


      1) Xavier University of Louisiana is located in New Orleans, Louisiana

      2) Texas Southern University is located in Houston, Texas

      3) Geographically, Louisiana is directly east of Texas on the US map

      4) More specifically, New Orleans (in southeastern Louisiana) is east of Houston
      (in southeastern Texas)


      Since Xavier University is in New Orleans, LA, which is east of Houston, TX,
      where Texas Southern University is located, the answer is:


      YES'

      1. Xavier University of Louisiana is in Louisiana (LA), specifically in New
      Orleans.

      2. Texas Southern University is in Texas (TX), specifically in Houston.


      Now I need to consider the relative geographical positions:

      - Louisiana is a state that borders Texas on the east.

      - New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana.

      - Houston is in southeastern Texas.


      Since Louisiana is east of Texas, and New Orleans is in eastern Louisiana while
      Houston is in eastern Texas, Xavier University of Louisiana would be east of
      Texas Southern University.


      So the answer is YES, Xavier University of Louisiana is located east of Texas
      Southern University.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the
      geographic locations of both universities and compare them.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Xavier University of Louisiana is located in New Orleans, Louisiana.

      - Texas Southern University is located in Houston, Texas.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Louisiana is located directly east of Texas on the U.S. map.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana.

      - Houston is in southeastern Texas.

      - Even though both are in the southeastern portions of their respective states,
      the state boundary relationship is the determining factor here.


      Step 4: Compare the longitudinal positions.

      - Since Louisiana is east of Texas, and these universities are in their respective
      states, Xavier University of Louisiana is east of Texas Southern University.


      YES, Xavier University of Louisiana is located east of Texas Southern University.'

      locations of two universities and compare them:

      1. Middlesex University, MA (Massachusetts)

      2. Syracuse University School of Education, NY (New York)


      Let me think about the geographic positions of Massachusetts and New York states.
      In the United States:

      - Massachusetts is located in the Northeast, on the Atlantic coast

      - New York state is west of Massachusetts


      More specifically, if we consider the locations:

      - Massachusetts is generally east of New York state

      - Syracuse, NY is in central New York state

      - Middlesex could refer to Middlesex County in Massachusetts, which is in the
      eastern part of Massachusetts (containing parts of the Boston metro area)


      Since Massachusetts is east of New York state, and Middlesex would be in eastern
      Massachusetts while Syracuse is in central New York, Middlesex University in
      MA would be east of Syracuse University in NY.


      Wait, I should double-check if there actually is a "Middlesex University" in
      Massachusetts. There''s Middlesex Community College in Massachusetts, but I''m
      not sure if there''s specifically a "Middlesex University" in MA. However, for
      the purposes of this question, I''ll assume it''s referring to an institution
      in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.</think># Reasoning about university locations


      To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic positions of these
      two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      - Middlesex University is in Massachusetts (MA)

      - Syracuse University School of Education is in New York (NY)

      - On a US map, Massachusetts is located to the east of New York state


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - Syracuse University is located in Syracuse, which is in central New York state

      - Middlesex University would be in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, which is
      in the eastern part of Massachusetts (in the greater Boston area)


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning.

      - Since Massachusetts is entirely east of central New York, and Syracuse is
      in central New York, any institution in Massachusetts would be east of Syracuse
      University.


      YES, Middlesex University, MA is located east of Syracuse University School
      of Education, NY.'

      First, I need to identify the locations of both universities:


      1. Middlesex University, MA - This would be in Massachusetts (MA)

      2. Syracuse University School of Education, NY - This is in New York state (NY)


      Now I need to determine their relative positions. In the United States, Massachusetts
      is east of New York state. Massachusetts is on the eastern coast, while New
      York is west of Massachusetts.


      Looking at their specific locations:

      - Syracuse University is in Syracuse, which is in central/western New York state

      - Middlesex University in Massachusetts would be in eastern Massachusetts


      Given that Massachusetts is east of New York state, and Syracuse is not in eastern
      New York (it''s in central/western NY), Middlesex University in MA would be
      east of Syracuse University in NY.</think>I need to determine the relative geographical
      positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Middlesex University, MA would be located in Massachusetts

      - Syracuse University School of Education is in Syracuse, New York


      Step 2: Consider the geographical layout of the northeastern United States.

      Massachusetts is located east of New York state on the US map.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - Syracuse is located in central/western New York state

      - Middlesex would be in eastern Massachusetts (near Boston area)


      Step 4: Compare the relative positions.

      Since Massachusetts is entirely east of central New York, and specifically Syracuse
      is in central/western New York, any institution in Massachusetts would be east
      of Syracuse.


      YES, Middlesex University, MA is located east of Syracuse University School

      Step 1: College of Charleston is located in Charleston, South Carolina.

      Step 2: Samford University is located in Birmingham, Alabama.

      Florida

      - Then states like Alabama, Mississippi, etc. are further west.


      South Carolina is on the Atlantic coast, while Alabama is inland, not on the
      coast. Generally, the states on the Atlantic coast are east of the inland states.


      So South Carolina is east of Alabama. Therefore, College of Charleston (in South
      Carolina) should be east of Samford University (in Alabama).

      1) University of Wisconsin-Waukesha is located in Waukesha, Wisconsin (WI)

      2) Dakota Wesleyan University is located in South Dakota (SD)


      To determine which is farther east, I need to consider the general geographic
      positions of these states.


      Wisconsin is in the upper Midwest, bordering Lake Michigan to the east. South
      Dakota is further west, in the Great Plains region. Generally speaking, Wisconsin
      is east of South Dakota.


      More specifically, Waukesha is in southeastern Wisconsin, near Milwaukee. Without
      knowing the exact location of Dakota Wesleyan University in South Dakota, I
      can still be confident that any location in Wisconsin would be east of most
      or all locations in South Dakota, as South Dakota is entirely west of Wisconsin.


      Dakota Wesleyan University is in Mitchell, South Dakota, which is in the eastern
      part of South Dakota, but South Dakota as a whole is west of Wisconsin.


      So University of Wisconsin-Waukesha would be east of Dakota Wesleyan University.</think>#
      Determining Which University Is Further East


      I need to locate both universities and compare their geographical positions
      from west to east.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - University of Wisconsin-Waukesha is in Waukesha, Wisconsin (WI)

      - Dakota Wesleyan University is in Mitchell, South Dakota (SD)


      ## Step 2: Compare the states geographically

      Wisconsin is located in the Upper Midwest, bordering Lake Michigan on its eastern
      side. South Dakota is located in the Great Plains region, considerably west
      of Wisconsin.


      ## Step 3: Consider specific locations

      Waukesha is in the southeastern part of Wisconsin, while Mitchell (home of Dakota
      Wesleyan) is in the eastern portion of South Dakota. However, even the easternmost
      part of South Dakota is still west of Wisconsin.


      ## Conclusion

      YES, University of Wisconsin-Waukesha is located east of Dakota Wesleyan University.'

      To determine which is further east, I need to think about the geographical positions
      of North Dakota and Washington.


      Washington state is on the west coast of the United States, bordering the Pacific

      North Dakota is in the upper Midwest region, bordering Canada. It''s significantly

      - Williston State College is in Williston, North Dakota

      - Eastern Washington University is in Cheney, Washington


      Despite the name "Eastern" Washington University, it''s still in Washington

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of these two colleges.

      - Williston State College is in Williston, North Dakota (ND)

      - Eastern Washington University is in Cheney, Washington (WA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      Washington state is on the west coast of the United States, while North Dakota
      is in the northern central part of the country. Generally speaking, states to
      the west coast are west of states in the central part of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      North Dakota is east of Washington state. Therefore, Williston State College
      in North Dakota would be east of Eastern Washington University in Washington
      state.


      So my answer is YES, Williston State College is located east of Eastern Washington
      University.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of these two colleges

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both colleges.

      - Williston State College is in Williston, North Dakota (ND)

      - Eastern Washington University is in Cheney, Washington (WA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Washington and North Dakota.

      - Washington state is on the west coast of the United States

      - North Dakota is in the upper Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Washington state lies entirely west of North Dakota on the map of the United
      States. Even though Eastern Washington University has "Eastern" in its name,
      this refers to its location in the eastern part of Washington state, not its

      2. Eastern Washington University is in Cheney, Washington (WA)


      To determine which is further east, I need to compare their longitudes. In the
      US, lower longitude numbers indicate more eastern locations (since longitude
      decreases as you move east in the US).


      North Dakota is east of Washington state, since Washington is on the west coast
      while North Dakota is in the upper midwest.


      Specifically:

      - Washington state is on the west coast, bordering the Pacific Ocean

      - North Dakota is several states east of Washington, near the middle of the
      northern border of the US


      So geographically, Williston State College in North Dakota would be east of
      Eastern Washington University in Washington state.


      Therefore, the answer is YES, Williston State College is located east of Eastern
      Washington University.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positioning

      - Washington state borders the Pacific Ocean on the west

      - North Dakota is approximately 1,000 miles east of Washington


      Step 4: Conclusion based on state locations.

      Since North Dakota is east of Washington state, Williston State College (in

      Step 1: Determine the location of Framingham State University

      Framingham State University is located in Framingham, Massachusetts (MA). Massachusetts
      is on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Determine the location of University of Michigan-Dearborn

      University of Michigan-Dearborn is located in Dearborn, Michigan (MI). Michigan
      is in the Midwest region of the United States.

      1. Stratford University is located in Virginia (VA)

      2. Xavier University is located in Ohio (OH)

      3. I need to determine if Stratford University is east of Xavier University


      Looking at the United States map, Virginia is on the east coast of the United
      States, while Ohio is more inland, in what''s called the Midwest or sometimes
      Great Lakes region.


      Geographically, Virginia is east of Ohio. States on the US east coast (like
      Virginia) are generally east of the Midwest states (like Ohio).


      Therefore, Stratford University in Virginia would be east of Xavier University
      in Ohio.</think>I need to determine if Stratford University in Virginia is located
      east of Xavier University in Ohio.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Stratford University is in Virginia (VA), which is on the eastern seaboard
      of the United States.

      - Xavier University is in Ohio (OH), which is in the Midwest region.


      Step 2: Compare the geographical positions.

      - Virginia is located on the Atlantic coast.

      - Ohio is an inland state, positioned west of Virginia.

      - On a map of the United States, Virginia is clearly east of Ohio.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on the geographical relationship.

      - Since Virginia is east of Ohio, and the universities are in these respective
      states, Stratford University (VA) is east of Xavier University (OH).


      YES'

      geographical locations of two universities in the US:

      1. Widener University in Delaware (DE)

      2. Huntington University in Indiana (IN)


      I need to determine if Widener University is located east of Huntington University.


      First, let me verify the locations of these universities:


      Widener University is in Delaware (DE). However, I should verify this because
      I believe the main Widener University campus is actually in Chester, Pennsylvania
      (PA), though they may have a Delaware campus.


      Huntington University is in Indiana (IN), which I believe is correct.


      For the purposes of this question, I''ll assume Widener University refers to
      either the main campus in Pennsylvania or a campus in Delaware.


      Now, let''s think about the geographic positions:

      - Delaware is on the east coast of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is also in the eastern part of the United States

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United States


      In terms of east-to-west positioning:

      - Delaware and Pennsylvania are both significantly east of Indiana

      - Therefore, whether Widener University is in Delaware or Pennsylvania, it would
      be east of Huntington University in Indiana


      So, Widener University (whether in DE or PA) is east of Huntington University
      in IN.</think>To determine if Widener University, DE is located east of Huntington
      University, IN, I need to consider the geographic positions of Delaware and
      Indiana within the United States.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both states.

      - Delaware (DE) is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      - Indiana (IN) is located in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider their positions relative to each other on an east-west axis.

      - States on the eastern seaboard (like Delaware) are further east than Midwestern
      states.

      - Indiana is significantly west of Delaware.


      Step 3: Since the universities are in these respective states, their relative
      positions follow the same pattern.

      - Widener University in Delaware would be positioned further east than Huntington
      University in Indiana.


      YES, Widener University, DE is located east of Huntington University, IN.'

      First, let me clarify the locations:


      Widener University in Delaware - Wait, I need to double-check this. I believe
      Widener University''s main campus is actually in Chester, Pennsylvania, not
      Delaware. They might have a branch in Delaware though.


      Huntington University in Indiana - This is likely in Huntington, Indiana.


      Let me think about the relative positions of these states on the US map:

      - Delaware is on the east coast of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is also in the eastern part of the US, but slightly west of Delaware

      - Indiana is in the Midwest, significantly west of both Delaware and Pennsylvania

      it would be east of Huntington University in Indiana, since both Pennsylvania
      and Delaware are east of Indiana.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west

      - Delaware is significantly east of Indiana on a US map

      - All locations in Delaware would be east of locations in Indiana


      Step 4: Conclude based on the states'' positions.

      To solve this problem, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of both universities

      2. Determine their relative positions on an east-west axis

      3. Conclude whether Widener is east of Huntington


      Let me start with what I know about US geography. The United States has an east
      coast and a west coast. Generally speaking:

      - Eastern states include those on the Atlantic coast like Delaware (DE)

      - Midwestern states like Indiana (IN) are more central in the country


      Delaware is one of the easternmost states in the US, located on the Atlantic
      coast.

      Indiana is in the Midwest region, much further inland from the Atlantic.


      Since Delaware is an East Coast state and Indiana is a Midwest state, a university
      in Delaware would be east of a university in Indiana.


      So Widener University in Delaware would be east of Huntington University in
      Indiana.</think>To determine if Widener University, DE is located east of Huntington
      University, IN, I need to consider the geographic locations of Delaware and
      Indiana.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both states.

      - Delaware (DE) is located on the eastern coast of the United States, along
      the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Indiana (IN) is located in the Midwest region of the United States, much further
      inland.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Delaware is one of the easternmost states in the country.

      - Indiana is significantly west of Delaware, positioned in the central part
      of the country.


      Step 3: Make the comparison between the specific universities.

      - Since Widener University is in Delaware, it inherits Delaware''s eastern position.

      - Since Huntington University is in Indiana, it inherits Indiana''s more western
      position.


      Therefore, Widener University in Delaware is indeed located east of Huntington
      University in Indiana.

      - Alabama is in the southeastern United States

      - Oklahoma is in the south-central United States


      On a west-to-east directional map of the United States, Oklahoma is significantly
      west of Alabama. The Mississippi River often serves as a rough dividing line
      for the eastern and central United States, with Oklahoma being west of this
      line and Alabama being east of it.


      Since Oakwood University is in Alabama (an eastern state relative to Oklahoma),
      it is located east of the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma.

    d924d571-ddd6-439e-9f98-08b1c07ff620: '<think>This question asks whether Oakwood
      University in Alabama is located east of the University of Science and Arts
      of Oklahoma in Oklahoma.


      To answer this, I need to consider the geographic locations of these two universities:


      1. Oakwood University is in Alabama (AL), which is a state in the southeastern
      United States.

      2. University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma is in Oklahoma (OK), which is
      a state in the south-central United States.


      Generally speaking, Alabama is located east of Oklahoma. On a map of the United
      States:

      - Oklahoma is located in the central part of the country

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern part of the country, bordering the
      Gulf of Mexico


      Since Alabama is east of Oklahoma, and these universities are in their respective
      states, Oakwood University in AL should be east of the University of Science
      and Arts of Oklahoma in OK.</think>To determine if Oakwood University in Alabama
      is located east of the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma, I need to
      consider their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' locations

      - Alabama (AL) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Oklahoma (OK) is located in the south-central United States


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions

      - On a US map, Alabama is positioned to the east of Oklahoma

      - Alabama is closer to the Atlantic Ocean, while Oklahoma is more centrally
      located in the country


      Step 3: Since universities are located within their respective states, their
      relative positions follow the same pattern

      - Oakwood University is in Alabama

      - University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma is in Oklahoma


      Since Alabama is east of Oklahoma on the map of the United States, Oakwood University
      must be east of the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma.
