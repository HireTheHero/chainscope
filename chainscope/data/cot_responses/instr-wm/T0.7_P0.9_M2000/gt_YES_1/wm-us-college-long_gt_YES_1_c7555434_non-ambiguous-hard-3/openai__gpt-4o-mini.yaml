      1. **Location of East Stroudsburg University**: ESU is situated in East Stroudsburg,
      Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is located in the eastern part of the United States.


      2. **Location of Robert Morris University**: RMU is located in Chicago, Illinois.
      Illinois is situated to the west of Pennsylvania.


      3. **Comparative Positioning**: Since Pennsylvania is to the east of Illinois,
      it follows that any location in Pennsylvania, including East Stroudsburg University,
      is to the east of any location in Illinois, including Robert Morris University.


      Based on this reasoning:


      **YES**, East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania is located east of Robert
      Morris University in Illinois.'

      University (FVSU) in Georgia is located east of The College of Saints John Fisher
      & Thomas More (located in Texas), we need to consider the geographical locations
      of both institutions.


      1. **Location of Fort Valley State University**: Fort Valley State University
      is in Fort Valley, Georgia, which is located in the southeastern United States.


      2. **Location of The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More**: This college
      is located in San Antonio, Texas. Texas is to the west of Georgia.


      3. **Comparative Positioning**: Georgia is positioned to the east of Texas.
      Therefore, any location in Georgia, including Fort Valley State University,
      will be east of any location in Texas, including San Antonio.


      Based on this reasoning, Fort Valley State University is indeed east of The
      College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More.


      So, the answer is: YES.'
