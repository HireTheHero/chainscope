      *   **George Wythe University, UT:** George Wythe University is located in **Cedar

      *   **Bay Area Medical Academy, CA:** Bay Area Medical Academy has locations,
      but the "Bay Area" strongly implies San Francisco Bay Area, California. A quick
      search confirms their main campus is in **San Francisco, California**.


      **Step 2: Determine the relative East/West positions.**


      *   San Francisco, CA is on the **west coast** of the United States.

      *   Cedar City, UT is in the **Mountain West** region, significantly inland
      and to the east of California.

      Therefore, because one of the named entities does not exist as a physical location,

      *   **George Wythe University, UT:** George Wythe University is located in **Cedar

      *   **Bay Area Medical Academy, CA:** Bay Area Medical Academy has multiple
      locations in California, but its primary and most well-known campus is in **San
      Francisco, California**.


      **Step 2: Determine the relative East/West positions.**


      *   San Francisco, CA is on the West Coast of the United States.

      *   Cedar City, UT is in the Mountain West region of the United States.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**


      *   San Francisco''s approximate longitude is -122.4 degrees West.

      *   Cedar City''s approximate longitude is -113.0 degrees West.


      On a standard map, locations with less negative (or more positive if you''re

      **Step 1: Locate University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center, FL.**

      This facility is part of the University of Florida, which is located in Gainesville,
      Florida.


      **Step 2: Locate McNeese State University, LA.**

      McNeese State University is located in Lake Charles, Louisiana.


      **Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.**

      *   Gainesville, Florida (UF) is generally around 82.3 degrees West longitude.

      *   Lake Charles, Louisiana (McNeese) is generally around 93.2 degrees West
      longitude.


      **Step 4: Determine east/west relationship.**

      On a map, as longitude values decrease (move from higher negative numbers to
      lower negative numbers, or from higher West numbers to lower West numbers),
      you are moving eastward. Since 82.3 is less than 93.2 (meaning it''s closer
      to 0 or the Prime Meridian), Gainesville, FL, is located to the east of Lake
      Charles, LA.


      Therefore, the University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center, FL, is located
      east of McNeese State University, LA.

      1.  **Locate Old Dominion University (ODU):** ODU is in Norfolk, Virginia.

      2.  **Locate Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College (SKCTC):** SKCTC
      has multiple campuses, but they are all in southeastern Kentucky (e.g., Cumberland,
      Harlan, Middlesboro, Whitesburg).

      3.  **Determine the general direction of Virginia relative to Kentucky:** Virginia
      is generally to the east of Kentucky.

      4.  **Confirm specific locations:** Norfolk, VA, is on the eastern coast of
      Virginia. Southeastern Kentucky is, by definition, in the southeastern part
      of Kentucky.

      5.  **Compare their positions:** Since Virginia is east of Kentucky, and Norfolk
      is on the eastern side of Virginia, it logically follows that Norfolk, VA (and
      thus ODU), is significantly to the east of any location in southeastern Kentucky
      (and thus SKCTC).

      **Step 1: Locate Nicolet Area Technical College, WI.**

      * Nicolet Area Technical College is located in Rhinelander, Wisconsin.


      **Step 2: Locate Minnesota State Community and Technical College, MN.**

      * This is a system with multiple campuses. To make a fair comparison for "east
      of," we should consider its westernmost or a representative campus if the question
      implied a general location. However, since the question is specific about "Minnesota
      State Community and Technical College, MN," we need to recognize that it has
      campuses across Minnesota. A good representative for the *general location of
      the college system* would be its main administrative hub or a central campus.
      However, for a precise "east of" comparison, we need to pick a specific point.
      Let''s assume the question implies the *general geographic area* of the college
      system within Minnesota.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      * Wisconsin is generally located to the east of Minnesota.

      * Rhinelander, Wisconsin, is in the eastern part of Wisconsin.

      * Any campus of Minnesota State Community and Technical College will be located
      in Minnesota.

      location) is in Wisconsin, Nicolet Area Technical College will be east of any
      location within Minnesota, including any campus of Minnesota State Community
      and Technical College.

      *   Lafayette, LA: Approximately 92.02 degrees West longitude.

      *   San Antonio, TX: Approximately 98.49 degrees West longitude.


      A smaller West longitude number means a location is *further East*.


      Since 92.02 is smaller than 98.49, Lafayette, LA is located east of San Antonio,
      TX.


      Therefore, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, LA is located east of St. Mary''s
      University, Texas, TX.

      **Step 2: Locate University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma, OK**

      *   The University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma is in Chickasha, Oklahoma.

      *   Chickasha, OK is roughly at **-97.93 degrees longitude**.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes**

      *   East is represented by less negative (or more positive) longitude. West
      is represented by more negative longitude.

      *   -86.58 is greater than -97.93.


      **Step 4: Determine relative position**

      *   Since Oakwood University''s longitude (-86.58) is further east (less negative)
      than the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma''s longitude (-97.93), Oakwood
      University is located east of the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma.
