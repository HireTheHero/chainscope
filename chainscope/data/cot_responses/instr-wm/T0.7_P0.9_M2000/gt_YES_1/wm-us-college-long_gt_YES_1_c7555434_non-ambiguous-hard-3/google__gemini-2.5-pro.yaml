      \nI've established that the user's inquiry boils down to a straightforward geographical\
      \ comparison: Is MSU east of CUP? It's a binary question, requiring a simple\
      \ YES or NO response based on their relative locations. I'm now delving into\
      \ the geographical data to determine the correct answer.\n\n\n**Evaluating Coordinate\
      \ Comparisons**\n\nI've determined the task is straightforward; compare the\
      \ longitudes of MSU and CUP to ascertain relative east-west positions. Currently,\
      \ I'm focusing on locating these institutions. I've pinpointed MSU as Bozeman,\
      \ MT, and CUP as Portland, OR. Longitude data shows Bozeman is roughly 111\xB0\
      \ W and Portland is around 122\xB0 W.  I noted CUP's closure, though it doesn't\
      \ affect geographical analysis. My next step will be comparing these values.\n\
      \n\n**Synthesizing Findings Geographically**\n\nMy analysis has progressed.\
      \ I've broken down the inquiry into steps, identifying the need to locate both\
      \ institutions and compare their longitudes. Bozeman, MT (MSU) at 111\xB0 W,\
      \ and Portland, OR (CUP, closed in 2020) at 122\xB0 W. I have confirmed that\
      \ lower longitude values represent more eastern locations. Consequently, I conclude\
      \ that Bozeman, MT, is indeed east of Portland, OR.\n\n\n**Determining Geographical\
      \ Conclusion**\n\nI've organized the task into a methodical step-by-step approach.\
      \ I pinpointed Bozeman, MT's longitude as 111\xB0 W and Portland, OR's (CUP)\
      \ as 122\xB0 W. I recognized the significance of lower longitude values indicating\
      \ an easterly position. Finally, I confirm MSU is east of CUP.\n\n\n</think>Here\

      \ Concordia University was located in the city of Portland, Oregon. (Note: The\
      \ university closed in 2020, but its physical location is still Portland, Oregon\
      \ for the purpose of this question).\n3.  **Finally, compare the two locations\
      \ on a map.** The state of Montana is geographically east of the state of Oregon.\

      I''ve established the core question: is MSU east of CUP? I''m now deconstructing
      the locations. "MT" is Montana. This means MSU''s location involves this state.
      More details will come.



      **Analyzing State Relationships**


      I''ve determined Montana is east of Oregon. Using a U.S. map, Oregon''s coastal,
      and Montana''s inland. Idaho, east of Oregon, confirms this. Now, focusing on
      Bozeman, Montana, and Portland, Oregon, the state-level relation still holds.



      **Pinpointing Specific Longitudes**


      I''ve determined Montana is east of Oregon, and thus Bozeman, Montana, is east
      of Portland, Oregon. Now, I''m verifying the conclusion by comparing their longitudes.
      I am preparing to provide a conclusive answer.



      **Determining Final Conclusion**


      I''ve established the state-level relationship. Montana is east of Oregon. Now,
      I will confirm this by comparing the specific longitudes of Bozeman and Portland.
      My comprehensive analysis leads me to a definitive answer. I''m ready to synthesize
      my findings to deliver the final conclusion.

      I''ve started by identifying the core question: determining the relative east-west
      position of two universities. Now, I''m breaking it down. First, I''ll need
      to find the precise locations (latitude and longitude) of Urbana University
      in Ohio and Lincoln College in Illinois. This will provide the necessary geographic
      data.



      **Re-evaluating the Premises**


      I''m circling back to the initial question. It seems my earlier assumptions
      were too simplistic. Both universities are closed, so I now have to consider
      their *former* locations. This introduces an interesting wrinkle: the question
      is about a past state, requiring me to treat the former campuses as the subjects.
      I''ll now focus on finding the longitudes of Urbana, OH, and Lincoln, IL, to
      make my comparison.



      **Pinpointing the Locations**


      I''ve successfully determined the locations of both former universities: Urbana,
      Ohio, and Lincoln, Illinois. Further clarifying, the question essentially asks
      if a location in Urbana, OH, is east of a location in Lincoln, IL. I''m now
      confirming that the entire state of Ohio is east of Illinois to definitively
      answer the core question. This will allow a clear "Yes" or "No" conclusion.



      **Mapping Out the Logic**


      I''ve just finished consolidating the entire thought process. It all boils down
      to comparing the relative east-west positions. I''m now outlining a clear, concise,
      step-by-step argument. The final answer is straightforward, and I''m ready to
      present it with supporting reasoning. The structure of my answer is finalized
      and ready to be rendered, complete with closure on a yes/no.



      </think>Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Find the location of Urbana University, OH:** Urbana University was located
      in the city of Urbana, in the state of Ohio.

      2.  **Find the location of Lincoln College, IL:** Lincoln College was located
      in the city of Lincoln, in the state of Illinois.

      3.  **Compare the two locations:** On a map of the United States, the state
      of Ohio is located entirely to the east of the state of Illinois. Therefore,
      any location in Ohio is east of any location in Illinois.

      I''ve pinpointed the core inquiry: determining if Henderson State University
      lies east of Eastern New Mexico University. My approach necessitates obtaining
      the precise geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) for each institution.
      These coordinates will be the foundation for comparing their eastward positioning.



      **Analyzing State Positions**


      I''ve determined Henderson State University is in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, and
      Eastern New Mexico University is in Portales, New Mexico. My focus now is comparing
      the states'' positions. It is evident, by observing the United States map, that
      Arkansas is east of New Mexico. This suggests a straightforward comparison of
      longitudes might be unnecessary, but I will still confirm that, of course!



      **Clarifying Geographical Positioning**


      I''m now fully immersed in the core geographical comparison. I''ve pinpointed
      both universities and their respective states, Arkadelphia, Arkansas, and Portales,
      New Mexico. My approach will be straightforward: I will compare their general
      locations, with Arkansas being clearly east of New Mexico. I plan to construct
      a step-by-step reasoning process, leading to a definitive "yes" answer. I am
      certain that this will result in a clear and complete response.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to locate Henderson State University. It is in Arkadelphia,
      Arkansas.

      2.  Next, we need to locate Eastern New Mexico University. It is in Portales,
      New Mexico.

      3.  Finally, we compare the locations. The state of Arkansas is geographically
      east of the state of New Mexico.


      Therefore, Henderson State University is located east of Eastern New Mexico
      University.

      I''ve started by identifying the core question: determining the relative east-west
      positioning of two universities. My next step involves gathering the necessary
      data points, specifically the geographic coordinates for each institution. This
      will enable a direct comparison.



      **Mapping University Positions**


      I''ve successfully located both universities: Henderson State in Arkadelphia,
      Arkansas, and Eastern New Mexico University in Portales, New Mexico. Now, the
      focus shifts to pinpointing their precise geographical coordinates. My plan
      is to use the city and state data I''ve acquired for the coordinates.



      **Determining University Locations**


      I''ve broken down the question: I need the longitude of each university to compare
      them. I''ve researched and found the cities: Arkadelphia, Arkansas, for Henderson
      State, and Portales, New Mexico, for Eastern New Mexico. I know Arkansas is
      east of New Mexico, confirming my initial hypothesis, but I''ll still verify
      the longitudes as an additional check.



      **Analyzing University Positions**


      I''ve successfully identified the universities'' locations as Arkadelphia, Arkansas,
      and Portales, New Mexico. Now I''m comparing these locations to verify the relative
      east-west positions. I will then use the longitudes of the cities to confirm
      my finding. My current conclusion is that Henderson State is east of Eastern
      New Mexico.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of Henderson State University.** Henderson State
      University is located in Arkadelphia, Arkansas.

      2.  **Identify the location of Eastern New Mexico University.** Eastern New
      Mexico University is located in Portales, New Mexico.

      3.  **Compare the geographical locations.** The state of Arkansas is located
      entirely to the east of the state of New Mexico. Therefore, any location in
      Arkansas (like Arkadelphia) is east of any location in New Mexico (like Portales).

      \ the location of the Community College of Vermont.** The Community College\
      \ of Vermont (CCV) has 12 locations across the state of Vermont. To answer the\
      \ question, we only need to determine if Machias, ME is east of *any* of them.\
      \ The entire state of Vermont is west of Machias, Maine. For example, CCV's\
      \ easternmost location is in St. Johnsbury, VT, which has an approximate longitude\

      I''ve successfully pinpointed the locations: New Albany, Indiana, and Wichita,
      Kansas. My focus now shifts to comparing their longitudinal positions to ascertain
      the east/west relationship. I will employ established geographical principles
      to determine if Indiana lies eastward of Kansas. Then, I''ll formulate the final
      answer.



      **Finalizing the Geographical Analysis**


      After successfully pinpointing the locations and determining their relative
      east-west positions, I''ve concluded that New Albany, Indiana (where Indiana
      University Southeast is located), lies eastward of Wichita, Kansas (where Wichita
      State University is located). The United States map visualization, as well as
      the states situated between Kansas and Indiana, confirmed this. The final answer,
      in response to the user''s inquiry, is a definitive YES. Now, the concluding
      report will need to be properly structured.



      **Structuring the Final Response**


      I''m now in the process of structuring the response for the user. I''ve gathered
      all necessary information, and I am putting it together in a logical, step-by-step
      fashion. My structure follows the precise instructions: beginning with the location
      of the two universities, followed by the comparative geographical positioning,
      and finally concluding with the definitive answer, "YES." This final structuring
      phase ensures a precise and comprehensible answer.

      \nI'm starting to pinpoint the core question - it's definitely a geographical\
      \ problem. I've identified the two key entities: Marywood University, specifically\

      \ Next, I'll look into the specific coordinates and spatial relationships.\n\
      \n\n**Determining Spatial Relationships**\n\nI've successfully mapped the locations\
      \ to coordinates. Scranton, PA, has a more easterly longitude than Detroit,\
      \ MI. I considered the concept of \"east of,\" correlating it with longitude.\
      \ This means Marywood *is* east of Wayne State's School of Social Work.\n\n\n\
      **Confirming Geographical Positioning**\n\nI've now methodically broken down\
      \ the problem. First, I located each university's city. Then I correlated \"\
      east of\" with longitude, realizing Scranton's longitude is less negative than\
      \ Detroit's. This clearly indicates Scranton is indeed east of Detroit. Now,\
      \ I'm formulating the definitive response, and the reasoning behind it.\n\n\n\

      \ MI:** Wayne State University is located in Detroit, Michigan. The School of\
      \ Social Work is part of the main campus in Detroit.\n3.  **Compare the geographic\
      \ locations:** The state of Pennsylvania is located entirely to the east of\
      \ the state of Michigan. Therefore, Scranton, Pennsylvania, is east of Detroit,\

      \ is approximately 75.6\xB0 W. The longitude of Detroit, MI, is approximately\
      \ 83.0\xB0 W. A smaller western longitude value means the location is further\

      \ if Marywood is east of Wayne State.\n\n\n**Analyzing Longitude Data**\n\n\
      I've gathered the necessary longitude data: Scranton, PA, is approximately at\

      \n\n**Confirming Longitude Data**\n\nI've verified the longitude data for both\

      \ both universities, I've confirmed that Georgia Southern's location is indeed\
      \ east of Alcorn State's, as their longitudes are 81.7\xB0 W and 91.1\xB0 W,\

      \ Southern's longitude (81.7\xB0 W) is smaller than Alcorn State's (91.1\xB0\
      \ W). Smaller longitudes in the Western Hemisphere mean 'further east'. The\
      \ key lies in understanding that Western longitude degrees decrease as you move\
      \ east. Thus, the conclusion is clear: Georgia Southern *is* east of Alcorn\
      \ State.\n\n\n</think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Locate Georgia\
      \ Southern University:** Georgia Southern University is located in Statesboro,\
      \ Georgia.\n2.  **Locate Alcorn State University:** Alcorn State University\
      \ is located in Lorman, Mississippi.\n3.  **Compare the longitudes of the locations:**\
      \ Statesboro, Georgia, is at a longitude of approximately 81.7\xB0 W. Lorman,\
      \ Mississippi, is at a longitude of approximately 91.1\xB0 W.\n4.  **Determine\
      \ relative position:** In the Western Hemisphere, a location with a smaller\
      \ longitude number is east of a location with a larger longitude number. Since\
      \ 81.7 is smaller than 91.1, Statesboro, GA is east of Lorman, MS.\n\nYES"

      I''m now zeroing in on the longitudes. Keuka Park, NY, clocks in around -77.1
      degrees, and Hammond, IN, at about -87.5 degrees. Initially, I forgot to account
      for the negative sign! Because -77.1 is greater than -87.5, Keuka Park, NY,
      is indeed farther east. With that critical realization, I need to check if the
      merger of Purdue Calumet changed the relevant geographical information.



      **Concluding the Comparison**


      I''ve completed the comparison and determined Keuka College is indeed east of

      I''ve identified the core inquiry: determining if Altamaha Technical College
      is east of Jarvis Christian College. I''m now breaking down this geographical
      question into its constituent parts. My current focus is pinpointing the exact
      locations of these two institutions, which I''ll then use to establish their
      relative positions on a map. I''m considering using latitude and longitude coordinates
      to ensure precision.



      **Mapping Relative Positions**


      I''ve established both locations: Jesup, GA, and Hawkins, TX.  My next step
      involves using these coordinates to plot the locations. I plan to determine
      the relative positions of Jesup and Hawkins, specifically if Jesup is east of
      Hawkins, to answer the initial geographical question.



      **Establishing Geographical Comparison**


      Having identified Jesup, GA and Hawkins, TX, I''ve now completed the comparison.
      My reasoning is now ready to be put in a format that answers the core question.
      To that end, I have a step-by-step reasoning process already and an associated
      final answer. I''m focusing on ensuring clarity.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to find the location of Altamaha Technical College in Georgia.
      Altamaha Technical College has since merged to become part of Coastal Pines
      Technical College, with its main campus located in Jesup, Georgia.

      2.  Next, we need to find the location of Jarvis Christian College in Texas.
      It is located in Hawkins, Texas.

      3.  Finally, we compare the two locations on a map of the United States. Jesup,
      Georgia is in the southeastern US, while Hawkins, Texas is in the south-central
      US.

      4.  Therefore, Jesup, Georgia, is geographically east of Hawkins, Texas.

      \nI'm now focusing on the primary goal: determining the relative geographical\
      \ positioning of the two universities. The core of my analysis will revolve\
      \ around comparing their longitudes and latitudes. I've identified it as a yes/no\
      \ question, and I must now move onto finding factual data.\n\n\n**Mapping the\
      \ Facts**\n\nI've just finished the first phase; pinpointing Middlesex Community\
      \ College's approximate coordinates, focusing on Lowell, Massachusetts. The\
      \ coordinates I found are roughly 42.6334\xB0 N, 71.3162\xB0 W. Next, I will\
      \ obtain the coordinates for Syracuse University's School of Education, which\
      \ is the second piece of factual data.\n\n\n**Concluding the Comparison**\n\n\
      I've successfully compared the longitudes! Based on the data, Middlesex Community\
      \ College in Massachusetts, with a longitude around -71.3\xB0 W, is definitely\
      \ located east of Syracuse University's School of Education in New York, which\
      \ has a longitude of roughly -76.1\xB0 W. A clear, concise answer to the yes/no\
      \ question has been established, along with an explanation.\n\n\n**Finalizing\
      \ the Synthesis**\n\nI've reviewed the gathered data and the comparison process.\
      \ I've refined the explanation to clarify the decision to use Middlesex Community\
      \ College and presented the final answer in the requested format: a detailed\
      \ reasoning process followed by a concise \"YES.\" The analysis is complete,\
      \ the logic is sound, and I'm confident with the conclusion.\n\n\n**Structuring\
      \ the Explanation**\n\nI'm finalizing the presentation of the information. I'm\
      \ organizing the factual data and comparisons into a logical flow. The explanation\
      \ will clearly state the assumptions made, detail the longitude comparison,\

      \ Syracuse University School of Education, which is located on the campus of\
      \ Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York.\n3.  **Determine the relative geographical\
      \ positions:** Massachusetts is a state on the Atlantic coast, while Syracuse\
      \ is located in Central New York, which is west of Massachusetts.\n4.  **Compare\
      \ their longitudes:**\n    *   Lowell, Massachusetts, is at a longitude of approximately\
      \ 71.3\xB0 W.\n    *   Syracuse, New York, is at a longitude of approximately\
      \ 76.1\xB0 W.\n5.  **Conclusion:** A location with a smaller longitude value\
      \ in the Western Hemisphere (e.g., 71.3\xB0 W is smaller than 76.1\xB0 W) is\
      \ farther east. Therefore, Middlesex Community College in Massachusetts is located\
      \ east of Syracuse University in New York.\n\n**YES**"

      \nI've identified the core question: determining if Middlesex University, MA,\
      \ is located east of Syracuse University School of Education, NY. My next step\
      \ will be pinpointing the geographical coordinates for each institution.\n\n\
      \n**Analyzing the Coordinates**\n\nI've successfully located the coordinates\
      \ for Middlesex Community College in Lowell, MA. My focus now shifts to finding\
      \ the geographical data for Syracuse University School of Education in NY, to\
      \ enable a comparison of the longitudes. I will then determine the relative\
      \ east-west positions.\n\n\n**Determining Relative Positions**\n\nI've determined\
      \ that Middlesex Community College, MA, has a longitude of roughly 71.3\xB0\
      \ W, while Syracuse University, NY, has a longitude around 76.1\xB0 W. Since\
      \ a smaller West longitude indicates a position further east, I've concluded\
      \ that Middlesex Community College is east of Syracuse University.\n\n\n**Evaluating\
      \ The Discrepancy**\n\nI've just realized the query specified \"Middlesex University,\
      \ MA,\" which is confusing because a university by that exact name isn't readily\
      \ apparent in Massachusetts. My current focus centers on the most likely intended\
      \ entity, Middlesex Community College, while acknowledging a potential misunderstanding\
      \ in the original request, which would affect the final answer. I am working\
      \ on how best to frame my response around this possible error.\n\n\n**Refining\
      \ The Response**\n\nI'm now focused on crafting a comprehensive response. It\
      \ needs to explicitly mention the ambiguity regarding \"Middlesex University,\"\
      \ presenting the most likely interpretation as Middlesex Community College,\
      \ and clearly explain the geographical comparison. My goal is to provide a conclusive\

      \ reasoning:\n\n**Step 1:** Identify the location of \"Middlesex University,\
      \ MA\". While there is no institution with this exact name, the most likely\
      \ intended place is Middlesex Community College, which has campuses in Lowell\
      \ and Bedford, Massachusetts. Both cities are in the eastern part of Massachusetts.\n\
      \n**Step 2:** Identify the location of \"Syracuse University School of Education,\
      \ NY\". This school is part of Syracuse University, which is located in the\
      \ city of Syracuse in central New York.\n\n**Step 3:** Compare the geographical\
      \ positions. Massachusetts is a coastal state on the Atlantic Ocean. New York\
      \ is to the west of Massachusetts. Therefore, any location in Massachusetts\
      \ is geographically east of any location in central New York.\n\n**Step 4:**\
      \ To be more precise, we can compare their longitudes.\n*   Middlesex Community\
      \ College (Lowell, MA) is at approximately 71.3\xB0 W longitude.\n*   Syracuse\
      \ University (Syracuse, NY) is at approximately 76.1\xB0 W longitude.\n\nIn\
      \ the Western Hemisphere, a smaller longitude number means the location is further\
      \ east. Since 71.3 is less than 76.1, the location in Massachusetts is east\
      \ of the location in New York.\n\n**YES**"

      \ at 98.03\xB0 W. Now, I need to interpret this data: a lower value indicates\
      \ a more eastward location. Since Waukesha's longitude is greater (less negative)\
      \ than Mitchell's, that confirms that UW-Waukesha is indeed east of Dakota Wesleyan.\
      \ The analysis is complete.\n\n\n**Establishing Geocoordinates**\n\nI've just\

      \ comparison and conclusion.\n\n\n**Finalizing Geographical Deduction**\n\n\
      The analysis is complete, and the reasoning is sound. I've broken down the query,\
      \ gathered coordinates, compared the longitudes, and now have a comprehensive\
      \ answer. UW-Waukesha, indeed, is east of Dakota Wesleyan University. The final\

      I''ve focused on the core question: determining Oakwood University''s location
      relative to the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma. My initial step
      is to identify their respective geographical coordinates, specifically longitude,
      so I can accurately compare their positions.



      **Confirming Relative Positions**


      I''ve established that Oakwood University is in Huntsville, Alabama, and the
      University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma is in Chickasha, Oklahoma. The core
      challenge now shifts to confirming Alabama''s eastward position relative to
      Oklahoma. I''m preparing to use my geographical knowledge, backed by a mental
      map of the United States, to solidify this conclusion. The plan is to compare
      the relative longitudes of Huntsville and Chickasha directly, once I look them
      up.



      **Analyzing State Positions**


      I''ve moved on to establishing the specific methodology. My approach breaks
      down the geographical comparison into manageable steps. I will use the known
      cities of the universities, Huntsville and Chickasha, and the states in which
      they are located, to determine the relative eastward positions. The final conclusion
      will be formulated as a direct "yes" or "no" answer.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to locate Oakwood University. The prompt indicates it is
      in AL, which is the abbreviation for Alabama. Specifically, Oakwood University
      is located in Huntsville, Alabama.

      2.  Next, we need to locate the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma.
      The prompt indicates it is in OK, which is the abbreviation for Oklahoma. Specifically,
      this university is located in Chickasha, Oklahoma.

      3.  Finally, we compare the geographical locations of these two cities. On a
      map of the United States, the state of Alabama is located to the east of the
      state of Oklahoma.

      4.  Therefore, Huntsville, Alabama is east of Chickasha, Oklahoma.

      \nMy initial assessment points towards a straightforward geographical inquiry.\
      \ The core focus will be pinpointing the longitudes of Oakwood University and\
      \ the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma. This comparison of longitude\
      \ values will definitively answer the user's question.\n\n\n**Confirming Geographical\
      \ Positions**\n\nI've determined that Oakwood University is located at approximately\
      \ -86.58\xB0 W longitude, while the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma\
      \ is at -97.95\xB0 W. I need to complete the comparison of these longitude values,\

      \ located in Chickasha, Oklahoma.\n3.  **Compare the longitudes of the two locations.**\
      \ Huntsville, Alabama, is at a longitude of approximately 86.6\xB0 W. Chickasha,\
      \ Oklahoma, is at a longitude of approximately 97.9\xB0 W.\n4.  **Determine\
      \ relative position.** On a map, a location with a smaller West longitude (a\
      \ number closer to 0) is east of a location with a larger West longitude. Since\
      \ 86.6\xB0 W is a smaller number than 97.9\xB0 W, Huntsville, AL is located\
      \ east of Chickasha, OK.\n\nYES"
