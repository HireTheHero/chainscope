      of Virginia, near the Atlantic coast.


      2. **Owensboro Community and Technical College, Kentucky**: This college is

      - Virginia Beach, VA, where Regent University is located, is much closer to
      the eastern coast of the United States.

      - Owensboro, KY, is located further west in the state of Kentucky.

      - Rhinelander, Wisconsin, is situated in the northern part of Wisconsin.

      - Fergus Falls, Minnesota, is located in the western part of Minnesota.


      Since Wisconsin is generally east of Minnesota, and Rhinelander is located in
      northern Wisconsin while Fergus Falls is in western Minnesota, Rhinelander (and
      thus Nicolet Area Technical College) is east of Fergus Falls (Minnesota State
