      Bridgeport in Connecticut is located east of Premier Flight Academy in Ohio,
      we need to compare their geographical longitudes. Locations with smaller (more
      negative) longitude values in the Western Hemisphere are further west, while
      those with larger (less negative) longitude values are further east.


      Step 1: Identify the location of University of Bridgeport, Connecticut.

      - The University of Bridgeport is located in Bridgeport, CT, which is in the
      southwestern part of Connecticut along the Atlantic coast.

      - Approximate coordinates: Latitude 41.165, Longitude -73.190.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Premier Flight Academy, Ohio.

      - Premier Flight Academy is located in Ohio. While there may be multiple flight
      schools, a commonly known one is located at Toledo Executive Airport near Toledo,
      OH.

      - Approximate coordinates: Latitude 41.560, Longitude -83.480.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes.

      - University of Bridgeport: Longitude -73.190

      - Premier Flight Academy (Toledo area): Longitude -83.480


      Step 4: Determine which location is further east.

      - Since -73.190 is greater than -83.480, the University of Bridgeport is located
      further east than Premier Flight Academy.

      values in the Western Hemisphere are further west, and those with larger (less
      negative) longitudes are further east.


      **Step 1: Identify the locations of the universities.**

      - Wingate University is located in Wingate, North Carolina.

      - Reinhardt University is located in Waleska, Georgia.


      **Step 2: Find the approximate longitudes of both universities.**

      - Wingate, NC is approximately at longitude **-80.45** degrees.

      - Waleska, GA is approximately at longitude **-84.55** degrees.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      - -80.45 (Wingate) is greater than -84.55 (Reinhardt), meaning Wingate is further
      east.


      **Conclusion:**

      Since Wingate University is located at a more eastern longitude than Reinhardt
      University, the answer is:
