      4. To calculate population density, I''ll divide population by land area:

      - Fairview-Ferndale, PA: 1,500 / 0.5 = 3,000 people per square mile

      - Pennington Gap, VA: 1,300 / 1.2 = about 1,083 people per square mile


      5. Comparing the densities:

      - Fairview-Ferndale, PA has 3,000 people per square mile

      - Pennington Gap, VA has 1,083 people per square mile


      6. 3,000 is greater than 1,083, so Fairview-Ferndale is more densely populated.

    9eea24b5-61b0-4f2b-94ad-76af9aef9ec0: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll look up the population of Paramus, NJ:

      - Paramus is a suburban town in Bergen County, New Jersey

      - Its population is around 26,000 people

      - Its land area is approximately 11 square miles


      2. Next, I''ll look up the population of Moulton, AL:

      - Moulton is a small city in Lawrence County, Alabama

      - Its population is around 2,500 people

      - Its land area is approximately 10 square miles


      3. Calculate population density for each:

      - Paramus: 26,000 people / 11 sq miles = about 2,364 people per square mile

      - Moulton: 2,500 people / 10 sq miles = about 250 people per square mile


      4. Compare the population densities:

      - Paramus is much more densely populated (2,364 vs 250 people per square mile)


      Therefore, the answer is: YES, Paramus, NJ is more densely populated than Moulton,
      AL.'

      - Paramus is a suburban town in Bergen County, New Jersey

      - It has an area of about 11 square miles

      - Its population is around 26,000

      2. Next, I''ll find the population of Beaver Creek, TX

      TX

      - In fact, I''m not certain this is even a real incorporated city/town


      3. Population density requires both population and land area

      - Without reliable population data for Beaver Creek, I cannot calculate its
      density

      - Without both population and area, I cannot compare densities


      4. Given the lack of verifiable data for Beaver Creek, TX, I cannot confidently
      answer whether Essexville is more densely populated


      Therefore, I cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer due to insufficient information.'

    9412b8a8-93e1-47c9-b1a1-98246a8c3bc9: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll look up the population and land area of Florissant, MO:

      - Population: Around 52,000

      - Land area: About 27 square miles


      2. Then, I''ll look up the population and land area of Patagonia, AZ:

      - Population: Around 900

      - Land area: About 1 square mile


      3. Calculate population density for Florissant, MO:

      52,000 / 27 = approximately 1,926 people per square mile


      4. Calculate population density for Patagonia, AZ:

      900 / 1 = 900 people per square mile


      5. Compare the two densities:

      1,926 > 900


      Therefore, Florissant, MO is more densely populated than Patagonia, AZ.

      - Kaysville: 33,000 / 10.5 = about 3,143 people per square mile

      - Wittenberg: 1,400 / 3.5 = about 400 people per square mile


      4. Compare the densities:

      - Kaysville''s density (3,143) is significantly higher than Wittenberg''s (400)


      5. Conclusion:

      - Kaysville is more densely populated than Wittenberg

      2. Next, I''ll look up Carrolltown, PA:

      - Carrolltown is a small borough in Cambria County, Pennsylvania

      - Its population is around 900

      - Its total area is approximately 0.4 square miles


      3. Calculate population density for each:

      - Fife, WA: 10,500 / 4.5 = about 2,333 people per square mile

      - Carrolltown, PA: 900 / 0.4 = about 2,250 people per square mile

      1. First, I''ll need to find the population of Pleasant Run, OH

      - I know Pleasant Run is a very small place in Ohio

      - According to census data, Pleasant Run has approximately 300-400 residents


      2. Next, I''ll find the population of White Springs, FL

      - White Springs is also a very small town in Florida

      - Census data shows White Springs has around 700-800 residents


      3. Now, I''ll consider their land areas to calculate population density

      - Pleasant Run is quite small geographically, likely less than 1 square mile

      - White Springs also has a small land area, but slightly larger than Pleasant
      Run


      4. Calculating population density

      - Pleasant Run: ~350 people / ~0.5 sq miles = roughly 700 people per square
      mile

      - White Springs: ~750 people / ~1 sq mile = roughly 750 people per square mile


      5. Comparing the densities

      - White Springs appears to have a slightly higher population density


      Therefore, the answer is: NO, Pleasant Run, OH is not more densely populated
      than White Springs, FL.'

      \ larger area\n\n4. Population density calculation:\n\u2022 Population density\
      \ = Total population / Land area\n\u2022 While I don't have precise square mileage,\
      \ the raw population numbers suggest Juniata Terrace likely has a higher density\
      \ due to its very small total area\n\n5. Conclusion reasoning:\n\u2022 Despite\

      1. First, I''ll look up the population and area of Blackhawk, CA:

      - Blackhawk is an unincorporated community in Contra Costa County, California

      - It''s an affluent suburban area

      - Its population is around 10,000

      - Its land area is approximately 4-5 square miles

      1. First, I''ll look up the populations of Whitewood, SD and Kieler, WI.


      2. Whitewood, SD:

      - According to the 2020 census, Whitewood has a population of about 814 people

      - The town covers approximately 0.54 square miles


      3. Kieler, WI:

      - Kieler is a very small unincorporated community

      - Its population is estimated to be around 200-300 people

      - It covers a similar small area


      4. Population density calculation:

      - Whitewood, SD: 814 people / 0.54 sq miles = about 1,507 people per square
      mile

      - Kieler, WI: Approximately 200-300 people in a similar area, which would be
      around 370-555 people per square mile


      5. Comparing the densities:

      - Whitewood''s density (1,507 people/sq mile) is significantly higher than Kieler''s
      (370-555 people/sq mile)


      Therefore, the answer is: YES, Whitewood, SD is more densely populated than
      Kieler, WI.'
