    e9c943a1-78e6-4abb-a149-debe84a9696c: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s locate the Celtic Sea:

      - The Celtic Sea is located off the southwest coast of Ireland

      - It is part of the Atlantic Ocean

      - It borders Ireland, the United Kingdom, and France


      2. Now, let''s consider Canada Lake:

      - There is no well-known major lake called "Canada Lake"

      - The name seems geographically improbable


      3. Geographical reasoning:

      - The Celtic Sea is in the northeast Atlantic

      - It is in Europe

      - Canada is in North America, far across the Atlantic Ocean


      4. Spatial relationship:

      - The Celtic Sea and Canada are not in close proximity

      - They are separated by the entire width of the Atlantic Ocean

      - There is no way the Celtic Sea could be east of a hypothetical Canada Lake


      5. Conclusion:

      The statement does not make geographical sense. The Celtic Sea is not located
      east of Canada Lake.

    71d11776-8b0d-401b-9aea-d3d29263904f: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate the Strait of Sicily:

      - The Strait of Sicily is a body of water between Sicily (Italy) and Tunisia
      in the Mediterranean Sea

      - This is in southern Europe, specifically in the Mediterranean region


      2. Next, locate Indian Lake:

      - Indian Lake is a reservoir in Logan County, Ohio, United States

      - This is in the midwestern part of North America


      3. Compare their geographical locations:

      - The Strait of Sicily is in southern Europe

      - Indian Lake is in Ohio, North America

      - These are on completely different continents, separated by the Atlantic Ocean


      4. Consider the directional relationship:

      - Given their vast geographical separation, the concept of "east" or "west"
      becomes complex

      - However, from a global perspective, the Strait of Sicily is significantly
      west of Indian Lake


      5. Conclusion:

      - The Strait of Sicily is NOT east of Indian Lake
