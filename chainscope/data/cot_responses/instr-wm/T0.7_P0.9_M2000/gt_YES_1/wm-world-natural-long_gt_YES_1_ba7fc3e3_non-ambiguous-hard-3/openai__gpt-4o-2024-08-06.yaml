      across northwestern Africa.


      2. **Ouachita Mountains**: This mountain range is located in the United States,
      primarily in western Arkansas and southeastern Oklahoma.


      Next, we''ll consider their relative positions:


      - The Saharan Atlas, being part of the Atlas Mountains in North Africa, is situated
      in the eastern part of the continent relative to the western hemisphere.

      - The Ouachita Mountains are located in the central part of the United States,
