      2. Identify the location of Briones Reservoir.

      3. Compare their longitudinal coordinates to determine east-west positioning.


      **Step 1: Location of Lake Tillery**

      - Lake Tillery is a reservoir located in North Carolina, USA.

      - Specifically, it lies in the central part of North Carolina, in the Piedmont
      region.


      **Step 2: Location of Briones Reservoir**

      - It is situated in the East Bay area near Orinda and Lafayette in Contra Costa
      County.


      **Step 3: Compare Longitude**

      - North Carolina (where Lake Tillery is) is on the east coast of the United
      States.

      - California (where Briones Reservoir is) is on the west coast.


      Therefore, **Lake Tillery is east of Briones Reservoir**, since North Carolina
      is east of California.

      east of the Calapooya Mountains, we need to:


      1. Identify the location of Wazee Lake.

      2. Identify the location of the Calapooya Mountains.

      3. Determine the relative position of Wazee Lake with respect to the Calapooya
      Mountains.


      Step 1: Wazee Lake is located in Jackson County, in the state of Wisconsin,
      USA. It is known as the deepest inland lake in Wisconsin, and it was created
      from a former iron mine.


      Step 2: The Calapooya Mountains are located in the state of Oregon, USA. They
      form a mountain range in southwestern Oregon and separate the Willamette Valley
      from the Umpqua Valley.


      Step 3: Now comparing the two: Wazee Lake is in Wisconsin, which is in the north-central
      United States, while the Calapooya Mountains are in Oregon, which is in the
      Pacific Northwest. On a map, Wisconsin is significantly east of Oregon.


      Therefore, Wazee Lake is located east of the Calapooya Mountains.

      east of Woman Lake, we need to determine the geographic locations of both places.


      1. **Lough Ennell** is a lake in Ireland. Specifically, it is located in County
      Westmeath, in the central part of the Republic of Ireland.


      2. **Woman Lake** is located in the United States, specifically in Minnesota.


      Now, we need to compare their longitudinal positions to determine if Lough Ennell
      is east of Woman Lake.


      - The approximate longitude of Lough Ennell (Ireland) is around **-7.4 degrees**

      - The approximate longitude of Woman Lake (Minnesota, USA) is around **-94.5

      \ step:\n\n1. **Identify the location of the Tanggula Mountains**:\n   - The\
      \ Tanggula Mountains are located in China. They are part of the Transhimalaya\
      \ mountain range and are situated in the central part of the Tibetan Plateau.\n\
      \   - Their approximate coordinates are around 33\xB0N latitude and 91\xB0E\
      \ longitude.\n\n2. **Identify the location of Lake Habbaniyah**:\n   - Lake\
      \ Habbaniyah is located in Iraq, west of Baghdad.\n   - Its approximate coordinates\
      \ are around 33.3\xB0N latitude and 43.5\xB0E longitude.\n\n3. **Compare the\
      \ longitudes**:\n   - Tanggula Mountains: ~91\xB0E\n   - Lake Habbaniyah: ~43.5\xB0\
      E\n\n4. **Determine east vs. west**:\n   - Since 91\xB0E is a higher longitude\

      \ step:\n\n1. **Location of Lake Habbaniyah**:\n   - Lake Habbaniyah is located\
      \ in Iraq, which is in the Middle East.\n   - More specifically, it is situated\

      \   - The Tanggula Mountains are located in China.\n   - They are part of the\
      \ eastern section of the Tibetan Plateau.\n   - Geographically, they are situated\
      \ in the central part of China, mostly in the Qinghai-Tibet region.\n\n3. **Comparing\
      \ Longitudes**:\n   - Iraq (and therefore Lake Habbaniyah) is located approximately\
      \ around 43\u201344 degrees East longitude.\n   - The Tanggula Mountains are\
      \ located around 90\u201392 degrees East longitude.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n\
      \   - Since 90\u201392 degrees East is significantly east of 43\u201344 degrees\
      \ East, the Tanggula Mountains are indeed located east of Lake Habbaniyah.\n\
