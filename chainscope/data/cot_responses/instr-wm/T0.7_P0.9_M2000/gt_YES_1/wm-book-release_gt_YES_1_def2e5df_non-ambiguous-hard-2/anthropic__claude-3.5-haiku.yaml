      1. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri''s Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings:

      - This is a scholarly work addressing terrorism from an Islamic perspective

      - It was published in 2010


      2. Sion Sono''s Suicide Circle: The Complete Edition:

      - This appears to be a book related to a Japanese film

      - I''ll need to verify its publication date


      3. Comparing publication dates:

      - Tahir-ul-Qadri''s book: 2010

      - I would need to confirm the exact publication date of the Suicide Circle book
      to compare


      4. However, without being 100% certain of the Suicide Circle book''s publication
      date, I cannot confidently state whether one was released later than the other.


      Given the uncertainty, I cannot definitively answer YES or NO.


      If I were required to give a YES or NO answer, I would need more information
      to do so accurately and confidently.'
