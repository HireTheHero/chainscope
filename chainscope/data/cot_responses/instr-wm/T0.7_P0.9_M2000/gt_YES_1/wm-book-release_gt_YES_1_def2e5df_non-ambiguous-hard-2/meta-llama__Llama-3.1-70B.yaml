      1. **Identify the release date of "Fandemonium" by Red Hot Chili Peppers**:
      This book is a photo book by the American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers. The
      exact release date needs to be found, but generally, the band has been active
      since the 1980s.


      2. **Identify the release date of "And Another Thing..." by Eoin Colfer**: This
      is a novel by Irish author Eoin Colfer. The release date of "And Another Thing..."
      specifically needs to be identified.


      3. **Compare the release dates**: Once the release dates of both books are known,
      we can directly compare them to determine which was released later.
