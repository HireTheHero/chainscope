      2) Let''s look at East Lake, Oregon:

      - East Lake is located in central Oregon


      3) For Elk Mountains:

      - If we consider Elk Mountains in South Dakota (as stated in the name), it''s
      in South Dakota

      - If we consider the location marker (WY), it would be in Wyoming


      4) Regardless of whether we use South Dakota or Wyoming:

      - Both South Dakota and Wyoming are east of Oregon

      - Both South Dakota and Wyoming are at a more northerly latitude than central
      Oregon

      1) Let me recall the locations:

      - Grapevine Mountains are in Nevada, near the California border

      - Great Salt Plains Lake is in north-central Oklahoma


      2) Looking at relative positions:

      - Nevada is west of Oklahoma

      - More importantly for this question, Nevada is roughly at the same latitude
      as the middle of Oklahoma


      3) Specifically:

      - Grapevine Mountains are in southern Nevada

      - Great Salt Plains Lake is in northern Oklahoma


      4) Therefore:

      - Since Grapevine Mountains are in the southern part of Nevada, and Great Salt

      SOUTH of Great Salt Plains Lake

      also near Baker, CA.


      4. Looking at their relative positions:

      - Lake Tuendae is located at the Desert Studies Center at Zzyzx

      - Soda Lake is the large dry lake bed that lies just north of Zzyzx


      Therefore, since Soda Lake is positioned north of Zzyzx where Lake Tuendae is
      located...
