    e4b77817-8d78-4e51-b494-c3579de00ab0: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of Pine Lake (Washington) and Lake Cushman in Washington state
      and then compare their positions.


      1. **Location of Pine Lake (Washington)**: Pine Lake is located in King County,
      Washington. King County is in the western part of Washington state, and it includes
      the city of Seattle.


      2. **Location of Lake Cushman**: Lake Cushman is located in Mason County, Washington.
      Mason County is also in western Washington but is further south and west compared
      to King County.


      3. **Comparing Locations**: To determine if Pine Lake is north of Lake Cushman,
      we need to understand the geography of the region. Pine Lake is in King County,
      which is north of Mason County where Lake Cushman is located.


      Given these considerations, Pine Lake (Washington) is generally north of Lake
      Cushman, considering their positions relative to King County and Mason County

      1. **Identify the locations**: We have two main locations to consider - Never
      Summer Mountains in Colorado and Navesink Highlands in New Jersey. The Never
      Summer Mountains are a mountain range in the Rocky Mountains, located in the
      state of Colorado. Navesink Highlands are a region in New Jersey, specifically
      part of the Highlands of New Jersey.


      2. **Understand the geography**: The Never Summer Mountains are in northern
      Colorado, relatively close to the Wyoming border. Navesink Highlands are located
      in the eastern part of New Jersey, near the Atlantic coast.


      3. **Determine the directional relationship**: To determine if Never Summer
      Mountains are north of Navesink Highlands, we need to understand their relative
      positions. Colorado is a western state, and New Jersey is an eastern state.
      The Never Summer Mountains are in northern Colorado, which places them north
      of the Navesink Highlands in New Jersey, considering the general layout of the
      United States.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations, the Never Summer Mountains
      in Colorado are indeed north of the Navesink Highlands in New Jersey. The Navesink
      Highlands are located in the eastern part of New Jersey, which is east of Colorado,
      placing the Never Summer Mountains north of them.

      Cass County is in the north-central part of the state.


      2. **Location of Woman Lake**: Woman Lake is also in Minnesota but is specifically
      located in the Chippewa National Forest in Cass County.


      3. **Comparing Locations**: To determine if Ten Mile Lake is north of Woman
      Lake, we need to understand the geography of the region. Since both lakes are
      in Cass County, Minnesota, they are relatively close to each other.


      However, without more specific information about their exact locations within
      the county, it''s challenging to determine which one is definitively north of
      the other. Both lakes are in the same county, which suggests they are at similar
      latitudes.


      Given the information, we cannot definitively say if Ten Mile Lake is north
      of Woman Lake. They are in the same county, but without more precise location
      details, the answer would be:


      $\boxed{UNDECIDABLE}$

      the locations of Ten Mile Lake (Cass County, Minnesota) and Woman Lake, and
      then compare their positions.


      1. **Location of Ten Mile Lake (Cass County, Minnesota)**: Ten Mile Lake is
      located in Cass County, Minnesota. Cass County is in the northern part of the
      state, near the Canadian border. This places Ten Mile Lake in the northern region
      of Minnesota.


      2. **Location of Woman Lake**: Woman Lake is also located in Minnesota, but
      it''s in the central part of the state. This places it south of Cass County,
      where Ten Mile Lake is located.


      3. **Comparing Locations**: To determine if Ten Mile Lake is north of Woman
      Lake, we need to understand the geography of Minnesota. Cass County, being in
      the northern part of the state, places Ten Mile Lake in a more northerly position
      than Woman Lake, which is in the central region.


      Given these considerations, Ten Mile Lake (Cass County, Minnesota) is generally
      north of Woman Lake, considering their positions within the state of Minnesota.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      of Colorado, which is east of California.


      3. **Determine the directional relationship**: To determine if Honey Lake is
      north of Shadow Mountain Lake, we need to understand their relative positions.
      California is west of Colorado, so Honey Lake is generally west of Shadow Mountain
      Lake, not directly north or south.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations, Honey Lake, CA, is not
      north of Shadow Mountain Lake, CO. Instead, it is more westward. The lakes''
      locations are such that Honey Lake is west of Shadow Mountain Lake, considering

      in the northern part of the United States but generally east of Wisconsin.


      6. **Comparison**: Without exact latitudes, we know both lakes are in the northern
      part of the United States. However, to say one is definitively north of the
      other, we''d ideally compare their exact latitudes. Given their general locations,
      Lake Winnebago is west and slightly north of Lake Lila, considering the layout
      of the states.


      Based on these steps and understanding that Lake Winnebago is slightly north
      and west of Lake Lila due to the geography of the United States, the answer
      is:


      YES'

      3. **Compare the Positions**: Both Lake Phalen and Como Lake are in the same
      general area, the Twin Cities. However, they are not in the same city. Lake
      Phalen is in Saint Paul, while Como Lake is in Minneapolis.


      4. **Determine the Directional Relationship**: Saint Paul is generally east
      of Minneapolis. Therefore, Lake Phalen, being in Saint Paul, is east of Como
      Lake, which is in Minneapolis.


      Given these steps and considering the general geography of the Twin Cities,
      Lake Phalen is not north of Como Lake. Instead, it is east of Como Lake.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      3. **Comparing Locations**: To determine if Cedar Lake is north of Lake Delton,
      we need to understand the geography of the region. New York is an eastern state,
      and Wisconsin is a Midwestern state. This means that Lake Delton is generally
      west of Cedar Lake. However, the question asks specifically about the north-south
      relationship.


      4. **North-South Relationship**: Both New York and Wisconsin are northern states
      in the United States. However, given their east-west positioning, Lake Delton
      is not significantly north or south of Cedar Lake. It is more to the west.


      Given these considerations, Cedar Lake (New York) is generally east of Lake
      Delton, considering their positions relative to their respective states. Therefore,
      Cedar Lake is not north of Lake Delton.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Camel''s
      Hump and Lower Saranac Lake. Camel''s Hump is a mountain in Vermont, and Lower
      Saranac Lake is a lake in New York.


      2. **Geographical Positions**: Next, we should understand their geographical
      positions relative to each other. Generally, in the northeastern United States,
      locations further north are closer to the Canadian border, while those further
      south are closer to the New York City area.


      3. **Compare Latitude**: To compare their positions accurately, we can look
      at their latitudes. Latitude is a measure of how far north or south a place
      is. A higher latitude indicates a location is further north.


      4. **Camel''s Hump Latitude**: Camel''s Hump, being in Vermont, is relatively
      north in the United States.


      5. **Lower Saranac Lake Latitude**: Lower Saranac Lake, situated in New York,
      is also relatively north but not as far north as Camel''s Hump.


      6. **Comparison**: Without exact latitudes, we know both locations are in the
      northern part of the United States. However, to say one is definitively north
      of the other, we''d ideally compare their exact latitudes. Given their general
      locations, Camel''s Hump, VT, is indeed north of Lower Saranac Lake, NY, considering

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We have two locations: Soda Lake (San Bernardino
      County) in California and Lake Tuendae in California. Soda Lake is a dry lake
      bed in the Mojave Desert, while Lake Tuendae is a small lake near the town of
      Tuendae.


      2. **Understand the geography**: Soda Lake is in the Mojave Desert, which is
      in southeastern California. Lake Tuendae is in the southern part of California,
      but it''s not as far east as Soda Lake. California is a long state, so locations
      can be quite distant from each other.


      3. **Determine the directional relationship**: To say if Soda Lake is north
      of Lake Tuendae, we need to understand their relative positions. Since Soda
      Lake is in the Mojave Desert, which is in southeastern California, and Lake
      Tuendae is in southern California but not as far east, Soda Lake is more to
      the east of Lake Tuendae.

      state, and Lake Worth is in Texas, a southern U.S. state.


      2. **Geographical Positions**: Generally, in the United States, locations further
      north are closer to the Canadian border, while those further south are closer
      to the Mexican border. Arizona and Texas are both southern states.


      3. **Compare Latitude**: To compare their positions accurately, we can look

      is. A higher latitude indicates a location is further north.


      4. **Imperial Reservoir Latitude**: Imperial Reservoir, being in Arizona, is

      3. **Consider the Latitude**: To determine if a location is north or south,
      we typically consider its latitude. However, in this case, due to the layout
      of the states, it''s not a simple north-south comparison. Arizona, while generally

      located north of Lizard Pond (New York), NY, let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Honnedaga Lake is located in the Adirondack Mountains
      in Hamilton County, New York. Lizard Pond is also in New York, but its exact
      location is not specified.


      2. **Geographical Positions**: Generally, in New York, locations further north
      are closer to the Canadian border, while those further south are closer to New
      York City and the New Jersey border.


      3. **Compare Latitude**: To compare their positions accurately, we can look
      at their latitudes. Latitude is a measure of how far north or south a place
      is. A higher latitude indicates a location is further north.


      4. **Honnedaga Lake Latitude**: Honnedaga Lake, being in Hamilton County, which
      is in the Adirondack Mountains, is relatively north in New York.


      5. **Lizard Pond Latitude**: Without a specific location for Lizard Pond, we
      can''t compare its latitude directly. However, since it''s also in New York,
      it''s likely to be at a similar or slightly different latitude from Honnedaga
      Lake, considering New York''s geography.


      6. **Comparison**: Given the general locations and without exact latitudes,
      Honnedaga Lake is likely north or at a similar latitude to Lizard Pond, considering
      the layout of New York''s counties and lakes.


      Based on these steps and understanding that Honnedaga Lake is likely north or
      at a similar latitude to Lizard Pond due to New York''s geography, the answer

      1. **Location of Misquah Hills, MN**: Misquah Hills are located in northeastern
      Minnesota, specifically in the Superior National Forest. This places them in
      the northern part of the state, close to the Canadian border.


      2. **Location of Swan Lake, MT**: Swan Lake is located in the Flathead National
      Forest in northwestern Montana. This places it in the western part of the state,

      Swan Lake is a lake in Montana.


      2. **Geographical Positions**: Next, we should understand their geographical
      positions relative to each other. Generally, in the United States, locations
      further north are closer to Canada, while those further south are closer to
      Mexico.


      3. **Compare Latitude**: To compare their positions accurately, we can look
      at their latitudes. Latitude is a measure of how far north or south a place
      is. A higher latitude indicates a location is further north.


      4. **Misquah Hills Latitude**: Misquah Hills, being in Minnesota, is relatively
      north in the United States.


      5. **Swan Lake Latitude**: Swan Lake, situated in Montana, is also in the northern

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We have two locations - Black Lake (New York)
      and Oregon Coast Range. Black Lake is located in the state of New York, and
      the Oregon Coast Range is a mountain range in the state of Oregon.


      2. **Understand the geography**: Black Lake is situated in the northern part
      of New York, which places it in the northeastern United States. The Oregon Coast
