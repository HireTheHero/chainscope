    90832ea8-6129-4b77-b961-4e2b45c41c70: '1. **Locate Warm Lake, ID:**  Warm Lake
      is in west-central Idaho, generally north and slightly east of Boise.

      the border with Montana and west of Yellowstone National Park.

      Lake, simply being "north of Boise" doesn''t automatically place it north of
      Henrys Lake.  I need to determine if Warm Lake''s more northerly latitude is
      enough to put it above Henrys Lake, despite being further west.  A map is needed
      for accuracy.

      is indeed north of Henrys Lake.

      2. **Locate Swan Lake, MT:** Swan Lake is in northwestern Montana, relatively
      close to the border with Canada.


      3. **Compare latitudes:**  Generally, places further north have higher latitudes.  Since
      both locations are near the US/Canada border, we need to determine which is
      further east/west. Minnesota is east of Montana.  Lines of latitude run horizontally,
      so the more northerly a location, the higher the latitude.  The question becomes
      is the change in longitude between the two locations enough to make Swan Lake
      further north than Misquah Hills?


      4. **Consider the curvature of the Earth:** Because the earth is a globe, lines
      of longitude converge as you get closer to the poles.  This means that the east/west
      distance between Minnesota and Montana is significantly less at their northern
      borders than it would be further south.  Thus, the change in longitude is not
      enough to compensate for the position of Minnesota being east of Montana and
      therefore at a more southerly latitude.


      5. **Conclusion:** Misquah Hills, being considerably east of Swan Lake, is likely
      at a lower latitude, meaning it''s further south.

      of a location in Montana. We need to consider how far east Minnesota is compared
      to how far north Swan Lake is. A quick look at a map shows that while Misquah
      Hills is quite north, it''s not far enough north to overcome the eastward shift
      from Montana.


      4. **Conclusion:** Misquah Hills, despite being in northern Minnesota, is  *not*
      north of Swan Lake, MT.

    655d7133-3816-4979-b2d3-d450703d3072: '1. **Locate Misquah Hills, MN:** Misquah
      Hills is in northeastern Minnesota, near the border with Canada.


      2. **Locate Swan Lake, MT:** Swan Lake is in northwestern Montana, near the
      border with Canada.


      3. **Compare latitudes:**  Generally, places further north have higher latitudes.  Since
      both locations are near the US/Canada border, we need to determine which state''s
      border with Canada is further north.  Minnesota''s northern border is further
      north than Montana''s.


      4. **Conclusion:** Since Misquah Hills is in Minnesota and Swan Lake is in Montana,
      and Minnesota extends further north than Montana, Misquah Hills is likely north
      of Swan Lake.

      higher latitude (further north) than Montana''s northern border.


      4. **Determine north/south relationship:** Since Minnesota is further north

      2. **Locate Swan Lake, MT:** Swan Lake is in northwestern Montana, near the
      border with Canada.


      3. **Compare latitudes:**  Minnesota is generally east of Montana.  Therefore,
      simply being "north" geographically doesn''t automatically mean a higher latitude.
      We need to consider their relative positions east/west as well. While Misquah
      Hills is north *relative to the central US*, it''s east of Swan Lake. Swan Lake,
      despite being further west, is at a much higher latitude than northeastern Minnesota.


      4. **Conclusion:** Misquah Hills, though appearing "north" on a map, is actually
      at a lower latitude than Swan Lake, MT.

      2. **Locate Swan Lake, MT:** Swan Lake is in northwestern Montana, also relatively
      near the US-Canada border.


      3. **Compare latitudes:**  Generally, places further north have higher latitudes.
      Since both are near the US-Canada border, we need to determine which is further
      east or west as lines of latitude bend. Minnesota is east of Montana. Therefore,
      even if they are at roughly the same north/south level, a location further east
      will be further north on the globe.


      4. **Conclusion:** Misquah Hills, being in Minnesota and east of Swan Lake,
      Montana, is likely at a higher latitude.
