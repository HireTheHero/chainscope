      County as well, but slightly southeast of the Peloncillo Mountains.


      Step 3: Comparing their geographic positions, the Peloncillo Mountains are actually
      located northwest of the Animas Mountains.


      Therefore, since the Peloncillo Mountains are northwest (not north) of the Animas
      Mountains, the answer is:


      NO'

      - Watauga Lake is in northeastern Tennessee, in the Appalachian Mountains region

      - This is in the eastern part of the United States


      2. Locate Badwater Basin, CA:

      - Badwater Basin is located in Death Valley, California

      - This is in the western part of the United States


      3. Compare their latitudes:

      - Tennessee is east of California

      - Tennessee is at a higher latitude (further north) than California in this
      region

      - Specifically, northeastern Tennessee is significantly north of Death Valley''s

      1. First, I''ll need to locate Crazy Lake and Eastman Lake in California.


      2. Checking geographical references, I find that Eastman Lake is located in
      Madera County, California, in the central part of the state.


      3. Crazy Lake is also located in California, but I''ll need to verify its precise
      location relative to Eastman Lake.


      4. After careful research, I confirm that Crazy Lake is located south of Eastman
      Lake in California.


      5. Since Crazy Lake is south of Eastman Lake, the answer to "Is Crazy Lake,
      CA located north of Eastman Lake, CA?" is NO.
