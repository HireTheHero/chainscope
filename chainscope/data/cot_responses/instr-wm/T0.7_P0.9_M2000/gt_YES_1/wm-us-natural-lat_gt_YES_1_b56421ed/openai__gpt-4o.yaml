      1. **Lake Tonawanda**: This was a prehistoric lake in western New York, which
      no longer exists as a distinct lake today. It was located in the area that now
      includes parts of modern-day Erie and Niagara counties in New York.


      2. **Rock Lake, Wisconsin**: This is a real lake located in Jefferson County,
      Wisconsin. It is situated south of the city of Madison, WI.


      Now, let''s consider their relative positions:


      - **New York** is generally east of **Wisconsin**. However, to determine north
      or south, we need to compare latitudes.

      - Western New York, where Lake Tonawanda was located, is generally more northerly
      than the southern parts of Wisconsin.
