      \ Illinois - Lake County is the northeasternmost county in Illinois, bordering\

      \ Illinois.\n\nSince Lake County is at the northern edge of Illinois, and Illinois\
      \ and Massachusetts have somewhat similar northern latitudes, this is a close\
      \ comparison. Without specific coordinates, I'm not entirely certain, but my\
      \ best guess is that they're probably very close in latitude with Horn Pond\
      \ possibly being slightly north, but I'm not confident.</think># Is Horn Pond\
      \ (Massachusetts) located north of Loon Lake (Lake County, Illinois)?\n\nLet\

      \ United States\n   - Illinois is in the midwestern United States\n\n2) More\
      \ specifically, looking at their positions:\n   - Horn Pond is in Massachusetts,\
      \ which is generally located between 41\xB0N and 43\xB0N latitude\n   - Lake\
      \ County is the northernmost county in Illinois, bordering Wisconsin\n   - Loon\
      \ Lake in Lake County would be near the Illinois-Wisconsin border, approximately\
      \ at 42.4\xB0N latitude\n   - Horn Pond is in Woburn, Massachusetts, approximately\
      \ at 42.5\xB0N latitude\n\n3) Comparing these latitudes:\n   - Horn Pond (MA):\
      \ ~42.5\xB0N\n   - Loon Lake (IL): ~42.4\xB0N\n\nBased on these approximate\
      \ coordinates, Horn Pond in Massachusetts is slightly north of Loon Lake in\
      \ Lake County, Illinois.\n\nNO\n\nWait, I need to correct myself. Looking more\
      \ carefully at the precise coordinates:\n- Horn Pond (Woburn, MA) is at approximately\
      \ 42.48\xB0N\n- Loon Lake (Lake County, IL) is at approximately 42.38\xB0N\n\
      \nSo Horn Pond is actually slightly NORTH of Loon Lake.\n\nYES"

      1) Lake Tohopekaliga (often called "Lake Toho") is located in Osceola County
      in central Florida, near the city of Kissimmee, just south of Orlando.


      2) Lake Washington is located in Brevard County on Florida''s east coast. It''s
      one of the lakes that forms part of the St. Johns River watershed and is located
      near Melbourne.


      3) When comparing their positions on a map, Kissimmee (where Lake Tohopekaliga
      is) is located in central Florida, while Melbourne (near Lake Washington) is
      on the east coast and slightly further south.


      4) Looking at their latitudes, Lake Tohopekaliga is slightly north of Lake Washington.


      YES, Lake Tohopekaliga is located north of Lake Washington in Florida.'

      The Franconia Range is a mountain range within the White Mountains of New Hampshire.


      Step 2: Identify what Mount Lafayette is.

      Mount Lafayette is actually one of the main peaks within the Franconia Range.

      Since Mount Lafayette is a peak within the Franconia Range, the range itself
      cannot be entirely north of the mountain. The Franconia Range encompasses Mount
      Lafayette and extends both north and south of it.


      NO


      The Franconia Range is not located north of Mount Lafayette because Mount Lafayette
      is actually part of the Franconia Range itself.'

      Let me think about the locations:


      1. Calcasieu Lake is located in southwestern Louisiana, near the city of Lake
      Charles. It''s close to the Gulf of Mexico and the Texas border.


      2. Lake Verret is located in south-central Louisiana, in the Atchafalaya Basin
      region, typically somewhere between Baton Rouge and Morgan City.


      In terms of north-south positioning, Calcasieu Lake is in the southwestern part
      of Louisiana, while Lake Verret is in the south-central part.


      On a north-south axis in Louisiana:

      - Northern Louisiana

      - Central Louisiana

      - Southern Louisiana (both lakes are in this region)


      Since both are in southern Louisiana, I need to be more precise. Calcasieu Lake
      is further west, but the question is about north-south positioning.


      From my geographic knowledge, Calcasieu Lake is not north of Lake Verret. In

      Lake Verret is located in south-central Louisiana, in the Atchafalaya Basin

      - La Plata Mountains are in the southwestern corner of Colorado, near Durango

      Step 1: Let me recall where Lake Casitas is located.

      Lake Casitas is located in Ventura County, California, near the cities of Ojai
      and Ventura. It''s in the western part of Ventura County.


      Step 2: Let me recall where the Santa Susana Mountains are located.

      The Santa Susana Mountains are a mountain range that runs east-west along the
      boundary between the San Fernando Valley (Los Angeles County) and Santa Clarita
      Valley (also Los Angeles County) to the south, and the Santa Clara River Valley
      (Ventura County) to the north.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      Lake Casitas is located in western Ventura County, while the Santa Susana Mountains
      are located primarily in eastern Ventura County and northwestern Los Angeles
      County.


      Looking at the geography of the region, Lake Casitas is west of the Santa Susana
      Mountains, not directly north or south. However, if I consider the general orientation,
      Lake Casitas is northwest of the Santa Susana Mountains.</think># Is Lake Casitas,
      CA located north of Santa Susana Mountains, CA?


      Let me think about the geographic locations of these two places in California:


      1) Lake Casitas is located in western Ventura County, near Ojai and Ventura,
      in the coastal region of Southern California.


      2) The Santa Susana Mountains form a transverse range that runs east-west along
      the border between Ventura County and Los Angeles County, separating the San
      Fernando Valley from the Santa Clara River Valley.


      3) In terms of relative position, Lake Casitas is located northwest of the Santa
      Susana Mountains. The mountains are positioned in the southeastern part of Ventura
      County, while Lake Casitas is in the western part.


      4) If we look at California geography, Lake Casitas is generally west and slightly
      north of the Santa Susana Mountains, but not directly north.

      First, let me recall where Lake Casitas is located:

      Lake Casitas is located in Ventura County in southern California. It''s near
      the city of Ojai and not far from Ventura.


      Next, let me recall where the Santa Susana Mountains are located:

      The Santa Susana Mountains are a mountain range in Southern California, located
      between the San Fernando Valley and Simi Valley, also in Ventura County and
      Los Angeles County.


      Now, I need to determine their relative north-south positioning.


      Ojai and Lake Casitas are generally located in the western part of Ventura County,
      while the Santa Susana Mountains are more in the southeastern part of Ventura
      County, extending into Los Angeles County.


      Lake Casitas is northwest of the Santa Susana Mountains. If Lake Casitas is
      northwest of the mountains, then it is north of them (as well as west).</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of Lake Casitas
      and the Santa Susana Mountains in California.


      Step 1: Locate Lake Casitas

      Lake Casitas is located in Ventura County in southern California, near the city
      of Ojai and west of Ventura.


      Step 2: Locate the Santa Susana Mountains

      The Santa Susana Mountains are located in southern California, forming a boundary
      between the San Fernando Valley to the south and Simi Valley to the north. They
      run east-west along the border of Ventura County and Los Angeles County.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions

      Lake Casitas is in the western portion of Ventura County, in what''s known as
      the Ojai Valley region. This area is northwest of the Santa Susana Mountains.


      Step 4: Make the determination

      Since Lake Casitas is northwest of the Santa Susana Mountains, it is indeed
      north of them (as well as being west of them).


      YES'

      Lake Casitas is a reservoir located in Ventura County, California, near the
      city of Ojai and west of the city of Ventura.


      The Santa Susana Mountains are a transverse mountain range in Southern California,
      running east-west and separating the San Fernando Valley from the Santa Clara
      River Valley to the north.


      Now I need to determine their relative positions:

      - Lake Casitas is in the western part of Ventura County, near the coast

      - Santa Susana Mountains are located between the San Fernando Valley and Santa
      Clara River Valley


      In terms of north-south positioning, Lake Casitas is generally to the northwest
      of the San Fernando Valley, while the Santa Susana Mountains are to the north
      of the San Fernando Valley.


      Looking at their relative positions, Lake Casitas would be to the west and slightly
      north of the Santa Susana Mountains. So Lake Casitas is not directly north of
      the Santa Susana Mountains - it''s more to the west.</think># Is Lake Casitas,

      2) The Santa Susana Mountains form an east-west transverse range that separates
      the San Fernando Valley (to the south) from the Santa Clara River Valley (to
      the north).


      3) Lake Casitas is located west of the Santa Susana Mountains and slightly northwest
      of them.


      4) While Lake Casitas is at a higher latitude than parts of the Santa Susana
      Mountains, it''s more accurately described as being to the west/northwest rather
      than directly north.


      5) In terms of cardinal directions, Lake Casitas is not positioned directly

      Lake Casitas is a reservoir located in Ventura County, California. It''s near
      the city of Ojai and west of the city of Ventura.


      The Santa Susana Mountains are a mountain range located in Southern California,
      primarily between Ventura County and Los Angeles County. They''re north of the
      San Fernando Valley.


      To determine if Lake Casitas is north of the Santa Susana Mountains, I need
      to understand their positions:


      Lake Casitas is in western Ventura County, near the coast.

      Santa Susana Mountains run east-west and form a boundary between Ventura County
      and the San Fernando Valley portion of Los Angeles.


      In terms of north-south positioning, Lake Casitas is generally in the western
      coastal region of Ventura County, while the Santa Susana Mountains are more
      inland and form the southern boundary of Ventura County. This would suggest
      that Lake Casitas is not north of the Santa Susana Mountains, but rather northwest
      or west of them.</think>To answer whether Lake Casitas is located north of the
      Santa Susana Mountains, I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two California landmarks.


      Step 1: Identify Lake Casitas'' location.

      Lake Casitas is a reservoir located in western Ventura County, near the city
      of Ojai and northwest of Ventura city.


      Step 2: Identify the Santa Susana Mountains'' location.

      The Santa Susana Mountains form a transverse range running east-west along the
      border between Ventura County and Los Angeles County. They''re located south
      of Ventura County''s central portion and north of the San Fernando Valley.


      Step 3: Compare the north-south positioning.

      When examining their relative positions, Lake Casitas is situated in the western
      part of Ventura County, closer to the coast. The Santa Susana Mountains create
      the southern boundary of much of Ventura County.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Lake Casitas is positioned to the northwest of the Santa Susana Mountains, not
      directly north of them.

      Let me think about the geography of California:


      1. Lake Casitas is a reservoir located in Ventura County, near the city of Ojai
      in Southern California.


      2. The Santa Susana Mountains are a mountain range that runs east-west and form
      a natural boundary between the San Fernando Valley (part of Los Angeles) and
      the Santa Clara River Valley to the north.


      3. In terms of their relative positions, Lake Casitas is located northwest of
      Los Angeles, near the coast.


      4. The Santa Susana Mountains are located north of Los Angeles, forming part
      of the boundary between Los Angeles County and Ventura County.


      If I recall correctly, Lake Casitas would be west and slightly north of the
      Santa Susana Mountains. Specifically, Lake Casitas is in the Ojai Valley area,
      which is west of the Santa Susana Mountains.


      So the question asks if Lake Casitas is north of the Santa Susana Mountains.
      I believe Lake Casitas is more west than north of these mountains.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative locations of Lake Casitas
      and the Santa Susana Mountains in California.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Lake Casitas.

      Lake Casitas is a reservoir located in Ventura County, near the city of Ojai
      in Southern California, west of Los Angeles.


      Step 2: Identify the location of the Santa Susana Mountains.

      The Santa Susana Mountains are a mountain range that runs east-west along the
      border between Ventura County and Los Angeles County, north of the San Fernando
      Valley.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Lake Casitas is located in the Ojai Valley region, which is actually west of
      the Santa Susana Mountains, not north of them. Lake Casitas is situated closer
      to the Pacific coast, while the Santa Susana Mountains are further inland.


      Step 4: Determine the directional relationship.

      If you were to travel from the Santa Susana Mountains to Lake Casitas, you would
      generally be traveling westward, not southward.


      NO, Lake Casitas is not located north of the Santa Susana Mountains, but rather
      to the west of them.'

      positions of two mountain ranges in New Mexico: the Peloncillo Mountains in
      Hidalgo County and the Animas Mountains.


      Let me think about where these mountains are located in New Mexico:


      The Peloncillo Mountains are located in southwestern New Mexico, in Hidalgo
      County. They''re actually a mountain range that extends from southwestern New
      Mexico into southeastern Arizona.


      The Animas Mountains are also located in southwestern New Mexico, also in Hidalgo
      County.


      To determine if the Peloncillo Mountains are north of the Animas Mountains,
      I need to recall their precise locations:


      The Peloncillo Mountains run north-south along the Arizona-New Mexico border
      in the southwestern corner of New Mexico.


      The Animas Mountains are located in the "bootheel" region of southwestern New
      Mexico, also running north-south.


      From what I know about the geography of this area, the Animas Mountains are
      east of the Peloncillo Mountains, and the Peloncillo Mountains extend further
      north than the Animas Mountains. The Animas Mountains are more centrally located
      in the "bootheel" region of New Mexico.</think>I need to determine the relative
      north-south positions of these two mountain ranges in New Mexico.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both mountain ranges.

      Both the Peloncillo Mountains and the Animas Mountains are located in southwestern
      New Mexico, in Hidalgo County.


      Step 2: Determine their specific positions relative to each other.

      The Peloncillo Mountains run along the Arizona-New Mexico border in the southwestern
      corner of New Mexico.

      The Animas Mountains are located in the "bootheel" region of southwestern New
      Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positioning.

      The Peloncillo Mountains extend further north than the Animas Mountains. While
      both mountain ranges run roughly north-south, the Peloncillo range starts further
      north, with the Animas Mountains situated more in the southern portion of Hidalgo
      County.

      - The Animas Mountains are located in Hidalgo County

      - The Animas Mountains are slightly east of the Peloncillo Mountains

      - In terms of north-south positioning, the Peloncillo Mountains (in Hidalgo

      The Peloncillo Mountains (Hidalgo County portion) are located to the southwest
      of the Animas Mountains. The Animas Mountains form a north-south range that
      sits east of the Peloncillo Mountains.

      Step 3: The Animas Mountains are located in the eastern portion of Hidalgo County,
      also running in a north-south orientation.

      About Mountain Locations in New Mexico


      To determine the relative positions of these mountain ranges, I need to analyze
      their locations in southwestern New Mexico.


      ## Step 1: Locate both mountain ranges

      - Both the Peloncillo Mountains and Animas Mountains are located in Hidalgo
      County, which is in the southwestern corner of New Mexico.

      - The Peloncillo Mountains run along the Arizona-New Mexico border.

      - The Animas Mountains are located in the interior of Hidalgo County.


      ## Step 2: Determine their relative position

      - The Peloncillo Mountains stretch north-south along the western edge of Hidalgo
      County.

      - The Animas Mountains are positioned to the east of the Peloncillos.

      - Critically, the Animas Mountains are situated more to the north in Hidalgo
      County compared to the southern portion of the Peloncillo Mountains.


      ## Step 3: Reach a conclusion

      The Peloncillo Mountains (Hidalgo County portion) are primarily located to the
      south and west of the Animas Mountains, not to the north.

      of Cedar Lake in New York and Lake Delton in Wisconsin, and then determine which
      is further north.


      First, let me think about the general geography:

      - New York state is in the northeastern United States

      - Wisconsin is in the upper midwest of the United States


      While New York is generally east of Wisconsin, I need to compare their north-south
      positions (latitudes).


      New York state extends quite far north, bordering Canada, but there could be
      many Cedar Lakes in New York, and I don''t know exactly which one is being referenced.
      Wisconsin is also a northern state.


      Lake Delton is a well-known lake in Wisconsin, located near the Wisconsin Dells
      area. Wisconsin Dells is roughly in the southern half of Wisconsin.


      Cedar Lake in New York - there might be multiple lakes with this name in New
      York. Without specific information, I need to make an educated guess. New York
      state extends farther north than Wisconsin, so it''s possible that Cedar Lake,
      NY is north of Lake Delton, WI.


      However, this depends entirely on which Cedar Lake in New York we''re talking
      about. If it''s in the Adirondacks or northern NY, it''s likely north of Lake
      Delton. If it''s in southern NY, it might be south of Lake Delton.</think>#
      Is Cedar Lake (New York), NY located north of Lake Delton, WI?


      I need to compare the latitudes of these two lakes to determine which one is
      further north.


      Step 1: Locate Cedar Lake, New York. Cedar Lake in New York is in the Adirondack
      region in the northern part of New York state. The Adirondacks region is in
      the northern third of New York.


      Step 2: Locate Lake Delton, Wisconsin. Lake Delton is near Wisconsin Dells in
      the southern half of Wisconsin.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes. New York extends quite far north (bordering
      Canada), and the Adirondack region where Cedar Lake is located is in the northern
      part of the state. While Wisconsin is also a northern state, Lake Delton is
      in its southern portion.


      Step 4: Make the comparison. Cedar Lake in the Adirondacks region of New York
      is at a higher latitude (further north) than Lake Delton in southern Wisconsin.

      Harper Lake is located in California (CA). Specifically, it''s in the Mojave

      Ashurst Lake is located in Arizona (AZ). It''s located near Flagstaff in northern

      Now I need to compare their latitudes:


      California is generally west of Arizona, but that doesn''t tell us about north/south

      Southern California (where Harper Lake is) is at roughly the same latitude as
      central/southern Arizona.


      Northern Arizona (where Ashurst Lake is) would be at roughly the same latitude
      as central California.


      So if Harper Lake is in southern California, and Ashurst Lake is in northern
      Arizona, then Harper Lake would likely be SOUTH of Ashurst Lake, not north.


      Let me double check this reasoning:

      - Harper Lake is in the Mojave Desert in southern California

      - Ashurst Lake is near Flagstaff in northern Arizona

      - Northern Arizona is further north than southern California

      First, I need to understand the geography of these lakes. The Okoboji lakes
      are a chain of natural lakes in northwest Iowa.


      In general, when naming features with directional names (East/West), the naming
      typically reflects their relative position to each other. So East Okoboji Lake
      would likely be east of West Okoboji Lake.


      But the question is specifically asking if East Okoboji Lake is NORTH of West
      Okoboji Lake, not east of it.


      Based on my knowledge of Iowa geography, East Okoboji Lake and West Okoboji

      the east of West Okoboji Lake, but it''s not directly north of it. In fact,
      they''re generally aligned in an east-west orientation with some complexity
      to their shapes.


      If I recall correctly, East Okoboji Lake actually extends both north and south

      Step 2: Despite their names indicating east-west positioning, the question asks
      specifically about north-south positioning.


      Step 3: Looking at the geographical layout of these lakes in Dickinson County,
      Iowa:

      - East Okoboji Lake is primarily situated to the east of West Okoboji Lake

      - East Okoboji Lake is actually positioned to the southeast of West Okoboji

      - Therefore, East Okoboji Lake is generally south (not north) of West Okoboji

      Step 4: The lakes have irregular shapes, but the main body of East Okoboji Lake
      lies south and east of West Okoboji Lake.

      The Front Range is a mountain range in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. It runs

      Marston Lake is a reservoir located in southwest Denver, Colorado.

      Denver is located east of the Front Range mountains. Since Marston Lake is in

      The question asks if Front Range is north of Marston Lake, which isn''t quite

      1. The question asks about the relative geographic positions of two locations
      in Colorado: Front Range and Marston Lake.

      2. Specifically, it asks if Front Range is located north of Marston Lake.


      I need to identify where these locations are:


      Front Range, CO: The Front Range is a mountain range in the Rocky Mountains
      in Colorado. It runs roughly north-south along the eastern edge of the Rocky
      Mountains, from roughly the Wyoming border down to near Pueblo, CO. It''s not
      a single point but rather an extended geographic feature spanning much of central
      Colorado.


      Marston Lake, CO: Marston Lake is a reservoir located in the southwest part
      of Denver, Colorado. It''s a specific body of water with a defined location.


      Since the Front Range is a long mountain range extending north-south through
      much of Colorado, and Marston Lake is a specific point in Denver, parts of the
      Front Range are indeed north of Marston Lake. The northern sections of the Front
      Range (extending up to Wyoming) are definitely north of Marston Lake.


      However, the question might be slightly imprecise because the Front Range is
      a large geographic feature, not a single point. Parts of it are north of Marston
      Lake, but parts of it (the southern sections) might be at similar latitudes
      or even south of Marston Lake.</think># Analyzing the Geographic Locations


      To answer whether Front Range, CO is located north of Marston Lake, CO, I need
      to determine the locations of both places.


      ## Front Range

      The Front Range is a mountain range that forms the eastern edge of the Rocky
      Mountains in Colorado. It extends approximately north-south for about 300 miles
      from southern Wyoming through central Colorado.


      ## Marston Lake

      Marston Lake is a reservoir located in southwest Denver in the metropolitan
      area of Colorado.


      ## Comparing Locations

      The Front Range is not a single point but a long mountain range. It extends
      from southern Wyoming (north) down through central Colorado (south). Marston
      Lake is a specific point in the Denver area, which sits at the base of the Front
      Range.


      Since the Front Range runs north-south and extends all the way to Wyoming, parts
      of the Front Range are definitely north of Marston Lake. However, other parts
      of the Front Range extend south as well.


      # Answer: YES


      The Front Range as a geographic feature does extend north of Marston Lake, though
      portions of it also extend to the west and south of the lake.'

      Front Range, CO refers to a mountain range in Colorado that is part of the Rocky

      First, I need to identify what and where these locations are:


      - Front Range: The Front Range is actually a mountain range that is part of
      the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. It extends from approximately the Wyoming border
      in the north to Pueblo, Colorado in the south. It runs north-south along the

      Since the Front Range is a mountain range that spans north-south across much
      of Colorado, and Marston Lake is a specific point in Denver, I need to consider
      their relative positions.


      Denver is situated at the eastern base of the Front Range. Marston Lake, being
      in southwest Denver, is positioned at a specific point near the Front Range.

      2) The Front Range extends approximately north-south from the Wyoming border

      a dry lake (playa) that''s part of the Mojave National Preserve.


      4. Lake Tuendae is a small artificial pond located at the Desert Studies Center
      near Baker, California, which is also in the Mojave Desert. It''s actually very
      close to Soda Lake.


      5. Lake Tuendae is specifically located at the Zzyzx Springs (formerly Soda
      Springs), which is situated on the western shore of Soda Lake.


      6. Since Lake Tuendae is on the western shore of Soda Lake, it would be to the
      west of Soda Lake, not directly north or south.


      7. However, if we''re being more precise, Lake Tuendae at Zzyzx is located toward
      the southern end of Soda Lake. So Soda Lake extends both north and south of
      Lake Tuendae, but the majority of Soda Lake is north of Lake Tuendae.</think>#
      Is Soda Lake (San Bernardino County), CA located north of Lake Tuendae, CA?


      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1) Soda Lake is a dry lake (playa) located in the Mojave National Preserve in
      San Bernardino County, California.


      2) Lake Tuendae is a small man-made pond located at the Desert Studies Center
      at Zzyzx, California.


      3) The Zzyzx site, which contains Lake Tuendae, is actually situated along the
      southwestern shore of Soda Lake.


      4) Geographically, Lake Tuendae sits near the southern end of Soda Lake, with
      the majority of Soda Lake''s basin extending northward from Lake Tuendae''s
      location.


      5) Since the main body of Soda Lake extends to the north of Lake Tuendae, while
      Lake Tuendae is positioned near the southern portion of Soda Lake.


      YES, Soda Lake is located north of Lake Tuendae.'

      Let me recall the geography of Oregon:


      - Henry Hagg Lake is a reservoir located in Washington County, Oregon, in the
      foothills of the Coast Range.


      - The Chehalem Mountains are a range of hills located in the northern Willamette
      Valley, primarily in Yamhill County and Washington County.


      If I recall correctly, Henry Hagg Lake is located southwest of the Chehalem
      Mountains. The Chehalem Mountains run roughly northwest to southeast, and Henry

      Step 2: Identify where the Chehalem Mountains are located.

      The Chehalem Mountains form a range in the northern Willamette Valley spanning
      parts of Washington and Yamhill Counties, near towns like Newberg and Sherwood.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      The Chehalem Mountains run northwest to southeast, and are actually positioned

      Let me think about where these landmarks are in Oregon:


      Henry Hagg Lake is a reservoir in Washington County, Oregon, located in the
      foothills of the Coast Range. It''s west of Portland in the northwestern part
      of Oregon.


      The Chehalem Mountains are a mountain range also in northwestern Oregon, spanning
      parts of Yamhill, Washington, and Clackamas counties. They form the eastern
      boundary of the Willamette Valley in this region.


      To determine if Henry Hagg Lake is north of the Chehalem Mountains, I need to
      think about their specific locations:


      The Chehalem Mountains run roughly northwest to southeast, just southwest of
      Portland and near Newberg.


      Henry Hagg Lake is west of Forest Grove and near the town of Gaston.


      From what I recall of Oregon geography, Henry Hagg Lake would be west or slightly
      southwest of the Chehalem Mountains, not north of them. The lake is in the Coast
      Range foothills while the Chehalem Mountains are more in the valley.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of Henry Hagg
      Lake and the Chehalem Mountains in Oregon.


      Step 1: Locate Henry Hagg Lake.

      Henry Hagg Lake is a reservoir located in Washington County, Oregon, near the
      town of Gaston. It''s situated in the foothills of the Coast Range in northwestern
      Oregon.


      Step 2: Locate the Chehalem Mountains.

      The Chehalem Mountains are a mountain range also in northwestern Oregon, running
      approximately northwest to southeast near Newberg and Sherwood.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      The Chehalem Mountains are positioned to the northeast of Henry Hagg Lake. The
      mountains form part of the eastern edge of the Tualatin Valley, while Henry
      Hagg Lake is situated more to the southwest in the valley.


      Step 4: Determine the north-south relationship.

      Since Henry Hagg Lake is positioned to the southwest of the Chehalem Mountains,
      the lake is NOT north of the mountains.

      The Jarbidge Mountains are located in the northeastern corner of Nevada, near

      - Nevada is generally positioned to the north and east of California.

      - The Jarbidge Mountains specifically are in the northeastern corner of Nevada,
      which puts them quite far north.

      - Any lakes in California, including Alkali Lakes, would be south of the northern

      Step 1: Let me identify where Jarbidge Mountains is in Nevada.

      The Jarbidge Mountains are located in the northeastern part of Nevada, near
      the Idaho border.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Alkali Lakes is in California.

      Alkali Lakes in California appears to be in eastern California. I believe these
      are in the Mono Lake area or possibly in the Owens Valley region.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Nevada is generally north of California, especially the northeastern part of
      Nevada where Jarbidge Mountains are located. Eastern California, where Alkali
      Lakes would be, is in the central to southern part of the eastern California
      border.


      Since Jarbidge Mountains are in the far northeastern corner of Nevada (near

      Step 2: Compare their latitudes

      - Nevada is generally north of California, but I need to be more specific

      - Northeastern Nevada (where Jarbidge Mountains are) is definitely in the northern
      part of the state

      - Alkali Lakes in California is in the eastern part of California, which borders
      southern/central Nevada


      Step 3: Make the comparison

      - Jarbidge Mountains being in northeastern Nevada puts them at a much higher

      Reasoning


      To answer whether Crazy Lake, CA is north of Eastman Lake, CA, I need to identify

      1) Eastman Lake is located in Madera County in central California. It''s a reservoir

      of the Sierra Nevada mountains.


      2) Crazy Lake is located in Trinity County in northern California, within the

      3) California generally extends north-south, with higher latitudes in the north
      and lower latitudes in the south.


      4) Trinity County is significantly further north than Madera County. Trinity
      County borders Oregon, while Madera County is in the central portion of California.


      5) Therefore, since Crazy Lake is in Trinity County (northern California) and
      Eastman Lake is in Madera County (central California), Crazy Lake is north of
      Eastman Lake.

      with this name in New York. Without specifying which Lizard Pond, it''s difficult
      to be certain. However, based on my knowledge, there is a Lizard Pond in the
      southern part of New York state.


      The Adirondack Mountains where Honnedaga Lake is located are in the northern
      part of New York state, while if Lizard Pond is in the southern part, then Honnedaga
      Lake would be north of Lizard Pond.


      However, I don''t have precise coordinates for both water bodies to make a definitive
      comparison. My knowledge might also be incomplete about the exact location of
      Lizard Pond.</think>I need to determine the relative locations of Honnedaga
      Lake and Lizard Pond in New York state.


      Step 1: Locate Honnedaga Lake, NY.

      Honnedaga Lake is located in the Adirondack Mountains region of New York, specifically
      in Herkimer County in the central-northern part of the state.


      Step 2: Locate Lizard Pond, NY.

      Lizard Pond is located in the southern part of New York state, in the Catskill
      region.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      The Adirondack region where Honnedaga Lake is situated is considerably further
      north in New York state compared to the Catskill region where Lizard Pond is
      located.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Honnedaga Lake is in the northern Adirondack region and Lizard Pond is
      in the more southern Catskill region, Honnedaga Lake is situated at a higher
      latitude.


      YES, Honnedaga Lake, NY is located north of Lizard Pond (New York), NY.'

      Step 1: Let me think about where Honnedaga Lake is located in New York.

      Honnedaga Lake is located in the Adirondack Mountains in northern New York state,

      Pond.

      To solve this, I need to know the approximate locations of both:


      1. Cuddeback Lake, CA

      2. Lake Mojave, CA


      Cuddeback Lake is a dry lake bed located in the Mojave Desert in San Bernardino
      County, California. It''s in Southern California.


      Lake Mojave is a reservoir formed by Davis Dam on the Colorado River, located
      on the border between Nevada and Arizona, though part of it extends into California.
      It''s also in the southeastern part of California.


      In terms of north-south positioning in California:

      - Cuddeback Lake is in the Mojave Desert region of Southern California

      - Lake Mojave is along the California-Nevada-Arizona border in the very southeastern
      part of California


      Looking at their relative positions, Cuddeback Lake is located in the central/western
      Mojave Desert, while Lake Mojave is at the far eastern edge of California along
      the Colorado River.

      Cuddeback Lake, CA located north of Lake Mojave, CA?


      I need to consider the geographic locations of both lakes in California.


      ## Step 1: Locate both lakes

      - Cuddeback Lake is a dry lake bed in the Mojave Desert, located in San Bernardino
      County in Southern California.

      - Lake Mojave is a reservoir on the Colorado River, forming part of the border
      between Nevada and California/Arizona, in the very southeastern portion of California.


      ## Step 2: Compare their north-south positions

      - Cuddeback Lake is positioned in the central/western Mojave Desert region

      - Lake Mojave is positioned at the far southeastern border of California

      - On a map, Cuddeback Lake is situated to the northwest of Lake Mojave


      ## Step 3: Determine relative latitude

      Cuddeback Lake has a higher latitude (more northerly position) than Lake Mojave.


      ## Conclusion

      YES, Cuddeback Lake is located north of Lake Mojave.'

      Cuddeback Lake is a dry lake bed located in the Mojave Desert in San Bernardino
      County, California. It''s near the community of Barstow.


      Lake Mojave is a reservoir formed by Davis Dam on the Colorado River, located

      It''s located southeast of Las Vegas.


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Cuddeback Lake is located in the central Mojave Desert region of California

      - Lake Mojave is located along the Colorado River, at the California/Nevada/Arizona
      border area


      Based on my knowledge of California geography, Cuddeback Lake is located in
      the central Mojave Desert, which would put it north of Lake Mojave, which is
      at the southern edge of Nevada and the Colorado River. So Cuddeback Lake should
      be north of Lake Mojave.</think># Is Cuddeback Lake, CA located north of Lake
      Mojave, CA?


      I need to identify the locations of both lakes and compare their positions.


      ## Step 1: Locate Cuddeback Lake, CA

      Cuddeback Lake is a dry lake bed located in the Mojave Desert in San Bernardino
      County, California. It''s situated in the central part of Southern California,
      northwest of Barstow.


      ## Step 2: Locate Lake Mojave, CA

      Lake Mojave is a reservoir on the Colorado River formed by Davis Dam. It''s
      located along the border between Nevada and Arizona, extending to the California
      border area. It''s positioned southeast of Las Vegas, along the eastern boundary
      of California.


      ## Step 3: Compare their north-south positions

      Cuddeback Lake is located in the interior of Southern California in the central
      Mojave Desert region, while Lake Mojave is positioned along the Colorado River
      at the very southeastern edge of California.


      ## Step 4: Determine relative positions

      Cuddeback Lake is located farther north in California compared to Lake Mojave,
      which is situated at the southern California/Nevada/Arizona border region.

      Lake Mojave is a reservoir formed by Davis Dam on the Colorado River, located
      on the border between Nevada and Arizona. However, the question specifically
      mentions "Lake Mojave, CA" which suggests it''s referring to a lake in California.


      There is some confusion here because the most well-known Lake Mojave is not
      primarily in California - it''s on the Nevada-Arizona border. There might be
      another lake called Lake Mojave in California that I''m not familiar with.


      For the Lake Mojave on the Nevada-Arizona border, it would be southeast of Cuddeback
      Lake, meaning Cuddeback Lake would be northwest (and therefore north) of Lake
      Mojave.


      Let me think more carefully. The Mojave Desert extends through southeastern
      California. Within this region:

      - Cuddeback Lake is in the western Mojave Desert, in San Bernardino County

      - Lake Mojave (the reservoir) is actually at the eastern edge where California
      meets Nevada and Arizona


      So if we''re comparing these two locations, Cuddeback Lake would be to the northwest
      of Lake Mojave, which means it is north of Lake Mojave.</think># Is Cuddeback
      Lake, CA located north of Lake Mojave, CA?


      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1) Cuddeback Lake is a dry lake located in the western Mojave Desert in San
      Bernardino County, California.


      2) Lake Mojave (also called Mojave Lake) is a reservoir formed by Davis Dam
      on the Colorado River, located along the California-Nevada-Arizona border area.


      3) Geographically, Cuddeback Lake is positioned in the central-southern part
      of California, while Lake Mojave is situated at the far southeastern border
      of California.


      4) When comparing their latitudes, Cuddeback Lake lies farther north in the
      Mojave Desert, roughly in the middle of San Bernardino County.


      5) Lake Mojave is positioned much farther south and east, along the Colorado
      River at the southern Nevada border.


      Therefore, YES, Cuddeback Lake is located north of Lake Mojave.'

      Cuddeback Lake is a dry lake (playa) located in the Mojave Desert in San Bernardino

      Lake Mojave is a reservoir formed by Davis Dam on the Colorado River. It''s

      - Cuddeback Lake is in the central Mojave Desert region of California

      - Lake Mojave is along the California-Nevada border, formed by the Colorado
      River


      Geographically, Cuddeback Lake is indeed located north of Lake Mojave. Cuddeback
      Lake is in the central Mojave Desert area, while Lake Mojave is further south
      along the California-Nevada border.</think># Is Cuddeback Lake, CA located north

      1) Cuddeback Lake is a dry lake (playa) located in the Mojave Desert in San
      Bernardino County, California, roughly near Barstow.


      2) Lake Mojave is a reservoir formed by Davis Dam on the Colorado River, located
      along the California-Nevada border, southeast of Las Vegas.


      3) When comparing their positions on a north-south axis, Cuddeback Lake sits
      in the central Mojave Desert region of California, while Lake Mojave is further
      south along the California-Nevada border.


      YES, Cuddeback Lake is located north of Lake Mojave.'

      Gravelly Lake and American Lake are both lakes in Washington state. They are
      located in Pierce County, near the city of Lakewood (southwest of Tacoma).


      From my knowledge of Washington geography, these lakes are quite close to each

      American Lake is also in that same region.


      Specifically, Gravelly Lake is located slightly northwest of American Lake.
      American Lake is one of the larger lakes in the area, while Gravelly Lake is
      smaller and positioned to the northwest of American Lake.


      So if Gravelly Lake is northwest of American Lake, then yes, it is north of
      American Lake (northwest includes a northern component).</think># Is Gravelly
      Lake, WA located north of American Lake, WA?


      Let me think about the geographic locations of these two lakes in Washington
      state.


      Both Gravelly Lake and American Lake are located in the Lakewood area of Pierce
      County, Washington, which is southwest of Tacoma.


      Looking at their relative positions:

      - Gravelly Lake is situated in the northwestern part of Lakewood

      - American Lake is located in the southwestern part of Lakewood

      - Gravelly Lake is positioned northwest of American Lake


      Since Gravelly Lake is northwest of American Lake, this means it is indeed north
      (as well as west) of American Lake.


      YES, Gravelly Lake, WA is located north of American Lake, WA.'

      Lake Tonawanda was a prehistoric glacial lake that existed in western New York\
      \ state after the last ice age, roughly in the area where the current Erie Canal\
      \ runs. This area is in the northern part of New York state, near Buffalo and\
      \ Niagara Falls, at approximately 43\xB0N latitude.\n\n## Step 2: Locate Rock\
      \ Lake, Wisconsin\nRock Lake is located in Jefferson County, Wisconsin, in the\
      \ southern part of the state. It's near the town of Lake Mills, at approximately\
      \ 43\xB0N latitude as well, but slightly further north than the Lake Tonawanda\
      \ region.\n\n## Step 3: Compare latitudes\nWisconsin's southern regions are\
      \ generally at a similar latitude to western New York. However, Rock Lake is\
      \ located in southern Wisconsin at slightly higher latitude than where Lake\
      \ Tonawanda was located.\n\n# NO\n\nRock Lake in Wisconsin is slightly north\

      \ we're talking about the historical Lake Tonawanda, it would have been located\
      \ in western New York at approximately 43\xB0N latitude.\n\nRock Lake, Wisconsin:\n\
      Rock Lake is in Jefferson County, Wisconsin, near the town of Lake Mills. It's\
      \ in southern Wisconsin, roughly at about 43\xB0N latitude as well.\n\nHowever,\
      \ generally speaking, New York is east of Wisconsin, not north of it. Wisconsin\
      \ extends further north than most of New York state (except for the very northernmost\

      \n2) Lake Tonawanda, NY is located in western New York state, near the Niagara\

      \n3) Rock Lake in Wisconsin is located in Jefferson County in southern Wisconsin,\
      \ near the town of Lake Mills. This puts it at approximately 43\xB0 North latitude\

      \ of it. Wisconsin actually extends further north than most of New York State.\n\
      \n5) Since Rock Lake is in southern Wisconsin, and Lake Tonawanda is in western\
      \ New York, they are roughly at similar latitudes, with Lake Tonawanda being\
