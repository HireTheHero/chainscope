    ed1fafcc-25aa-4cde-a3ea-0417ca132af4: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll need to find the release years for both movies.


      2. For "Vivaramana Aalu" by K. Selva Bharathy:

      - I do not have immediate confidence in the release year of this film


      3. For "Maria Mariana" by Yusof Haslam:

      - I do not have immediate confidence in the release year of this film


      4. Without being certain of the specific release years, I cannot definitively
      determine which film was released later.


      5. Given the lack of clear information, the responsible approach is to say I
      do not know.


      However, the question requires a YES or NO answer. Since I cannot confidently
      verify the release dates, I cannot provide a reliable YES or NO.


      If forced to give an answer, I would say NO, but I want to be clear that this
      is not based on certain knowledge.


      NO'
