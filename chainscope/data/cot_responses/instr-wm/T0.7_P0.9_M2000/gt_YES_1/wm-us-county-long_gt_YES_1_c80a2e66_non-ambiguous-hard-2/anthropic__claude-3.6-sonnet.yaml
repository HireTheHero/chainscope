      1) Let me recall the general geography:

      - New York (NY) is in the northeastern United States

      - Texas (TX) is in the south-central United States


      2) In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New York state is entirely east of Texas

      - Therefore, any county in NY must be east of any county in TX


      3) Since Otsego County is in NY and Karnes County is in TX:

      - Otsego County must be east of Karnes County

      2) Now, let me think about the general east-west positioning of New York vs
      Texas:

      - New York is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Texas is much further west, bordering the Gulf of Mexico


      3) Since any county in New York state will be east of any county in Texas (due

      2. More specifically:

      - Steuben County is in western New York state

      3. When comparing east-west positions:

      - Even western New York is still east of Wisconsin

      - The entire state of New York lies east of Wisconsin

      - Therefore, any county in NY will be east of any county in WI

      1) First, I need to locate these counties roughly on a mental map:

      - Seminole County, FL is in central Florida, near Orlando

      - Bates County, MO is in western Missouri, near the Kansas border


      2) To determine east/west relationships, I can compare their relative positions:

      - Florida is clearly east of Missouri on the US map

      - Even western Florida is still east of eastern Missouri

      - Therefore, any point in Florida would be east of any point in Missouri


      3) Since Seminole County, FL is in Florida (regardless of its specific location
      within Florida), and Bates County, MO is in Missouri (regardless of its specific
      location within Missouri), the relationship holds.


      Therefore: YES, Seminole County, FL is located east of Bates County, MO.'
