      is located east of Hays County, TX, let''s go through the reasoning step by
      step:


      1. **Locate Hays County, TX**: Hays County is in central Texas. It is part of
      the Austin-Round Rock metropolitan area. Geographically, it lies in the central
      southern region of Texas.


      2. **Locate Russell County, AL**: Russell County is in the eastern part of Alabama.
      It borders the state of Georgia and is part of the Columbus, GA-AL Metropolitan
      Area. It lies along the eastern border of Alabama.


      3. **Compare Longitudes**: Texas is located to the west of Alabama. Central
      Texas, where Hays County is located, is significantly west of eastern Alabama.
      Since Russell County is in eastern Alabama, it''s much farther east than central
      Texas.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the geographic positions of these two counties, Russell
      County, AL is definitely located to the east of Hays County, TX.

      \n1. **Locate Champaign County, IL**:\n   - Champaign County is in the state\
      \ of Illinois.\n   - Illinois is located in the Midwestern region of the United\
      \ States.\n   - Champaign County is roughly in the east-central part of Illinois.\n\

      \ The key is to compare the longitudes of the two counties to see which one\
      \ is farther east.\n   - Illinois, including Champaign County, lies approximately\
      \ between 87\xB0W and 91\xB0W longitude.\n   - Massachusetts, including Plymouth\

      \ the longitudes**:\n   - Smaller longitude values (closer to 0\xB0) indicate\
      \ locations farther east.\n   - Therefore, 70\xB0W (Massachusetts) is east of\
      \ 87\xB0W (Illinois).\n\nConclusion:\nSince Plymouth County, MA is located in\

      **Step 1: Identify the location of Slope County, ND**

      - Slope County is in the southwestern part of North Dakota.

      - North Dakota is located in the northern central region of the United States,
      and Slope County is toward the western edge of the state.


      **Step 2: Identify the location of McNairy County, TN**

      - McNairy County is in the southwestern part of Tennessee.

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions**

      - North Dakota is generally farther west than Tennessee.

      - Specifically, Slope County is near the western border of North Dakota, close
      to the Montana border.

      - McNairy County, while in the western part of Tennessee, is still significantly
      farther east than Slope County.

      is located east of Musselshell County, MT, we need to consider their geographic
      locations within their respective states and relative to each other.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Musselshell County, Montana.

      - Musselshell County is located in central Montana. Montana is a western U.S.
      state.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Becker County, Minnesota.

      - Becker County is located in the western part of Minnesota. Minnesota is a
      Midwestern state, directly east of North Dakota, which is east of Montana.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions of Minnesota and Montana.

      - Minnesota is located to the east of Montana.


      Step 4: Even though Becker County is in western Minnesota and Musselshell is
      in central Montana, we need to determine if Becker is still east of Musselshell.


      - Western Minnesota is still significantly east of central Montana.

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States.

      - Yoakum County borders New Mexico and is in the Texas Panhandle-Plains region.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions.

      - Since Elliott County is in northeastern Kentucky and Yoakum County is in western
      Texas, Elliott County is significantly farther east in terms of longitude.


      Conclusion: Based on their geographic positions, Elliott County, KY is located
      east of Yoakum County, TX.

      the geographic positions of both counties within the United States.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Whatcom County, WA.

      - Whatcom County is in the far northwest corner of Washington state. It borders
      Canada and is near the Pacific Ocean. This means it is located in the far western
      part of the contiguous United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Charles Mix County, SD.

      - Charles Mix County is located in the southeastern part of South Dakota. South
      Dakota is well east of Washington state and is situated in the north-central
      region of the U.S., part of the Midwest.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions.

      - Washington state is on the west coast, while South Dakota is inland and to
      the east of Washington.

      is located east of Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma, we need to consider the relative
      geographic locations of the two counties based on their positions in the United
      States.


      **Step 1: Identify the location of Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma.**

      - Pottawatomie County is located in central Oklahoma. Oklahoma is in the south-central
      region of the United States.


      **Step 2: Identify the location of Dixie County, Florida.**

      - Dixie County is located in the northern part of Florida, along the Gulf Coast.
      Florida is in the southeastern region of the United States.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes of the two counties.**

      - Oklahoma is generally west of the Mississippi River.

      - Florida is entirely east of the Mississippi River.

      - Therefore, Dixie County, FL is significantly farther east than Pottawatomie
      County, OK.


      **Conclusion:**

      Since Florida is east of Oklahoma, and Dixie County is in Florida while Pottawatomie
      County is in Oklahoma, Dixie County, FL is located east of Pottawatomie County,
      OK.

      is located east of Sharkey County, Mississippi, we need to consider the relative
      geographic locations of the two counties in terms of longitude.


      Step 1: Locate Charles County, Maryland.

      - Charles County is located in the state of Maryland, which is on the East Coast
      of the United States.

      - Maryland is in the Eastern Time Zone and lies along the Atlantic Seaboard.


      Step 2: Locate Sharkey County, Mississippi.

      - Sharkey County is in the state of Mississippi, which is in the southeastern
      part of the United States but further inland than Maryland.

      - Mississippi is located to the west of Maryland and is in the Central Time
      Zone.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Maryland (including Charles County) lies significantly east of the Mississippi
      River.

      - Mississippi (including Sharkey County) lies west of the Mississippi River.

      - Thus, Charles County, MD is east of Sharkey County, MS in terms of longitude.

    c091c2fe-3a11-4bac-9f98-ba16c5360ac4: 'To determine whether Lenoir County, NC
      is located east of Pratt County, KS, we need to consider the relative geographic
      locations of the two counties within the United States.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Pratt County, KS.

      - Pratt County is located in the state of Kansas, which is in the central part
      of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lenoir County, NC.

      - Lenoir County is located in the state of North Carolina, which is in the southeastern
      region of the United States and lies along the Atlantic Coast.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions (east-west direction) of the two
      counties.

      - Kansas is west of North Carolina.

      - Therefore, any place in North Carolina, including Lenoir County, is east of
      any place in Kansas, including Pratt County.


      Conclusion:

      Since Lenoir County, NC is in North Carolina, and Pratt County, KS is in Kansas,
      and North Carolina is east of Kansas, Lenoir County is indeed east of Pratt
      County.
