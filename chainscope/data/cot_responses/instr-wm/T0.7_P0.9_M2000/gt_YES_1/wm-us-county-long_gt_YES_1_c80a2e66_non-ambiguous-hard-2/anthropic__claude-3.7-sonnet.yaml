      - NE stands for Nebraska, which is in the central part of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west positioning of these states.

      - North Carolina is significantly east of Nebraska in the United States.

      - States on the east coast (like North Carolina) are east of central states
      (like Nebraska).


      Step 3: Since counties are subdivisions within states, the east-west relationship
      between the states will generally determine the east-west relationship between
      counties in those states.

      - Any county in North Carolina would be east of any county in Nebraska.

      - Therefore, Bladen County, NC would be east of Frontier County, NE.

      the United States.

      - Texas is located in the southern part of the United States

      - Idaho is located in the northwestern part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning.

      - Texas is positioned in the central-to-eastern part of the country

      - Idaho is positioned in the western part of the country

      - Generally, Idaho is west of Texas

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Galax City is in Virginia (VA), which is on the eastern side of the United
      States.

      - Nueces County is in Texas (TX), which is in the southern central/southwestern
      part of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider their general positions.

      - Virginia is on the Atlantic coast in the eastern United States.

      - Texas is much further west, bordering the Gulf of Mexico in the south central
      United States.


      Step 3: Compare their approximate longitudes.

      - All of Virginia, including Galax City, lies east of all of Texas.

      - Nueces County, TX (which includes Corpus Christi) is on the Gulf Coast of
      Texas.

      - Any location in Virginia would be east of any location in Texas due to their
      positions in the continental United States.


      Therefore, Galax City, VA is indeed located east of Nueces County, TX.
