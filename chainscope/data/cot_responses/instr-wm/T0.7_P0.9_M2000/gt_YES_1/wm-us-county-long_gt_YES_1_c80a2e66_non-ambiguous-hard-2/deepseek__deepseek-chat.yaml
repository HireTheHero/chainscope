      3. **Compare their locations geographically**: West Virginia is significantly
      farther east than Louisiana. Specifically, Wetzel County, WV, is in the Eastern
      Time Zone, while Caddo Parish, LA, is in the Central Time Zone. This alone indicates
      that Wetzel County is east of Caddo Parish.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Wetzel County, WV, is in a state that is east of Louisiana,
      and Caddo Parish, LA, is in the western part of Louisiana, Wetzel County is
      indeed east of Caddo Parish.

      \ by step to determine whether Hudspeth County, TX, is located east of Calaveras\
      \ County, CA.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations of Both Counties\n\n**Hudspeth\
      \ County, TX:**\n- Hudspeth County is situated in the western part of Texas,\
      \ near the border with Mexico. It's part of the Trans-Pecos region, known for\
      \ its desert landscapes.\n\n**Calaveras County, CA:**\n- Calaveras County is\
      \ located in the Sierra Nevada region of California, northeast of San Francisco.\
      \ It's known for its gold rush history and scenic mountainous areas.\n\n###\
      \ Step 2: Determine the Longitudes of Both Counties\n\nTo ascertain which county\
      \ is further east, we need to look at their longitudinal positions.\n\n- **Hudspeth\
      \ County, TX:** Approximately 105\xB0 W longitude.\n- **Calaveras County, CA:**\
      \ Approximately 120\xB0 W longitude.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Longitudes\n\
      \nLongitudes are measured in degrees west of the Prime Meridian (0\xB0). The\
      \ lower the longitude, the further east a location is.\n\n- Hudspeth County:\
      \ 105\xB0 W\n- Calaveras County: 120\xB0 W\n\nSince 105\xB0 W is less than 120\xB0\
      \ W, Hudspeth County is further east than Calaveras County.\n\n### Step 4: Consider\
      \ the Geographic Context\n\nLooking at a map:\n\n- California is generally west\
      \ of Texas.\n- Within Texas, Hudspeth County is in the westernmost part, but\
      \ still east of California's eastern counties like Calaveras.\n\n### Step 5:\
      \ Final Verification\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I checked an online map and confirmed\
      \ that Hudspeth County, TX, is indeed positioned to the east of Calaveras County,\
      \ CA.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter analyzing the longitudinal positions and verifying\
