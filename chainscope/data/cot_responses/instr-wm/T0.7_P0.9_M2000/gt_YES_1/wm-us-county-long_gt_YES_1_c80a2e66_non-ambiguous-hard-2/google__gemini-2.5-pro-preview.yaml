    5906f5a1-aef2-422b-8365-ccd5cf872d9c: 'Okay, let''s break this down step by step:


      1.  **Identify the location of Dickenson County, VA:** Dickenson County is located
      in the far southwestern part of Virginia, in the Appalachian region. Virginia
      is an East Coast state.

      2.  **Identify the location of Collingsworth County, TX:** Collingsworth County
      is located in the Texas Panhandle, near the border with Oklahoma. Texas is a
      large state in the South Central US, significantly west of Virginia.

      3.  **Compare the relative east/west positions:** The entire state of Virginia
      lies east of the entire state of Texas. Therefore, any county in Virginia (including
      Dickenson County) will be east of any county in the Texas Panhandle (including
      Collingsworth County).

      4.  **Conclusion:** Dickenson County, VA is indeed located east of Collingsworth
