      4. To determine east/west positioning:

      - Since Manassas Park City is in northeastern Virginia and Ascension Parish
      is in southeastern Louisiana

      - Manassas Park City is definitively east of Ascension Parish


      Therefore, the answer is:


      YES'

      - It is in a very different part of the United States from Kankakee County


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Kankakee County is in Illinois (a Midwestern state east of the Mississippi
      River)

      - Hayes County is in Nebraska (a Great Plains state west of the Mississippi
      River)


      4. Relative positioning:

      - Nebraska is west of Illinois

      - So Hayes County is west of Kankakee County


      5. Therefore, Kankakee County is NOT east of Hayes County.
