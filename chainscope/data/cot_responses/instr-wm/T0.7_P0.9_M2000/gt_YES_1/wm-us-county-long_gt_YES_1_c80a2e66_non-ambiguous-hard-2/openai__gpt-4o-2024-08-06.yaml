      is in the central part of the United States.


      3. **Comparing Longitudes:** The longitude of Virginia is generally east of
      the longitude of Nebraska because the entire state of Virginia is on the eastern
      side of the United States compared to Nebraska, which is centrally located.


      Therefore, Wythe County, VA is located east of Buffalo County, NE.
