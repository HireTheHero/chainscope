      1. **Locate Portage County, OH**: Portage County is in northeastern Ohio. It
      is situated to the east of the state of Ohio, near cities like Kent and Ravenna.


      2. **Locate Coleman County, TX**: Coleman County is in central Texas. It is
      located southwest of the central part of Texas, with the city of Coleman as
      its county seat.

      KY is located east of Duchesne County, UT, we need to consider the geographical
      locations of both counties.


      1. **Locate McCracken County, KY**: McCracken County is situated in the western
      part of Kentucky, near the Ohio River and the border with Illinois.


      2. **Locate Duchesne County, UT**: Duchesne County is located in the northeastern
      part of Utah, primarily in the Uinta Basin.


      3. **Compare the Longitudes**: Generally, when comparing locations east or west
      of each other in the United States, we look at their longitudes. Kentucky is
      east of Utah, as the state of Utah is further west than Kentucky.


      4. **Check Specific Locations**: McCracken County is approximately at a longitude
      of around 88 degrees West, while Duchesne County is approximately at a longitude
      of around 110 degrees West. Since 88 degrees West is less than 110 degrees West,
      McCracken County is indeed east of Duchesne County.

      Utah, known for its mountainous terrain and proximity to the Wasatch Range.


      3. **Relative Positioning**: To find out if Ray County is east of Wasatch County,
      we need to visualize or consult a map. Missouri is to the east of Utah when
      considering the two states as a whole. However, Ray County is in the northwestern
      part of Missouri, while Wasatch County is in central Utah.


      4. **Comparing Longitudes**: Generally, the longitude of Ray County is approximately
      93 degrees west, while Wasatch County is around 111 degrees west. Since the
      longitude increases as you move west, Ray County is indeed further east in terms
      of longitudinal position.


      Thus, after analyzing the geographical locations:


      **Answer**: YES, Ray County, MO is located east of Wasatch County, UT.'
