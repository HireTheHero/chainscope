      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** New York is in the northeastern
      US. Texas is in the southern US.

      3.  **Determine the relative longitude of the states:** Generally speaking,
      states further east in the US have higher longitudes (closer to 0 degrees, or
      less negative in the Western Hemisphere). New York is significantly further
      east than Texas.

      4.  **Consider the specific counties:** While there might be some variation
      within states, Otsego County is in central New York, and Karnes County is in
      southern Texas. Their relative positions within their states don''t drastically
      alter the overall east/west relationship between the states themselves. New
      York is clearly east of Texas.

      5.  **Compare the locations:** Since New York is east of Texas, any county in
      New York will be east of any county in Texas.

      \ Cottle County, TX.\n2.  **Identify the locations:**\n    *   Aiken County,\
      \ SC (South Carolina)\n    *   Cottle County, TX (Texas)\n3.  **Determine the\
      \ general location of each state:**\n    *   South Carolina is in the southeastern\
      \ United States.\n    *   Texas is in the southwestern/south-central United\

      \ location within Texas, especially given the significant distance between the\
      \ two states.\n7.  **Refine the reasoning (optional but good for confirmation):**\
      \ South Carolina's longitude is roughly between 78\xB0 W and 83\xB0 W. Texas's\
      \ longitude is roughly between 93\xB0 W and 107\xB0 W. A county in South Carolina\
      \ (like Aiken) will have a longitude significantly further east (lower number\
      \ in the Western Hemisphere) than a county in Texas (like Cottle).\n8.  **Formulate\

      \ the *relative longitudinal position* of two specific US counties: Dooly County,\
      \ GA and Frio County, TX. I need to determine which is further east or west.\n\
      \n2.  **Identify the key geographical entities:**\n    *   Dooly County, GA\n\
      \    *   Frio County, TX\n\n3.  **Determine the location of each county:** I\
      \ need to find their approximate geographical positions, specifically their\
      \ longitudes.\n    *   **Dooly County, GA:** I know Georgia is on the southeastern\
      \ side of the US. A quick search confirms its location in central Georgia. I'll\
      \ need its longitude. A search reveals Dooly County is around 32.1\xB0 N, **-83.8\xB0\
      \ W**.\n    *   **Frio County, TX:** I know Texas is in the south-central US,\
      \ significantly west of Georgia. A quick search confirms its location in southern\
      \ Texas. I'll need its longitude. A search reveals Frio County is around 28.8\xB0\
      \ N, **-99.2\xB0 W**.\n\n4.  **Compare the longitudes:**\n    *   Dooly County,\
      \ GA: -83.8\xB0 W\n    *   Frio County, TX: -99.2\xB0 W\n\n5.  **Interpret the\
      \ longitude values:**\n    *   Longitude values in the Western Hemisphere are\
      \ negative (or expressed as degrees West).\n    *   A longitude value *closer\
      \ to 0* (or *less negative*) is further east.\n    *   A longitude value *further\
      \ from 0* (or *more negative*) is further west.\n\n6.  **Perform the comparison:**\n\
      \    *   -83.8 is less negative than -99.2.\n    *   Therefore, -83.8\xB0 W\
      \ is further east than -99.2\xB0 W.\n\n7.  **Relate the comparison back to the\
      \ counties:**\n    *   Dooly County, GA is located at -83.8\xB0 W.\n    *  \
      \ Frio County, TX is located at -99.2\xB0 W.\n    *   Since -83.8\xB0 W is east\
      \ of -99.2\xB0 W, Dooly County, GA is located east of Frio County, TX.\n\n8.\
      \  **Formulate the final answer:** The question asks \"Is Dooly County, GA located\
      \ east of Frio County, TX?\". Based on the longitude comparison, the answer\
      \ is yes.\n\n9.  **Provide the final YES/NO answer:** YES.\n\nThis step-by-step\
      \ process, involving identifying locations, finding specific coordinates (longitude\
      \ is key for east/west), comparing those coordinates, and interpreting the comparison\
      \ in geographical terms, leads directly to the correct YES/NO answer.Here's\
      \ the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  Identify the two counties: Dooly County,\
      \ GA and Frio County, TX.\n2.  Understand the question: It asks for the relative\
      \ east/west position of Dooly County, GA compared to Frio County, TX. \"East\
      \ of\" means having a longitude closer to 0 degrees (the Prime Meridian) or\
      \ further into the positive range (for those using positive East longitudes).\
      \ In the Western Hemisphere, this means a less negative (or greater) longitude\
      \ value.\n3.  Determine the approximate location (specifically longitude) of\
      \ Dooly County, GA. Georgia is in the southeastern US. Its longitude is roughly\
      \ around 83-84 degrees West.\n4.  Determine the approximate location (specifically\
      \ longitude) of Frio County, TX. Texas is in the south-central US, significantly\
      \ west of Georgia. Its longitude is roughly around 99-100 degrees West.\n5.\
      \  Compare the longitudes: -83\xB0 W (Dooly County) vs. -99\xB0 W (Frio County).\n\
      6.  Determine which is further east: A longitude of -83\xB0 W is a greater value\
      \ than -99\xB0 W, meaning it is located further east (closer to the Prime Meridian).\n\
      7.  Conclude the relative position: Dooly County, GA is located east of Frio\
      \ County, TX.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{YES}$."

      time zone, and its western side is roughly around 101 degrees West longitude.

      4.  **Compare longitudes:** 86 degrees West longitude is further east than 101
      degrees West longitude.

      5.  **Formulate the answer:** Since Oceana County''s longitude is a smaller
      negative number (or smaller number on the West side of the Prime Meridian),
      it is located east of Kearny County.

      to compare Oceana County, Michigan and Kearny County, Kansas.

      2.  **Determine the relative position of the states:** Michigan is generally
      located east of Kansas within the United States.

      3.  **Consider the size of the states and counties:** While states are large,
      individual counties within states are much smaller. However, the overall east-west
      position of the states is a strong indicator. Michigan is significantly further
      east than Kansas.

      4.  **Compare longitudes (implicitly):** Michigan''s western edge is roughly
      around 86 degrees West longitude. Kansas''s eastern edge is roughly around 94
      degrees West, and Kearny County is in western Kansas, around 101 degrees West
      longitude. Oceana County is on the western coast of Michigan, around 86-87 degrees
      West longitude.

      5.  **Conclusion based on state positions and approximate longitudes:** Since
      Michigan is located substantially east of Kansas, and Oceana County is in Michigan
      while Kearny County is in Kansas, Oceana County must be located east of Kearny
      County.


      **Answer:** YES'

      the locations of Oceana County, MI and Kearny County, KS.

      2.  **Determine the relative east-west position of Michigan and Kansas:** Michigan
      is generally located further east than Kansas in the United States.

      3.  **Infer the relative east-west position of counties within those states:**
      Since Michigan is east of Kansas, any county in Michigan will generally be located
      east of any county in Kansas, assuming they are at roughly similar latitudes.
      While this isn''t a perfect rule (you could have a far western county in Michigan
      and a far eastern county in Kansas), the general position of the states makes
      it highly likely.

      4.  **Confirm with specific county locations (optional but good practice):**
      Oceana County is on the western side of Michigan (along Lake Michigan). Kearny
      County is in the western half of Kansas. Even with these relative positions
      *within* their states, Michigan''s overall eastward shift relative to Kansas
      means Oceana County, MI is still east of Kearny County, KS.


      Therefore, Oceana County, MI is located east of Kearny County, KS.

      3.  **Visualize or know the relative positions of the states:** Ohio is significantly
      to the east and north of Texas.

      4.  **Consider the counties within their states:** While the exact location
      within the state matters for precise comparisons, the vast difference in state
      locations is the primary factor. Portage County, OH will be somewhere within
      Ohio. Coleman County, TX will be somewhere within Texas.

      5.  **Compare the general locations:** Since Ohio is generally east of Texas,
      any county in Ohio is highly likely to be east of any county in Texas, especially
      given the large geographical separation between the states.

      5.  **Consider the counties within their states:** While specific county locations
      within their states matter for a precise comparison, the states themselves are
      so far apart that the east/west relationship of any county in Arkansas relative
      to any county in Montana is likely dominated by the state-level positions. Arkansas
      is east of Montana.

      6.  **Apply the east/west relationship:** Since Arkansas is generally east of

      \ County, ND:** Located in the northeastern part of North Dakota. North Dakota\
      \ is located in the Upper Midwest/Great Plains region, west of the Mississippi\
      \ River.\n\n4.  **Compare the longitudes:** To determine if one place is east\
      \ of another, I need to compare their longitudes. The further east a location\
      \ is, the higher (closer to 0, Greenwich) its longitude number will be (less\
      \ negative in the Western Hemisphere).\n\n    *   North Dakota is generally\
      \ located much further west than Michigan. North Dakota is bordered by Montana\
      \ to the west and Minnesota to the east. Michigan is bordered by Wisconsin,\
      \ Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio to the west/southwest/south, and Canada to the\
      \ north/east.\n    *   Specifically, North Dakota's longitude is roughly between\
      \ 97\xB0 W and 104\xB0 W.\n    *   Michigan's longitude is roughly between 82\xB0\
      \ W and 90\xB0 W (though the western part of the Upper Peninsula extends further\
      \ west).\n\n5.  **Focus on the specific counties:** While the state comparison\
      \ is helpful, I need to be sure about the specific counties.\n\n    *   *Cavalier\
      \ County, ND:* Northeastern corner of ND. Still firmly within the western longitude\
      \ range of North Dakota. Approximate longitude around 98\xB0 W to 99\xB0 W.\n\
      \    *   *Cheboygan County, MI:* Northern Lower Peninsula of MI. Within the\
      \ central/eastern longitude range of Michigan. Approximate longitude around\
      \ 84\xB0 W to 85\xB0 W.\n\n6.  **Make the comparison:**\n    *   Cheboygan County's\
      \ longitude is around 84\xB0 W to 85\xB0 W.\n    *   Cavalier County's longitude\
      \ is around 98\xB0 W to 99\xB0 W.\n\n    Since 84/85 is a smaller negative number\
      \ (or larger number closer to 0) than 98/99, Cheboygan County is located *east*\
      \ of Cavalier County.\n\n7.  **Formulate the final answer:** The comparison\

      \ County.\n\n8.  **State the YES/NO answer:** Based on the comparison, the answer\
      \ is YES.\n\n**Self-Correction/Double Check:** Does this make sense geographically?\
      \ Yes, North Dakota is clearly west of Michigan. Therefore, a county in Michigan\
      \ would be expected to be east of a county in North Dakota.\n\nOkay, planning\

      \n1.  Locate Cheboygan County, MI: It's in the northern part of the Lower Peninsula\
      \ of Michigan. Michigan is in the Great Lakes region, east of the Mississippi\
      \ River.\n2.  Locate Cavalier County, ND: It's in the northeastern part of North\
      \ Dakota. North Dakota is in the Great Plains region, generally west of the\
      \ Mississippi River.\n3.  Compare the general locations: North Dakota is significantly\
      \ further west than Michigan.\n4.  Therefore, a county in Michigan (like Cheboygan)\
      \ will be located at a more easterly longitude than a county in North Dakota\

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** South Carolina is on the
      southeastern coast of the US. Oklahoma is in the south-central US.

      3.  **Mentally place the states on a US map:** South Carolina is significantly
      further east than Oklahoma.

      4.  **Consider the counties within their states:** While county locations within
      states can vary, the states themselves are far apart in terms of east-west position.
      Beaufort County is in the eastern part of South Carolina. Okmulgee County is
      in the eastern part of Oklahoma.

      5.  **Compare the east-west positions:** Since South Carolina as a whole is
      much further east than Oklahoma as a whole, any location in South Carolina will
      be east of any location in Oklahoma.

      6.  **Confirm the relative position:** Beaufort County, SC is indeed located
      well to the east of Okmulgee County, OK.

      \ question: \"Is Franklin City, VA located east of Jasper County, MO?\"\n\n\
      1.  **Identify the locations:** I need the geographical positions of two places:\n\
      \    *   Franklin City, Virginia\n    *   Jasper County, Missouri\n\n2.  **Determine\
      \ the relative position (East/West):** To determine if Franklin City is east\
      \ of Jasper County, I need to compare their longitudes. A location with a *smaller*\
      \ (less negative, or more positive if using positive values for East) longitude\
      \ is further east than a location with a *larger* (more negative, or less positive)\
      \ longitude.\n\n3.  **Find the coordinates:** I'll look up the approximate geographic\
      \ coordinates (specifically longitude) for both locations.\n\n    *   **Franklin\
      \ City, VA:** Franklin City is in southeastern Virginia. Searching for its coordinates\
      \ gives me something around: Latitude 36.68\xB0 N, Longitude **-76.93\xB0 W**.\n\
      \n    *   **Jasper County, MO:** Jasper County is in southwestern Missouri.\
      \ Searching for its coordinates (or the approximate center/major city like Joplin)\
      \ gives me something around: Latitude 37.17\xB0 N, Longitude **-94.32\xB0 W**.\n\
      \n4.  **Compare the longitudes:**\n    *   Franklin City, VA longitude: -76.93\xB0\
      \ W\n    *   Jasper County, MO longitude: -94.32\xB0 W\n\n5.  **Interpret the\
      \ comparison:**\n    *   -76.93 is a *larger* (less negative) number than -94.32.\n\
      \    *   On a standard map where West is to the left and East is to the right,\
      \ larger negative longitudes are further left (west), and smaller negative longitudes\
      \ are further right (east).\n    *   Therefore, -76.93\xB0 W is significantly\
      \ *east* of -94.32\xB0 W.\n\n6.  **Formulate the answer:** Since Franklin City,\
      \ VA has a longitude of approximately -76.93\xB0 W and Jasper County, MO has\
      \ a longitude of approximately -94.32\xB0 W, Franklin City is located to the\
      \ east of Jasper County.\n\n7.  **Final YES/NO:** The question asks if Franklin\
      \ City, VA is located east of Jasper County, MO. Based on the longitude comparison,\
      \ the answer is yes.\n\n**Answer:** YES"

      \ It's known for being on the Atlantic coast and Gulf Coast.\n    *   Iowa (IA)\
      \ is a state in the Midwestern United States, known as a \"corn belt\" state.\
      \ It's landlocked.\n3.  **Visualize or recall the relative positions of Florida\
      \ and Iowa on a map of the United States:** Florida is far to the southeast.\
      \ Iowa is much further north and west than Florida.\n4.  **Consider the concept\
      \ of \"east\" and \"west\" on a map:** \"East\" means further towards the right\
      \ side of a standard US map (towards the Atlantic Ocean). \"West\" means further\
      \ towards the left side (towards the Pacific Ocean).\n5.  **Compare the longitudinal\
      \ positions:** Since Florida is on the Atlantic coast (eastern side of the US)\
      \ and Iowa is in the Midwest (further west than the Atlantic coast), Florida\
      \ is significantly further east than Iowa.\n6.  **Apply this comparison to the\
      \ counties:** If the entire state of Florida is east of the entire state of\
      \ Iowa, then any county within Florida must be east of any county within Iowa\
      \ (assuming they are roughly within the standard longitudinal range of their\
      \ respective states, which they are). St. Lucie County is in Florida, and Sac\
      \ County is in Iowa.\n7.  **Formulate the conclusion:** St. Lucie County, FL\
      \ is located in a state that is geographically *east* of the state where Sac\
      \ County, IA is located. Therefore, St. Lucie County, FL is located east of\
      \ Sac County, IA.\n8.  **Final Answer Format:** Provide the answer as a simple\

      \  **Identify the two locations:** The question is about the relative positions\
      \ of Wolfe County, KY and Archer County, TX.\n\n2.  **Determine the general\
      \ location of each state:**\n    *   Kentucky (KY) is a state in the southeastern\
      \ or east-central United States.\n    *   Texas (TX) is a state in the south-central\
      \ United States.\n\n3.  **Formulate a hypothesis based on state locations:**\
      \ Since Kentucky is generally east of Texas, it's *likely* that a county in\
      \ Kentucky is east of a county in Texas. However, states are large and have\
      \ significant east-west extent, so this is just a starting point, not a definitive\
      \ answer.\n\n4.  **Need more specific location information:** To be certain,\
      \ I need to compare the longitudinal positions of the two counties. Latitude\
      \ (north-south) is irrelevant for an \"east of\" comparison.\n\n5.  **Find the\
      \ approximate longitude of Wolfe County, KY:** I can look up the coordinates\
      \ or general location. Wolfe County is in eastern Kentucky. Its approximate\
      \ longitude is around 83.3 degrees West.\n\n6.  **Find the approximate longitude\
      \ of Archer County, TX:** I can look up the coordinates or general location.\
      \ Archer County is in north-central Texas, near Wichita Falls. Its approximate\
      \ longitude is around 98.7 degrees West.\n\n7.  **Compare the longitudes:**\n\
      \    *   Wolfe County, KY: ~83.3\xB0 W\n    *   Archer County, TX: ~98.7\xB0\
      \ W\n\n8.  **Interpret the longitude comparison:** Longitude decreases as you\

      \ than a location with a larger West longitude number.\n    *   83.3 is smaller\
      \ than 98.7.\n\n9.  **Conclusion based on longitude:** Since 83.3\xB0 W is east\

      \ but the *relative* difference is key). In the Western Hemisphere, this means\
      \ a longitude value that is less negative or closer to zero.\n\n4.  **Find the\

      \ the question:\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The question asks if\
      \ Walworth County, Wisconsin is located *east* of Uintah County, Utah. This\
      \ is a relative location question based on cardinal directions.\n\n2.  **Identify\
      \ the key entities:** I need to know the locations of:\n    *   Walworth County,\
      \ Wisconsin (WI)\n    *   Uintah County, Utah (UT)\n\n3.  **Determine the approximate\
      \ location of each county:**\n    *   Walworth County, WI is in the southeastern\
      \ part of Wisconsin. Wisconsin is in the Midwest region of the US.\n    *  \
      \ Uintah County, UT is in the northeastern part of Utah. Utah is in the Mountain\
      \ West region of the US.\n\n4.  **Determine the relative east-west position\
      \ of the states:**\n    *   Wisconsin is generally located *east* of Utah on\
      \ a map of the United States. Wisconsin is closer to the Atlantic coast states\
      \ (though still in the Midwest), while Utah is significantly further west, in\
      \ the Rocky Mountain region.\n\n5.  **Refine the comparison to counties:** Since\
      \ the states themselves have a clear east-west relationship (WI is east of UT),\
      \ it's highly likely that a county in southeastern WI will be east of a county\
      \ in northeastern UT. To be certain, I'd consider the longitude.\n    *   Wisconsin's\
      \ longitude is roughly between 86\xB0W and 93\xB0W.\n    *   Utah's longitude\
      \ is roughly between 109\xB0W and 114\xB0W.\n    *   Walworth County, WI is\
      \ around 88\xB0W.\n    *   Uintah County, UT is around 109\xB0W.\n\n6.  **Compare\
      \ the longitudes:** A smaller (more negative or less west) longitude means a\
      \ location is further east.\n    *   88\xB0W is smaller than 109\xB0W.\n   \
      \ *   Therefore, Walworth County, WI is located east of Uintah County, UT.\n\
      \n7.  **Formulate the answer:** Based on the geographical locations and comparison\
      \ of longitudes, Walworth County, WI is indeed located east of Uintah County,\
      \ UT.\n\n8.  **State the final YES/NO answer:** The conclusion is that Walworth\
      \ County, WI is east of Uintah County, UT. The answer is YES.\n\nThis step-by-step\
      \ process, moving from identifying the components to comparing their locations\
      \ (first at the state level, then confirming with specific approximate locations\
      \ or longitudes), leads directly to the correct YES/NO answer.Here's the step-by-step\
      \ reasoning:\n\n1.  **Locate Walworth County, WI:** Walworth County is in southeastern\
      \ Wisconsin. Wisconsin is a state in the Midwest region of the US, relatively\
      \ far east compared to the western states.\n2.  **Locate Uintah County, UT:**\
      \ Uintah County is in northeastern Utah. Utah is a state in the Mountain West\
      \ region of the US, located significantly west of the Midwest.\n3.  **Compare\
      \ the general locations:** Wisconsin is geographically located to the east of\
      \ Utah on a map of the United States.\n4.  **Apply to the counties:** Since\
      \ Walworth County is in Wisconsin and Uintah County is in Utah, and Wisconsin\
      \ is east of Utah, a county in Wisconsin will almost certainly be east of a\
      \ county in Utah. Walworth County, WI is roughly at 88\xB0 W longitude, while\
      \ Uintah County, UT is roughly at 109\xB0 W longitude. A smaller W longitude\
      \ means a location is further east. 88\xB0 W is east of 109\xB0 W.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ Walworth County, WI is located east of Uintah County, UT.\n\nThe answer is:\n\
      YES"

      \ the question:\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The question asks for\
      \ a YES or NO answer about the relative east/west location of two specific US\
      \ counties: Winkler County, TX and Hood River County, OR.\n\n2.  **Identify\
      \ the key entities:**\n    *   Winkler County, TX\n    *   Hood River County,\
      \ OR\n\n3.  **Determine the required information:** To compare their east/west\
      \ positions, I need to know the approximate longitude of each county.\n\n4.\
      \  **Information Retrieval (Simulated):**\n    *   Search for \"Winkler County,\
      \ TX location\" or \"Winkler County, TX longitude\". I would find it's in West\
      \ Texas. Approximate longitude is around 103\xB0 W.\n    *   Search for \"Hood\
      \ River County, OR location\" or \"Hood River County, OR longitude\". I would\
      \ find it's in Northern Oregon, along the Columbia River Gorge. Approximate\
      \ longitude is around 121.5\xB0 W.\n\n5.  **Compare the Longitudes:**\n    *\
      \   Winkler County, TX: ~103\xB0 W\n    *   Hood River County, OR: ~121.5\xB0\
      \ W\n\n6.  **Interpret Longitude:** Longitude lines run north-south. As you\
      \ move *east* from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0), the longitude numbers become\
      \ *less* negative (or increase from 0\xB0 East). As you move *west* from the\
      \ Prime Meridian, the longitude numbers become *more* negative (or increase\
      \ from 0\xB0 West). In the Western Hemisphere (where both counties are), a smaller\
      \ West longitude number indicates a location *further east* than a larger West\
      \ longitude number.\n\n7.  **Apply Interpretation to the Comparison:**\n   \
      \ *   103\xB0 W is a *smaller* number than 121.5\xB0 W.\n    *   Therefore,\
      \ 103\xB0 W is *east* of 121.5\xB0 W.\n\n8.  **Relate Longitude back to the\
      \ Counties:**\n    *   Winkler County, TX is at ~103\xB0 W.\n    *   Hood River\

      \ W, Winkler County, TX is east of Hood River County, OR.\n\n9.  **Formulate\
      \ the Answer based on the Question:** The question is \"Is Winkler County, TX\
      \ located east of Hood River County, OR?\". My conclusion is that it *is* located\
      \ east.\n\n10. **Final Answer Format:** The question requires a simple YES or\

      \ We need to compare the positions of Winkler County, TX and Hood River County,\
      \ OR.\n2.  **Determine the primary East/West indicator:** For comparing locations\
      \ across large distances in the US, longitude is the key factor for East/West\
      \ position.\n3.  **Find the approximate longitude of Winkler County, TX:** Winkler\
      \ County is in West Texas. Its approximate longitude is around 103\xB0 West.\n\
      4.  **Find the approximate longitude of Hood River County, OR:** Hood River\
      \ County is in northern Oregon. Its approximate longitude is around 121.5\xB0\
      \ West.\n5.  **Compare the longitudes:** In the Western Hemisphere (where both\
      \ counties are), a smaller West longitude number indicates a location further\
      \ east than a larger West longitude number.\n    *   103\xB0 W is smaller than\
      \ 121.5\xB0 W.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since 103\xB0 W is east of 121.5\xB0 W,\

      south. This immediately suggests Texas is generally *east* of Oregon.

      5.  **Focus on the specific counties:** While the general state locations are
      helpful, the question is about specific counties. However, given the vast distance
      and the clear east-west separation of the states, it''s highly likely that *any*
      county in Texas will be east of *any* county in Oregon.

      6.  **Confirm with a mental map or external knowledge:** Recall or quickly check
      a map of the United States. Locate Texas and Oregon. Observe their positions
      relative to each other. Texas is clearly situated to the east of Oregon.

      \n2.  **Identify the key geographical entities:** Ray County, MO and Wasatch\
      \ County, UT.\n\n3.  **Determine the relative locations:** To determine if one\

      \ run north-south. Locations with smaller (more negative) longitudes are further\
      \ west, and locations with larger (less negative) longitudes are further east.\n\
      \n4.  **Find the approximate longitude of Ray County, MO:** Ray County is in\

      \ around -93 to -91 degrees West. Kansas City is near Ray County, and its longitude\
      \ is around -94.5 degrees West. Ray County itself is east of Kansas City, so\
      \ its longitude is likely slightly less negative, perhaps around -93.5 degrees\

      \ the longitudes:**\n    *   Approximate longitude of Ray County, MO: ~ -93.5\
      \ degrees West\n    *   Approximate longitude of Wasatch County, UT: ~ -111\
      \ degrees West\n\n7.  **Analyze the comparison:** -93.5 is a larger number (less\
