    765fa557-fd3e-4217-8b45-51059ef5cdc9: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Bridge Canyon Dam, AZ:

      - This dam is located in northwestern Arizona, near the Grand Canyon

      - It would be in the western part of Arizona


      2. Next, I''ll locate Saint Sophia Cathedral in Los Angeles, CA:

      - This cathedral is located in Los Angeles, which is in southern California

      - Los Angeles is on the west coast of California


      3. Consider their relative geographic positions:

      - Bridge Canyon Dam is in northwestern Arizona

      - Saint Sophia Cathedral is in southwestern California

      - Arizona is east of California


      4. So, is Bridge Canyon Dam east of Saint Sophia Cathedral?

      - Yes, because Arizona is geographically east of California

    75368b6f-e516-4aa4-a41a-4019700b5b13: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Eighth & Main, ID (which I understand is in Idaho)

      2. Then I''ll locate Topaz Solar Farm, CA (which is in California)

      3. I''ll determine their relative geographic positions


      Step 1: Eighth & Main is likely in Idaho

      Step 2: Topaz Solar Farm is located in San Luis Obispo County, California

      Step 3: Comparing their locations:

      - Idaho is east of California

      - So any location in Idaho would be east of a location in California


      Therefore, Eighth & Main, ID is EAST of Topaz Solar Farm, CA.

      specific places.


      2. Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is located in Minneapolis, Minnesota
      (MN).


      3. Nichols Hall is located in Kansas (KS).


      4. These are two different states, located in different parts of the United
      States.


      5. Minnesota is located in the upper Midwest, while Kansas is in the central
      plains.


      6. Geographically, Minnesota is east of Kansas.


      7. Therefore, a location in Minneapolis, MN would be east of a location in Kansas.


      8. So the answer is: YES, Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is located east
      of Nichols Hall.

    1e798d4b-54a6-4a98-8553-cdf3740cf4a8: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate St. Peter Cathedral in Marquette, Michigan

      - Marquette is in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan

      - It is located in the northern part of Michigan, near Lake Superior


      2. Next, locate Lake Hudson in Oklahoma

      - Lake Hudson is in northeastern Oklahoma


      3. Determine their relative geographic positions

      - Michigan is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, in the northeastern United
      States

      - Oklahoma is in the south-central part of the United States

      - Michigan is significantly east of Oklahoma


      4. Compare their east-west positions

      - Since Michigan is east of Oklahoma, any location in Michigan (like Marquette)
      would be east of any location in Oklahoma (like Lake Hudson)


      5. Therefore, St. Peter Cathedral in Marquette, Michigan is indeed east of Lake
      Hudson in Oklahoma.

      1. First, I''ll locate Lake Cascade, Idaho on a map

      - Lake Cascade is in west-central Idaho, in the western part of the state


      2. Next, I''ll locate Lake Amador, California on a map

      - Lake Amador is in central California, specifically in Amador County in the
      Sierra Nevada foothills


      3. Comparing their geographical positions

      - Idaho is located to the east of California

      - Therefore, Lake Cascade (in Idaho) would be east of Lake Amador (in California)


      4. Double-checking the reasoning

      - West of California = Pacific Ocean

      - Idaho is entirely east of California

      - Any point in Idaho is east of any point in California
