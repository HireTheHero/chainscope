      - Jindabyne Dam is located in New South Wales, Australia

      - It is situated in the Snowy Mountains region


      2. Next, locate the National Shrine of the Divine Mercy:

      1. First, locate Estadio Gigante de Arroyito:

      - This is a soccer stadium located in Rosario, Argentina

      - Rosario is in the central-eastern part of Argentina


      2. Next, locate Baker Lake:

      - Baker Lake is a location in Washington state, United States

      - It is situated in the western part of the United States


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Estadio Gigante de Arroyito is in South America

      - Baker Lake is in North America

      - These locations are thousands of miles apart, on different continents


      4. Determine their relative east-west positioning:

      - Rosario, Argentina is significantly west of Baker Lake, Washington

      - This means Estadio Gigante de Arroyito is NOT east of Baker Lake


      5. Conclusion:

      Since Estadio Gigante de Arroyito is west of Baker Lake, the answer to "Is Estadio
      Gigante de Arroyito located east of Baker Lake (Washington)?" is:

      - Porac is a municipality in Pampanga, Philippines


      2. Next, I''ll locate Mandarin Oriental Chengdu

      - Chengdu is a city in Sichuan Province, China


      3. These locations are in different countries (Philippines vs China)
