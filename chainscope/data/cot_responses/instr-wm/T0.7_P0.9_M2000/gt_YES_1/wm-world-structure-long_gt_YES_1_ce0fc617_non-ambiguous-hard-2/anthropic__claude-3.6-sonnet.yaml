      1) First, I need to identify what "The Doughnut" is

      - The Doughnut is a nickname for the O2 Arena (formerly the Millennium Dome)
      in London, UK

      - It''s located in Greenwich, London


      2) Now, I need to identify where the North Aral Sea is

      - The North Aral Sea is part of what remains of the former Aral Sea

      - It''s located in Kazakhstan, Central Asia


      3) Now I need to compare their relative positions

      - London is in Western Europe

      - Kazakhstan is in Central Asia

      - When looking at a map, Kazakhstan is clearly east of London


      Therefore: YES, the North Aral Sea is located east of The Doughnut.'

      3. Now let''s compare their locations:

      - Belgium is in Western Europe

      - South Africa is much further east than Belgium

      - Therefore, Pretoria (and Ou Raadsaal) is located east of Thorntonbank Wind
      Farm

      - Bahrain is in the Middle East, east of Europe


      3. Therefore, Al-Sakhir Palace in Bahrain is indeed located east of Sacred Heart
      in Edinburgh.


      Answer: YES'
    b3d0b0c3-f2db-48af-99df-4ec3b498908f: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s identify the locations:

      - Al-Sakhir Palace is in Bahrain, in the Middle East

      - Sacred Heart is in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK


      2. Let''s consider their positions on a world map:

      - Edinburgh is in Western Europe

      - Bahrain is in the Middle East

      - When looking at a world map, Bahrain is clearly east of Scotland/Edinburgh


      3. Therefore, since Al-Sakhir Palace is in Bahrain, and Bahrain is east of Edinburgh,
      Al-Sakhir Palace must be east of Sacred Heart in Edinburgh.


      Answer: YES'

      2. Now, let''s locate Al-Sakhir Palace:

      - Al-Sakhir Palace is located in Bahrain

      - Bahrain is a country in the Middle East


      3. Compare their relative positions:

      - Edinburgh is in Western Europe

      - Dublin, Ireland is located in Western Europe

      - Skara, Sweden is located in Northern Europe, specifically in the eastern part
      of Southern Sweden


      3. Looking at a mental map of Europe:

      - Ireland is one of the westernmost countries in Europe

      - Sweden is much further east, positioned in Scandinavia


      4. Therefore, Skara Cathedral (in Sweden) is definitely located east of St.
      Werburgh''s Church (in Dublin)


      Answer: YES'

      - I am not completely certain about this location, but immigration stations
      in the US would be in the United States


      3. Given these locations:

      - England is east of the United States

      - Therefore, any location in England would be east of any location in the United
      States


      4. Conclusion:

      Since Calcot Manor is in England, and Washington Avenue Immigration Station
      would be in the US, Calcot Manor must be east of it.
