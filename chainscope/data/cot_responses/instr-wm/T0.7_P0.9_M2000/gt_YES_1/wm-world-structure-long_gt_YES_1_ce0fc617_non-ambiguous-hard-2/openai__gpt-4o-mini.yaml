      Now, evaluating the east-west relationship:

      - Since Pretoria (Ou Raadsaal) is west of Belgium (where the Thorntonbank Wind

      both in terms of latitude and longitude.


      Now, considering the direction:


      - When comparing the two, since Thorntonbank Wind Farm is in Europe and Ou Raadsaal
      is in Africa, they are not directly comparable in terms of east or west relative
      to each other.

      - However, if we visualize or map these locations, Ou Raadsaal is actually located

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to establish the locations of both
      the Acropole Hotel and King Alfred''s Tower. The Acropole Hotel is typically
      known to be located in Athens, Greece, while King Alfred''s Tower is in Somerset,
      England.


      2. **Geographical Orientation**: Next, we should understand the geographical
      relationship between the two locations. Athens is situated to the southeast
      of Somerset, England.


      3. **Determine Direction**: Since Athens (where the Acropole Hotel is located)
      is southeast of Somerset (where King Alfred''s Tower is located), we can infer
      the directional relationship.


      4. **East or Not**: Being southeast means that Athens is not directly east of
      Somerset; it is more towards the southeast direction.


      Based on this reasoning, the Acropole Hotel is not located east of King Alfred''s
      Tower.


      The answer is: **NO**.'

      the northwest of Sheboygan.


      Since Sheboygan Municipal Auditorium and Armory is not located east of Victoria
      General Hospital but rather southwest, the answer is:


      NO'

      1. **Cluj-Napoca National Theatre**: This theatre is located in Cluj-Napoca,
