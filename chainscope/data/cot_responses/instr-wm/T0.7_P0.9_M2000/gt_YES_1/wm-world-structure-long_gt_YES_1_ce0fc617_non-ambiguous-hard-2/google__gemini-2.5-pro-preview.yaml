      \    *   Barker Reservoir (Colorado): Longitude approximately 105.51\xB0 **W**\n\
      5.  **Determine East/West:** For locations in the Western Hemisphere, a smaller\

      1.  **Locate Grange Park railway station:** Grange Park railway station is located
      in the London Borough of Enfield, in North London, UK.


      2.  **Locate Riverside Park Community:** "Riverside Park Community" most prominently
      refers to a neighbourhood in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. There are other places
      called "Riverside Park," but "Riverside Park Community" is strongly associated
      with Ottawa.


      3.  **Determine their relative geographical positions:** London, UK, is significantly
      to the east of Ottawa, Canada.


      4.  **Answer the question:** Therefore, Grange Park railway station (in London)
      is indeed located east of Riverside Park Community (in Ottawa).


      YES'
    74b4ba38-06e4-49db-a40d-abacaa17eec3: 'Okay, let''s break this down.


      **Step 1: Identify "Grange Park railway station."**

      The most prominent and well-known Grange Park railway station is located in
      the London Borough of Enfield, UK.


      **Step 2: Identify "Riverside Park Community" in relation to that station.**

      Searching for "Riverside Park Community" near Grange Park, Enfield, or in Enfield
      generally, points to "Riverside Park." This is a public park in Enfield. The
      "Community" likely refers to the residential areas surrounding or near this
      park.


      **Step 3: Determine their relative geographical locations.**

      Using a map (e.g., Google Maps):

      *   Grange Park railway station is situated on the eastern side of the A10 road
      in Enfield.

      *   Riverside Park (and the community around it) is located to the west of the
      A10 and west/southwest of Grange Park railway station.


      **Step 4: Conclude the directional relationship.**

      Since Grange Park railway station is to the east/northeast of Riverside Park
      (and the associated community), the statement "Grange Park railway station is
      located east of Riverside Park Community" is correct.


      Therefore, the answer is:

      **Step-by-step reasoning:**


      1.  **Identify "Grange Park railway station":** A search reveals this station
      is located in the London Borough of Enfield, in North London, UK.

      2.  **Identify "Riverside Park Community":** This name is more generic. However,
      a prominent and well-known "Riverside Park Community" (often referred to as
      Riverside Park) is a neighbourhood in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. There might be
      other, smaller places with similar names, but this is a significant one.

      3.  **Compare Locations:** Grange Park railway station is in London, UK. Riverside
      Park Community (Ottawa) is in Ontario, Canada.

      4.  **Conclusion:** These two locations are on different continents, separated
      by the Atlantic Ocean. Therefore, it''s not meaningful to ask if one is directly
      east of the other in a local sense. London, UK, is indeed globally east of Ottawa,
      Canada, but the question implies a local geographical relationship, which doesn''t
      exist here as they are not in the same city or even country. Assuming the question
      implies a local proximity for such a directional query, they are not proximally
      located.

      \ reasonable to assume the question refers to one of the more globally recognized\
      \ ones, or at least one *not* in Paris. The one in Istanbul, Turkey, is a historically\
      \ significant and well-known landmark.\n\n3.  **Determine the geographical relationship\

      \ located east of The Scots Kirk in Paris.\n\nLet's consider if there's a notable\
      \ \"Cathedral of the Holy Spirit\" *in Paris* itself. There isn't a major, well-known\

      \ in such a general knowledge question. The most famous cathedrals in Paris\
      \ are Notre-Dame, Sacr\xE9-C\u0153ur, etc. There is the \"\xC9glise du Saint-Esprit\"\
      \ (Church of the Holy Spirit) in the 12th arrondissement of Paris, which is\

      \ in Istanbul or a lesser-known church with a similar name in Paris itself (\xC9\
      glise du Saint-Esprit), the answer points in the same direction. However, the\
      \ most common interpretation for an unspecified \"Cathedral of the Holy Spirit\"\
