      1. Identify the geographic locations of both Grange Park railway station and

      2. Compare their longitudinal coordinates or their positions relative to each
      other on a map.


      Step 1: Grange Park railway station is located in the London Borough of Enfield,
      in north London, England.


      Step 2: There are multiple places named "Riverside Park Community" globally.
      However, one of the notable ones is in Jacksonville, Florida, USA. Another is

      is in London.


      However, in the UK, there is no widely known "Riverside Park Community" directly
      near Grange Park. But if the Riverside Park Community refers to one in the UK,
      such as Riverside Park in Southampton or other locations, we need to compare
      their locations.


      Assuming "Riverside Park Community" refers to Riverside Park in Southampton
      (England), then:

      of Southampton.

      If Riverside Park Community is in Southampton, then YES, Grange Park railway
      station is east of it.


      If Riverside Park Community refers to a location outside the UK (e.g., in the
      US or Canada), then Grange Park station would be east of them, as London is
      east of North America.


      Hence, in all likely interpretations, Grange Park railway station is to the
      east of Riverside Park Community.

    640592d7-1af4-49f0-bf1e-33aed2619938: 'To determine whether the Mikhail Bulgakov
      Museum is located east of Greenford station, we need to:


      1. Identify the location of the Mikhail Bulgakov Museum.

      2. Identify the location of Greenford station.

      3. Determine the relative positions of these two locations, specifically whether
      the museum is east of the station.


      Step 1: The Mikhail Bulgakov Museum is located in Kyiv, Ukraine. It is a well-known
      museum dedicated to the Russian writer Mikhail Bulgakov and is situated at 13
      Andriivskyi Descent in Kyiv.


      Step 2: Greenford station is a London Underground and National Rail station
      located in Greenford, a suburb of West London, United Kingdom.


      Step 3: Now compare the geographical positions of Kyiv and Greenford. Kyiv is
      in Eastern Europe, while Greenford (London) is in Western Europe. When looking
      at a map, Kyiv is significantly east of London.


      Therefore, the Mikhail Bulgakov Museum (in Kyiv) is located east of Greenford
      station (in London).

      1. Identify the location of the Sheboygan Municipal Auditorium and Armory.

      2. Identify the location of Victoria General Hospital.

      3. Compare their longitudinal coordinates to see which is further east.


      Step 1: The Sheboygan Municipal Auditorium and Armory was located in Sheboygan,
      Wisconsin, USA. Sheboygan is situated in the central part of the United States,
      along the western shore of Lake Michigan.


      Step 2: Victoria General Hospital is located in Victoria, British Columbia,
      Canada. Victoria is on the southern tip of Vancouver Island, off the west coast
      of Canada.


      Step 3: Now, let''s compare their positions:

      - Sheboygan, Wisconsin is approximately at a longitude of about -87.7 degrees.

      - Victoria, British Columbia is approximately at a longitude of about -123.4
      degrees.


      Since -87.7 is greater than -123.4, this means Sheboygan is further east than
      Victoria.

      Step 1: Identify the location of Pharping Hydropower Station.

      - The Pharping Hydropower Station is located in Pharping, which is a town in
      the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal. Nepal is situated in South Asia, and Pharping
      lies to the south of Kathmandu city.
