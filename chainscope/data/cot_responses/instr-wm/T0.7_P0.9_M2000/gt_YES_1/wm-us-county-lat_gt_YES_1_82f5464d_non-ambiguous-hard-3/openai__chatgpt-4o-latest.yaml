      is located north of Sabine Parish, LA, we need to understand the geographical
      locations of both places relative to each other.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Sibley County, Minnesota.

      - Sibley County is in the state of Minnesota, which is located in the northern
      region of the United States.

      - Minnesota borders Canada to the north, indicating it is quite far north geographically.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Sabine Parish, Louisiana.

      - Sabine Parish is in the state of Louisiana, which is in the southern United
      States.

      - Louisiana borders the Gulf of Mexico and is one of the southernmost states
      in the U.S.


      Step 3: Compare the relative latitudes.

      - Minnesota (and thus Sibley County) is significantly farther north than Louisiana
      (and thus Sabine Parish).

      - Therefore, Sibley County is geographically north of Sabine Parish.
