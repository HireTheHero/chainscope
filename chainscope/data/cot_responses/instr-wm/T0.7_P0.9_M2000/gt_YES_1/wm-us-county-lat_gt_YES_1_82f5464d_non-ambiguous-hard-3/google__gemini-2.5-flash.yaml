      **Step 1: Find the approximate latitude of Lac qui Parle County, MN.**

      Lac qui Parle County, MN is in western Minnesota. Its county seat, Madison,
      MN, is at approximately 45.0 degrees North latitude.


      **Step 2: Find the approximate latitude of Archer County, TX.**

      Archer County, TX is in north-central Texas. Its county seat, Archer City, TX,

      **Step 3: Compare the latitudes.**

      45.0 degrees North (Lac qui Parle County) is a higher numerical value than 33.6
      degrees North (Archer County). On a map, higher North latitude values are further
      north.


      **Step 4: Conclude based on the comparison.**

      Since Lac qui Parle County''s latitude is higher (further North) than Archer
      County''s latitude, Lac qui Parle County is located north of Archer County.

      Canada. Alabama is a southern state, bordering the Gulf of Mexico.

      3.  **Compare latitudes:** Because Michigan is geographically north of Alabama,
      any point in Michigan will be at a higher latitude (further north) than any
      point in Alabama, generally speaking.

      4.  **Confirm for specific counties:** Gogebic County is in the Upper Peninsula
      of Michigan, one of the northernmost parts of the state. Conecuh County is in
      southern Alabama. Their relative positions reinforce the general state-level
      comparison.


      Therefore, Gogebic County, MI is indeed located north of Conecuh County, AL.
