      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Treasure County is in Montana (MT), which is in the northern part of the United
      States.

      - Otero County is in New Mexico (NM), which is in the southern part of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions.

      in the contiguous US.

      - New Mexico is along the US-Mexico border and is one of the southernmost states
      in the US.


      Step 3: Determine north-south relationship.

      - Since Montana is significantly north of New Mexico in the United States, any
      county in Montana (including Treasure County) would be north of any county in
      New Mexico (including Otero County).

      - Louisiana is in the southern part of the United States, along the Gulf of
      Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Wisconsin shares a border with Canada to its north and Illinois to its south

      - Louisiana is one of the southernmost states in the continental US

      - Wisconsin is significantly farther north than Louisiana


      Step 4: Since Pepin County is in Wisconsin and Calcasieu Parish is in Louisiana,
      Pepin County must be north of Calcasieu Parish, regardless of their specific
      locations within their respective states.


      YES, Pepin County, WI is located north of Calcasieu Parish, LA.'

      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - Sanders County is in Montana (MT)

      - Inyo County is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Montana is located in the northern United States, bordering Canada.

      - California is located on the west coast, extending from the Mexican border
      northward.


      Step 3: More specifically locate these counties.

      - Sanders County is in northwestern Montana.

      - Inyo County is in eastern California, containing parts of Death Valley and
      the Sierra Nevada mountains.


      Step 4: Compare latitudes.

      - Montana as a state is entirely north of most of California.

      - Sanders County, being in Montana, is significantly further north than Inyo
      County, which is in the central-eastern portion of California.


      Based on this analysis, Sanders County, MT is indeed located north of Inyo County,
