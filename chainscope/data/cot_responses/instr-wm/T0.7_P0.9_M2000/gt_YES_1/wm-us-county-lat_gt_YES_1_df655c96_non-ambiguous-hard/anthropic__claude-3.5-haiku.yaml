      1. First, locate Washakie County, Wyoming on a map

      - Washakie County is in north-central Wyoming

      - It is situated in the north-central part of the state


      2. Next, locate Crane County, Texas on a map

      - Crane County is in western Texas

      - It is located in the southwestern part of the state


      3. Compare their latitudes

      - Wyoming is north of Texas

      - Washakie County''s latitude is higher (more northerly) than Crane County''s
      latitude


      4. Conclusion: Since Washakie County is in Wyoming (north) and Crane County
