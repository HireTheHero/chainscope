      is a regency (kabupaten) in Bali, Indonesia.

      2. **Identify Mulakuzha:** This appears to be a village in Kerala, India.

      3. **Compare population sizes:**  A regency is an administrative division significantly
      larger than a village.  Therefore, it''s highly probable Buleleng Regency has
      a larger population than the village of Mulakuzha.


      YES

    eea7f16b-d9c9-4076-a24c-1b2586b11551: '1. **Identify Buleleng Regency:** Buleleng
      Regency is a regency (kabupaten) of Bali, Indonesia. This implies a significant
      population.


      2. **Identify Mulakuzha:** Mulakuzha is a village in the Alappuzha district
      of Kerala, India.  Villages generally have smaller populations than regencies.


      3. **Compare likely populations:** A regency will almost certainly have a much
      larger population than a single village.


      Therefore, YES.
