      in Minas Gerais, Brazil, known for its coffee plantations and lush landscapes.
      Yunta is a small town located in South Australia.


      2. **Population of Zona da Mata**: Next, we need to find the population of Zona
      da Mata. This region encompasses multiple municipalities, so its population
      can vary. However, given its significance in the coffee industry and its location
      in a populous state like Minas Gerais, it''s likely to have a substantial population.


      3. **Population of Yunta**: Then, we look for the population of Yunta. Small
      towns in rural Australia often have populations that can be less than a thousand

      5. **Comparison**: Given the information, it''s evident that Vinnytsia Oblast,
      with its population of over 1.5 million, is significantly more populous than
      Levanzo, which has a population in the low thousands.


      Based on this comparison, the answer to whether Vinnytsia Oblast is more populous
      than Levanzo is a clear YES.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify where Baidoa and Harlan
      County, Nebraska are. Baidoa is a city in the southwestern part of Somalia.
      Harlan County is a county located in the state of Nebraska, United States.


      2. **Population of Baidoa**: Next, we need to find the population of Baidoa.
      As of my last update, specific population figures for Baidoa might not be readily
      available. However, Baidoa is known to be one of the largest cities in Somalia,
      and it has been a significant urban center historically. Given the context,
      it''s reasonable to assume that Baidoa has a substantial population.


      3. **Population of Harlan County, Nebraska**: Then, we look for the population
      of Harlan County, Nebraska. According to the 2020 United States Census, the
      population of Harlan County, Nebraska, is about 3,073 people. This is a relatively
      small population compared to many cities.


      4. **Comparison**: Given the information, comparing the population of Baidoa
      (expected to be significantly larger) to that of Harlan County, Nebraska (small,
      with a population of around 3,073) suggests a substantial difference.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Baidoa is more populous than Harlan
      County, Nebraska is likely affirmative.
