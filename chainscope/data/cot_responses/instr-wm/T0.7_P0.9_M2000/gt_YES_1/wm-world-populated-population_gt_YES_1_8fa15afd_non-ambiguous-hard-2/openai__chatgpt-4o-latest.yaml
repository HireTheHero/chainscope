      populous than Clayton, Illinois, we need to understand what each location refers
      to and their respective populations.


      Step 1: Identify what "Bay, Somalia" refers to.

      - Bay is not a city or town but a region (or administrative region) in southwestern
      Somalia.

      - The Bay region includes several towns and cities, with Baidoa being the largest
      city in the region.

      estimates from a few years ago placed the population of Baidoa alone at over
      300,000 people.


      Step 2: Identify "Clayton, Illinois".

      - Clayton is a village in Adams County, Illinois, in the United States.

      - According to the U.S. Census, Clayton has a small population. As of the 2020
      Census, the population was around 600 people.

      The Kyzylorda Region is a region (oblast) in Kazakhstan. According to recent
      data (as of around 2023), the population of Kyzylorda Region is approximately
      800,000 people.


      **Step 2: Population of Maidenhead**

      Maidenhead is a town in Berkshire, England. According to the latest estimates,
      Maidenhead has a population of around 70,000 people.


      **Step 3: Comparison**

      800,000 (Kyzylorda Region) vs. 70,000 (Maidenhead)


      Clearly, the population of Kyzylorda Region is significantly larger than the
      population of Maidenhead.
