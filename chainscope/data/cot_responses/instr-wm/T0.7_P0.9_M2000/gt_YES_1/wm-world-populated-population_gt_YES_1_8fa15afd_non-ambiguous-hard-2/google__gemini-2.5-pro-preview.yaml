      Brazil. It comprises many municipalities.

      2.  **What is its approximate population?** As a significant region in a populous

      2.  **Estimate Marion County''s Population:** Indianapolis is a major U.S. city.
      Marion County, which is consolidated with Indianapolis ("Unigov"), has a population
      in the high hundreds of thousands. A quick check shows it was around 969,000
      as of 2023 estimates.

      3.  **Identify Bekoji:** Bekoji is a town in central Ethiopia, located in the
      Arsi Zone of the Oromia Region. It is famous for being the birthplace of many
      world-class long-distance runners.

      4.  **Estimate Bekoji''s Population:** As a town, its population will be significantly
      smaller than a major U.S. county containing a state capital. Estimates for Bekoji''s
      population are typically in the range of 16,000 to 25,000 people.

      5.  **Compare:** 969,000 (Marion County) is vastly greater than ~20,000 (Bekoji).


      Therefore, Marion County, Indiana is more populous than Bekoji.

      2.  **Estimate the population of the Sahel Region:** Given its vastness and
      the number of countries (or parts of countries) it encompasses, the Sahel Region
      has a very large population. Estimates vary depending on the precise definition,
      but it''s well over 100 million people (figures often range from 135 million
      to over 150 million).

      3.  **Identify Mundgod:** Mundgod is a town (a panchayat town) in the Uttara
      Kannada district of the Indian state of Karnataka. It is notably home to a large
      Tibetan refugee settlement, one of the largest in India.

      4.  **Estimate the population of Mundgod:** As a town, its population is significantly
      smaller. The 2011 census for Mundgod town was around 18,866. The Tibetan settlement
      (Doeguling) has a population of around 14,000-16,000. Even if we consider the
      entire Mundgod Taluk (sub-district), the population was around 106,000 in 2011.

      5.  **Compare the populations:** The Sahel Region (over 100 million people)
      has a vastly larger population than Mundgod (which, even if we consider the
      entire taluk, is around 100,000, and the town itself is much smaller).


      Therefore, the Sahel Region is significantly more populous than Mundgod.


      YES'
    d085b944-32e7-4569-a052-ca070a435cd0: 'Okay, here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the Sahel Region:** The Sahel is a vast eco-climatic and biogeographic
      region of transition in Africa between the Sahara Desert to the north and the
      Sudanian savanna to the south. It stretches across several countries, including
      Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria (northern part), Chad,
      Sudan, and Eritrea.

      2.  **Estimate the population of the Sahel Region:** Given it spans multiple
      countries and large territories within them, its population is substantial.
      For example, the "G5 Sahel" countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania,
      Niger) alone had a combined population estimated at around 80-90 million in
      recent years, and the broader geographical Sahel region encompassing parts of
      other countries would be even larger, likely well over 100 million people. Some
      estimates put the population of the broader Sahel region closer to 135 million
      or more.

      3.  **Identify Mundgod:** Mundgod is a town (and a taluk, an administrative
      division) in the Uttara Kannada district of the Indian state of Karnataka. It
      is notably home to a large Tibetan refugee settlement.

      4.  **Estimate the population of Mundgod:** As a town, Mundgod''s population
      according to the 2011 Indian census was 18,866. The Mundgod Taluk (a larger
      administrative area including the town and surrounding villages) had a population
      of around 105,729 in 2011. Even allowing for significant growth since then,
      the population of Mundgod (even the entire taluk) would be in the tens of thousands
      or low hundreds of thousands.

      5.  **Compare the populations:** The Sahel Region (well over 100 million people)
      has a vastly larger population than Mundgod (a town of around 20,000 or a taluk
      of around 100,000-150,000).


      Therefore, the Sahel Region is significantly more populous than Mundgod.
