    d3b0b7be-8ca1-45a4-9dc7-edce8151625d: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll need to find the population of Bay, Somalia

      - After careful research, I cannot find reliable population data for a place
      called "Bay" in Somalia

      - Somalia has a region called Bay, but specific population figures are not readily
      available


      2. Next, I''ll look at Clayton, Illinois

      - Clayton, Illinois is a very small town

      - According to the 2010 census, Clayton had a population of around 450-500 people


      3. Comparing the two:

      - Without definitive population data for Bay, Somalia, I cannot confidently

      - However, given the lack of clear population information for Bay, Somalia,
      I cannot confirm it has more than 500 people

      more populous than Clayton, Illinois
