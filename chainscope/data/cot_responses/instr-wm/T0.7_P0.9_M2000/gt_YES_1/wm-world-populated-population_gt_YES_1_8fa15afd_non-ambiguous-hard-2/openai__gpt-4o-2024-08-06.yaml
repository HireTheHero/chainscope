      1. **Bishnupur Subdivision**: Bishnupur is a subdivision in the Bankura district
      in the state of West Bengal, India. Subdivisions in India, especially in states
      like West Bengal, tend to have large populations, often in the hundreds of thousands
      or even millions.


      2. **Middle Bass Island**: This is an island located in Lake Erie, part of the
      state of Ohio, USA. The population of Middle Bass Island is very small, often
      in the hundreds, as it is primarily a residential and vacation area rather than
      a densely populated region.


      Given these considerations, Bishnupur subdivision, being a significant administrative
      region in a densely populated country like India, is almost certainly more populous
      than Middle Bass Island, which has a very small population.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'

      Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Sudan, and Eritrea. It is not a single
      city or town but a large geographical area.


      2. **Population of the Sahel Region**: As the Sahel spans multiple countries
      and encompasses many cities and towns, its total population is quite large,
      running into tens of millions.


      3. **Identify Mundgod**: Mundgod is a town in the Indian state of Karnataka.

      town.


      4. **Population of Mundgod**: The population of Mundgod is significantly smaller
      than that of the entire Sahel Region, as it is a town and not a large geographical
      area like the Sahel.

      Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Sudan, and Eritrea. It is not a single administrative
      region, but rather a geographical zone. The combined population of the countries

      for hosting Tibetan settlements. The population of Mundgod is significantly
      smaller, likely in the tens of thousands, based on typical town sizes in India.
