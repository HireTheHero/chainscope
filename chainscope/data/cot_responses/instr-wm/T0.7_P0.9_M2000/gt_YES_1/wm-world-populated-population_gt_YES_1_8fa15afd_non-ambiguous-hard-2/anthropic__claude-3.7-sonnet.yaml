      Bishnupur subdivision, being in densely populated West Bengal, India, would
      likely have tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of residents.


      Middle Bass Island is very small with limited year-round residents - likely
      only a few hundred people at most. According to available data, Middle Bass
      Island has fewer than 100 permanent residents.


      Step 4: Compare the populations.

      Given that Bishnupur subdivision is in a densely populated region of India and
      would contain multiple settlements, while Middle Bass Island is a small vacation
      island with minimal permanent population, Bishnupur subdivision would be significantly
      more populous.


      YES, Bishnupur subdivision is more populous than Middle Bass Island.'

      Step 1: Identify both locations.

      - Bishnupur subdivision appears to be an administrative division in India (likely
      in West Bengal).

      - Middle Bass Island is a small island in Lake Erie, Ohio, USA.


      Step 2: Research population figures.

      - Bishnupur subdivision, as an administrative division in India, likely has
      tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of residents.

      - Middle Bass Island is a small island with very limited permanent population,
      likely in the dozens or few hundred residents.


      Step 3: Compare the scales.

      - Indian subdivisions typically contain multiple towns/villages and have substantial
      populations.

      - Small islands in the Great Lakes typically have very small permanent populations.


      Step 4: Make a reasonable conclusion based on the typical scale difference.

      - Bishnupur subdivision almost certainly has a population in the thousands or
      tens of thousands at minimum.

      - Middle Bass Island likely has fewer than 500 permanent residents.


      YES, Bishnupur subdivision is more populous than Middle Bass Island.'
