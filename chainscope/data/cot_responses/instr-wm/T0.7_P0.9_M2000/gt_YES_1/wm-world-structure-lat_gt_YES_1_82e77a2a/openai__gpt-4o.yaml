    3bf64a7f-1bd4-4e54-9efb-d32e21ace877: 'To determine whether the Fitzroy Tavern
      is located north of Burdett Road railway station, we need to establish the locations
      of both places and their relative positions.


      1. **Identify the location of Fitzroy Tavern**: The Fitzroy Tavern is a pub
      located in the Fitzrovia area of London, specifically on Charlotte Street.


      2. **Identify the location of Burdett Road railway station**: There is no current
      railway station named Burdett Road. However, there was a station by that name
      in East London, which was closed in 1941. It was located near Mile End, in the
      East End of London.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Fitzrovia (where the Fitzroy Tavern
      is located) is in Central London, north of the River Thames. The former Burdett
      Road station was located in the East End, which is generally east of Central
      London.


      Considering these positions: Fitzrovia is west of Mile End, not north. However,
      Fitzrovia is generally north in terms of latitude compared to the former location
      of Burdett Road station.


      Thus, the answer is:


      YES.'

      2. **Location of Burdett Road railway station**: Burdett Road railway station
      was a railway station located in the Limehouse area in East London. It was closed
      in 1941 and no longer exists, but historically, it was situated near the intersection
      of Burdett Road and the railway lines in East London.


      3. **Comparison of Locations**: Fitzrovia, where Fitzroy Tavern is located,
      is in central London, generally to the northwest of Limehouse, where the former

      End of London.


      Now, let''s consider their relative positions geographically:


      - Fitzrovia, where the Fitzroy Tavern is located, is in central London, north
      of the River Thames and generally considered to be part of the West End.

      - Limehouse, where Burdett Road railway station was located, is in East London,

      2. Identify the location of Burdett Road railway station: There is no railway
      station specifically named "Burdett Road railway station." However, Burdett
      Road is a road in the East End of London, near Mile End. The closest station
      to this road is likely Mile End Station.

      2. **Stephen Joseph Theatre**: This theatre is also located in Scarborough,
      North Yorkshire, England.


      Given that both theatres are in Scarborough, we need specific addresses or locations
      within the town to compare their relative positions. Without precise details
      on their exact locations within Scarborough, we cannot definitively say whether
      one is north of the other.


      In the absence of specific locational data, I cannot provide a definitive yes
      or no answer. However, based on historical data and maps, the Futurist Theatre
      was located on Foreshore Road, which is generally south of the Stephen Joseph
      Theatre on Westborough.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**, the Futurist Theatre was not located north
      of the Stephen Joseph Theatre.'

      1. **Locate Lake Gregory**: Lake Gregory is situated in Nuwara Eliya, which
      is a city in the central part of Sri Lanka.


      2. **Locate St. Anthony''s Shrine, Kochchikade**: This shrine is located in
      Kochchikade, a neighborhood in Colombo, which is on the western coast of Sri
      Lanka.


      3. **Compare the geographic positions**: Nuwara Eliya is in the central highlands
      of Sri Lanka, while Colombo, where Kochchikade is located, is on the western
      coast.


      4. **Determine the relative north-south position**: Nuwara Eliya is situated
      to the east and slightly south of Colombo. Therefore, geographically, Lake Gregory
      in Nuwara Eliya is south of St. Anthony''s Shrine in Kochchikade.


      Given this information, the answer is:


      NO.'
