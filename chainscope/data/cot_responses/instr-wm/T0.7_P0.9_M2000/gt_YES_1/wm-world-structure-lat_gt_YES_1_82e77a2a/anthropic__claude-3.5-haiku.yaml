    08c53b5f-b474-4ef4-9655-6e2a4a7c3deb: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Fitzroy Tavern:

      - Fitzroy Tavern is located in central London

      - Specifically, it is on Charlotte Street in the Fitzrovia area of London


      2. Next, I''ll locate Burdett Road railway station:

      - Burdett Road is located in the East London area, specifically in Mile End

      - This is quite far from Fitzrovia


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Fitzroy Tavern is in central London (west/central)

      - Burdett Road railway station is in East London

      - Central London is generally west of East London


      4. Determining north/south orientation:

      - Since Fitzroy Tavern is west/central and Burdett Road is east, Fitzroy Tavern
      would indeed be north of Burdett Road railway station


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      4. Without being certain of their exact locations, I cannot confidently determine
      whether one is north of the other.

      3. Concordia Station is located in the interior of the Antarctic continent,
      specifically in the high plateau region known as Dome C.


      4. Dome C is located in the Australian Antarctic Territory, which is in East
      Antarctica.


      5. Ross Island, where Scott Base is located, is in the Ross Dependency region
      of Antarctica.


      6. Geographically, Dome C (Concordia Station) is further south than Ross Island
      (Scott Base).


      7. Therefore, Concordia Station is NOT located north of Scott Base.


      Answer: NO'

      3. I''ll determine their relative positions


      Step 1: Thomson Dam location

      - Thomson Dam is located in the Baw Baw Shire in Victoria

      - It is situated in the Thomson River valley, east of Melbourne


      Step 2: Monash Freeway location

      - The Monash Freeway runs southeast from Melbourne

      - It passes through the southeastern suburbs of Melbourne


      Step 3: Relative positioning

      - Thomson Dam is located northeast of Melbourne

      - The Monash Freeway runs southeast of Melbourne

      - Therefore, Thomson Dam is north of the Monash Freeway

      - Therefore, San Clemente Dam''s location is north of Santorini


      5. Conclusion:

      The San Clemente Dam is indeed located north of St. John the Baptist Cathedral,
      Santorini.
