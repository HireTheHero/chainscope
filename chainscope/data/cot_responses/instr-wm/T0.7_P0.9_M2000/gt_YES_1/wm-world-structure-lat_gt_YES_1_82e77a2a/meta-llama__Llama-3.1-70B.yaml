      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of the
      two churches mentioned. The question specifies that both are located in Burlington,
      Vermont.


      2. **Determine Geographic Coordinates**: Next, we need to find the geographic
      coordinates of each church. These coordinates will help us determine their relative
      positions.


      3. **Compare the Coordinates**: Once we have the coordinates, we can compare
      them to see which church is located further north. In this case, we''re interested
      in the latitude coordinates.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the comparison of the coordinates, we can determine
      whether the Cathedral Church of St. Paul is located north of the Cathedral of
      the Immaculate Conception.


      Based on the steps above, the question of whether the Cathedral Church of St.
      Paul is located north of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception can be answered
      by comparing their geographic coordinates. Since the question is about the relative
      positions of the two churches in Burlington, Vermont, and not about specific
      directions like north, south, east, or west, the answer can be determined based
      on the latitude coordinates.

      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Both Lake Mulwala and Hume Dam are located

      Alps to the south, so both locations are south of the Alps.

      3. **Compare Positions**: To determine if one is north of the other, we need

      River in New South Wales, Australia.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we need to understand the geographic
      positions of these locations relative to each other. Lake Mulwala is situated
      in the northeast corner of Victoria, Australia, near the border with New South
      Wales. Hume Dam is located further upstream on the Murray River, which flows

      2. **Determine the relative positions**: Rome is a city with a complex layout,

      step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Maharana Pratap Sagar and Khushab Nuclear Complex. Maharana Pratap Sagar is
      a reservoir located in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, while Khushab Nuclear
      Complex is a nuclear facility situated in the Punjab province of Pakistan.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we need to understand the geographic
      positions of these locations relative to each other. Maharana Pratap Sagar is
      located in the northern part of India, specifically in Himachal Pradesh. Khushab
      Nuclear Complex is located in the northeastern part of Pakistan, in the Punjab
      province.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Now, compare their positions in terms of north-south
      orientation. Since both locations are in different countries, we need to consider
      their positions on the global map. India is located to the south of Pakistan.
      Therefore, Maharana Pratap Sagar, being in northern India, is indeed located
      to the south of Khushab Nuclear Complex, which is in northeastern Pakistan.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographic positions and the comparison, we
      can conclude that Maharana Pratap Sagar is not located north of Khushab Nuclear
      Complex. Instead, it is located to the south.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      \ north of Monash Freeway, let's break down the information step by step:\n\n\
      1. **Identify Locations**:\n   - **Thomson Dam**: The Thomson Dam is a reservoir\
      \ located in the state of Victoria, Australia. It is situated within the Thomson\
      \ River catchment area.\n   - **Monash Freeway**: The Monash Freeway is a major\
      \ highway in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It runs through the southeastern\

      \ is 37.85\xB0S, which is slightly north of Monash Freeway's latitude of 37.88\xB0\
      S.\n   - Therefore, based on the geographic coordinates, Thomson Dam is located\
      \ north of Monash Freeway.\n\nBased on the steps above, the question of whether\
      \ Thomson Dam is located north of Monash Freeway can be answered by comparing\

      is located in Yangon, Myanmar, while 54 University Avenue is in Toronto, Canada.

      north of Hilton Cardiff, we can follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Chelsea Old Church is located in Chelsea, London,
      England. Hilton Cardiff is in Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom.


      2. **Determine geographic positions**: Chelsea is in the western part of London,
      while Cardiff is in the southern part of Wales.


      3. **Compare positions**: When comparing the positions, we can see that Chelsea
      is located east of Cardiff. This means that Hilton Cardiff is to the west of
      Chelsea Old Church.


      4. **Directional comparison**: The question asks whether Chelsea Old Church
      is located north of Hilton Cardiff. Since north is in the opposite direction
      of west, we can conclude that Chelsea Old Church is not located north of Hilton
      Cardiff.


      Based on these steps, we can conclude that Chelsea Old Church is **not** located
      north of Hilton Cardiff. The answer is: **NO**'
