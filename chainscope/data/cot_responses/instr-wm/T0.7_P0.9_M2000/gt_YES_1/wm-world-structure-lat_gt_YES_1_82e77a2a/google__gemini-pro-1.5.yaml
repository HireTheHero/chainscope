      (like Google Maps or Bing Maps), we can find the precise coordinates of each
      church.


      3. **Compare the latitude coordinates:** The church located further north will
      have a higher latitude value.


      4. **Formulate the answer:** Based on the comparison of latitude coordinates,
      we can determine if St. Stanislaus is north of Saint Sava.

      * **Shrine Church of St. Stanislaus:**  Merrillville, IN 46410 (Approximate

      * **Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church:** Merrillville, IN 46410 (Approximate
      coordinates: 41.4792, -87.3173)

      USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) was sunk in the North Atlantic near Greenland. Hvalsey

      two locations is relatively close. However, a shipwreck can shift position.  Without

      church.

      3. **North/South Relationship:**  Santorini is in the Mediterranean Sea, considerably
      east of California.  Therefore, the concept of "north" is relative.  While one
      might be at a higher latitude than the other, the significant longitudinal difference
      makes a simple north/south comparison less meaningful in the context of the
      question. However, for the sake of argument, let''s consider latitudinal position.


      4. **Latitude Check:** Santorini (Greece) is at a significantly higher latitude
      than California.


      5. **Conclusion:** Since Santorini is considerably east and at a higher latitude
      than the location of San Clemente Dam, the dam is *not* north of the cathedral.

      Monica Boulevard, also in West Hollywood.  Sunset Strip generally runs east-west,
      and Santa Monica Boulevard runs at an angle, but generally east-west as well.  The
      crucial point is that Sunset Strip is north of Santa Monica Boulevard in the
      area of West Hollywood where these clubs existed.

      English Disco was located at 8175 Sunset Blvd.  The Starwood was at 8151 Sunset
      Blvd.  Lower street numbers on Sunset generally correspond to more westerly
      locations.  Since they''re both on the same street, and one isn''t numerically

      is a large lake in Yangon, Myanmar. 54 University Avenue is an address, also
      likely in Yangon (given the context).


      2. **Determine relative position:**  We need to figure out if Inya Lake is north
      of 54 University Avenue. This requires knowing the general layout of Yangon
      or consulting a map.


      3. **Consult a map:** A quick search shows that 54 University Avenue is located
      south of Inya Lake.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.
