      1. First, let''s locate both places:

      - Fitzroy Tavern is in central London, specifically in Fitzrovia area near Tottenham
      Court Road

      - Burdett Road railway station is in East London, near Mile End


      2. In London, when comparing north/south positions:

      - Fitzrovia is in central London, roughly around W1

      - Burdett Road station is in E3 area

      - Both are fairly close to the Thames, but Fitzroy Tavern is definitely further
      north


      3. Looking at their specific positions:

      - Fitzroy Tavern is north of the Thames

      - Burdett Road station is north of the Thames too, but in a more southern position
      compared to Fitzroy Tavern


      Therefore: YES'

      - Anything in the northern suburbs would be north of downtown Chicago

      - Therefore, Skokie Lagoons must be north of Big Pink

      - The Cathedral is around 13th St (based on its address being 1347)

      - The Emerson is on 10th St


      4. Since the Cathedral is around 13th St and the Emerson is on 10th St, and

      4. Looking at the river''s flow: Hume Dam is upstream (east) of Lake Mulwala


      5. Since they''re both on roughly the same latitude and the river flows west,
      Lake Mulwala is not north of Hume Dam - it''s actually west of it
