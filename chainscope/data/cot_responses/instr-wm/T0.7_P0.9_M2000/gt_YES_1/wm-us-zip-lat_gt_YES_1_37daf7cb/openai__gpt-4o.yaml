      1. **Locate 07446, NJ**: This zip code corresponds to Ramsey, New Jersey, which
      is in the northern part of New Jersey.


      2. **Locate 44281, OH**: This zip code corresponds to Wadsworth, Ohio, which
      is located in the northeastern part of Ohio.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Generally, New Jersey is located to the east of
      Ohio. However, to determine which location is further north, we should compare
      their latitudinal positions.


      - Ramsey, NJ (07446) is situated at approximately 41.057 latitude.

      - Wadsworth, OH (44281) is situated at approximately 41.025 latitude.

      north of 22042, VA, we need to establish the geographical positions of these
      two ZIP codes.


      1. **Locate 64082, MO:** This ZIP code corresponds to Lees Summit, Missouri.
      Missouri is located in the Midwestern region of the United States.


      2. **Locate 22042, VA:** This ZIP code corresponds to Falls Church, Virginia.
      Virginia is located in the Southeastern/Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.


      3. **Compare Latitude:** Since both ZIP codes are in the United States, the
      primary consideration for "north" in this context is latitude. Lees Summit,
      MO (64082) is generally further north than Falls Church, VA (22042).


      Therefore, based on their geographical positions, ZIP code 64082 in Missouri
      is located north of ZIP code 22042 in Virginia.

      1. **Understanding Zip Code Patterns**: In the United States, zip codes generally
      increase from east to west and from north to south, but there are exceptions.
      Vermont zip codes typically start with "05" because Vermont is in the northeastern
      part of the US.

      VT, which is located slightly to the north-central part of Vermont.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Richmond (05477) is generally southwest of Stowe
