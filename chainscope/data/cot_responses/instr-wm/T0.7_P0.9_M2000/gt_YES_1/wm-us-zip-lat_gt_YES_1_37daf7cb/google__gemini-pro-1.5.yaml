      than 54474, suggesting it might be further north.


      3. **State & Magnitude Combined:** Since Minnesota is north of Wisconsin, and
      the Minnesota zip code is numerically larger (which often indicates further
      north within a state), it''s highly likely 55055, MN is north of 54474, WI.

      and WI is Wisconsin.  Minnesota is generally north of Wisconsin.


      2. **Zip Code Significance within a State:** While zip codes generally increase
      from east to west, they also reflect a north-south component, especially across
      state lines.  Since MN is north of WI, a lower zip code in MN is likely still
      north of a higher zip code in WI.

      north of Wisconsin.

      2. **Zip Code Numbering:**  While zip codes generally increase from east to

      location, particularly across state lines.  Therefore, the numerical difference
      between 55055 and 54474 is not a reliable indicator on its own.

      codes generally increase as you move from east to west, and north to south.
      Since Minnesota is west and north of Wisconsin, the higher zip code further

      2. **General US Geography:** Louisiana is east of Texas.  Latitude changes as
      you go north/south. Longitude changes as you go east/west.

      3. **North/South determination is based on latitude:**  Since Louisiana is east
      of Texas, the north/south relationship isn''t directly determined by the state.
      We need to look at the specific locations within each state.  A zip code in
      western Texas could be west *and* south of a zip code in eastern Louisiana.

      4. **We need more information:**  While zip codes give a general location, we''d
      need to look up the latitude of each zip code to definitively determine which
      is further north.  We cannot determine this solely from the zip codes and state
      abbreviations.

      way to determine relative north/south placement, especially across state lines.  State

    fb573594-e50d-40ae-97ac-f1f1955e78dc: '1. **Identify the states:** Both zip codes
      are in Pennsylvania (PA), so we don''t need to consider different states.

      2. **Interpret the first two digits:** The first two digits of a US zip code
      broadly represent a geographic area from east to west.  159 indicates a more
      easterly location than 151.

      3. **Consider north/south:** Since Pennsylvania is generally oriented east-west,
      with lower numbers to the west, the east-west distinction is more relevant than
      a small difference in the remaining digits.  A zip code further east is unlikely
      to be significantly north or south of a zip code slightly further west.

      4. **Look up if needed:**  While not strictly necessary, a quick zip code lookup
      confirms 15909 is Johnstown, PA and 15140 is McKeesport, PA. Johnstown is slightly
      west and north of McKeesport.

      Indiana, and OH refers to Ohio.


      2. **General US Geography:** Indiana is generally west of Ohio.  While some
      parts of Indiana might be slightly north of *some* parts of Ohio,  we need to
      consider the specific zip codes.


      3. **Zip Code Proximity:** 46506 is in Elkhart, Indiana. 44065 is in Mentor,
      Ohio. Mentor is considerably east of Elkhart.  Since we''re dealing with a significant
      east-west difference, the slight north-south variations between the states become
      less relevant.  Elkhart is mostly west, not north, of Mentor.


      4. **Conclusion:**  Elkhart (46506, IN) is NOT north of Mentor (44065, OH).

      3. **Specific Latitude Comparison (needed but not provided):** To definitively
      determine which zip code is further north, we need to know the latitude of each.  Zip
      codes alone don''t give precise latitude.


      Since I don''t have the latitude information, I can''t definitively answer.  However,
      given Indiana''s location west of Ohio, it''s *likely* but not guaranteed that

      is not directly determined by the state.  We need to look at the zip code''s

      westward offset makes a definitive answer based on zip codes alone difficult.  It''s
