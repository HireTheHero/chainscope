      2) Recall the general zip code pattern:

      - First digit represents a certain geographical area

      - Higher first digits generally = further west

      - Within same first digit, higher second digits generally = further south


      3) Looking at the zip codes:

      - 46235 starts with 4

      - 43125 starts with 4

      - So they''re in the same general region


      4) Compare second digits:

      - 46235 has 6 as second digit

      - 43125 has 3 as second digit

      - Since 6 > 3, 46235 is SOUTH of 43125


      5) Since 46235 is SOUTH of 43125, it cannot be NORTH of it.
