      3. **Latitude comparison**: To determine if one location is north of the other,
      we need to compare their latitudes. The latitude of a location tells us how
      far north or south it is. Without specific latitude values for these zip codes,
      we can use general knowledge about the states'' positions. California is known
      to be west of Georgia, but its latitude is not necessarily higher than Georgia''s.


      4. **Conclusion based on state positions**: Since California is west of Georgia,
      it does not necessarily mean that any location in California (like 90274) is
      north of any location in Georgia (like 30332). The latitudes of these states
      overlap, so the north-south relationship is not straightforward based solely
      on the states'' positions.


      Therefore, based on the states'' general geographic locations, the answer to
      whether 30332, GA is located north of 90274, CA is: **NO**'

      1. **Identify the locations**: The zip code 37221 is located in Nashville, TN,
      and the zip code 37918 is located in Knoxville, TN.


      2. **General geographic knowledge**: Nashville is generally located in the central
      part of Tennessee, while Knoxville is located in the eastern part of the state.


      3. **Latitude comparison**: To determine if one location is north of the other,
      we need to compare their latitudes. The latitude of a location tells us how
      far north or south it is. Without specific latitude values for these zip codes,
      we can use general knowledge about the cities'' positions. Nashville is known
      to be north of Knoxville.


      4. **Conclusion based on city positions**: Since Nashville is north of Knoxville,
      it follows that 37221, TN (Nashville) is generally north of 37918, TN (Knoxville).

      - **55038** corresponds to Hugo, MN.


      Given these locations, Mound (55316) and Hugo (55038) are relatively close to

      Mound is slightly north and west of Hugo.


      Therefore, based on this general understanding and without precise GPS coordinates
      or a detailed map to confirm the exact relative positions, it seems that 55316
      (Mound) might be slightly north of 55038 (Hugo), considering their proximity
      and the general geography of the area.


      However, this reasoning is based on general geographical knowledge and might
      not accurately reflect the precise locations or the definition of "north" in
      a strict directional sense.

      of 15140, PA, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to identify where these zip codes are
      located in Pennsylvania (PA).

      2. **Use of Zip Code Database or Map**: Typically, we would refer to a zip code
      database or a map to find the exact locations of these zip codes.

      3. **Compare Locations**: Once we have the locations, we can compare them to
      determine their relative positions, specifically whether 15909 is north of 15140.


      Without access to real-time data or a specific database at this moment, I can
      suggest a general approach based on typical knowledge:


      - **15909** corresponds to South Fork, PA.

      - **15140** corresponds to Munhall, PA.


      Given these locations, South Fork (15909) is located in Cambria County, PA,
      which is in the western part of the state, close to the border with West Virginia.
      Munhall (15140) is located in Allegheny County, PA, which is also in the western
      part of the state, near Pittsburgh.


      Considering the general geography:

      - South Fork is more to the southwest of Pennsylvania.

      - Munhall is more central and slightly north of South Fork.


      Therefore, based on this general understanding and without precise GPS coordinates
      or a detailed map to confirm the exact relative positions, it seems that 15909
      (South Fork) might not be directly north of 15140 (Munhall), considering Munhall''s
      more central and slightly northern position relative to South Fork.


      However, this reasoning is based on general geographical knowledge and might
      not accurately reflect the precise locations or the definition of "north" in
      a strict directional sense.

      1. **Identify the locations**: The zip codes 15909 and 15140 are both in Pennsylvania
      (PA).

      2. **General geographic location of Pennsylvania**: Pennsylvania is located
      in the northeastern United States.

      3. **Latitude comparison**: To determine if one location is north of the other,
      we need to compare their latitudes. The latitude of a location tells us how
      far north or south it is. Without specific latitude values for these zip codes,
      we can use general knowledge about the states'' positions. Pennsylvania is known
      to be in the northeastern part of the United States, which is generally north
      of many other states.

      4. **Conclusion based on state positions**: Since Pennsylvania is in the northeastern
      United States, any location within Pennsylvania (like 15909) is generally north
      of many other locations in the country. However, we cannot make a definitive
      conclusion about whether 15909 is north of 15140 without more specific information

    f2e2b03f-de19-48e3-91e1-69e0d6f40c99: 'To determine if 23111, VA is located north
      of 67216, KS, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: The zip code 23111 is located in Virginia (VA),
      and the zip code 67216 is located in Kansas (KS).


      2. **General geographic location of states**: Virginia is generally located
      in the eastern part of the United States, while Kansas is located in the central
      part of the country.


      3. **Latitude comparison**: To determine if one location is north of the other,
      we need to compare their latitudes. The latitude of a location tells us how
      far north or south it is. Without specific latitude values for these zip codes,
      we can use general knowledge about the states'' positions. Virginia is known
      to be east of Kansas, but it''s not necessarily north or south of Kansas.


      4. **Conclusion based on state positions**: Since Virginia and Kansas are not
      directly north-south of each other, we can''t definitively say that 23111, VA
      is located north of 67216, KS based on the states'' overall positions.


      Therefore, based on the states'' general geographic locations, the answer to
      whether 23111, VA is located north of 67216, KS is: **NO**'

      1. **Identify the locations**: The zip codes 60514 and 60559 are both located
      in Illinois (IL).


      2. **Use of Zip Code Database or Map**: Typically, one would refer to a zip
      code database or a map to find the exact locations of these zip codes.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Once we have the locations, we compare them to determine
      their relative positions, specifically whether 60514 is north of 60559.


      Without access to real-time data or a specific database at this moment, I can
      suggest a general approach based on typical knowledge:


      - **60514** corresponds to Clarendon Hills, IL.

      - **60559** corresponds to Westmont, IL.


      Given these locations, Clarendon Hills (60514) and Westmont (60559) are relatively
      close to each other in the Chicago metropolitan area. Clarendon Hills is a bit
      west and slightly north of Westmont.


      Considering the general geography:

      - Westmont (60559) is a suburb of Chicago, located in DuPage County.

      - Clarendon Hills (60514) is also a suburb of Chicago, located in DuPage County,
      slightly west and north of Westmont.


      Therefore, based on this general understanding and without precise GPS coordinates
      or a detailed map to confirm the exact relative positions, it seems that 60514
      (Clarendon Hills) might be slightly north of 60559 (Westmont), considering their
      proximity and general geographical relationship.


      However, this reasoning is based on general geographical knowledge and might
      not accurately reflect the precise locations or the definition of "north" in
      a strict directional sense.

      - **19131** also corresponds to Philadelphia, PA.


      Given these locations, both zip codes are in Philadelphia, PA. Philadelphia
      is a large city, and the zip codes can represent different areas within the
      city. However, to determine the exact relative positions of these zip codes,
      we need more precise information.


      Based on the information provided, it''s not clear if 19134 is located north
      of 19131. To provide a definitive answer, we would need to refer to a zip code

      far north or south it is. Without specific latitude values for these zip codes,
      we can use general knowledge about the states'' positions. Arkansas is known
      to be north of North Carolina.


      4. **Conclusion based on state positions**: Since Arkansas is north of North
      Carolina, any location within Arkansas (like 72143) is generally north of any
      location in North Carolina (like 28202), given the states'' overall positions.


      Therefore, based on the states'' general geographic locations, the answer to
      whether 72143, AR is located north of 28202, NC is: **YES**'

      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to find out the locations corresponding
      to the zip codes 14228 and 13323 in New York (NY).


      2. **Use of Zip Code Database or Map**: We can use a zip code database or a
      map to find the exact locations of these zip codes.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Once we have the locations, we can compare them to
      determine their relative positions, specifically whether 14228 is north of 13323.


      Without access to real-time data or a specific database at this moment, I can
      suggest a general approach based on typical knowledge:


      - **14228** corresponds to Buffalo, NY.

      - **13323** corresponds to Cold Brook, NY.


      Given these locations, Buffalo (14228) is in the western part of New York State,
      and Cold Brook (13323) is in the central part of the state. Buffalo is closer
      to the Canadian border and is generally located north of Cold Brook.


      Considering the general geography:

      - Buffalo is a major city in western New York, close to the Canadian border.

      - Cold Brook is a village in central New York, located south of Buffalo.


      Therefore, based on this general understanding and without precise GPS coordinates
      or a detailed map to confirm the exact relative positions, it seems that 14228
      (Buffalo) is located north of 13323 (Cold Brook).

      1. **Identify the locations**: We know that both zip codes are in Texas (TX).
      We need to find the specific locations within Texas.

      2. **Use of Zip Code Database or Map**: Typically, we would refer to a zip code
      database or a map to find the exact locations of these zip codes.

      3. **Compare Locations**: Once we have the locations, we can compare them to
      determine their relative positions, specifically whether 77061 is north of 77031.


      Without access to real-time data or a specific database at this moment, I can
      suggest a general approach based on typical knowledge:


      - **77061** corresponds to Houston, TX.

      - **77031** also corresponds to Houston, TX.


      Given these locations, both zip codes are in Houston, Texas. Houston is a large

      Considering the general geography:

      - Houston is a sprawling city with a complex layout.

      - Zip codes can change frequently and might not always follow a strict north-south
      pattern.


      Therefore, based on this general understanding and without precise GPS coordinates
      or a detailed map to confirm the exact relative positions, it''s difficult to
      say definitively whether 77061 is north of 77031 in Houston, Texas. However,
      for the purpose of this question, we''re looking for a general north-south relationship.


      Given these steps, the question asks for a definitive YES or NO answer regarding
      whether 77061, TX is located north of 77031, TX. Based on the geographical information:


      - Houston (77061) and Houston (77031) are both in the same city, and their exact
      locations within the city might not be significantly different in terms of north-south
      positioning. However, for the purpose of this question, we''re looking for a
      general north-south relationship.

    f01c1587-5204-4e26-a387-85d8c900ff91: 'To determine if 77061, TX is located north
      of 77031, TX, we can follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to identify where these zip codes are
      located in Texas (TX).

      2. **Use of Zip Code Database or Map**: Typically, we would refer to a zip code
      database or a map to find the exact locations of these zip codes.

      3. **Compare Locations**: Once we have the locations, we compare them to determine
      their relative positions, specifically whether 77061 is north of 77031.


      Without access to real-time data or a specific database at this moment, I can
      suggest a general approach based on typical knowledge:


      - **77061** corresponds to Houston, TX.

      - **77031** also corresponds to Houston, TX.


      Given these locations, Houston (77061) and Houston (77031) are in the same city,
      so their relative positions depend on the specific areas within Houston. Houston
      is a large city with many neighborhoods, and the zip codes could be referring
      to different parts of the city.


      Considering the general geography:

      - Houston is a sprawling city in Texas, and the zip codes could refer to different
      neighborhoods or areas within the city.

      - Without more specific information about the locations within Houston, it''s
      difficult to determine if 77061 is definitively north of 77031.


      Therefore, based on this general understanding and without precise information
      about the specific locations within Houston, it''s challenging to give a definitive
      YES or NO answer to whether 77061 is north of 77031. However, we can provide
      a general answer based on the city''s geography.


      **Answer**: NO

      of 92025, CA, we can follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to identify the locations of the zip
      codes 92029 and 92025 in California (CA).


      2. **Use of Zip Code Database or Map**: Typically, one would refer to a zip
      code database or a map to find the exact locations of these zip codes.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Once we have the locations, we compare them to determine
      their relative positions, specifically whether 92029 is north of 92025.


      Without access to real-time data or a specific database at this moment, I can
      suggest a general approach based on typical knowledge:


      - **92029** corresponds to Escondido, CA.

      - **92025** corresponds to Escondido, CA as well.


      Given these locations, Escondido (92029) and Escondido (92025) are in the same
      city, Escondido, California. Therefore, they are in the same general area and
      have the same latitude. The zip codes 92029 and 92025 are used for different
      parts of the city but are not significantly different in their north-south positioning.


      Therefore, based on this general understanding and without precise GPS coordinates
      or a detailed map to confirm the exact relative positions, it seems that 92029
      (Escondido) is not north of 92025 (Escondido), considering they are in the same
      city and likely have similar latitudes.


      However, this reasoning is based on general geographical knowledge and might
      not accurately reflect the precise locations or the definition of "north" in
      a strict directional sense.

      of 62208, IL, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to identify where the zip codes 62269
      and 62208 are located in Illinois (IL).


      2. **Use of Zip Code Database or Map**: Typically, one would refer to a zip
      code database or a map to find the exact locations of these zip codes.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Once we have the locations, we compare them to determine
      their relative positions, specifically whether 62269 is north of 62208.


      Without access to real-time data or a specific database at this moment, I can
      suggest a general approach based on typical knowledge:


      - **62269** corresponds to O''Fallon, IL.

      - **62208** corresponds to Fairview Heights, IL.


      Given these locations, O''Fallon (62269) and Fairview Heights (62208) are relatively
      close to each other in the southern part of Illinois. O''Fallon is north of
      Fairview Heights.


      Considering the general geography:

      - O''Fallon is directly north of Fairview Heights.


      Therefore, based on this general understanding and without precise GPS coordinates
      or a detailed map to confirm the exact relative positions, it seems that 62269
      (O''Fallon) is north of 62208 (Fairview Heights).


      However, this reasoning is based on general geographical knowledge and might
      not accurately reflect the precise locations or the definition of "north" in
      a strict directional sense.

      in a direct north-south alignment, we need to consider the specific locations
      within each state. Without looking up the exact locations of these zip codes,
      we can infer that 80010, CO is likely not north of 45432, OH, as Colorado is

      of 90048, CA, let''s follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to identify where these zip codes are
      located in California (CA).

      2. **Use a Zip Code Database or Map**: Typically, one would refer to a zip code
      database or a map to find the exact locations of these zip codes.

      3. **Compare Locations**: Once we have the locations, we compare them to determine
      their relative positions, specifically whether 91803 is north of 90048.


      Without access to real-time data or a specific database at this moment, I can
      suggest a general approach based on typical knowledge:


      - **91803** corresponds to Alhambra, CA.

      - **90048** corresponds to Los Angeles, CA.


      Given these locations, Alhambra (91803) and Los Angeles (90048) are relatively
      close to each other in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.


      Considering the general geography:

      - Alhambra is located in the San Gabriel Valley, east of downtown Los Angeles.

      - Los Angeles is the central city in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.


      Therefore, based on this general understanding and without precise GPS coordinates
      or a detailed map to confirm the exact relative positions, it seems that 91803
      (Alhambra) is not directly north of 90048 (Los Angeles), considering Los Angeles''
      central and coastal location relative to Alhambra''s more inland and slightly
      eastern position.


      However, this reasoning is based on general geographical knowledge and might
      not accurately reflect the precise locations or the definition of "north" in
      a strict directional sense.

      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to identify where the zip codes 02169
      and 01611 are located in Massachusetts (MA).


      2. **Use of Zip Code Database or Map**: Typically, one would refer to a zip
      code database or a map to find the exact locations of these zip codes.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Once we have the locations, we compare them to determine
      their relative positions, specifically whether 02169 is north of 01611.


      Without access to real-time data or a specific database at this moment, I can
      suggest a general approach based on typical knowledge:


      - **02169** corresponds to Quincy, MA.

      - **01611** corresponds to Chicopee, MA.


      Given these locations, Quincy (02169) and Chicopee (01611) are relatively far
      apart in Massachusetts. Quincy is located in the eastern part of the state,
      closer to Boston, while Chicopee is located in the western part of the state.


      Considering the general geography:

      - Quincy is coastal and located in the eastern part of the state.

      - Chicopee is inland and located in the western part of the state.


      Therefore, based on this general understanding and without precise GPS coordinates

      of 01129, MA, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: The zip codes 01107 and 01129 are both located
      in Massachusetts (MA).

      2. **Use of Zip Code Database or Map**: We can use a zip code database or a
      map to find the specific locations of these zip codes.

      3. **Compare Locations**: Once we have the locations, we can compare them to
      determine their relative positions, specifically whether 01107 is north of 01129.


      Without access to real-time data or a specific database at this moment, I can
      suggest a general approach based on typical knowledge:


      - **01107** corresponds to Springfield, MA.

      - **01129** also corresponds to Springfield, MA.


      Given these locations, both zip codes are in Springfield, Massachusetts. This
      means they are in the same city, so their relative north-south positions would
      be very close to each other. The zip codes might cover different parts of the
      city, but they are not significantly different in their north-south positions.


      Therefore, based on this general understanding and without precise GPS coordinates
      or a detailed map to confirm the exact relative positions, it seems that 01107
      and 01129 are not significantly different in their north-south positions within
      Springfield, Massachusetts.


      However, this reasoning is based on general geographical knowledge and might
      not accurately reflect the precise locations or the definition of "north" in
      a strict directional sense.

      2. **General geographic location of states**: Florida is located in the southeastern
      part of the United States, while Alabama is located in the southeastern part
      as well but more north and west of Florida.


      3. **Latitude comparison**: To determine if one location is north of the other,
      we need to compare their latitudes. The latitude of a location tells us how
      far north or south it is. Without specific latitude values for these zip codes,
      we can use general knowledge about the states'' positions. Alabama is generally
      north and west of Florida.


      4. **Conclusion based on state positions**: Since Alabama is north and west
      of Florida, any location within Alabama (like 36582) is generally north of any
      location in Florida (like 32351), given the states'' overall positions.

      Given these locations, Chicago (60622) and Chicago (60651) are both in Cook

      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to identify where the zip codes 46761
      and 50322 are located in Indiana (IN) and Iowa (IA), respectively.

      2. **Use of Zip Code Database or Map**: Typically, one would refer to a zip
      code database or a map to find the exact locations of these zip codes.

      3. **Compare Locations**: Once we have the locations, we compare them to determine
      their relative positions, specifically whether 46761 is north of 50322.


      Without access to real-time data or a specific database at this moment, I can
      suggest a general approach based on typical knowledge:


      - **46761** corresponds to Pleasant Lake, IN.

      - **50322** corresponds to Urbandale, IA.


      Given these locations, Pleasant Lake (46761) and Urbandale (50322) are relatively
      far apart, with Pleasant Lake being in northeastern Indiana and Urbandale being
      in central Iowa.


      Considering the general geography:

      - Indiana is located south of Iowa.

      - Pleasant Lake (46761) is in the northeast part of Indiana, while Urbandale
      (50322) is in the central part of Iowa.


      Therefore, based on this general understanding and without precise GPS coordinates
      or a detailed map to confirm the exact relative positions, it seems that 46761
      (Pleasant Lake) is not located north of 50322 (Urbandale), considering Indiana''s
      more southern position relative to Iowa.


      However, this reasoning is based on general geographical knowledge and might
      not accurately reflect the precise locations or the definition of "north" in
      a strict directional sense.

      2. **General geographic location of states**: California is located on the West
      Coast of the United States, while Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern
      part of the country.


      3. **Latitude comparison**: To determine if one location is north of the other,
      we need to compare their latitudes. The latitude of a location tells us how
      far north or south it is. Without specific latitude values for these zip codes,
      we can use general knowledge about the states'' positions. California is known
      to be west of Pennsylvania, but it''s not clear if it''s north or south.


      4. **Consider the relative positions**: California is on the West Coast, and
      Pennsylvania is in the northeastern part of the country. Generally, as you move
      west in the United States, you move toward lower latitudes (toward the equator).
      So, based on this general knowledge, California is likely at a lower latitude
      (further south) than Pennsylvania.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the states'' general geographic locations, it''s likely
      that 19023, PA is north of 96021, CA.


      Therefore, the answer to whether 96021, CA is located north of 19023, PA is:
      **NO**'

      1. **Identify the zip codes**: We have two zip codes - 81632 and 21074, in Colorado
      (CO) and Maryland (MD), respectively.

      2. **Understand the general geography**: Colorado is located in the western
      part of the United States, while Maryland is located in the eastern part. This
      means that Maryland is generally east of Colorado.

      3. **Latitude comparison**: To determine if one location is north of the other,
      we need to compare their latitudes. The latitude of a location tells us how
      far north or south it is. Without specific latitude values for these zip codes,
      we can use general knowledge about the states'' positions. Maryland is known
      to be east of Colorado, but it is also north of Colorado.

      4. **Conclusion based on state positions**: Since Maryland is north of Colorado,
      any location within Maryland (like 21074) is generally north of any location
      in Colorado (like 81632), given the states'' overall positions.

      1. **Identify the locations**: 01908 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA), and
      48221 is a zip code in Michigan (MI).


      2. **General geographic knowledge**: Massachusetts is located in the Northeastern
      United States, while Michigan is in the Great Lakes region in the Midwest.


      3. **Latitude comparison**: Without needing the exact latitudes, we can generally
      infer that Massachusetts, being in the Northeast, is typically at a higher latitude
      than Michigan in the Midwest. This is because as you move north in the United
      States, you approach Canada, and Massachusetts is closer to Canada than Michigan.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Massachusetts is generally north of Michigan,

      of 14607, NY, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to identify the specific locations in
      New York (NY) that correspond to the zip codes 14526 and 14607.


      2. **Use of Zip Code Database or Map**: Typically, one would refer to a zip
      code database or a map to find the exact locations of these zip codes.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Once we have the locations, we compare them to determine
      their relative positions, specifically whether 14526 is north of 14607.


      Without access to real-time data or a specific database at this moment, I can
      suggest a general approach based on typical knowledge:


      - **14526** corresponds to Penfield, NY, which is a suburb of Rochester, NY.

      - **14607** corresponds to Rochester, NY, a city in western New York.


      Given these locations, Penfield (14526) is a suburb of Rochester (14607), which
      means it is likely located near or within the same general area as Rochester.


      Considering the general geography:

      - Penfield is a suburb, so it''s generally within or near the city of Rochester.

      - Rochester is a city, so it''s typically more centralized and densely populated.


      Therefore, based on this general understanding and without precise GPS coordinates
      or a detailed map to confirm the exact relative positions, it seems that 14526
      (Penfield) might not be directly north of 14607 (Rochester), considering Rochester''s
      more central and urban location relative to Penfield''s suburban location.


      However, this reasoning is based on general geographical knowledge and might
      not accurately reflect the precise locations or the definition of "north" in
      a strict directional sense.


      **Answer**: NO

      of 11436, NY, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: 11231 corresponds to Brooklyn, NY, and 11436
      corresponds to Jamaica, NY. Both are in New York (NY).

      2. **Understand the geography of New York City**: New York City consists of
      five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island. Brooklyn
      and Queens are the two largest boroughs.

      3. **Consider the relative positions of Brooklyn and Jamaica**: Brooklyn is
      located in the southwestern part of New York City, while Jamaica is in the eastern
      part of Queens, which is northeast of Brooklyn.

      4. **Latitude comparison**: To determine if one location is north of the other,
      we need to compare their latitudes. The latitude of a location tells us how
      far north or south it is. Without specific latitude values for these zip codes,
      we can use general knowledge about the boroughs'' positions. Jamaica (11436)
      is northeast of Brooklyn (11231), which means it is generally at a higher latitude,
      or further north.

      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical positions of Brooklyn and Jamaica,
      we can conclude that 11231, NY (Brooklyn) is not located north of 11436, NY

      - **90606** corresponds to Santa Fe Springs, CA.

      - **10703** corresponds to Yonkers, NY.

      - **11789** corresponds to Sound Beach, NY.


      Given these locations, Yonkers (10703) is located in the southern part of New
      York state, just north of New York City. Sound Beach (11789) is located on Long
      Island, which is east of New York City.


      Considering the general geography:

      - Yonkers is south of Sound Beach, both being in New York state.

      - Sound Beach is on Long Island, which is east of New York City.


      Therefore, based on this general understanding and without precise GPS coordinates
      or a detailed map to confirm the exact relative positions, it seems that 10703
      (Yonkers) is not north of 11789 (Sound Beach), considering Sound Beach''s more
      eastern and northern position relative to Yonkers.


      However, this reasoning is based on general geographical knowledge and might
      not accurately reflect the precise locations or the definition of "north" in
      a strict directional sense.
