      1. First, let''s identify when Francesco Cavalli was born:

      - Francesco Cavalli was an Italian Baroque composer

      - He was born in 1602 in Crema, Italy


      2. Next, let''s identify when Benjamin of Tudela was active:

      - Benjamin of Tudela was a medieval Jewish traveler and geographer

      - He was active in the 12th century

      - Specifically, he traveled between 1165 and 1173


      3. Comparing their time periods:

      - Cavalli lived from 1602 to 1676

      - Benjamin of Tudela was active around 1165-1173

      - This means Cavalli was born nearly 430 years after Benjamin of Tudela''s travels
