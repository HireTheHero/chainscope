      NO. The question asks if the Kaiser Mountains are *located north* of Lake Mai-Ndombe.
      While they are at a higher latitude, the implication of "located north" in this
      context usually refers to relative position within a moderately sized geographical
      region, not simply being in a higher latitude.  Since they are on different
      continents, it would not be considered correct to say the Kaiser Mountains are
      *located north* of the lake.
