      Step 1: I need to identify where the Putorana Plateau is located. The Putorana
      Plateau is a large highland region in northern Siberia, Russia, located just
      south of the Taymyr Peninsula in the Arctic Circle.


      Step 2: Now I need to identify where the Ajay River is located. This is where
      I encounter an issue. I don''t have definitive information about an "Ajay River"
      in my knowledge base. There is no major river with this exact name that I''m
      aware of in relation to the Putorana Plateau.


      Step 3: The major rivers associated with the Putorana Plateau include the Yenisei,
      Khatanga, and Pyasina rivers, but not an "Ajay River."


      Step 4: Without being able to confirm the existence or location of the Ajay
      River, I cannot determine whether the Putorana Plateau is north of it.


      Given the lack of information about the Ajay River, I cannot provide a definitive
      YES or NO answer to whether the Putorana Plateau is located north of it.'
    b69d027f-46e5-445f-824b-70474035e6ba: 'I need to determine if the Putorana Plateau
      is located north of the Ajay River. Let me think step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the location of the Putorana Plateau.

      The Putorana Plateau is located in northern Siberia, Russia, specifically in
      the northern part of Central Siberia between the Yenisei and Khatanga rivers.


      Step 2: Identify the location of the Ajay River.

      There is no major river named "Ajay River" in the geographical records near
      the Putorana Plateau. The Ajay (or Ajoy) River is actually located in eastern
      India, flowing through the states of Jharkhand and West Bengal.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Since the Putorana Plateau is in northern Siberia (Russia) and the Ajay River
      is in eastern India, I can determine their relative positions. Russia is located
      significantly north of India on the globe.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      The Putorana Plateau (in northern Russia) is located far north of the Ajay River
      (in eastern India).


      NO.


      Wait, I made a mistake in my reasoning. The Putorana Plateau IS located north
      of the Ajay River, not south of it. Since Russia is north of India, and the
      Putorana Plateau is in Russia while the Ajay River is in India, the correct
      answer is:


      YES.'

      Step 1: Let me identify the Putorana Plateau''s location. The Putorana Plateau
      is located in northern Siberia, Russia, above the Arctic Circle. It''s situated
      between the Yenisei and Khatanga rivers in the Central Siberian Plateau.


      Step 2: Now I need to identify the Ajay River''s location. After checking geographical
      information, I don''t find a major river called "Ajay River" in the geographical
      records. There is an Ajay River in India (also spelled Ajoy), which flows through
      the Indian states of Jharkhand and West Bengal.


      Step 3: Compare the locations. The Putorana Plateau is in northern Russia, while
      the Ajay River is in eastern India. Given their positions, the Putorana Plateau
      is significantly north of any river in India, including the Ajay River.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is: YES'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Kaiser Mountains are a mountain range in the Austrian Alps, located in Europe.

      - Lake Mai-Ndombe is a lake in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located
      in central Africa.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      Step 1: Identify the location of Great Craggy Mountains.

      The Great Craggy Mountains are located in western North Carolina in the United
      States, part of the Blue Ridge Mountains range.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Sandoval.

      Lake Sandoval is located in the Peruvian Amazon, specifically in the Madre de
      Dios region of southeastern Peru.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes of both locations.

      - Great Craggy Mountains are in North Carolina, USA, which is in North America,
      approximately between 35-36 degrees North latitude.

      - Lake Sandoval is in southeastern Peru, which is in South America, approximately
      12 degrees South latitude.


      Step 4: Determine relative north-south positioning.

      Since Great Craggy Mountains are at a northern latitude (North America) and
      Lake Sandoval is at a southern latitude (South America), the Great Craggy Mountains
      are north of Lake Sandoval.

      Step 1: Let me identify where Te Whanga Lagoon is located.

      Te Whanga Lagoon is a large lagoon on Chatham Island, which is part of New Zealand.
      Chatham Island is located in the Pacific Ocean, about 800 kilometers east of
      mainland New Zealand.


      Step 2: Let me identify where the Transantarctic Mountains are located.

      The Transantarctic Mountains are a major mountain range in Antarctica that extend
      across the continent, essentially dividing Antarctica into two parts: East Antarctica
      and West Antarctica.


      Step 3: Compare the locations in terms of north-south positioning.

      Te Whanga Lagoon is located in the South Pacific but is still in the Southern
      Hemisphere well north of Antarctica.

      The Transantarctic Mountains are in Antarctica, which is the southernmost continent
      on Earth.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Te Whanga Lagoon (in New Zealand territory) is located in the South Pacific
      and Antarctica is further south than any other landmass, Te Whanga Lagoon must
      be north of the Transantarctic Mountains.


      YES, Te Whanga Lagoon is located north of the Transantarctic Mountains.'

    3cdb8d1b-55d3-47ca-848d-e47764cb89dc: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Budi Lake is located.

      Budi Lake (also known as Lake Budi) is located in Chile, South America, near
      the Pacific coast in the southern part of the country.


      Step 2: Let me identify where the Thiel Mountains are located.

      The Thiel Mountains are located in Antarctica, specifically in western Antarctica.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      Chile is located in the southern hemisphere, but north of Antarctica. Any location
      in Chile would be north of any location in Antarctica.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Budi Lake is in Chile (South America) and the Thiel Mountains are in Antarctica,
      Budi Lake is located north of the Thiel Mountains.


      Answer: YES'

      Step 1: Identify the locations mentioned.

      - Gjende is a lake in Norway, in the Scandinavian region of Northern Europe.

      - The Saronic Gulf is a gulf in Greece, located in Southern Europe.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on a map.

      - Norway is located in Northern Europe, specifically in the Scandinavian Peninsula.

      - Greece is located in Southern Europe, bordering the Mediterranean Sea.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Norway (including Gjende) is located much further north in Europe compared
      to Greece.

      - The Saronic Gulf, being in Greece, is located in a much more southern position
      in Europe.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since Norway is north of Greece, and Gjende is in Norway while the Saronic
      Gulf is in Greece, Gjende must be north of the Saronic Gulf.


      YES, Gjende is located north of the Saronic Gulf.'
