    dbaae750-67a1-4dc9-9180-51eec34df8b4: 'To determine whether Dudipatsar is located
      north of Velachery Lake, let''s break down the locations:


      1. **Dudipatsar**: Dudipatsar, also known as Dudipatsar Lake, is located in
      the northern part of Pakistan, specifically in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.


      2. **Velachery Lake**: This lake is located in Chennai, in the southern part
      of India, in the state of Tamil Nadu.


      Now, let''s compare their relative locations:


      - Pakistan (where Dudipatsar is located) is geographically north of India.

      - Chennai is in the southern part of India, which places Velachery Lake much
      further south compared to Dudipatsar.


      Based on this comparison:


      - Dudipatsar is indeed located north of Velachery Lake.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'
    f783bdc6-c1e4-4f71-b2d4-716a00c42fcf: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of Dudipatsar and Velachery Lake and then compare their relative
      positions.


      1. **Location of Dudipatsar**: Dudipatsar is a lake located in the northern
      part of Pakistan, specifically in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.


      2. **Location of Velachery Lake**: Velachery Lake is located in the southern
