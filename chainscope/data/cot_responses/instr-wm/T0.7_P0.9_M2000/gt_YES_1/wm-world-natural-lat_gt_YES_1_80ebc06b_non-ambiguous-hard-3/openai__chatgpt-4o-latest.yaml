      in western North Carolina, USA, near the city of Asheville.


      2. **Lake Sandoval**: This is located in the Madre de Dios region of southeastern
      Peru, within the Amazon Basin.


      Now let''s compare their relative positions:


      - The Great Craggy Mountains are in the Northern Hemisphere, specifically in
      the southeastern United States.

      - Lake Sandoval is in the Southern Hemisphere, in the Amazon rainforest of South
      America.


      Given that North Carolina is significantly farther north than southeastern Peru,
      we can conclude that:


      **The Great Craggy Mountains are indeed located north of Lake Sandoval.**


      Answer: **YES**.'

      3. Compare their latitudes to determine which one is farther north.


      Step 1: Wizard Lake is located in Alberta, Canada. It is a small lake situated
      south of Edmonton.


      Step 2: Lake of the Arbuckles is located in south-central Oklahoma, USA, within
      the Chickasaw National Recreation Area.


      Step 3: Alberta, Canada is significantly farther north than Oklahoma, USA. Since
      Wizard Lake is in Alberta and Lake of the Arbuckles is in Oklahoma, Wizard Lake
      must be north of Lake of the Arbuckles.


      Final answer: YES.'
