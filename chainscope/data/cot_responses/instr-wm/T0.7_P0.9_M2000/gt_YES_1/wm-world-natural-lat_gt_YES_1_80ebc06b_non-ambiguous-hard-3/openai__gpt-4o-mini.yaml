      to India.

      - The Ajay River is in India, which is significantly south of the Putorana Plateau.

      2. **Mount Baya**: This is a mountain located in the same region of Japan, but

      Mount Baya is located to the northeast of Tsukuba.


      Now, to find out if Lake Kasumigaura is north of Mount Baya, we can visualize
      or map out their locations:


      - Since Lake Kasumigaura is to the southeast of Tsukuba and Mount Baya is to
