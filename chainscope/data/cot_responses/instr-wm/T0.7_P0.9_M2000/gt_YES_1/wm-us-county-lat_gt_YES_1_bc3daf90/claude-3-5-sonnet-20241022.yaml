      - Bingham County is in southeastern Idaho


      2. To compare their positions:

      - South Dakota is entirely north of Idaho

      - All counties in South Dakota are therefore north of all counties in Idaho

      - Therefore, Fall River County, SD must be north of Bingham County, ID


      3. Even though Fall River County is in the southern part of South Dakota, and
      Bingham County is in the eastern part of Idaho, the fact that South Dakota is
      entirely north of Idaho means the answer is clear.

      1. First, let me visualize the relative positions of these Texas counties.


      2. Wichita County is located in north Texas, along the Oklahoma border.


      3. Foard County is also in north Texas.


      4. Looking at their relative positions:

      - Wichita County borders Wilbarger County on its west side

      - Foard County is west of Wilbarger County

      - This means Wichita and Foard counties are not directly adjacent

      - Foard County is slightly south of Wichita County''s latitude


      5. Therefore, Wichita County is indeed positioned north of Foard County.


      Answer: YES'

      1. First, let me recall where Wichita County, TX is located:

      - Wichita County is in north Texas

      - It''s on the Oklahoma border

      - Its county seat is Wichita Falls


      2. Next, let me recall where Foard County, TX is located:

      - Foard County is also in north Texas

      - Its county seat is Crowell


      3. Let me determine their relative positions:

      - Wichita County is in the first tier of counties along the Oklahoma border

      - Foard County is in the second tier of counties from the Oklahoma border

      - Therefore, Wichita County is directly north of Foard County


      Answer: YES'

      - Foard County is located a few counties south of the Oklahoma border

      - Specifically, Foard County is southwest of Wichita County


      5. Therefore, since Wichita County is positioned above/northeast of Foard County...


      NO - Wichita County is not located north of Foard County. It''s located northeast
      of Foard County.'

      - Chesapeake is in the southeastern part of Virginia

      - It''s part of the Hampton Roads metropolitan area

      - It''s near the Atlantic coast


      3. Now let me compare their latitudes:

      - Patrick County is right along the NC border in southern VA

      - Chesapeake is also in southern VA

      - However, Chesapeake is slightly further south than Patrick County


      4. Therefore, Patrick County is slightly north of Chesapeake City.
