      3. **Consider the meaning of "north of".**  To be north of something generally
      means it lies at a higher latitude across the entire area. Since a significant
      portion of Imperial County is at the same latitude or lower than San Diego County,
      it cannot be considered entirely north.

      north of several parishes, including Bienville, Lincoln, and Jackson. Morehouse

      of Morehouse. "North of" implies directly or mostly above.

      is slightly west, a significant portion of it is at a higher latitude than Morehouse.

      County on a map of Texas.**  A quick online search will show a map of Texas
      counties.

      2. **Determine the relative positions of the two counties.** Visually comparing
      their locations on the map reveals Swisher County is directly above Briscoe
      County.

      3. **"North" implies higher latitude.**  Being directly above another location
      on a map signifies a higher latitude, which corresponds to being north.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.
