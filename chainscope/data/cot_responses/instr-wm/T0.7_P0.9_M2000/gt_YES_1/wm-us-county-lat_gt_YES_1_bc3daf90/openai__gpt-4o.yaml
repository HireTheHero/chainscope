      located north of Anne Arundel County, MD, let''s examine their relative positions:


      1. **Identify the location of Hardy County, WV**: Hardy County is located in
      the eastern part of West Virginia. It is part of the region known as the Eastern
      Panhandle of West Virginia.


      2. **Identify the location of Anne Arundel County, MD**: Anne Arundel County
      is in the central part of Maryland, surrounding the state capital, Annapolis.
      It is located south of Baltimore and north of Washington, D.C.


      3. **Compare their latitudes**: Anne Arundel County is situated relatively further
      east and south compared to Hardy County, given its proximity to the Chesapeake
      Bay and the Atlantic coast. Hardy County is more inland and closer to the northern
      part of the state of Virginia.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given these locations, Hardy County, WV is generally located
      to the west and slightly north of Anne Arundel County, MD.


      Therefore, the answer is YES, Hardy County, WV is located north of Anne Arundel

      1. **Dade County, GA**: This county is located in the northwestern corner of
      Georgia, bordering Tennessee and Alabama. It is part of the Eastern Time Zone
      and is situated near the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee.


      2. **San Bernardino County, CA**: This county is located in Southern California
      and is known for its vast area, encompassing parts of the Mojave Desert and
      the San Bernardino Mountains. It is part of the Pacific Time Zone and is situated
      east of Los Angeles.


      Now, let''s consider the latitudinal positions:


      - **Dade County, GA**: Approximately around 34.9 degrees North latitude.

      - **San Bernardino County, CA**: The county covers a wide area, but the city
      of San Bernardino is approximately around 34.1 degrees North latitude.


      Given these coordinates, Dade County, GA is indeed located slightly north of
