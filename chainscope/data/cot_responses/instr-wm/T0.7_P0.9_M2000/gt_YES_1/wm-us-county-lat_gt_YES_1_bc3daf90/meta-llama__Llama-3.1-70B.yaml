      north of Broadwater County, MT, let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Fallon County and Broadwater County are both
      in Montana, a state in the western United States.


      2. **General geography of Montana**: Montana is a large state with various counties.
      Without specific knowledge of these counties'' exact locations, we need to rely
      on general geographical knowledge.


      3. **Latitude comparison**: To determine if one location is north of another,
      we need to compare their latitudes. However, without specific information about
      the exact latitudes of these counties, we need to make an educated guess.


      4. **Inference from general knowledge**: Since both counties are in Montana,
      which is a northwestern state, it''s reasonable to assume that Fallon County
      is north of Broadwater County based on the general north-south alignment of
      the state.


      Therefore, based on the general geography of Montana and the inference from
      the state''s north-south alignment, the answer is:


      YES'

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: We have two locations: Fallon County, MT and
      Broadwater County, MT. Both are counties in the state of Montana, USA.


      2. **Consider General Geography**: Montana is a large state in the northwestern
      United States. Counties in Montana are generally arranged from north to south
      and east to west. Without knowing the specific geography, we can''t definitively
      say which county is located north of the other.


      3. **Research or Recall Specific Geography**: To answer this question with certainty,
      we need to know the exact locations of these counties. Without this specific
      information, we can''t determine if Fallon County is located north of Broadwater
      County.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since we don''t have the specific information about the locations
      of these counties, we can''t say with certainty whether Fallon County is located
      north of Broadwater County. Therefore, without additional information, we can''t
      give a definitive YES or NO answer.

      County, CO. Both are counties in the United States, with Muskingum County located
      in Ohio and Broomfield County in Colorado.


      2. **Understand the general geography of the United States**: Generally, states
      in the north are higher in latitude than those in the south. So, we need to
      compare the latitudes of Ohio and Colorado.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Without needing exact coordinates, we can infer
      that Ohio is generally north of Colorado. This is because Ohio is part of the
      Midwest and is located in the northern half of the United States, while Colorado
      is in the West and is located in the southern half of the United States.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography and the relative positions
      of Ohio and Colorado, it is safe to conclude that Muskingum County, OH is indeed
      located north of Broomfield County, CO.

      2. **Consider geographical positions**: Generally, counties within the same
      state are arranged from north to south. However, this is not always the case,
      especially in states with irregular shapes.


      3. **Research or recall the geography of Indiana**: Indiana is a Midwestern
      state with a relatively rectangular shape. Counties are typically arranged in
      a grid-like pattern, with northern counties being located north of southern
      counties.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Based on the geography of Indiana and the arrangement
      of its counties, we can infer that Parke County is located north of Hendricks
      County. This is because Parke County is in the western part of Indiana, and

      of the United States, while Utah is located in the western part.


      3. **Latitude comparison**: To determine if one location is north of another,
      we need to compare their latitudes. Without specific coordinates, we can still
      make a general inference based on the relative positions of Kentucky and Utah.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Kentucky is in the eastern United States and Utah
      is in the western United States, and considering the general north-south orientation
      of the country, it''s reasonable to conclude that Jessamine County, KY is located
      north of Iron County, UT.


      The answer is: YES

      is part of New York State. Wells County, IN, is in the northeastern part of
      Indiana. Both counties are relatively close to the Great Lakes.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Weber County is in Utah (UT), and Kosciusko County
      is in Indiana (IN).


      2. **Consider general geographical positions**: Generally, Utah is located in
      the western United States, while Indiana is located in the midwestern United
      States.


      3. **Specific locations**: Weber County is in the northern part of Utah, and
      Kosciusko County is in the northern part of Indiana.


      4. **Compare the specific locations**: Even though both counties are in the
      northern parts of their respective states, Utah is located significantly further
      west than Indiana. This means that Weber County is likely located further west,
      but not necessarily north, of Kosciusko County.


      Therefore, based on the general geographical relationship between Utah and Indiana,
      and considering the positions of Weber County and Kosciusko County within their
      respective states, the answer is:

      located north of Concordia Parish, LA, we need to consider the geography of
      these two locations. Here are the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Culberson County is located in Texas (TX), while
      Concordia Parish is located in Louisiana (LA).


      2. **Consider general geography**: Texas is located to the west of Louisiana,
      which means that Culberson County, being in Texas, is west of Concordia Parish
      in Louisiana.


      3. **Consider specific locations**: Both Culberson County and Concordia Parish
      are located in the southern parts of their respective states. This means that
      they are not at extreme north or south ends.


      4. **Compare the specific locations**: Even though Culberson County is west
      of Concordia Parish, it is not significantly north of it. Both counties are
      in the southern parts of their states.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical relationship between Texas and
