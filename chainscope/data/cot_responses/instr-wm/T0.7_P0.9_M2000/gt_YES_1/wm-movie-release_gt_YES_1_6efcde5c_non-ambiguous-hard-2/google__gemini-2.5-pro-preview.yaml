      Harvey Weinstein (along with his brother Bob) produced a teen comedy-drama called
      *Playing for Keeps* through Miramax, which was released in **1986**. There is
      also a 2012 romantic comedy called *Playing for Keeps* which was distributed

      in October 1990. So, its release year is 1990.

      3.  **Identify the second movie:** *Playing for Keeps*, associated with Harvey
      Weinstein. There are two films with this title. One was released in 1986 and
      was directed by Bob and Harvey Weinstein. Another was released in 2012, which
      Harvey Weinstein''s company distributed in some territories but he wasn''t the
      director or primary producer. Given the phrasing "Harvey Weinstein''s Playing
      for Keeps", the 1986 film he co-directed is the most direct fit.

      4.  **Find its release date:** The *Playing for Keeps* directed by Bob and Harvey
      Weinstein was released in the US on October 3, 1986.

      5.  **Compare the release dates:** *Bethune: The Making of a Hero* (1990) vs.
      *Playing for Keeps* (1986).

      6.  **Determine if Bethune was released later:** 1990 is later than 1986.


      YES'
    829a03d1-db95-43cd-aa15-95dbe7496431: 'Okay, let''s break this down step by step:


      1.  **Identify the first movie and its release date:** *Bethune: The Making
      of a Hero*, directed by Phillip Borsos. This film had its premiere at the Cannes
      Film Festival in May 1990 and saw wider release later that year. So, its release
      year is **1990**.

      2.  **Identify the second movie and its release date:** *Playing for Keeps*.
      The question attributes it to Harvey Weinstein. There are two prominent films
      with this title. One was released in 2012, distributed by FilmDistrict (Harvey
      Weinstein''s company, The Weinstein Company, handled international distribution
      later). However, there is an earlier film titled *Playing for Keeps* released
      in **1986**, which was co-directed by Bob and Harvey Weinstein. Given the comparison
      is with a 1990 film, the 1986 film directed by the Weinsteins is the most likely
      candidate intended by the question.

      3.  **Compare the release dates:** *Bethune: The Making of a Hero* (1990) vs.
      *Playing for Keeps* (1986).

      4.  **Determine if the first movie was released later:** 1990 is later than
      1986.


      Therefore, Phillip Borsos''s *Bethune: The Making of a Hero* was released later
      than Harvey Weinstein''s (co-directed) *Playing for Keeps* (1986).


      **YES**'
    b0488608-ffa0-4c42-a185-d42c4289ac10: 'Okay, here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the first movie:** *Bethune: The Making of a Hero*, directed
      by Phillip Borsos.

      2.  **Find its release date:** This film had a troubled production and release
      history, but its premiere (e.g., at Cannes Film Festival) and initial Canadian
      release occurred in **1990**.

      3.  **Identify the second movie:** *Playing for Keeps*. The prompt specifies
      "Harvey Weinstein''s", indicating the 1986 film directed by Bob and Harvey Weinstein
      (not the unrelated 2012 film).

      4.  **Find its release date:** The film *Playing for Keeps* directed by the
      Weinstein brothers was released in **1986**.

      5.  **Compare the release dates:** Compare 1990 (Bethune) and 1986 (Playing
      for Keeps).

      6.  **Determine if Bethune''s release date is later:** 1990 is indeed later
      than 1986.

    fefc7d30-aaf1-4671-8b09-bf594495c581: 'Okay, here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the first movie:** *Safe Conduct* (original title: *Laissez-passer*),
      directed by Bertrand Tavernier.

      2.  **Find the release date for *Safe Conduct*:** It premiered and was released
      in early **2002** (specifically January 9, 2002, in France).

      3.  **Identify the second movie:** *Playing for Keeps*. The reference to Bob
      Weinstein points most strongly to the **1986** film *Playing for Keeps*, which
      was produced and distributed by Miramax, the company co-founded by Bob and Harvey
      Weinstein. (There is a later 2012 film with the same name, but the 1986 film
      has the direct Bob Weinstein/Miramax production/distribution link from that
      era).

      4.  **Find the release date for the 1986 *Playing for Keeps*:** It was released
      on October 3, **1986**.

      5.  **Compare the release dates:** *Safe Conduct*''s release year (2002) is
      compared to *Playing for Keeps*''s release year (1986).

      6.  **Determine if *Safe Conduct*''s release date is later:** 2002 is indeed
      later than 1986.


      Therefore, the answer is:
