      by step. The goal is to determine whether Vishal Pandya''s *Hate Story* was
      released later than Munin Barua''s *Nayak*. To answer this, we''ll need to find
      the release dates of both movies and compare them.


      ### Step 1: Identify the Directors and Their Films


      First, let''s confirm the directors and the films in question:


      - **Vishal Pandya**: He is an Indian film director known for movies like *Hate
      Story*.

      - **Munin Barua**: He is an Assamese film director, and *Nayak* is one of his
      notable works.


      ### Step 2: Find the Release Year of *Hate Story* by Vishal Pandya


      *Hate Story* is a Hindi film. A quick search reveals that *Hate Story* was released
      on **April 20, 2012**.


      ### Step 3: Find the Release Year of *Nayak* by Munin Barua


      *Nayak* is an Assamese film. Searching for its release date, we find that *Nayak*
      was released in **2001**.


      ### Step 4: Compare the Release Dates


      Now that we have both release years:


      - *Hate Story*: 2012

      - *Nayak*: 2001


      Clearly, 2012 is later than 2001.


      ### Conclusion


      Based on the release dates:


      - *Hate Story* (2012) was indeed released later than *Nayak* (2001).
