      \ \"The Life of Rayful Edmond Vol. 1 The Rise and Fall\", let's break down the\
      \ steps:\n\n1. **Identify Release Years**: First, we need to find the release\
      \ years of both movies. \n   - Behrouz Boochani's \"Chauka, Please Tell Us the\
      \ Time\" was released in 2017 (this is an Australian documentary film).\n  \
      \ - Kirk Fraser's \"The Life of Rayful Edmond Vol. 1 The Rise and Fall\" was\
      \ released in 2012 (this is an American documentary film).\n\n2. **Compare Release\
      \ Years**: Now, we compare the release years to determine which film was released\
      \ later.\n   - Chauka, Please Tell Us the Time (2017) vs. The Life of Rayful\
      \ Edmond Vol. 1 The Rise and Fall (2012)\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since 2017 is\
      \ later than 2012, \"Chauka, Please Tell Us the Time\" was indeed released later\
      \ than \"The Life of Rayful Edmond Vol. 1 The Rise and Fall\".\n\nTherefore,\
      \ the answer to whether Behrouz Boochani's \"Chauka, Please Tell Us the Time\"\
      \ was released later than Kirk Fraser's \"The Life of Rayful Edmond Vol. 1 The\
      \ Rise and Fall\" is: **YES**"
