      Porky & Friends: Hilarious Ham released later than Jeff Daniels''s Super Sucker?",
      we need to determine the release years of both productions and compare them.


      Step 1: Identify the release year of "Super Sucker"

      - "Super Sucker" is a comedy film directed by Jeff Daniels.

      - It was released in the year 2002.


      Step 2: Identify the release year of "Porky & Friends: Hilarious Ham"

      - "Porky & Friends: Hilarious Ham" is an animated compilation featuring classic
      Warner Bros. characters like Porky Pig.

      - As it features Bob Clampett''s work, and Bob Clampett was active mainly in
      the 1930s to 1950s, this production would most likely be a compilation of older
      material.

      - Such compilations are sometimes released later for home video, but the original
      content dates from decades earlier.

      - However, research shows that "Porky & Friends: Hilarious Ham" was released
      in 1986 as a VHS compilation.


      Step 3: Compare the release years:

      - "Porky & Friends: Hilarious Ham": 1986

      - "Super Sucker": 2002


      1986 is earlier than 2002.

      exact title, since "The Three Faces" might refer to *Le tre facce della paura*,
      an Italian horror film from the 1960s. But Franco Indovina contributed to a
      1965 anthology film titled *I tre volti* (The Three Faces), which includes segments
      directed by different directors including Michelangelo Antonioni and Franco
      Indovina. This film was released in **1965**.


      Now compare the years:

      - *Because of the Cats*: 1973

      - *The Three Faces* (Franco Indovina): 1965


      Since 1973 is later than 1965, the answer is:


      **YES**.'
