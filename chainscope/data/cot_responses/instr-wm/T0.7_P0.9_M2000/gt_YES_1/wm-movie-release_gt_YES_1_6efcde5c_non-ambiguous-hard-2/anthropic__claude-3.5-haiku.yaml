      - "Pharaoh''s Army" was released in 1995


      4. Determining the order:

      - 1992 comes before 1995

      - So "Hero" was released EARLIER than "Pharaoh''s Army"


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      1. I need to find the release year of Swapan Saha''s "Hero"

      2. I need to find the release year of Robby Henson''s "Pharaoh''s Army"

      3. Then compare which came out later


      Step 1: Research shows Swapan Saha''s "Hero" is a Bengali film, likely released
      in the 1990s or 2000s.


      Step 2: Research shows "Pharaoh''s Army" was released in 1995.


      Step 3: Comparing the years, I can''t find a definitive release year for "Hero"
      to make a precise comparison.


      Without a confirmed release year for "Hero", I cannot confidently answer YES
      or NO.
