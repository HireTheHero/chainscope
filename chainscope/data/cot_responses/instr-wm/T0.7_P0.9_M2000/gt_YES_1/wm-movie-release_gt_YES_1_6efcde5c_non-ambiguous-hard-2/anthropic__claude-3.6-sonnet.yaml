      1. Let me find when Bob Clampett''s Porky & Friends: Hilarious Ham was released

      - This appears to be a compilation of classic Porky Pig cartoons

      - Bob Clampett directed Porky Pig cartoons in the 1930s and 1940s

      - DVD compilations of these were released in the early 2000s


      2. Let me find when Super Sucker was released

      - Super Sucker starring Jeff Daniels was released in 2002


      3. Compare the dates

      - Since Porky & Friends: Hilarious Ham is a DVD compilation released in the
      early 2000s, and Super Sucker came out in 2002, they were released around the
      same time period

      - However, I''m not finding a definitive release date for the Porky compilation


      Without being able to confirm the exact release date of the Porky compilation,
      I cannot make a definitive comparison.


      I apologize, but I cannot provide a clear YES/NO answer without having more
      precise release date information for the Porky & Friends compilation.'

      3. Comparing the dates:

      - While I don''t have the exact compilation release date for Porky & Friends,
      being a collection of classic cartoons, it would likely be released as a home
      video/DVD collection after 2002

      - Modern compilations of classic cartoons typically came out in the DVD era
      of the 2000s and beyond
