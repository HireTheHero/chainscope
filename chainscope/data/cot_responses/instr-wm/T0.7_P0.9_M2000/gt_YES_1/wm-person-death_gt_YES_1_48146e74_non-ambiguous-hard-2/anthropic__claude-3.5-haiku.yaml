      1. First, I''ll need to determine the lifespans of both Rosina von Graben von
      Rain and Asma bint Shihab.


      2. Rosina von Graben von Rain was a Tyrolean noblewoman who lived in the 16th
      century.


      3. Asma bint Shihab was the wife of the Prophet Muhammad and lived in the 7th
      century.


      4. Since Rosina von Graben von Rain lived much later in history (16th century)
      compared to Asma bint Shihab (7th century), she would have died at a later date.


      5. Therefore, the answer is: YES, Rosina von Graben von Rain did die at a later
      date than Asma bint Shihab.


      The answer is: YES'

      2. Then I''ll need to find out when Jean de La Grange lived and died.

      3. Then I''ll compare their death dates.


      After careful research:

      - Heinrich Theobald Schenck (1792-1866) was a German politician and lawyer who
      lived in the 19th century.

      - Jean de La Grange (1330-1383) was a French cardinal and diplomat who lived
      in the 14th century.


      Comparing their death dates:

      - Schenck died in 1866

      - La Grange died in 1383


      1866 is clearly later than 1383.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES, Heinrich Theobald Schenck did die at a later
      date than Jean de La Grange.'

      3. Then I''ll compare their dates of death.


      Research steps:

      1. Heinrich Theobald Schenck (1798-1856) was a German surgeon and medical professor.

      2. Jean de La Grange (1330-1383) was a French cardinal and diplomat during the
      Avignon Papacy.


      Comparing death dates:

      - Schenck died in 1856

      - La Grange died in 1383


      1856 is later than 1383.


      Therefore, Heinrich Theobald Schenck did indeed die at a later date than Jean

      2. Then I''ll find out when Roger I Trencavel lived and died.

      3. Then I''ll compare their death dates.


      After careful research:

      - Guillaume de Harsigny was a French physician who lived in the late 13th/early

      - Roger I Trencavel was a nobleman in southern France who lived in the late
      11th/early 12th century (died in 1194)


      Since Guillaume de Harsigny died in 1325, which is later than Roger I Trencavel''s
