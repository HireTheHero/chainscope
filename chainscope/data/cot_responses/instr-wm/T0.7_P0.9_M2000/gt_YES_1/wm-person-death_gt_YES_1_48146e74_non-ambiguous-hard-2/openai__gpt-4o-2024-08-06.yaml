      If Hartwig von Lierheim is a real historical figure, and assuming his death

      Without specific information on Hartwig von Lierheim, a definitive YES or NO

      lived and died.


      1. **John Montacute, 3rd Earl of Salisbury**: He was an English nobleman who
      lived during the late 14th and early 15th centuries. He died on January 7, 1400.


      2. **Widukind of Corvey**: Widukind was a Saxon leader and a key figure in the
      Saxon Wars against Charlemagne. He lived during the 8th and 9th centuries, with
      most historical accounts suggesting he died around the year 808.


      Now, comparing the two:


      - John Montacute died in 1400.

      - Widukind of Corvey died around 808.


      Based on these dates, John Montacute died at a later date than Widukind of Corvey.
