      **Step 1:**

      We are not given any information about the death of Alexander VI or Svein Knutsson,
      so we cannot determine if they died at different dates.


      **Step 2:**

      We are not provided with any specific dates or timelines regarding the lives
      of Alexander VI or Svein Knutsson, so we cannot determine if they died at different
      dates.


      **Therefore, we cannot answer this question with a YES or NO answer.**'
    fe5ebdfd-b1fb-4403-a331-14590108159e: '

      **Step 2:**

      Svein Knutsson was born in 1135 and died in 1202.


      Therefore, Alexander VI died more than 47 years after Svein Knutsson.
