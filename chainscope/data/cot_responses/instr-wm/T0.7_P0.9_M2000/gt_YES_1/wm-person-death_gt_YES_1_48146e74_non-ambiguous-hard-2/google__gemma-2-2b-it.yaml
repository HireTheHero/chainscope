      known for his work in aeronautics and other areas.

      * **Who was Hilary of Poitiers?** He was a 5th-century Christian theologian
      and philosopher, famous for his work on the history of Christianity.


      **Reasoning:**


      * Hilary of Poitiers lived in the 5th century.

      * Abbas Ibn Firnas lived in the 11th century.

      *  The time period between the two is a significant difference.
