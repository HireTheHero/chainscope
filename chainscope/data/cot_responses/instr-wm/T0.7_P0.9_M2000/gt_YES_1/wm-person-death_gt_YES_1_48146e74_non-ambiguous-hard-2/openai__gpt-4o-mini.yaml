      the dates of death for both historical figures.


      1. **Constance of Babenberg**: She was born around 1154 and died in 1198. This
      gives us a clear date of death: 1198.


      2. **Abraham Trembley**: He was born on March 17, 1710, and died on July 1,
      1784. This gives us a clear date of death: 1784.

      - Constance of Babenberg died in 1198.

      - Abraham Trembley died in 1784.

      2. **Identify Peter Paul Morandell**: Peter Paul Morandell was a lesser-known
      figure compared to Bidermann, but he is believed to have lived later than Bidermann.
      However, the specific death date of Morandell is not widely documented in historical
      records.


      3. **Comparison**: Given that Jacob Bidermann died in 1639, we need to ascertain
      if Peter Paul Morandell died after this date.


      Without specific information confirming Morandell''s death date, we cannot definitively
      say whether he died later than Bidermann. Therefore, based on the available
      data:


      The answer is **NO**, because we cannot confirm that Morandell died later than
      Bidermann, and it is possible that he may have died earlier or around the same

      2. **Roger Pierre**: There are several historical figures with the name Roger
      Pierre, but if we assume we are referring to Roger Pierre, a French actor and

      Now, comparing the two dates:


      - Henry Percy died in 1489.

      - Roger Pierre died in 2003.
