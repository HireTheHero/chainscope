      2.  **Find his death date:** Christian Gottlob Neefe was a German composer and
      conductor, known as one of Beethoven''s teachers. He died on **January 26, 1798**.

      3.  **Identify the second individual:** Margaret Graham, Countess of Menteith.

      was a German composer, organist, and conductor, famously known as Beethoven''s
      teacher. He died on **January 26, 1798**.

      2.  **Identify Margaret Graham, Countess of Menteith''s death date:** This title
      was held by several women. The most historically prominent Margaret Graham associated
      with the title was likely the one who held it *suo jure* (in her own right)
      in the 15th century, succeeding her father. She died sometime **after 1490**
      (likely around 1490/1491). Another earlier Margaret Graham, Countess of Menteith
      (by marriage to Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany) died even earlier, **before
      1380**. In either prominent case, the death date is in the 14th or 15th century.

      3.  **Compare the dates:** Christian Gottlob Neefe died in 1798. Margaret Graham,
      Countess of Menteith (the later prominent one) died around 1490/1491.

      4.  **Conclusion:** 1798 is a later date than c. 1491 (or c. 1380). Therefore,
      Christian Gottlob Neefe died later than Margaret Graham, Countess of Menteith.

      1.  **Identify Karl Joseph Eberth''s death date:** Karl Joseph Eberth was a
      German pathologist and bacteriologist. He died on December 2, 1926.

      2.  **Identify Pierre Moulu''s death date:** Pierre Moulu was a Franco-Flemish
      composer of the Renaissance. His exact dates are uncertain, but historical records
      indicate he was active until at least 1522. His death date is estimated to be
      sometime *after* 1522, possibly around 1550.

      3.  **Compare the death dates:** Karl Joseph Eberth died in 1926. Pierre Moulu
      died sometime after 1522 (likely mid-16th century).

      4.  **Conclusion:** 1926 is significantly later than any date in the 16th century
      (like "after 1522" or c. 1550). Therefore, Karl Joseph Eberth died at a later
