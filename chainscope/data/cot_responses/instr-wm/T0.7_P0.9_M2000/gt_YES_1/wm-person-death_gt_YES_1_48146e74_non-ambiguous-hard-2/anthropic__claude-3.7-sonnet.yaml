      Conrad (also known as Konrad) was a Margrave of Meissen from the House of Wettin.
      He died on February 5, 1157.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Marianus III died in 1376.

      Conrad died in 1157.

      1376 comes after 1157, so Marianus III died at a later date than Conrad.


      NO.

      YES, Marianus III of Arborea did die at a later date than Conrad, Margrave of
      Meissen (1376 vs. 1157).'

      - Robert de Brus died in either 1226 or 1233 (13th century)

      - Eilika died around 1059 (11th century)

      - 1226/1233 comes after 1059, with approximately 167-174 years difference

      Philip II of Baden-Baden lived from 1559 to 1588. He died on June 17, 1588.

      I''m not finding clear historical records for a "Heinrich von Lazan." There
      may be variations in spelling, or this could be a less documented historical
      figure.

      Mary of Lusignan was a member of the Lusignan dynasty. Based on historical records,
      Mary of Lusignan, Countess of Brienne, died in 1322.

      Heinrich von Lazan (also known as Heinrich von Leipa) was a Bohemian nobleman
      who lived in the late 13th to early 14th century. Based on historical records,
      he died around 1329.

      Mary of Lusignan was a member of the Lusignan family of Cyprus and Jerusalem.

      she died in 1322.
