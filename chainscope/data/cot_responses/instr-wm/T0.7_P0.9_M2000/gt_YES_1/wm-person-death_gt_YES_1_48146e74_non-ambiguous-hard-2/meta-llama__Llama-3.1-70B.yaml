      died at a later date than Pierre Moulu is **YES**'
    f168fc5d-a886-49d2-9ded-dfcd814855fc: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the dates of death for both Karl Joseph Eberth and Pierre Moulu.


      1. **Identify Pierre Moulu**: Pierre Moulu was a French composer of the Renaissance
      period. He was active in the early 16th century, but specific details about
      his life are somewhat limited.


      2. **Date of Death for Pierre Moulu**: Pierre Moulu''s date of death is not
      precisely known. However, given his active period in the early 16th century,
      it is likely that he died before the mid-16th century.


      3. **Identify Karl Joseph Eberth**: Karl Joseph Eberth was a German pathologist
      and bacteriologist. He was born on September 21, 1835, and made significant
      contributions to the understanding of infectious diseases.


      4. **Date of Death for Karl Joseph Eberth**: Karl Joseph Eberth died on December
      2, 1922.


      5. **Comparison**: Now, we compare the dates of death. Pierre Moulu likely died
      before the mid-16th century, and Karl Joseph Eberth died in 1922.


      Given that 1922 is significantly later than the mid-16th century, the answer
      to whether Karl Joseph Eberth died at a later date than Pierre Moulu is **YES**'
