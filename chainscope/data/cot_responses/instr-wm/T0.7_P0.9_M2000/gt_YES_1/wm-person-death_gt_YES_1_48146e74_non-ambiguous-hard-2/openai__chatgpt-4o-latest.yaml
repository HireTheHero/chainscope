      Step 1: Identify the date of death of Benedict Stattler.

      - Benedict Stattler was a German Jesuit theologian and philosopher.

      - He was born in 1728 and died in 1797.


      Step 2: Identify the date of death of Wolfgang Glaeser.

      - Wolfgang Glaeser is a German computer scientist.

      - He was born in 1944.

      - As of the latest available information, Wolfgang Glaeser is still alive or
      at least died well after 1797 if he is deceased.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      - Benedict Stattler died in 1797.

      - Wolfgang Glaeser was born in 1944, which is already after 1797, so any death

      3. Compare the two dates.


      **Step 1: Death date of Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff**

      - Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff was a Prussian painter and architect.

      **Step 3: Compare the dates**

      - 1753 (Knobelsdorff) is after 1286 (Darlington).
