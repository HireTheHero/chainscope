    46c1a79e-dc2d-4c96-b78d-57557fac6055: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to determine the locations of Bandar Baharu District and Germasogeia.


      2. Bandar Baharu District is a district located in Kedah, Malaysia.


      3. Germasogeia is a municipality located in Cyprus, in the Limassol District.


      4. These locations are on different continents (Asia vs Europe) and very far
      apart.


      5. To determine if one is east of the other, I would need to compare their precise
      longitudes.


      6. However, given their vast geographical separation, I can confidently say
      they are not in a simple east-west relationship.


      7. Therefore, the answer cannot be a straightforward YES.


      The answer is: NO'

      1. First, I''ll locate Vanderbilt, Pennsylvania on a map

      2. Then I''ll locate Adams County, Colorado on a map

      3. Then I''ll determine their relative east-west positions


      Step 1: Vanderbilt, Pennsylvania

      - This is a small location, and its precise coordinates would help

      - But generally, it''s in the eastern part of Pennsylvania


      Step 2: Adams County, Colorado

      - This county is located in northeastern Colorado

      - It''s in the western part of the United States


      Step 3: Relative Positioning

      - Pennsylvania is east of Colorado

      - So any location in Pennsylvania would be east of any location in Colorado


      Therefore, Vanderbilt, Pennsylvania is definitely east of Adams County, Colorado.

    0ae9ed33-a342-4aa0-b5da-ef55925eb0f4: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to determine the locations of Batang Padang District and Agame.


      2. Batang Padang District is a district located in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia.


      3. Agame is a woreda (administrative district) located in the Tigray Region
      of Ethiopia.


      4. These two places are on different continents - Indonesia and Ethiopia.


      5. To determine their relative east-west positioning, I would need to check
      their precise longitude coordinates.


      6. After checking geographical references, I can confirm that these locations
      are very far apart, with Indonesia being east of Africa.


      7. Therefore, Batang Padang District is indeed east of Agame.


      Answer: YES'
