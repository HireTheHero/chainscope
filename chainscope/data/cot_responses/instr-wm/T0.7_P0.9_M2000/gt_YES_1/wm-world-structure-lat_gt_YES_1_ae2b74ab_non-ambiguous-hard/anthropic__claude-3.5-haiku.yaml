      - Kalmar is a city in southeastern Sweden, near the Baltic Sea


      2. Next, locate Lake Waco:

      - Lake Waco is located in Texas, United States

      - It is situated near the city of Waco in central Texas

      - Kalmar, Sweden is in Northern Europe

      - Waco, Texas is in the southern United States

      - Sweden is significantly north of Texas

      1. St Cross Church is located in Oxford, England, which is in the United Kingdom.


      2. Lake Glenville is located in North Carolina, United States.


      3. These two locations are on different continents - the UK and the US.


      4. Specifically, Oxford is in the northern hemisphere, and Lake Glenville is
      also in the northern hemisphere.


      5. However, the question is about their relative north-south positioning.


      6. The UK is much further north than North Carolina.


      7. Therefore, St Cross Church in Oxford is definitely located north of Lake
      Glenville.


      The answer is: YES.'

      2. Rectory Road railway station is located in London, United Kingdom, not in
