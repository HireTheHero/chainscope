      1) First, let me identify the locations:

      - Vermont Studio Center is in Johnson, Vermont

      - Hartford International University for Religion and Peace is in Hartford, Connecticut


      2) Now, let''s consider their positions relative to each other:

      - Hartford, CT is in central Connecticut

      - Johnson, VT is in northern Vermont


      3) Looking at their east-west positioning:

      - Vermont is entirely west of Connecticut on a map

      - Therefore, any location in Vermont must be west of any location in Connecticut


      4) Since Vermont Studio Center is in Vermont, and Hartford International University
      is in Connecticut, the Vermont location must be west of the Connecticut location.

      - Street numbers increase as you go west

      - 15th Street is east of 17th Street


      4. Therefore, since Strayer is on 15th Street and Corcoran was on 17th Street,
      Strayer is located east of Corcoran.


      Answer: YES'
    f6ce8c12-d6b3-45b6-bbbf-7c96a7cc1131: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let me recall the locations of both institutions in Washington, DC:

      - Strayer University''s DC campus is located at 1133 15th Street NW

      - Corcoran College of Art and Design (now part of GW University) was located
      at 500 17th Street NW


      2) Looking at the street numbers:

      - Strayer is on 15th Street

      - Corcoran was on 17th Street


      3) In Washington DC''s grid system:

      - Streets run north-south and are numbered from east to west

      - The lower the street number, the further east it is

      - 15th Street is east of 17th Street


      4) Therefore, since Strayer is on 15th Street and Corcoran was on 17th Street,
      Strayer is east of Corcoran.

      - University of the Sciences is at 43rd Street and Woodland Avenue

      - Saint Joseph''s University is at City Avenue (US Route 1) around 54th Street


      3. In Philadelphia''s grid system:

      - Lower street numbers are towards the east

      - University of the Sciences is at 43rd Street

      - Saint Joseph''s is around 54th Street


      4. Since 43 is less than 54, and lower numbers are east, University of the Sciences
      is east of Saint Joseph''s University.

      3. The question asks if Heidelberg is EAST of Western Carolina

      - Since we determined Heidelberg is WEST of Western Carolina, not east, the
      answer is no


      NO'

    9addbf24-63a5-4bf5-b188-95ac1b763ba0: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me recall the locations of both institutions:

      - MIT is located in Cambridge, MA

      - Wentworth Institute of Technology is located in Boston, MA


      2. Looking at their specific locations:

      - MIT is located along the north side of the Charles River in Cambridge

      - Wentworth is located in the Mission Hill neighborhood of Boston


      3. Comparing their relative positions:

      - Cambridge is directly north of Boston

      - Mission Hill is in the western part of Boston

      - MIT is actually slightly to the east of Wentworth''s location


      4. Therefore, looking at their precise locations on a map, MIT is indeed positioned
      to the east of Wentworth Institute of Technology.
