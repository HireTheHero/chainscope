    24ec0165-4727-4499-9f1b-88acb94e6dab: '1. **Find the locations of both universities:**
      Army Logistics University is in Fort Lee, Virginia. Cordoba University is apparently
      a fictitious university; no such accredited university exists in Virginia (or
      elsewhere based on internet searches).  Since the prompt states it is in VA,
      we''ll assume it''s meant to refer to a location within Virginia.  However,
      Cordoba is a city in Spain.


      2. **Compare their longitudinal coordinates (East/West):** Since Cordoba University
      doesn''t exist, we can''t directly compare coordinates.  We could compare Fort
      Lee to Cordoba, Spain.  Fort Lee, VA is in the western hemisphere and Cordoba,
      Spain is in the eastern hemisphere.


      3. **Determine East/West relative position:** Anything in the western hemisphere
      is west of anything in the eastern hemisphere.


      Therefore, Fort Lee, VA (and thus Army Logistics University) is *west* of Cordoba,
      Spain.  Since the prompt refers to a (fictional) Cordoba University *in Virginia*,  we
      don''t have enough information to compare.  If we assumed Cordoba University,
      VA was meant to represent a location named Cordoba *within* Virginia, we''d
      need more information to determine its location relative to Fort Lee.


      **Answer:**  Cannot be determined based on available information.  If the question
      was "Is Army Logistics University, VA located east of Cordoba, *Spain*?" the
      answer would be NO.

      2. **Determine East/West relationship:** Once locations are known, we can assess
      which is further east.


      Army Logistics University is located at Fort Lee, VA.  Cordoba University is
      in Orange County, VA. Fort Lee is southeast of Richmond, while Orange is southwest
      of Fredericksburg.  Richmond is considerably east of Fredericksburg. Therefore,

      and west.  Harlem is further north, but also further inland (west) than the

      a location further East will have a higher street number or avenue address.


      3. **Compare locations based on East/West positioning:**  I need specific address
      information to be certain.  However, general knowledge of Manhattan geography
      suggests CCNY (and therefore Sophie Davis) is further West/inland than the Upper
      East Side, where Rockefeller is located.

      Minnesota State Community and Technical College has multiple campuses, but its
      main administrative location appears to be in Fergus Falls. Northland Community
      & Technical College has campuses in Thief River Falls and East Grand Forks.  Fergus
      Falls is noticeably west of both Thief River Falls and East Grand Forks.

      need to determine the geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) or general
      location (city and state) of both colleges.

      2. **Compare longitudes:** Since the question asks about East/West, longitude
      is the relevant coordinate.  A location further East will have a higher longitude
      value.

      3. **Determine if Minnesota State Community and Technical College has a higher
      longitude:**  If Minnesota State Community and Technical College has a higher
      longitude than Northland Community & Technical College, it is located east of
      it.


      Minnesota State Community and Technical College has multiple campuses. Its westernmost
      campus appears to be in Moorhead.  Northland Community & Technical College has
      campuses in Thief River Falls and East Grand Forks. Both of these are west of
      Moorhead.

      3. **Determine East/West relationship:** If Strayer University''s longitude

      Searching online, Strayer University''s DC campus appears to have several locations,
      but the main campus seems to be near 1100 15th St NW. The Corcoran College of
      Art and Design *was* located at 500 17th St NW, Washington, DC. It merged with
      the George Washington University and that building now houses the GW Corcoran
      School of the Arts & Design.


      Since both are on NW streets, we are comparing which street number is further
      east.  17th St NW is east of 15th St NW.


      Therefore, Strayer University (near 15th St NW) is *west* of the former Corcoran
      College of Art and Design (17th St NW).

      GA:** Ralston College is located in Savannah, Georgia.


      2. **Find the location of South University, GA:**  South University has several
      campuses in Georgia.  To be sure, we need to specify which campus. Assuming
      the question refers to the main campus, it is located in Savannah, Georgia.


      3. **Determine relative location:** Since both colleges are in the same city,
      one cannot be strictly *east* of the other.  They might be adjacent, across
      the street, or in different parts of the city, but not in an east/west relationship
      in the way states are.


      **Answer:** NO

    665650bc-8a1c-4f4a-ac61-7afd1471e35f: '1. **Find the locations of Ralston College
      and South University in Georgia.**  Ralston College is in Savannah, GA. South
      University has campuses in several states, including one in Savannah, GA.  Since
      they are in the same city, the question of one being "east of" the other is
      nuanced.


      2. **Determine if they have specific street addresses.**  This would allow for
      a precise comparison.  Ralston''s address is 201 Bull Street, Savannah. South
      University''s Savannah campus is at 709 Mall Blvd, Savannah.


      3. **Compare their locations using a map.**  A quick map check shows that 201
      Bull Street (Ralston) is slightly east of 709 Mall Blvd (South University).


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

    84833304-c275-4d77-a3b9-c18f5631a6a0: '1. **Locate Ralston College, GA:** Ralston
      College is located in Savannah, Georgia.

      2. **Locate South University, GA:** South University has several campuses in
      Georgia. To avoid ambiguity, let''s assume the question refers to the main campus
      in Savannah, Georgia.

      3. **Determine relative positions:** Since both colleges are in the same city,
      the question becomes irrelevant.  They might be across the street from each
      other, a few blocks away, or further, but "east of" doesn''t hold the same meaning
      when two locations are so close in the same city.


      Therefore, the premise of the question is flawed. However, if forced to provide
      a YES/NO answer based on a more general interpretation of "east of," the answer
      would most likely be **NO**. It''s highly improbable that one specific location
      within a city is precisely due east of another specific location within the
      same city.

      2. **Since both are in the same city, determine if one is significantly east
      of the other within Savannah.**  A quick search reveals they are very close
      to each other, practically neighbors.  Ralston College is slightly northeast
      of South University.


      3. **Determine if "slightly northeast" counts as "east".** While northeast isn''t
      purely east, it does have an eastward component.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

    596e1bb6-fec0-445e-a5ab-2e7461907b64: '1. **Find the locations of the two universities:**  I
      need to determine the general geographic location of King University in Virginia
      and Lander University in South Carolina.


      2. **Focus on Longitude:** Since the question is about East vs. West, I need
      to consider the longitude of each university.  A university further East will
      have a *lower* numerical value for its longitude coordinate (since longitude
      lines decrease as you go East from the Prime Meridian).


      3. **Compare Longitudes:** Once I have the approximate longitude for each university
      I can compare them.


      4. **Formulate Answer:** If King University has a lower longitude value than
      Lander University, then it is East of Lander University, and the answer is YES.  Otherwise,
      the answer is NO.


      King University (Bristol, TN/VA) is located around -82.1 degrees longitude.
      Lander University (Greenwood, SC) is located around -82.3 degrees longitude.
      Since King University has a lower longitude value, it is east.

      need to determine the geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) or general
      location (city, state) of both universities.

      2. **Compare longitudes:** Since we are concerned with East/West, longitude
      is the relevant coordinate.  A location further East will have a higher longitude
      value.

      3. **Determine if Texas Woman''s University has a higher longitude:** If Texas
      Woman''s University has a higher longitude than Arlington Baptist College, then
      it is located east of it.
