      - Connecticut is south of New Hampshire

      - Eastern Connecticut State University is in the eastern part of Connecticut

      - Keene, NH is in the southwestern part of New Hampshire


      4. Determine their relative east-west positioning:

      - Given their state locations, Eastern Connecticut State University is east
      of the Cohen Center


      5. Therefore, the answer is: YES, Eastern Connecticut State University is located
      east of Cohen Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies.

      7. If the Agriculture college is west, then the Health and Human Sciences college
      is east.


      8. The question asks: "Is Purdue University College of Agriculture, IN located
      east of Purdue University College of Health and Human Sciences, IN?"


      9. Since the Agriculture college is west, not east, of the Health and Human
      Sciences college, the answer is:


      NO'
