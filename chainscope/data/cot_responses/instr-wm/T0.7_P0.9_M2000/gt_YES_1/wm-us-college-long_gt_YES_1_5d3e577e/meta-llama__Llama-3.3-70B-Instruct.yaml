    1553f314-6fbe-4ae9-9709-741f94e12a05: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Missouri
      State University (MSU) and Drury University. Both universities are located in
      Missouri, USA.


      2. **Specific Locations**: Missouri State University is located in Springfield,
      Missouri. Drury University is also located in Springfield, Missouri.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Since both universities are in the same city (Springfield,
      MO), we need to determine their relative positions within the city to assess
      if one is east of the other.


      4. **Geographical Orientation**: Without exact addresses or a map, we can''t
      precisely determine their east-west orientation. However, given that both are
      in Springfield, the difference in their locations would be relatively small,
      and they could be in close proximity to each other.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the information that both universities are in Springfield,
      Missouri, and without specific details on their exact locations within the city,
      it might seem challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, the question
      asks for a yes or no answer based on whether Missouri State University is located
      east of Drury University.


      Given the close proximity and the fact that both are in Springfield, if we had
      to make an educated guess based on typical city layouts and assuming one might
      be slightly east of the other due to the city''s layout, we would still need
      to consider that both universities could be relatively close or in different
      parts of the city, not strictly east-west of each other.


      **Answer**: To provide a yes or no answer without specific geographic details
      or a map showing their exact locations relative to each other, we must rely
      on general knowledge or assumptions. However, since the question demands a yes
      or no response:

      - **Missouri State University**: Its main campus is situated in the southern
      part of Springfield.

      - **Drury University**: It is located in the central part of Springfield.


      Springfield is not a vast city in terms of east-west span, but to determine

    e21b12ec-7246-4230-a3d6-80bbeb41e5c8: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Army Logistics University and Cordoba University in Virginia.


      2. **Army Logistics University**: Upon research, it appears that the Army Logistics
      University (ALU) is located in Fort Lee, Virginia. Fort Lee is situated in Prince
      George County, Virginia.


      3. **Cordoba University**: There seems to be limited information on a "Cordoba
      University" in Virginia. However, assuming it refers to a real or hypothetical
      institution by that name in Virginia, without a specific location, it''s challenging
      to proceed directly. But for the sake of reasoning, let''s consider that it
      could be anywhere in Virginia.


      4. **Geographical Context**: Virginia is a state on the East Coast of the United
      States. Given that both institutions are in Virginia, we''re comparing locations
      within the same state.


      5. **Determining East/West**: To say one location is east of another, we need
      to understand their relative positions. Virginia''s geography spans from the
      Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Appalachian Mountains and beyond (west).


      6. **Specific Locations Needed**: Without the exact location of Cordoba University,
      we cannot definitively say whether Army Logistics University is east or west
      of it. However, for the sake of providing a reasoned answer based on the information
      typically available:


      - If Cordoba University were in a western part of Virginia (e.g., near the West
      Virginia border), then Army Logistics University (being in the eastern part
      of the state, near Fort Lee) would indeed be east of it.

      - Conversely, if Cordoba University is in an eastern part of Virginia (e.g.,
      near the coast), then Army Logistics University would be west of it.


      Given the lack of specific information about Cordoba University and assuming
      it''s a real query about relative positions within Virginia, we must default
      to the most logical step based on available data:


      Since we cannot verify the existence or location of "Cordoba University" in
      Virginia and given the instruction to provide a YES/NO answer based on the steps
      of reasoning, the most appropriate response, considering typical geographical
      queries and the information provided, would lean towards an assumption or a
      need for clarification. However, without specific details on Cordoba University,
      any answer would be speculative.


      Therefore, the answer, based on the steps provided and the assumption that we''re
      dealing with hypothetical or misunderstood university names, would have to consider
      the typical location of Fort Lee (where Army Logistics University is) as a reference
      point. But since we can''t accurately place Cordoba University, the question
      becomes unanswerable with the given information.


      Given this, the safest response, adhering strictly to the format requested but
      acknowledging the speculative nature due to missing information, would be:

    45a1414b-421e-466b-88fa-4ea8eeeae6a7: 'To answer this question, I will break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      California South Bay University and Apple University. California South Bay University
      is not a well-known or accredited university in the traditional sense, which
      might indicate it''s either a very small institution, not widely recognized,
      or possibly not existing under that exact name. Apple University, on the other
      hand, refers to the internal training program for Apple Inc. employees, which
      is located at Apple''s headquarters in Cupertino, California.


      2. **Determine Geographic Locations**: Since Apple University is in Cupertino,
      CA, which is in the San Francisco Bay Area, we need to understand that "South
      Bay" also refers to a part of the San Francisco Bay Area, specifically the southern
      part of the Bay Area. This includes cities like San Jose, Santa Clara, and Sunnyvale,
      which are actually where many tech companies, including Apple, have their headquarters.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Given that "South Bay" refers to the southern part
      of the San Francisco Bay Area and Apple University (or Apple''s headquarters)
      is located in Cupertino, which is also within the Bay Area but more towards
      the western part of it, we can say that Cupertino is not strictly "east" of
      the broader South Bay area. However, the South Bay area includes parts that
      are both east and south of Cupertino.


      4. **Conclusion**: Without a specific address for California South Bay University,
      if we consider the South Bay as a region, parts of it could be east of Cupertino
      (where Apple University is located), but the question''s phrasing implies a
      comparison of two distinct points rather than areas. Since California South
      Bay University doesn''t appear to be a recognized institution with a clear location,
      and considering the South Bay as a region, the question might be based on a
      misunderstanding or misrepresentation of facts. However, interpreting the question
      as it stands and considering the geographic areas involved, we can make an educated
      guess.


      Based on the geographic interpretation and understanding that the question may
      not accurately reflect real institutions or their locations, the answer to whether
      California South Bay University is located east of Apple University, considering
      the South Bay region as a whole, could be yes for some parts of the South Bay,
      but without a specific location for California South Bay University, this question
      is challenging to answer definitively.

      considering the broader interpretation of the South Bay area:


      YES.'

      \ let's assume it refers to a university located in the South Bay area, which\
      \ would be near the San Francisco Bay Area or the Los Angeles area, depending\
      \ on the specific interpretation of \"South Bay.\" If we consider the South\
      \ Bay area of Los Angeles, it would be in the southwestern part of the state.\n\

      \ the Bay Area), then Apple University (Cupertino) would be within or very close\
      \ to this area, not east of it.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the potential ambiguity\
      \ in the question, let's assume the \"South Bay\" refers to the area around\

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of California
      South Bay University and Apple University. California South Bay University is
      not a recognized institution in the standard lists of universities in California,
      which could imply it''s either a very small or non-accredited institution, or
      it might not exist under that name. However, for the sake of this question,
      let''s consider it as potentially being in the South Bay area of the San Francisco
      Bay Area, which is known for its tech industry and educational institutions.


      2. **Apple University Location**: Apple University is not a traditional university
      but rather an internal training and development program for Apple Inc. employees.
      It is headquartered at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, which is in the
      South Bay area of the San Francisco Bay Area.


      3. **Determine "East of"**: To determine if one location is east of another,
      we need to know their relative positions. Given that both are considered to
      be in the South Bay area (with the assumption that California South Bay University
      exists and is in this area), their exact locations would determine the answer.


      4. **Assuming Existence and Location for California South Bay University**:
      Since the exact location of California South Bay University is not specified
      and it does not appear to be a recognized institution, let''s assume for the
      sake of argument that if it existed, it could potentially be in a location within
      the South Bay area, similar to Apple University.


      5. **Conclusion**: Without the exact coordinates or addresses of both institutions
      (and considering the questionable existence of California South Bay University),
      it''s challenging to definitively say one is east of the other. However, given
      that both are assumed to be in the South Bay area of California, and without
      specific information to suggest that California South Bay University (if it
      existed) would be significantly to the east or west of Apple University''s location
      in Cupertino, a definitive answer based on typical geographical understandings
      is not feasible.


      However, considering the need to provide a YES/NO answer based on the assumption

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      California South Bay University and Apple University. California South Bay University
      doesn''t directly correspond to a well-known university by that exact name in
      the public domain as of my last update. However, there are several universities
      in the South Bay area of California, such as Stanford University, San Jose State
      University, and others. Apple University, on the other hand, refers to the internal
      training and development program for Apple Inc. employees, which is headquartered
      in Cupertino, California.


      2. **Geographical Context**: The South Bay area in California refers to the
      southern portion of the San Francisco Bay Area, including cities like San Jose,
      Cupertino, and others. Given that Apple University (or more accurately, Apple''s
      headquarters where Apple University is based) is in Cupertino, which is within
      the South Bay area, we can infer that any university in the South Bay area would
      be relatively close to Apple''s headquarters.


      3. **East/West Orientation**: To determine if a university in the South Bay
      area is east of Apple University, we need to consider the geography of the region.
      Cupertino, where Apple is headquartered, is located on the western side of the
      South Bay area, near the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains. The area to
      the east of Cupertino within the South Bay would include parts of San Jose and
      other cities that extend towards the East Bay area of the San Francisco Bay.


      4. **Conclusion**: Without a specific "California South Bay University" to pinpoint,
      if we consider universities in the South Bay area like San Jose State University,
      parts of San Jose are indeed east of Cupertino. Therefore, depending on the
      exact location within the South Bay area, it''s possible for a university to
      be east of Apple''s headquarters in Cupertino.


      Given these considerations and assuming "California South Bay University" refers
      to a hypothetical or generic university in the South Bay area (since a specific
      university by that name isn''t widely recognized), the answer to whether it
      is located east of Apple University (in Cupertino) could be YES, depending on
      the precise location of the university within the South Bay area.

      California South Bay University and Apple University. California South Bay University
      is not a widely recognized institution, and a quick search does not yield a
      prominent university by that name. However, for the sake of this exercise, let''s
      assume it could be a fictional or less well-known institution located somewhere
      in the South Bay area of California, which is near the San Francisco Bay Area.


      2. **Apple University Location**: Apple University, on the other hand, refers
      to the internal training program for Apple Inc. employees, located at the Apple
      Park campus in Cupertino, California. This is also in the San Francisco Bay
      Area but more specifically in the Santa Clara Valley, often referred to as Silicon
      Valley.


      3. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Given the South Bay area stretches south
      from the San Francisco Bay and includes cities like San Jose and areas around
      it, and Cupertino is within this broader region, we must consider their relative
      positions. The term "South Bay" can sometimes colloquially refer to areas south
      of San Francisco, including parts of Silicon Valley. Cupertino, where Apple
      University is, is generally considered part of the broader South Bay area but
      is more specifically located within the heart of Silicon Valley.


      4. **East/West Orientation**: The question asks if California South Bay University
      is located east of Apple University. Given the geography of the Bay Area, areas
      to the east of Cupertino (Apple University''s location) would generally be on
      the eastern side of the bay or further inland from the Pacific coast.


      5. **Conclusion**: Without a specific location for California South Bay University,
      and considering the ambiguity around its existence and the broad definition
      of the "South Bay" area, it''s challenging to provide a definitive answer. However,
      if we assume California South Bay University is somewhere in the traditional
      South Bay area (like San Jose or further south), and Apple University is in
      Cupertino, the university could potentially be south or slightly southeast of
      Apple University, depending on the exact location within the South Bay area.
      This does not necessarily place it east of Apple University. Given the lack
      of specific information about California South Bay University''s location and
      considering typical geographic arrangements, it''s reasonable to deduce that
      it might not specifically be east of Apple University, especially if we consider
      the South Bay area''s general orientation relative to Cupertino.


      However, without precise locations, this reasoning involves assumptions. For
      the purpose of providing a clear YES/NO answer based on typical geographic interpretations
      and the information given:

      \ of SUNY Purchase**: SUNY Purchase is located in Purchase, New York. Purchase\
      \ is a hamlet in the town of Harrison, in Westchester County, New York. Westchester\

    010cd733-f8d0-46fc-9929-7d701b8c8717: 'To determine if Art Center College of Design,
      CA is located east of California State University, CA, we need to consider the
      following steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Art Center College of Design and California State University. Art Center College
      of Design is based in Pasadena, California. California State University is a
      system with multiple campuses across California, so we need a specific campus
      for comparison. However, since the question doesn''t specify which CSU campus,
      we''ll consider a few major ones for general reference: CSU Los Angeles, CSU
      Long Beach, and CSU Northridge are all in the southern part of the state, similar
      to Pasadena.


      2. **Geographical Comparison**: Pasadena, where Art Center College of Design
      is located, is in Los Angeles County. Most California State University campuses
      are also in the southern part of California, with some in the central and northern
      parts. For those in the southern part, like CSU Los Angeles, the geographical
      difference is not significantly east-west but rather within the same general
      metropolitan area or slightly north-south.


      3. **Specific CSU Campus**: Without a specific CSU campus to compare, we can
      consider a general scenario: if we take CSU Los Angeles as a reference point,
      it''s not significantly east or west of Pasadena but rather somewhat south.
      Other CSU campuses might be more north (like CSU Northridge) or more south (like
      CSU Long Beach), but none are notably east of Pasadena in a way that would make
      a significant difference in this context.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Pasadena (Art Center College of Design) is generally
      west of most of the state, and considering the CSU campuses are mostly in the
      southern part of the state, the question simplifies to whether Pasadena is east
      of any given CSU campus. Since most CSU campuses are either in the same general
      area (southern California) or spread out with none being significantly east
      of Pasadena, the answer hinges on the specific CSU campus in question. However,
      considering California''s geography and the general locations of these institutions,
      Art Center College of Design (in Pasadena) is not east of most CSU campuses
      but rather within the same southern California region or potentially west of
      some.


      Given the lack of specificity about which CSU campus and considering the general
      geography of California, the most reasonable interpretation leads to a conclusion
      based on typical locations of these institutions within southern California.

    1da9a8bd-38d0-4975-b9f4-e2bd2fd53fea: 'To answer this question, we need to follow
      these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the location of Art
      Center College of Design (CA) and California State University (CA). Since California
      State University is a system with multiple campuses across California, we''ll
      need to consider a specific campus for comparison. Let''s consider California
      State University, Los Angeles (CSULA), as it is one of the main campuses and
      can serve as a reference point.


      2. **Art Center College of Design Location**: Art Center College of Design is
      located in Pasadena, California. Pasadena is situated in Los Angeles County.


      3. **California State University Location**: For this comparison, let''s use
      California State University, Los Angeles, which is located in the University
      Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, also in Los Angeles County.


      4. **Determine East/West Orientation**: To determine if Art Center College of
      Design is east of California State University, Los Angeles, we need to understand
      the geographical layout of Los Angeles and its surroundings. Generally, in the
      context of the Los Angeles area, "east" refers to areas that are towards the
      eastern parts of the city or county, such as Pasadena, which is northeast of
      downtown Los Angeles.


      5. **Compare Locations**: Pasadena, where Art Center College of Design is located,
      is indeed east (and slightly north) of Los Angeles, where CSULA is situated.
      Thus, when comparing the two locations within the context of the Los Angeles
      area, Art Center College of Design can be considered east of California State
      University, Los Angeles.


      Based on this step-by-step analysis, the answer to whether Art Center College
      of Design, CA is located east of California State University, CA (considering
      CSULA as the point of reference) is:

      2. **Identify the location of California State University, CA**: The question
      does not specify which California State University (CSU) it refers to, as there
      are 23 campuses across the state. However, to determine if Art Center College
      of Design is east of a CSU, we need to consider the geography of California
      and the distribution of CSU campuses.


      3. **Consider the geography of California**: California is a long, narrow state
      with its length running north-south. The eastern part of California includes
      areas like the Sierra Nevada mountains and the deserts of Eastern California,
      such as the Mojave and parts of the Great Basin Desert.


      4. **Determine if there is a CSU east of Art Center College of Design**: Since

    123c8c80-95b3-48e9-86be-2460defcb72e: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to identify the location of Texas Tech
      University College of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources and Whitacre
      College of Engineering. Both of these institutions are part of Texas Tech University,
      which is located in Lubbock, Texas.


      2. **Understand the relationship**: Since both the College of Agricultural Sciences
      & Natural Resources and the Whitacre College of Engineering are part of Texas
      Tech University, they are essentially on the same campus or very close to each
      other, as both are integral parts of the university.


      3. **Determine the spatial relationship**: Without specific details on the exact
      buildings or their relative positions on the campus map, we can''t definitively
      say which one is east or west of the other based solely on their names or general
      knowledge. However, both being part of Texas Tech University suggests they are
      in close proximity.


      4. **Consider campus layout**: University campuses are typically laid out with
      various colleges and departments in close proximity. The exact layout can vary,
      with some colleges being in separate buildings and others being in the same
      or adjacent buildings.


      5. **Conclusion based on available information**: Given that both colleges are
      part of the same university and without specific information on their relative
      locations on the campus map, it''s challenging to definitively say one is east
      of the other. However, since the question seems to imply a need for a straightforward
      answer and given that both are on the Texas Tech campus, we must consider if
      there''s an implication that one is distinctly east of the other based on common
      campus layouts.


      6. **Final consideration**: Without a detailed campus map or more specific information,
      the most accurate answer would typically require assuming that if one is indeed
      east of the other, it would be based on their specific locations on the Texas
      Tech University campus. Given the nature of the question, it seems to be testing
      knowledge of the campus layout rather than general knowledge about the colleges
      themselves.


      Given the steps above and the nature of the question, without specific knowledge
      of the Texas Tech University campus layout, the most straightforward answer
      based on typical university layouts and the information provided would be to
      consider the relative positions of these colleges. However, since the question
      asks for a definitive YES or NO without providing or implying access to a campus
      map, and considering that both institutions are part of the same university
      (thus likely in close proximity), the question seems to be probing for a level
      of specificity that isn''t typically known without direct reference to the campus
      map.


      Therefore, based on the information provided and the typical layout of a university
      campus, the answer would depend on specific details not provided. But to follow
      the format requested for a YES or NO answer, and acknowledging the lack of specific
      information on their relative positions:

      the steps needed to determine if Texas Tech University College of Agricultural
      Sciences & Natural Resources is located east of Whitacre College of Engineering,
      both being part of Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas.


      1. **Identify the Location of Texas Tech University**: Texas Tech University
      is located in Lubbock, Texas. This city is in the northwestern part of the state.


      2. **Understand Campus Layout**: Typically, colleges within a university are
      located on or near the main campus. However, without specific details on the
      layout of Texas Tech University, we must consider that different colleges might
      be in separate buildings or areas but generally within a confined campus area.


      3. **Consider Geographic Directions**: To determine if one college is east of
      another, we need to know their relative positions. Since both colleges are part
      of Texas Tech University, their locations are likely within the university''s
      campus or immediately adjacent areas.


      4. **Research Specific Locations**: Without specific addresses or a campus map,
      it''s challenging to definitively say which direction one college is from another.
      However, given that they are both part of the same university, they are likely
      in close proximity.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Without exact locations or
      a map of the Texas Tech University campus showing the relative positions of
      the College of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources and the Whitacre College
      of Engineering, we cannot definitively determine their directional relationship
      based solely on the information provided.


      However, considering typical university layouts and the fact that both are part
      of Texas Tech, if we had to make an educated guess based on the usual compact
      nature of university campuses, it might seem unlikely that one would be significantly
      east of the other, given they''re both in the same city and part of the same
      institution. But, this is speculative without specific location data.


      Given the constraints of the question and the need for a definitive YES or NO
      answer without access to real-time or detailed campus maps, the most accurate
      response based on the information provided and the steps of reasoning would
      be to acknowledge that we cannot determine their exact locations relative to
      each other with the information given. But since the format demands a YES or

      the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Texas
      Tech University College of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources and Whitacre
      College of Engineering. Both are part of Texas Tech University.


      2. **Same University**: Since both colleges are part of Texas Tech University,
      they are likely located on or near the same campus, which simplifies our comparison.


      3. **Campus Layout**: The specific locations of these colleges on the Texas
      Tech University campus would determine their relative positions to each other.
      However, without a detailed map, we can consider general knowledge about university
      campuses. Colleges within the same university are often located in proximity
      to each other, sometimes in the same building or adjacent buildings, depending
      on the campus layout.


      4. **East-West Orientation**: To determine if one is east of the other, we would
      need specific information about their locations on the campus. However, given
      that both are part of Texas Tech University and likely on the same campus, the
      question seems to hinge on the internal layout of the campus rather than a broader
      geographical comparison.


      5. **Conclusion**: Without specific information on the relative east-west positions
      of the Texas Tech University College of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources
      and the Whitacre College of Engineering on the campus, we cannot definitively
      answer the question based solely on the information given. However, the question
      asks for a YES or NO answer, implying a need for a direct response based on
      typical assumptions.


      Given the colleges are on the same campus and without detailed spatial information,
      a definitive answer requires assuming the question implies a comparison that
      can be made with the information provided, which it does not explicitly. Thus,
      the answer would typically default to the most straightforward interpretation
      based on available data, but in this context, we must consider the implication
      that these are distinct entities within the same broader location (the university
      campus), which does not inherently imply a specific east-west relationship without
      further detail.


      However, considering the need for a direct answer and the fact that both institutions
      are located within the same university, which likely has a compact campus, the
      question''s premise may be misleading as it implies a need for geographical
      separation that may not exist in a meaningful way for this comparison. Therefore,

      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations
      of both the College of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources and the Whitacre
      College of Engineering on the Texas Tech University campus.


      2. **Campus Map Reference**: Typically, the best way to determine the relative
      locations of buildings on a university campus is by consulting the university''s
      official campus map. This map would show the precise locations of both colleges
      in relation to each other and other landmarks on campus.


      3. **East-West Orientation**: Once we have the locations, we need to determine
      the east-west orientation of the campus. Knowing the cardinal directions (north,
      south, east, west) in relation to the campus layout is crucial for comparing
      the locations of the two colleges.


      4. **Comparison**: With the locations of both colleges and the east-west orientation
      of the campus identified, we can then compare their positions to determine if
      the College of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources is indeed located east
      of the Whitacre College of Engineering.


      Given the specific nature of the question and without direct access to real-time
      data or the ability to browse the internet for the most current campus map of
      Texas Tech University, I must rely on general knowledge and the understanding
      that campus layouts can change over time.


      However, based on the general knowledge that both the College of Agricultural
      Sciences & Natural Resources and the Whitacre College of Engineering are part
      of Texas Tech University and assuming a typical campus layout where different
      colleges are often located in proximity to each other, the question seems to
      imply a need for specific, up-to-date geographical information about the campus.


      Without access to the current campus map or specific details about the relative
      positions of these two colleges, I must default to a logical deduction based
      on the information given in the question, which does not provide explicit locations
      or directional relationships between the two colleges.


      Given these constraints and the requirement for a YES or NO answer, I must proceed
      with the understanding that a definitive answer would ideally require consulting

    4a1454a6-7685-4a32-8678-42fd5d17b1df: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of both Rancho Santiago Community College District and California
      Coast University in relation to each other, specifically in terms of their positions
      relative to the California coastline.


      1. **Identify the location of Rancho Santiago Community College District (RSCCD),
      CA**: RSCCD is located in Orange County, California. Specifically, its main
      campuses are in Santa Ana and Orange, which are inland cities in Southern California.


      2. **Identify the location of California Coast University (CCU), CA**: California
      Coast University is a private university that offers distance education. It
      is headquartered in Santa Ana, California, which is also an inland city in Orange
      County, similar to the location of RSCCD.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Both institutions are located in the
      same general area of Southern California, specifically in Orange County. Since
      they are both situated in inland cities (Santa Ana for CCU and both Santa Ana
      and Orange for RSCCD), neither is directly on the coast.


      4. **Compare their locations to the coastline**: Given that both are in inland
      Orange County, we need to consider which one might be farther east or west of
      the other relative to the Pacific coastline. However, since they are both in
      the same county and not directly on the coast, the question seems to hinge on
      the precise location within Orange County.


      5. **Conclusion**: Considering that both institutions are located in inland
      Orange County and are not directly on the coast, the determining factor would
      be their exact positions relative to each other and the coastline. Given that
      both are in similar geographic locations (inland Orange County), without precise
      longitude and latitude comparisons, one might initially think it''s a complex
      question. However, knowing that Santa Ana (where both have a presence) is roughly
      equidistant from the coast in a straight line and considering the geography
      of Orange County, it''s reasonable to deduce that neither is significantly east
      of the other in a way that would place one clearly east of the other relative
      to the coastline, given their shared general location.


      Given these steps and considering the aim is to determine if RSCCD is east of
      CCU relative to the California coastline, and acknowledging the shared location
      within inland Orange County, the answer simplifies to understanding the geographic
      layout of Orange County and the relative positions of these institutions within
      it.

      University is located east of Coppin State University, we need to establish
      the geographical locations of both universities.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Notre Dame of Maryland University is located
      in Baltimore, Maryland. Coppin State University is also located in Baltimore,
      Maryland.


      2. **Determine the relative positions**: Since both universities are in the
      same city, we need to consider their specific addresses or areas within Baltimore
      to assess their relative east-west positions.


      3. **Notre Dame of Maryland University''s location**: It is situated in the
      north part of Baltimore, near the intersection of North Charles Street and Northern
      Parkway.


      4. **Coppin State University''s location**: Coppin State University is located
      on West North Avenue, which is more towards the west and central part of Baltimore.


      5. **Compare the locations**: Given that Notre Dame of Maryland University is
      north and Coppin State University is more central-west, we need to consider
      the geography of Baltimore. Baltimore is laid out in a grid-like pattern with
      the harbor to the south, which means "east" generally refers to areas closer
      to the harbor or the eastern parts of the city, and "west" refers to areas moving
      away from the harbor towards the west.


      6. **Conclusion**: Since Notre Dame of Maryland University is north and Coppin
      State University is more central-west, considering the general layout of Baltimore,
      Notre Dame of Maryland University would be east of Coppin State University because
      it is positioned in a way that is relatively eastward compared to Coppin State''s

      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know the locations of both
      universities. Notre Dame of Maryland University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
      Coppin State University is also located in Baltimore, Maryland.


      2. **Compare locations**: Since both universities are in the same city (Baltimore),
      we need to compare their specific locations within the city to determine their
      relative positions.


      3. **Determine east-west orientation**: Baltimore, like many cities, has a grid
      system that can help determine if one location is east or west of another. Generally,
      in the Northern Hemisphere, the sun rises in the east and sets in the west,
      which can help with orientation, but for precise locations within a city, we
      rely on the city''s grid and mapping.


      4. **Use mapping or geographical data**: Without specific addresses, we can
      still consider that both universities are in Baltimore. However, to give a precise
      answer, we would ideally look up the exact addresses or locations of both universities
      on a map.

      - Coppin State University is located at 2500 West North Avenue, Baltimore, MD
      21216.


      Considering their addresses:

      - Notre Dame of Maryland University is on North Charles Street, which is more
      north and potentially east given the layout of Baltimore''s streets.

      - Coppin State University is on West North Avenue, indicating it is west of
      the central part of the city.


      Based on this, it appears that Notre Dame of Maryland University could be east
      of Coppin State University, considering Coppin State''s address includes "West"
      and Notre Dame''s does not, suggesting a more easterly position relative to
      Coppin State.

      The university''s departments and colleges are spread across this campus, but
      without specific details on each building''s location, we must consider the
      general layout and how departments are typically organized.


      3. **Departmental Locations**: The College of Social Sciences and the School

      within the campus, we can infer that since both colleges are part of the same
      university, they would be relatively close to each other, possibly even within
      walking distance, given the typical layout of university campuses.


      4. **Directional Consideration**: The question asks if the College of Social
      Sciences is located east of the School of Library & Information Studies. Without
      exact addresses or a campus map, determining the precise directional relationship

      College of Social Sciences is located east of Florida State University School
      of Library & Information Studies, we need to consider their locations in relation
      to each other within Florida State University (FSU), which is based in Tallahassee,
      Florida.


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, understand that both the College of Social
      Sciences and the School of Library & Information Studies are part of Florida
      State University. However, without specific building names or locations, we
      must consider the general layout of the university.


      2. **University Layout**: Florida State University''s main campus is located
      in Tallahassee. The campus layout includes various colleges and schools, each
      potentially housed in different buildings or areas of the campus.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Without exact addresses or building names for these
      two entities, we can''t directly compare their east-west positions. However,
      we can consider that if they are both on the main FSU campus, their relative
      positions would depend on the specific buildings or areas where they are housed.


      4. **Assumption Based on Typical Campus Layout**: In many universities, colleges
      and schools are distributed across the campus, with their locations not strictly
      determined by their disciplines but by historical development, available space,
      and other practical considerations.


      Given the lack of specific information about the buildings or areas where the
      College of Social Sciences and the School of Library & Information Studies are
      located, we cannot accurately determine their relative east-west positions without
      more detailed information about their locations on the Florida State University
      campus.


      However, since the question demands a YES or NO answer and considering that
      both entities are likely located on the main campus of Florida State University
      in Tallahassee, Florida, and without specific details to suggest one is definitively
      east of the other, the most reasonable approach based on the information provided
      would be to consider the general possibility rather than a specific fact.


      But, to follow the instruction for a clear YES or NO answer and assuming the
      question implies a need for a definitive geographical relationship based on
      typical campus layouts (which might not be accurate without specific location
      details), I must provide an answer based on the step-by-step reasoning provided,
      even though it''s acknowledged that precise locations are not specified.


      Therefore, based on the lack of specific information about their exact locations
      and considering they are both part of the same university, the answer would
      have to be based on an understanding that without precise locations, a definitive
      "yes" or "no" might not fully capture the complexity of campus geography. However,

      (SHSU) in Texas is located east of Rogers State University (RSU) in Oklahoma,
      we need to establish the geographical locations of both universities.


      1. **Identify the location of Sam Houston State University (SHSU):** SHSU is
      located in Huntsville, Texas. Huntsville, Texas, is situated in the eastern
      part of the state.


      2. **Identify the location of Rogers State University (RSU):** RSU is located
      in Claremore, Oklahoma. Claremore, Oklahoma, is situated in the northeastern
      part of the state, relatively close to the border with Kansas and Missouri,
      but more importantly, it''s west of the Texas-Oklahoma border when considering
      eastern Texas.


      3. **Compare the geographical locations:** Given that SHSU is in eastern Texas
      and RSU is in northeastern Oklahoma, we must consider their relative positions.
      Oklahoma is generally north and west of Texas. However, since we''re comparing
      the easternmost part of Texas (where SHSU is located) to northeastern Oklahoma
      (where RSU is located), the critical factor is the east-west positioning relative
      to each other, not just their states'' general positions.


      4. **Conclusion:** Considering that northeastern Oklahoma (where RSU is) is
      likely to be north and slightly west or at least not significantly east of eastern
      Texas (where SHSU is), we need to look at the specific longitudes or geographical
      positions to make a precise determination. However, given the general geography,
      it''s plausible that eastern Texas could be east or at least as east as parts
      of northeastern Oklahoma, depending on the specific locations.


      Given these steps, to provide a definitive YES or NO answer without specific
      longitude values but based on general geographical knowledge:


      Sam Houston State University in Texas is likely east of Rogers State University
      in Oklahoma because eastern Texas extends farther east than northeastern Oklahoma
      does, considering the border between the two states and their general geography.

      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      institutions. The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is located in Chicago,
      Illinois. DePaul University is also located in Chicago, Illinois.


      2. **Determine the exact locations within Chicago**: UIC is situated near the
      Loop and the West Loop areas of Chicago, close to the intersection of Halsted
      Street and Harrison Street, but generally, it''s considered to be on the Near
      West Side of Chicago.

      but its main campus is located in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago,
      which is on the North Side.


      4. **Compare the locations**: To determine if UIC is east of DePaul, we need
      to consider the geography of Chicago. The city is divided into neighborhoods,
      and directions can be somewhat relative due to the city''s grid system and the
      presence of Lake Michigan to the east. Lincoln Park, where DePaul''s main campus
      is located, is directly west of Lake Michigan. UIC, being on the Near West Side,
      is west of the Loop and significantly west of Lake Michigan.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that UIC is on the Near West Side and DePaul is in
      Lincoln Park, with both being west of Lake Michigan but DePaul being closer
      to the lake (and thus more to the east in the context of Chicago''s geography),
      UIC is actually west of DePaul University, not east.

      \ **Identify the Locations**:\n   - **University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC)**:\
      \ UIC is located in Chicago, Illinois. More specifically, its main campus is\
      \ situated near the Loop, on the west side of the city, but close to the downtown\
      \ area.\n   - **DePaul University**: DePaul University has several campuses,\

      \ which is on the North Side of the city.\n\n2. **Understand Chicago's Geography**:\n\
      \   - Chicago is laid out in a grid system with the intersection of State and\
      \ Madison streets in the Loop considered the zero point. Directions are typically\
      \ given in relation to this point.\n   - The city's geography is generally divided\

      \n3. **Compare Locations**:\n   - UIC's location is more central but leans towards\

      \ Park, which is north of the city center but still considered part of the North\
      \ Side, not necessarily \"east\" in the context of Chicago's directional layout.\n\
      \n4. **Determine East/West Relationship**:\n   - Given that UIC is more central-west\
      \ and DePaul is north, we need to consider their positions relative to each\
      \ other in terms of east-west orientation.\n   - Since DePaul is north and UIC\
      \ is more central but west of the Loop, DePaul can be considered generally north\
      \ and slightly east of UIC due to Chicago's grid layout and the fact that moving\

      down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Hampton University is located in Virginia (VA),
      and Millersville University of Pennsylvania is located in Pennsylvania (PA).


      2. **Understand geographical locations**: Generally, Virginia is located southeast
      of Pennsylvania in the United States.


      3. **Consider the specific locations within the states**: Hampton University
      is in the southeastern part of Virginia, near the coast. Millersville University
      is in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, which is more towards the central part
      of the state but definitely west of the easternmost parts of Virginia.


      4. **Determine east-west relationship**: Since Virginia is to the southeast
      of Pennsylvania, parts of Virginia (especially the eastern parts) can indeed
      be east of parts of Pennsylvania.


      5. **Conclusion based on geography**: Given that Hampton University is in the
      eastern part of Virginia and Millersville University of Pennsylvania is in the
      central part of Pennsylvania, Hampton University would be east of Millersville

    2c0bbfcc-d8f1-4ca5-8219-850402772d50: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Both the University of Michigan School of Public
      Health and the University of Michigan College of Pharmacy are located in Michigan.
      Specifically, they are both part of the University of Michigan, which has its
      main campus in Ann Arbor, Michigan.


      2. **Understand the geography**: Ann Arbor is a city in the state of Michigan.
      Knowing that both institutions are in Ann Arbor simplifies our analysis because
      we''re comparing locations within the same city rather than across different
      cities or states.


      3. **Campus layout**: The University of Michigan''s main campus in Ann Arbor
      is relatively compact, with various schools and colleges located in close proximity
      to each other. However, without specific details on the exact buildings or addresses
      of the School of Public Health and the College of Pharmacy, we must consider
      the general layout and how different schools are distributed across the campus.


      4. **Relative positions**: To determine if the School of Public Health is east
      of the College of Pharmacy, we would ideally need their exact locations or a
      map of the campus. However, given that both are part of the University of Michigan
      and likely located on or near the main campus in Ann Arbor, the difference in
      their locations would be a matter of blocks or buildings rather than significant
      geographical distances.


      5. **Conclusion based on available information**: Without specific addresses,
      building names, or a detailed campus map, it''s challenging to definitively
      say which is east of the other. However, given that the question seems to imply
      a comparison that should be answerable with a simple yes or no, let''s consider
      a general approach: If both institutions are in the same city and part of the
      same university, their locations are likely close, but the question of which

      it means the first location is positioned to the east (or more towards the east)
      relative to the second location on a map.


      3. **Same Campus**: Since both schools are part of the University of Michigan
      and located in Ann Arbor, they are essentially on the same campus or at least
      very close to each other within the city.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Without specific building locations or addresses,
      we can''t definitively say which is east of the other based solely on their

      \ the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and without specific details on their\
      \ exact locations relative to each other (e.g., building names, street addresses),\
      \ we cannot definitively say which one is east of the other without more detailed\

      \ of Michigan campus or contacting the university directly for the most current\
      \ and precise information.\n\nHowever, since the question demands a YES or NO\
      \ answer and considering the steps outlined, the implication is that one should\
      \ be able to determine the relative location based on general knowledge or typical\
      \ campus layouts. Without specific information to the contrary or a detailed\
      \ campus map, one might infer that determining the exact relative east-west\
      \ positioning could be challenging without more data.\n\nGiven these constraints\
      \ and the need for a direct answer, the response would have to be based on the\
      \ assumption that one has access to or knowledge of the specific layout of the\
      \ University of Michigan campus in Ann Arbor, which is not provided in the question.\n\
      \nTherefore, based on the process of reasoning and the information typically\
      \ available, the answer would depend on specific knowledge of the campus layout\

    f741f252-67c8-4dc1-ad2b-4cc1469f7e79: 'To answer this, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Sophie
      Davis School of Biomedical Education and The Rockefeller University. Sophie
      Davis School of Biomedical Education is located in New York City, specifically
      at the City College of New York (CCNY) in Harlem, Manhattan. The Rockefeller
      University is also located in New York City, in the Upper East Side of Manhattan.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we determine their geographic positions
      relative to each other. Harlem, where Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education
      is situated, is generally located in the northern part of Manhattan. The Rockefeller
      University, being in the Upper East Side, is also in Manhattan but more towards
      the central part of the island, though it''s on the eastern side.


      3. **Compare Positions**: To determine if Sophie Davis is east of The Rockefeller
      University, we need to understand the layout of Manhattan. Manhattan is laid
      out in a grid pattern, with avenues running north-south and streets running
      east-west. The Upper East Side, where The Rockefeller University is located,
      is east of Central Park and west of the East River. Harlem, where Sophie Davis
      School of Biomedical Education is, is north of Central Park but still west of
      the East River.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that both institutions are west of the East River and
      considering their positions within Manhattan, Sophie Davis School of Biomedical
      Education (in Harlem) is not east of The Rockefeller University (in the Upper
      East Side). Instead, Sophie Davis is more to the north and slightly west in
      terms of Manhattan''s grid layout.


      Based on this analysis, the answer is: **NO**'

      \ and Genocide Studies, NH is: **NO**."
    2ec46d7f-f9c2-4941-99e5-6e1fee9aee9f: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of Eastern Connecticut State University (CT) and the Cohen Center
      for Holocaust and Genocide Studies (NH) and compare their geographical positions.


      1. **Location of Eastern Connecticut State University**: This university is
      located in Willimantic, Connecticut. Connecticut is a state in the northeastern
      United States.


      2. **Location of Cohen Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies**: This center
      is located at Keene State College in Keene, New Hampshire. New Hampshire is
      also a state in the northeastern United States, located north of Massachusetts
      and directly north of Connecticut.


      Given these locations:

      - Eastern Connecticut State University is in Connecticut.

      - Cohen Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies is in New Hampshire.


      Considering geography, Connecticut (where Eastern Connecticut State University
      is located) is generally east of New York but south of New Hampshire. New Hampshire
      is located to the north of Connecticut, not to the west or east in a way that
      would place it in a position to be east of a location in eastern Connecticut.


      Therefore, since New Hampshire (where the Cohen Center is located) is north
      of Connecticut (where Eastern Connecticut State University is located), and
      considering the general east-west alignment of these states, Eastern Connecticut
      State University would indeed be east of a point directly south of it in New
      Hampshire, but in terms of direct east-west comparison, Eastern Connecticut
      State University is actually east of parts of New Hampshire when considering
      the states'' overall positions. However, the specific comparison here involves
      the relative east-west positioning of two points, not their north-south relationship.


      Given the specific question about being "east of" and considering the geographical
      layout of the northeastern United States, the correct interpretation hinges
      on understanding "east of" in a strict sense. Eastern Connecticut State University
      is indeed further east than parts of New Hampshire, but the question seems to
      be asking about the relative positioning of these two specific locations.


      So, considering the intended meaning of the question and the geographical layout:

      - Eastern Connecticut State University in Connecticut is generally east of many
      locations in New Hampshire but considering the direct line and geographic specifics,
      it''s essential to focus on the "east of" aspect in a strict geographical sense.


      Thus, to directly answer the question based on geographical positioning and
      considering the strict interpretation of "east of":

      The answer is YES.'

      The term "Eastern" in both names refers to the geographic location relative
      to Michigan, indicating they are both situated in the eastern part of the state.


      2. **Same University**: The "College of Health and Human Services" is a part
      of Eastern Michigan University. This means it''s not a separate entity located
      elsewhere but rather a constituent college within the university.


      3. **Location Implication**: Given that the College of Health and Human Services
      is a part of Eastern Michigan University, it is likely located on or very near
      the main campus of Eastern Michigan University, rather than being a separate
      entity located elsewhere.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since the College of Health and Human Services is part of
      Eastern Michigan University and not a separate entity that could be located
      in a different part of the state, it is not located "east" of Eastern Michigan
      University in the sense of being in a different geographic location. Instead,
      it is part of the university itself.

      5. **East-West Orientation in NJ**: New Jersey is oriented in such a way that
      the eastern part of the state borders the Atlantic Ocean, while the western
      part borders Pennsylvania. To determine if one location is east of another,
      we need to consider their relative positions along this east-west axis.


      6. **Specific Locations**: Wayne, where William Paterson University is located,
      is in Passaic County, which is in the northern part of New Jersey but more towards
      the eastern side of the state when considering the overall geography of New
      Jersey. Lakewood, where Georgian Court University is located, is in Ocean County,

      College is also located in Lincoln, Illinois.


      2. **Compare Locations**: Since both institutions are in the same city, the
      question of one being east of the other depends on their specific addresses
      or the parts of Lincoln, IL, they are in.


      3. **Determine Direction**: Without exact addresse consids, weer that if two
      places are in the same city, being "east" of each other would typically mean
      one is on the eastern part of the city and the other on the western part.


      4. **Research or Assumption**: Without specific geographic data or addresses
      provided in the question, one might need to research or make an assumption based
      on the names or kHowevnown locations. er, given both are named after the city
      and are in the same city, it suggests they could be relatively close to each
      other.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given t nature of the queshe information available and thetion,
      it seems the question might be trying to trick or test knowledge of specific
      locations within Lincoln, IL. However, since both institutions are in Lincoln,

      the city, the question simplifies to whether one can be considered east of the
      other based on their locations within the city limits.


      Given the above steps and without further information on their exact locations
      within Lincoln, IL, it''s reasonable to conclude that determining if one is
      east of the other requires more specific geographic information than provided.
      However, since the question demands a YES or NO answer and considering the institutions

      and Lincoln College within Lincoln, IL, it''s challenging to definitively state
      the directional relationship between the two. However, considering typical city

      \ that \"east\" refers to a direction on the compass. If one institution is\
      \ directly east of the other, it means that the first institution is positioned\
      \ to the east of the second on a map.\n\n4. **Research Institution Locations**:\

      \ Ave, Columbus, GA 31907.\n    - Columbus Technical College is located at 928\
      \ Manchester Expy, Columbus, GA 31904.\n\n5. **Geographic Comparison**: To determine\
      \ if Columbus State University is east of Columbus Technical College, we compare\
      \ their locations. University Avenue, where Columbus State University is located,\

      \ (east-west) cannot be directly compared. However, the intention here is to\
      \ outline the thought process required to approach this question.\n\n**Note**:\
      \ For an accurate answer, one would typically use a mapping service like Google\
      \ Maps to compare the exact locations of both institutions.\n\n**Assuming access\
      \ to such information for the purpose of this exercise**, if Columbus State\
      \ University is indeed positioned to the east of Columbus Technical College\
      \ based on their addresses, the answer would reflect that. Otherwise, it would\
      \ not.\n\n**Based on typical mapping analysis**, Columbus State University (4225\
      \ University Ave, Columbus, GA 31907) is generally west of Columbus Technical\
      \ College (928 Manchester Expy, Columbus, GA 31904), considering the layout\
      \ of Columbus, GA. Therefore, the answer to whether Columbus State University\
      \ is located east of Columbus Technical College would be **NO**."

      \ the geographical locations of Columbus State University (CSU) and Columbus\
      \ Technical College (CTC) in Georgia.\n\n1. **Identify Locations**: First, we\

      \ Georgia. Columbus State University is located in Columbus, Georgia. Columbus\
      \ Technical College, now known as Columbus Technical College but previously\
      \ known as Columbus Tech, is also based in Columbus, Georgia.\n\n2. **Relative\
      \ Positions**: Next, we need to determine their relative positions to each other,\
      \ specifically whether CSU is east of CTC. This requires knowing the specific\
      \ addresses or areas of Columbus where these institutions are situated.\n\n\

      \ in Columbus, GA**: In Columbus, GA, the city's layout and the orientation\
      \ of its main roads can help in understanding the east-west positioning. Generally,\
      \ the Chattahoochee River runs along the western edge of the city, with downtown\
      \ Columbus located near the river. Areas to the east of downtown would be considered\
      \ east, and areas to the west would be towards the river and Alabama.\n\n6.\
      \ **Specific Comparison**: Without exact geographical coordinates or a detailed\

      Newton College of the Sacred Heart is east of Massachusetts School of Professional
      Psychology.


      **Step 1: Identify Locations**


      - **Newton College of the Sacred Heart, MA**: This institution was located in
      Newton, Massachusetts. However, it''s essential to note that Newton College
      of the Sacred Heart is now closed. It merged with Boston College in 1975.

      College after a name change.


      **Step 2: Determine Relative Positions**


      Both institutions are located in Newton, Massachusetts. Given that they are

      in Newton, Massachusetts, without specific addresses or a detailed map showing
      their exact locations relative to each other, it might seem like a difficult
      call. However, since both are in the same city and there''s no clear indication
      that one is significantly east of the other based on publicly available information,
      the most straightforward answer, considering typical interpretations of such
      questions, would lean towards a simple geographical comparison which is not
      fully possible without exact locations.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      institutions. Newton College of the Sacred Heart is in Newton, Massachusetts.
      The Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology is also located in Massachusetts.


      2. **Specific Locations**: Newton College of the Sacred Heart was located in
      Newton, Massachusetts. For Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology,
      it''s essential to know its exact location. After research, it appears that
      the Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology (MSPP) is located in Newton,
      Massachusetts, as well.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Since both institutions are in Newton, Massachusetts,
      their locations are essentially the same in terms of the city. Therefore, one
      is not east of the other in the context of being in different cities or significantly
      different locations within Massachusetts.


      Given these steps, the answer to whether Newton College of the Sacred Heart,
      MA is located east of Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology, MA is
      **NO**, because they are in the same city, and without more specific address

    ee98bcc3-895a-4e34-9d25-534400d9b483: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of both Newton College of the Sacred Heart and the Massachusetts
      School of Professional Psychology.


      1. **Newton College of the Sacred Heart, MA**: Newton College of the Sacred
      Heart was a women''s college located in Newton, Massachusetts. It has since
      merged with Boston College.


      2. **Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology, MA**: The Massachusetts
      School of Professional Psychology (MSPP) is located in Newton, Massachusetts,
      as well.


      Given that both institutions are located in Newton, Massachusetts, they are
      essentially in the same location in terms of being in the same city. Therefore,
      one is not definitively east of the other based on the city level, as they share
      the same city.


      However, without specific addresses or considering potential street-level differences,
      we must conclude based on the information given:


      Since both institutions are in Newton, MA, and there''s no specific information
      provided about their exact locations relative to each other within Newton, the
      question about one being east of the other cannot be definitively answered without
      more precise location data. But considering the nature of the question and the
      fact that both are in the same city, the implication is that they are not sufficiently
      distant to be considered east-west of each other in a broader geographical context.


      So, the answer, based on the information provided and the fact that both are
      in Newton, MA, would be **NO**, they are not sufficiently distant to be considered
      one as east of the other in a way that would apply to separate cities or distinct
      geographical areas.'
    f556ddd9-71ab-48e1-99fa-37b52e23759d: 'To answer this question, we need to determine

      1. **Newton College of the Sacred Heart**: This institution was located in Newton,
      Massachusetts. It''s essential to note that Newton College of the Sacred Heart
      is now closed, but its historical location is what matters for this question.


      2. **Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology (MSPP)**: MSPP is located
      in Newton, Massachusetts, as well.


      Given that both institutions are in Newton, Massachusetts, we need to understand
      that "east of" refers to geographical positioning. Since they are in the same
      city, the question essentially asks if one point within Newton is east of another
      point within Newton.


      Without exact addresses or considering the closure of Newton College of the
      Sacred Heart, the question simplifies to whether one location in Newton can
      be east of another location in Newton. Geographically, within any given area,
      including a city like Newton, there can be locations that are east of others
      based on their specific addresses or positions.


      However, since both colleges are in Newton and assuming the question aims to
      understand if one is generally east of the other within the city limits, we''d
      need precise locations to give a definitive answer. But given the information,
      we can infer that if Newton College of the Sacred Heart and MSPP have different
      addresses within Newton, it''s possible for one to be east of the other, depending
      on those exact locations.


      But considering the specific context of the question and the fact that both
      are in Newton, without further detailed location information (like exact street
      addresses), the question might seem to lean towards a simplification or a misunderstanding
      since both are essentially in the same city. Yet, the direct answer based on
      the possibility within a city for locations to be east of one another would
      still consider the affirmative possibility based on their potential positioning

      is located east of Texas Tech University at Highland Lakes, TX, we need to consider
      the geographical locations of both institutions.


      1. **Identify the location of South Texas College, TX**: South Texas College
      is located in the Rio Grande Valley, which is in the southern part of Texas,
      close to the U.S.-Mexico border. This region is generally considered to be in
      the southernmost part of Texas.


      2. **Identify the location of Texas Tech University at Highland Lakes, TX**:
      Texas Tech University has a main campus in Lubbock, TX, but it also has other
      locations and programs. The specific location of "Texas Tech University at Highland
      Lakes, TX" suggests a location near the Highland Lakes region of Texas. The
      Highland Lakes are a chain of lakes in central Texas, which would place Texas
      Tech University at Highland Lakes in the central part of the state.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Given that South Texas College is in the southern
      part of Texas and Texas Tech University at Highland Lakes is in the central
      part, we need to determine the east-west orientation of these locations. Central
      Texas, where the Highland Lakes are, is generally east of the southern tip of
      Texas where South Texas College is located.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations, South Texas College,
      being in the southernmost part of Texas, is likely west or southwest of the
      central part of Texas where Texas Tech University at Highland Lakes is located.
      Therefore, South Texas College, TX is not located east of Texas Tech University
      at Highland Lakes, TX.

      AZ is located east of Northcentral University, AZ, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      universities. Wilkes University has a location in Mesa, Arizona. Northcentral
      University is also based in Arizona, but we need to confirm its exact location.
      Northcentral University is headquartered in San Diego, California, but it has
      an online presence and was previously based in Arizona. However, for the purpose
      of this question, we''ll consider its Arizona presence.


      2. **Geographical Positions**: Mesa, Arizona is a city located in the eastern
      part of the Phoenix metropolitan area. Without specific details on Northcentral
      University''s physical location in Arizona (since it''s primarily an online
      university and its main campus is in California), we can''t directly compare
      the two locations without assuming Northcentral''s Arizona location is in or
      around the Phoenix area, similar to many other universities.


      3. **Comparative Analysis**: Given the lack of specific information on Northcentral
      University''s physical campus in Arizona, we must rely on general geographical
      knowledge. Mesa, where Wilkes University is located, is in the eastern part
      of the Phoenix metropolitan area. If Northcentral University has a presence
      in the Phoenix area, it''s likely in or around Phoenix, which could be to the
      west or northwest of Mesa, depending on the exact location.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the assumption that Northcentral University''s Arizona
      operations are likely centered around the Phoenix area, and considering Mesa''s
      position to the east of Phoenix, Wilkes University in Mesa, AZ would indeed
      be located east of a hypothetical or general Phoenix-area location for Northcentral

      1. **Identify the locations**: Wilkes University has a location in Mesa, Arizona.
      Northcentral University is also based in Arizona, specifically in San Diego...
      no, that''s incorrect. Northcentral University is actually based in San Diego,
      California, but it has an online presence and can be accessed from anywhere,
      including Arizona. However, for physical locations, Northcentral University
      is primarily known to be in California, but considering the context of the question,
      we''re focusing on Arizona. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the
      premise since Northcentral University is not primarily based in Arizona but
      in California. However, for the sake of this question, let''s proceed under
      the assumption we''re discussing their presence or potential locations within
      Arizona.


      2. **Determine the geographical positions in Arizona**: Mesa, Arizona, where
      Wilkes University is located, is in the eastern part of the Phoenix metropolitan
      area. Without a specific location for Northcentral University in Arizona (since
      it''s primarily a California-based institution with online programs), we can''t
      directly compare their east-west positions within the state based on the information
      given.


      3. **Consider the context and available data**: Given the confusion and the
      fact that Northcentral University is not physically based in Arizona (it''s
      in California), the question seems to be based on incomplete or inaccurate premises.
      However, if we were to imagine a scenario where Northcentral University had
      a physical presence in Arizona (which it does not, as it''s known to be in California),
      we would need their specific location to make a comparison.

      Given that Wilkes University is in Mesa, AZ, and assuming we''re discussing
      hypothetical or potential locations for Northcentral University in AZ (despite
      it being primarily in CA), without exact coordinates or locations for Northcentral
      in AZ, the question''s premise is flawed. Yet, for the sake of compliance and
      assuming a scenario where Northcentral might have some form of presence in AZ

      the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Gonzaga University is located in Spokane, Washington.
      Washington State University also has a campus in Spokane, Washington, known
      as Washington State University Spokane.


      2. **Understand the geography**: Since both institutions are in Spokane, we
      need to consider their exact locations within the city to determine if one is
      east of the other.


      3. **Gonzaga University''s location**: Gonzaga University is situated in the
      Logan neighborhood of Spokane, which is relatively central but can be considered
      more towards the west or northwest part of the city, given Spokane''s layout.


      4. **Washington State University Spokane''s location**: WSU Spokane is located
      in the University District of Spokane, which is also relatively central but
      positioned in a way that could be considered east or northeast of Gonzaga University,
      depending on the exact reference points used.


      5. **Comparison**: Given that both universities are in the city of Spokane and
      considering their general areas, we must determine if Gonzaga University is
      located east of Washington State University Spokane.


      Considering these steps and the general layout of Spokane, Gonzaga University
      is not east of Washington State University Spokane; instead, it''s more accurate
      to say that Gonzaga is west or more centrally located in a manner that is west
      of WSU Spokane, depending on the precise locations and boundaries considered.

      down into the necessary steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to understand that both the Purdue
      University College of Agriculture and the Purdue University College of Health
      and Human Sciences are part of Purdue University.


      2. **Purdue University Location**: Purdue University is located in West Lafayette,
      Indiana. This means both colleges are in the same city.


      3. **Campus Layout**: Typically, different colleges within a university are
      located on the same campus or in very close proximity to each other. Purdue
      University has a large campus in West Lafayette, Indiana, where various colleges,
      including the College of Agriculture and the College of Health and Human Sciences,
      are situated.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Without specific information on the exact buildings
      or locations of these colleges on the Purdue University campus, it''s challenging
      to definitively state their relative positions (east-west, north-south) to each
      other. However, given that they are part of the same university and likely on
      the same campus, the difference in their locations would be relatively minor,
      possibly even within walking distance of each other.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Since both colleges are part
      of Purdue University and located in West Lafayette, Indiana, and without detailed
      campus maps or specific building locations provided, it''s reasonable to infer
      that their locations are not significantly distant in terms of cardinal directions
      (north, south, east, west) relative to each other.


      However, to answer the question directly based on the typical layout of university
      campuses and the fact that detailed location information is not provided:


      Given that both colleges are likely located on the Purdue University campus
      in West Lafayette, Indiana, and in the absence of specific information about
      their relative positions, the question seems to imply a level of specificity
      that is not generally applicable to buildings within the same campus area.


      But since I must give a YES or NO answer, and considering that Purdue University''s
      colleges could be situated in various configurations on the campus, the most
      straightforward response, acknowledging the lack of detailed spatial information,
      would lean towards a general understanding of campus layouts, where specific
      colleges might not have significantly distant locations in cardinal terms but
      are part of the same overall campus area.


      Therefore, without specific details on their exact locations relative to each
      other and considering they are likely on the same campus, the answer would have
      to be based on the assumption that their locations are not significantly distant

      being part of the same university.

      are located on the same campus or in very close proximity to each other, unless
      specified otherwise.


      3. **Purdue University''s Campus**: Purdue University is located in West Lafayette,
      Indiana. The main campus, where most colleges are situated, is not divided in
      a way that would place one college significantly east or west of another in
      a manner that would be notable or relevant for this question.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Without specific building or department locations,
      it''s generally not possible to say one college is east of another within the
      same university, especially considering that buildings for different colleges
      can be interspersed across the campus.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the information and typical university campus layouts,
      it''s reasonable to conclude that the question is based on an assumption that
      might not apply to how colleges are distributed within a university. However,
      without explicit information on the exact locations of these colleges within
      Purdue University, one might assume they are in close proximity or the same
      area, given they are part of the same institution.


      Based on the logic that both are part of Purdue University and likely located
      on the same campus without specific evidence to the contrary, and without detailed
      campus maps showing the exact location of each college, the question seems to
      imply a distinction that may not be meaningful or relevant in this context.
      However, considering the nature of the question and the potential for specific
      buildings to be located in different areas of the campus, the answer could technically
      be yes if the specific buildings for the College of Agriculture are indeed located
      east of the buildings for the College of Health and Human Sciences, but this
      would be a very specific and detailed level of information not typically relevant
      for general inquiries.


      Therefore, without specific information indicating the relative positions of
      these colleges on the Purdue University campus, and considering the question
      seems to imply a need for such specificity, the answer would have to be based

      the College of Agriculture and the College of Health and Human Sciences are
      part of Purdue University. This implies they are likely on the same campus or
      at least in the same general area, as many colleges within a university are.


      2. **Location Within the Campus**: Since both are colleges within the same university,
      unless specified otherwise, it''s reasonable to assume they could be relatively
      close to each other on the campus. However, the exact location (east, west,
      etc.) would depend on the specific layout of the Purdue University campus.


      3. **Purdue University''s Main Campus Location**: Purdue University''s main
      campus is located in West Lafayette, Indiana. Without specific details on the
      layout of the campus, we cannot directly infer the relative positions of the

      \ down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to understand\
      \ that both Purdue University College of Agriculture and Purdue University College\
      \ of Health and Human Sciences are part of Purdue University, which is located\
      \ in West Lafayette, Indiana.\n\n2. **Campus Layout**: Purdue University is\
      \ a large campus with various colleges and departments. However, the specific\
      \ locations of the College of Agriculture and the College of Health and Human\
      \ Sciences within the campus are not detailed in the question. \n\n3. **Assumption\
      \ Based on Typical University Setup**: In many universities, colleges are not\
      \ necessarily located in separate geographic areas but rather are distributed\
      \ across the campus. The exact placement can depend on the history of the university,\
      \ the availability of land, and the functional needs of each college.\n\n4.\
      \ **Interpreting \"East Of\"**: The question asks if the College of Agriculture\
      \ is located east of the College of Health and Human Sciences. This implies\
      \ a need for specific geographic knowledge of the Purdue University campus layout.\n\
      \n5. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Without specific information\
      \ on the relative locations of these two colleges within the Purdue University\
      \ campus, one might assume that since they are both part of the same university,\
      \ they could be relatively close to each other. However, the exact directional\
      \ relationship (east-west) cannot be determined without a campus map or more\
      \ detailed information.\n\nGiven the information typically available and the\
      \ fact that both colleges are situated within the same university campus, it's\
      \ reasonable to assume that their locations are likely proximal but the exact\
      \ directional relationship (east or west) would depend on the specific layout\
      \ of the Purdue University campus.\n\nHowever, the question format demands a\
      \ YES or NO answer without the possibility of saying \"cannot be determined\"\
      \ or requesting more information. Given this constraint and considering that\
      \ both colleges are part of Purdue University located in West Lafayette, Indiana,\
      \ and without specific details on their relative positions, the most straightforward\
      \ approach would be to consider the general geography of the campus.\n\nSince\
      \ the question cannot be answered with absolute certainty without more specific\
      \ information about the campus layout, and given the format requires a definitive\
      \ YES or NO, the logical step would be to acknowledge that typically, colleges\
      \ within the same university are not vastly separated but rather are part of\
      \ the same broader campus area. \n\nBut, to adhere strictly to the format and\
      \ recognize the limitations in the provided information, and considering that\
      \ a precise answer would require detailed campus maps which are not provided,\
      \ the answer based on the process of elimination and the nature of the question\
      \ would have to be a guess. Given that, a logical guess, acknowledging the lack\
      \ of specific information, would lean towards a \"NO\" due to the assumption\
      \ that if the colleges were significantly separated in such a manner (one being\
      \ distinctly east of the other), there would be some reference to such in the\
      \ question or in general knowledge about the university's layout. However, this\
      \ is a weak reasoning due to the lack of direct information.\n\nTherefore, the\
      \ answer, with the understanding that it's based on incomplete information and\
      \ the nature of university campuses, would be: NO."

    005141be-4bef-422c-9dba-0440e732f479: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to understand the locations of two places
      - International Residential College (IRC) in Virginia and the University of
      Virginia Center for Politics in Virginia.


      2. **Location of International Residential College (IRC), VA**: The International
      Residential College is located at the University of Virginia. It is specifically
      situated on the grounds of the University of Virginia, indicating that both
      institutions share a close geographical proximity.


      3. **Location of University of Virginia Center for Politics, VA**: The University
      of Virginia Center for Politics is also located at the University of Virginia
      in Charlottesville, Virginia. This suggests that both the IRC and the Center
      for Politics are within the same university campus or at least very close to
      each other.


      4. **Determine the relative location (east or west)**: Given that both are part
      of or closely associated with the University of Virginia, without specific addresses
      or a detailed map, it might seem challenging to determine their relative positions.
      However, since they are both part of the same university, they are likely to
      be relatively close to each other.


      5. **Conclusion based on typical university layout**: Universities often have
      various departments, colleges, and centers spread across their campuses. Without
      exact coordinates or a map, we can infer that if the International Residential
      College and the University of Virginia Center for Politics are both located
      within or near the University of Virginia campus, they are likely adjacent to
      each other or at least not significantly far apart in terms of cardinal directions
      (east, west, north, south) relative to the entire state or region.


      Given these considerations, the question seems to ask for a precise geographical
      comparison that might not significantly differ given their proximity within
      the same university setting. However, to provide a definitive YES or NO answer:


      - If the International Residential College is indeed on the eastern part of
      the University of Virginia campus and the Center for Politics is more to the
      west, then the answer would be YES.

      - If their locations are reversed or they are not significantly different in
      terms of east-west positioning, then the answer would be NO.


      Without exact locations, I must rely on general knowledge and the fact that
      they are both associated with the University of Virginia. Assuming the International
      Residential College could indeed be located east of the Center for Politics
      based on the campus layout (though this is speculative without a map), the most
      informed guess I can make is:

    4bc4c1fb-ee7f-4764-a273-e363b4079633: 'To determine if International Residential
      College, VA is located east of University of Virginia Center for Politics, VA,
      we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      International Residential College and the University of Virginia Center for
      Politics. International Residential College is a part of the University of Virginia,
      and it''s known to be located on the grounds of the university.


      2. **University of Virginia Campus Layout**: The University of Virginia is situated
      in Charlottesville, Virginia. Understanding the general layout of the university
      can help. However, without specific details on the exact locations of these
      entities within the university, we might need to rely on general knowledge or
      look up specific addresses.


      3. **Address Lookup**: Looking up the addresses, the University of Virginia''s
      main campus is generally located around Charlottesville, VA. The International
      Residential College is on the UVA campus, specifically at 2070 Irish Rd, Charlottesville,
      VA 22903. The Center for Politics is also on the UVA campus but does not have
      a distinct address separate from the university''s general address (400 McCormick
      Rd, Charlottesville, VA 22903) in many listings.


      4. **Geographical Orientation**: Charlottesville, VA, is situated in the western
      part of Virginia. The eastern part of Virginia refers to areas closer to the
      Atlantic coast. Without precise GPS coordinates or a detailed campus map showing
      the relative east-west positions of these two locations within the university,
      determining their exact orientation relative to each other (east-west) solely
      based on their addresses might be challenging.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Available Data**: Given that both the International
      Residential College and the University of Virginia Center for Politics are located
      within the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, and without specific information
      on their relative east-west positions within the campus, it''s reasonable to
      assume they are relatively close to each other. However, the question asks for
      a definitive YES or NO regarding their east-west orientation relative to each
      other.


      Given these steps and the lack of detailed geographical information within the
      university campus, the task becomes determining the relative positions based
      on available data. However, since both locations are on the UVA campus and relatively
      close, without exact coordinates or a detailed map, providing a definitive answer
      based on the east-west orientation within the campus requires more specific
      information than what''s readily available in this format.


      But, considering the nature of the question and the need for a YES or NO answer,
      and acknowledging that both entities are part of the University of Virginia
      and thus in very close proximity, one might infer that determining their relative
      east-west position could be subject to the specific layout of the university

    c0928df2-d2ac-4ab5-98b4-5602c714b703: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the International Residential College (IRC) and the University of Virginia Center
      for Politics. The International Residential College is located on the campus
      of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia. The University of
      Virginia Center for Politics is also in Charlottesville, Virginia.


      2. **Understand Geographic Directions**: To determine if one location is east
      of another, we need to understand the basic geographic directions. East refers
      to the direction towards the sunrise, which is generally to the right if you
      are facing north.


      3. **Specific Locations within Charlottesville**: Without exact addresses, we
      can consider the general layout of the University of Virginia campus. The University
      of Virginia is situated in Charlottesville, with various buildings and centers
      spread across the campus and surrounding areas.


      4. **Determine Relative Positions**: The International Residential College is
      a part of the University of Virginia, and it is located on the grounds of the
      university. The University of Virginia Center for Politics is also affiliated
      with the university but is specifically focused on political research and education.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Given that both institutions
      are part of the University of Virginia and located in Charlottesville, without
      specific addresses or a detailed map, it''s challenging to definitively say
      one is east of the other without more precise location information. However,
      considering the context of the question and the fact that both are within the
      same general area (the University of Virginia campus), we can make an educated
      guess based on typical campus layouts and the fact that the question implies
      a comparison within a relatively small geographic area.


      Given the information and the steps outlined, the answer to whether the International
      Residential College, VA is located east of the University of Virginia Center
      for Politics, VA, without specific location details, leans towards a need for
      more precise information. However, considering typical layouts and assuming
      both are on or very near the main campus, the difference in location might be
      relatively minor. But, to give a definitive YES or NO answer as requested:


      YES'
    e113681c-0c3c-491e-8aaa-00f70626f66c: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of both the International Residential College (IRC) and the University
      of Virginia Center for Politics (UVA Center for Politics) and then compare their
      positions relative to each other.


      1. **Identify the Location of International Residential College (IRC), VA**:
      The International Residential College is a residential college at the University
      of Virginia. Given its association with the University of Virginia, it is reasonable
      to assume that it is located on or near the University of Virginia''s campus
      in Charlottesville, Virginia.


      2. **Identify the Location of University of Virginia Center for Politics, VA**:
      The University of Virginia Center for Politics is also located in Charlottesville,
      Virginia, on the grounds of the University of Virginia. It is dedicated to promoting
      the value of politics and civic engagement.


      3. **Determine the Relative Locations**: Both institutions are associated with
      the University of Virginia and are located in Charlottesville, VA. Without specific
      addresses, we can infer that they are likely in close proximity to each other,
      given their affiliation with the University of Virginia.


      4. **Consider "East" as a Direction**: To say one location is east of another
      means it is positioned to the east on a map relative to the other location.
      Without exact addresses or a detailed map, determining the precise directional
      relationship between two points on the University of Virginia campus or in Charlottesville
      requires specific knowledge of the campus layout or the city''s geography.


      However, since both the International Residential College and the University
      of Virginia Center for Politics are part of the University of Virginia and presumably
      located within or near the university campus in Charlottesville, VA, the question
      of whether one is east of the other depends on their exact locations within
      the campus or the city.


      Given the lack of specific address information or a detailed description of
      their relative positions within Charlottesville or the UVA campus, and without
      a map or further details, it''s challenging to provide a definitive answer based
      solely on the information provided.


      But, considering typical scenarios and the fact that both are UVA entities,
      if we had to make an educated guess based on the assumption that both are on
      the UVA campus and without knowing their exact positions relative to each other,
      we might lean towards a simpler answer due to the nature of the question.

      1. **Identify the locations** of both colleges.

      2. **Compare their geographical positions** in relation to each other, specifically
      focusing on their east-west orientation.


      **Step 1: Identify the locations**


      - **Minnesota State Community and Technical College (MN)** has multiple campuses,
      but the main ones are in Detroit Lakes, Fergus Falls, Moorhead, and Wadena.
      For simplicity, let''s focus on the Moorhead campus, as it''s one of the primary
      locations.

      - **Northland Community & Technical College (MN)** has campuses in East Grand
      Forks, Thief River Falls, and online. The main campus relevant for this comparison
      would be in Thief River Falls.


      **Step 2: Compare their geographical positions**


      - Moorhead, where one of the main Minnesota State Community and Technical College
      campuses is located, is situated in the southwestern part of Minnesota, near
      the North Dakota border.

      - Thief River Falls, where Northland Community & Technical College is located,

      \ know it's in IL).\n\n2. **Understand the geography**:\n   - Wisconsin is a\
      \ state located in the northern United States, bordered by two of the Great\
      \ Lakes (Michigan and Superior).\n   - Illinois is a state located to the south\
      \ of Wisconsin.\n\n3. **Determine the relative positions**:\n   - Generally,\
      \ Wisconsin is north and slightly west of Illinois, considering the overall\
      \ geography of the two states.\n\n4. **Consider the specific locations**:\n\
      \   - Sheboygan, Wisconsin, is on the eastern side of Wisconsin, bordering Lake\
      \ Michigan.\n   - Without the exact location of The Ort Institute in Illinois,\
      \ we must consider the general east-west layout of the states and how locations\
      \ within them might relate.\n\n5. **Make an educated guess based on typical\
      \ state layouts and the fact that specific locations within states can vary**:\n\
      \   - Given that Sheboygan is a city in eastern Wisconsin and considering Illinois'\
      \ position south of Wisconsin, if The Ort Institute is in the northern part\
      \ of Illinois (near the Wisconsin border), it's possible for University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Sheboygan to be north or northwest of it, but without the exact location, we\
      \ can't be certain.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the question asks if University\
      \ of Wisconsin\u2013Sheboygan is located east of The Ort Institute, IL, and\
      \ considering that the eastern part of Wisconsin (where Sheboygan is located)\
      \ could indeed be east or northeast of parts of northern Illinois, the answer\
      \ depends heavily on the exact location of The Ort Institute within Illinois.\n\
      \nHowever, without the specific location of The Ort Institute in Illinois, we\
      \ must rely on general geographic principles. Given that Sheboygan, WI, is on\
      \ the eastern edge of Wisconsin and Illinois is to the south, if The Ort Institute\
      \ is sufficiently south within Illinois, University of Wisconsin\u2013Sheboygan\
      \ could indeed be northeast or even due east of it, considering the curvature\
      \ of the state borders and the lake shoreline.\n\nGiven the lack of specific\
      \ information about The Ort Institute's location within Illinois and assuming\
      \ it could be in the southern or central parts of the state (which would make\
      \ University of Wisconsin\u2013Sheboygan more likely to be east or northeast),\
      \ the most straightforward answer based on available information would lean\
      \ towards \"yes\" due to the general geographic layout, but with significant\
      \ uncertainty without more specific details about The Ort Institute's location.\n\

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Strayer
      University in Washington, D.C., and Corcoran College of Art and Design in Washington,
      D.C.


      2. **Strayer University, DC Location**: Strayer University has multiple campuses,
      but its main location in Washington, D.C., is typically considered to be in
      the northwest part of the city. However, to give a precise answer, we need to
      know the exact address. For the sake of this question, let''s assume it''s near
      the center or in a location that we can compare directly with Corcoran College
      of Art and Design.


      3. **Corcoran College of Art and Design, DC Location**: The Corcoran College
      of Art and Design is located near the George Washington University campus in
      the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C. This area is also in the northwest
      part of the city but closer to the Potomac River and Georgetown.


      4. **Comparison**: Given that both institutions are in the northwest part of
      Washington, D.C., but without exact addresses, we have to consider their relative
      positions. If Strayer University''s D.C. location is more towards the eastern
      part of the northwest quadrant compared to Corcoran College of Art and Design,
      it would be considered east. However, Corcoran is relatively close to the western
      edge of the city (near Georgetown), which suggests that many locations in the
      northwest quadrant could be east of it.


      5. **Conclusion**: Without exact addresses but knowing both are in the northwest
      part of D.C. and considering Corcoran''s location near the western part of the
      city, it''s reasonable to deduce that Strayer University could indeed be east
      of Corcoran College of Art and Design, depending on the specific location within

    9053bf0f-55e4-495a-bba6-5974f0a97434: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps needed to determine if Strayer University in DC is located east of
      Corcoran College of Art and Design in DC.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Strayer University and Corcoran College of Art and Design in Washington, D.C.


      2. **Strayer University Location**: Strayer University has multiple campuses,
      but focusing on the one in Washington, D.C., it''s essential to pinpoint its
      exact location. However, Strayer University is known for its online presence
      and has campuses in various locations, including Washington, D.C. For the sake
      of this question, let''s assume we are referring to a specific campus or location
      within D.C.


      3. **Corcoran College of Art and Design Location**: The Corcoran College of
      Art and Design was historically located in downtown Washington, D.C. However,
      it''s crucial to note that the Corcoran College of Art and Design merged with
      George Washington University in 2014, and its programs were integrated into
      GWU. The original Corcoran building is near the White House, but for the purpose
      of this question, we consider its general location in downtown D.C.


      4. **Compare Locations**: To determine if Strayer University is east of Corcoran
      College of Art and Design, we need to compare their locations relative to each
      other. Given that Corcoran is near the White House in downtown D.C., which is
      relatively west or central in the city, any location east of downtown would
      be considered east of Corcoran.


      5. **Conclusion**: Without the precise address of Strayer University''s D.C.
      campus, it''s challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, considering
      the general layout of Washington, D.C., and assuming Strayer University''s campus
      is not in the extreme west or southwest part of the city (which would be less
      likely given the city''s layout and the typical locations of educational institutions),
      there''s a possibility that it could be east of Corcoran, depending on its exact
      location.

      determination, I will provide a tentative answer based on the assumption that
      Strayer University''s D.C. location is indeed in a part of the city that could
      reasonably be considered east of the Corcoran College of Art and Design''s location

      \ and Design, now part of George Washington University, is located in the Foggy\
      \ Bottom area of Washington D.C. \n\n3. **Determine the relative east-west positions**:\
      \ Knowing that Washington D.C. is laid out in a grid pattern with clear quadrants\
      \ (NW, NE, SW, SE), we can use landmarks or the general geography of the city\
      \ to determine if one location is east of the other. The Corcoran College, being\
      \ in the Foggy Bottom area, is generally in the northwest part of the city.\
      \ \n\n4. **Compare locations**: Without the exact addresses or a precise map\
      \ in front of me, I'll rely on general knowledge of D.C.'s layout. The key is\
      \ understanding the relative positions of these institutions. If Strayer University's\
      \ D.C. location is also in a northwest area or further west, it would not be\
      \ east of Corcoran. Conversely, if it's in a northeast or southeast area, it\
      \ could potentially be east, depending on the specific locations.\n\nGiven these\
      \ steps, and acknowledging that specific addresses or current locations might\
      \ affect the outcome, I would typically look for the exact addresses to provide\
      \ a definitive answer. However, since I must provide a YES/NO answer based on\
      \ the information and reasoning provided:\n\nGiven that Corcoran College of\
      \ Art and Design is in the northwest (Foggy Bottom area), for Strayer University\
      \ to be east of it, it would need to be in an area that is indeed eastward,\
      \ considering D.C.'s grid layout. Without precise locations, and considering\
      \ the general nature of this question, it's a bit challenging to provide a definitive\
      \ YES/NO without assuming or looking up the current, exact locations of both\
      \ institutions.\n\nHowever, if we consider typical locations and the fact that\
      \ many universities and colleges in D.C. are somewhat clustered in the northwest\
      \ part of the city, the likelihood of one being significantly east of the other,\
      \ without more specific information, leans towards a simpler geographical comparison.\n\
      \n**ANSWER**: YES"

      \ the locations of Strayer University and Corcoran College of Art and Design,\
      \ both in Washington, D.C., and compare their positions relative to each other,\
      \ specifically in terms of east-west orientation.\n\n1. **Identify Locations**:\n\
      \   - **Strayer University, DC**: Strayer University has multiple locations,\
      \ but when referring to its presence in Washington, D.C., it's essential to\
      \ pinpoint the exact campus. However, without specific campus details, we can\
      \ consider that Strayer University, like many institutions, could have a central\
      \ or significant presence in the city. For the sake of this exercise, let's\
      \ consider its general location in D.C. without specifying a particular campus.\n\
      \   - **Corcoran College of Art and Design, DC**: The Corcoran College of Art\
      \ and Design is located near the White House and the National Mall in downtown\
      \ Washington, D.C. Specifically, its address is around 500 17th St NW, Washington,\
      \ DC 20006.\n\n2. **Understand Geographic Orientation**:\n   - In Washington,\
      \ D.C., the city's layout and the location of landmarks can help determine east-west\
      \ orientation. The National Mall, for instance, runs east-west, with the U.S.\
      \ Capitol Building at the east end and the Lincoln Memorial at the west end.\n\
      \n3. **Compare Locations**:\n   - Knowing that Corcoran College of Art and Design\
      \ is near the White House and the National Mall, we can approximate its location\
      \ as being relatively central in D.C. but leaning towards the west side of the\
      \ downtown area, given the White House's location.\n   - Without the exact address\
      \ of Strayer University's D.C. location, we cannot directly compare. However,\
      \ if we consider typical locations of universities and colleges within D.C.,\
      \ many are spread throughout the city, including areas that could be east of\
      \ the National Mall and downtown area.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the\
      \ lack of specific information about Strayer University's exact location in\
      \ D.C. and without precise coordinates or addresses for comparison, a definitive\
      \ answer based solely on the information provided is challenging. However, since\
      \ the question requires a YES or NO answer and considering that Strayer University\
      \ could potentially have locations east of the Corcoran College of Art and Design,\
      \ depending on the specific campus, we must make an educated guess based on\
      \ typical university distributions in D.C.\n\nBased on the steps and considering\
      \ the need for a definitive answer despite the ambiguity, I would answer: **YES**\
      \ \n\nThis answer assumes that there could be a Strayer University location\
      \ east of the Corcoran College of Art and Design, given the spread of educational\
      \ institutions across Washington, D.C. However, without exact locations, this\
      \ is an educated guess rather than a certainty."

      1. **Location of Strayer University, DC**: Strayer University has multiple locations,
      but when referring to its presence in Washington, D.C., it''s essential to identify

      Corcoran College of Art and Design has undergone significant changes, including
      its integration into George Washington University. For this question, we''ll
      consider its traditional location as a reference point.


      3. **Determining East-West Orientationy one location is east **: To saof another,

      D.C. locknowledge. Strayer ral erUnivsity has had a presence in the Washingtorea,
      inclun, D.C., ading locations that could potentially be east or west of ''s
      traditthe Corcoranional location, depending on the specific Strayer campus.


      However, considering the Corcoran''s location near the White House (17th Street
      NW), which is relatively central but more to the west side of the District,
      a Strayer University location would need to be east of this point to answer
      the question affirmatively.


      Given these consideratioss for Strans and without a specific addreyer University
      in D.C. to compare directly, the question requires more precise location data
      for a definitive answer. However, for the sake of provide baseing a responsd
      on the steps of reasoning:


      - If Strayer University''s D.C. location is indeed east of the Corcoran College
      of Art and Design''s traditional location (500 17th Street NW), the answer would
      be YES.

      - Without the exact location, but knowing that both institutions are in Washington,
      D.C., and considering the city''s layout, it''s possible for Strayer to have
      a location that fits this criterion.


      Given the information typically available and the nature of the question, a

    3d420dea-7685-4657-a075-691e7f30fc51: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Ralston
      College and South University in Georgia. Ralston College is located in Savannah,
      Georgia, but I need to verify if it''s actually based there or if it has a different
      main location. South University, on the other hand, has multiple locations,
      but one of its main campuses is also in Savannah, Georgia.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Since both institutions are mentioned
      to be in Georgia, we need to determine their specific geographic positions relative
      to each other. If both are indeed in Savannah, the question then becomes about
      their relative positions within the city or their exact addresses.


      3. **Compare Positions**: If Ralston College and South University are both in
      Savannah or nearby, determining which one is east of the other would typically
      require knowing their exact addresses or locations within the city. However,
      without specific addresses provided in the question, we would generally rely
      on geographical knowledge or mapping data.


      4. **Consideration of Ralston College''s Existence and Location**: Upon further
      review, it seems there might be some confusion regarding "Ralston College" in
      Georgia. Ralston College is actually a new liberal arts college that has been
      announced but might not yet be operational or have a widely recognized location.
      This could affect the accuracy of comparing its location directly to South University
      without more specific information.


      Given these considerations and without precise locations or addresses for both
      institutions, providing an accurate YES or NO answer based solely on the information
      given in the question is challenging. However, for the purpose of this exercise,
      I will attempt to provide a response based on typical geographical analysis:


      If we assume both institutions are in or around Savannah, Georgia, and without
      the exact addresses, a definitive answer cannot be accurately provided. But,
      considering the necessity of a YES or NO response and the potential for Ralston
      College to be in a similar geographic area as South University, Savannah, a
      tentative answer might lean towards uncertainty, which isn''t an option here.

      precise information:

      Georgia is located in Savannah and possibly other locations like Atlanta (through
      South University, Online, or other campuses). For this comparison, if we consider
      the Savannah location, it''s directly comparable to Ralston College''s location.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Given that both institutions have a presence in Savannah,
      Georgia, or if South University''s relevant location for this question is also
      in a similar eastern part of Georgia, we can proceed to compare their specific
      locations within the state.


      4. **Determine East/West Positioning**: Since Savannah is on the eastern side
      of Georgia, any institution located there is, by default, on the eastern side
      of the state. If both colleges are in Savannah or both are in the eastern part
      of Georgia, they would be relatively close in terms of east-west positioning,
      with no significant difference in their east-west locations.


      Given the steps above, if Ralston College and South University are both located
      in Savannah, Georgia, or both are generally in the eastern part of the state,
      then Ralston College would not be significantly east of South University, as
      they would be in the same general area. However, without precise addresses and
      considering the question''s phrasing, if we strictly interpret "east of" as
      being any amount east, even if both are in the same city or general area, the
      question becomes about the relative positioning within that area.


      Since both are in the eastern part of Georgia and likely in the same city (Savannah)
      or at least in similar longitudes, the difference in their locations in terms
      of being "east" of each other would be minimal or nonexistent in a broader geographical
      context.


      Therefore, based on the information provided and the logical steps followed,
      the answer to whether Ralston College, GA is located east of South University,
      GA would be: **NO**. This conclusion is reached by considering that both institutions
      are likely located in the same general area of Georgia (Savannah), making the
      question of one being east of the other less relevant in terms of significant
      geographical difference.'

    cad1986d-d30e-466f-9440-42dcf670e70b: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Ralston
      College and South University in Georgia. Ralston College does not directly appear
      in common listings of colleges in Georgia, which might indicate it''s either
      not well-known, a mistake, or not correctly named in the context of this question.
      However, for the sake of this exercise, let''s assume it exists or is a placeholder
      name for a real institution. South University, on the other hand, is a known
      institution with a campus in Savannah, Georgia, among other locations.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: To determine if Ralston College is east
      of South University, we need to know their geographic positions relative to
      each other. Since we don''t have specific information on Ralston College and
      assuming South University''s location in Savannah, Georgia, is our reference
      point, we must consider Savannah''s position. Savannah is located in the eastern
      part of Georgia, near the Atlantic coast.


      3. **Consider Possible Positions**: If Ralston College were located anywhere
      west of Savannah, it would not be east of South University. If it''s directly
      in line with or east of Savannah, then it could be considered east of South
      University, depending on the exact locations.


      4. **Conclusion Based on Available Data**: Without exact coordinates or a confirmed
      location for Ralston College, it''s challenging to provide a definitive answer.
      However, considering typical geographic inquiries, if Ralston College were indeed
      a real institution and assuming it''s not farther west than Savannah, there''s
      a possibility it could be east of South University if it''s situated more towards
      the eastern edge of Georgia or directly east of Savannah.


      Given the lack of specific information about Ralston College and the nature
      of this question, which requires precise knowledge of both institutions'' locations,
      a definitive answer cannot be provided with certainty based on the information
      available.


      However, to comply with the request for a YES/NO answer and considering the
      steps above, I must select an answer based on the assumption that without specific
      details on Ralston College, we cannot accurately determine its location relative
      to South University. Thus, my reasoning leads to a conclusion based on the information
      provided and the steps taken to analyze the question.

      - King University (Bristol, VA) is north and slightly west of Lander University
      (Greenwood, SC).


      Therefore, considering the question of whether King University, VA is located
      **east** of Lander University, SC:


      The answer is **NO**, because King University is more to the north and slightly
      west, not east, of Lander University.'

      determine the locations of both Patten University and California Maritime Academy.


      1. **Location of Patten University**: Patten University is located in Oakland,
      California. Oakland is in the San Francisco Bay Area, in the northern part of
      California.


      2. **Location of California Maritime Academy**: The California Maritime Academy
      is located in Vallejo, California. Vallejo is also in the northern part of California,
      but it is situated northeast of San Francisco, across the Bay from Oakland but
      more towards the eastern side of the San Francisco Bay Area when considering
      the broader geographical context of the Bay Area.


      3. **Comparison**: Both institutions are in the northern part of California,
      within the San Francisco Bay Area. However, to determine if Patten University
      is east of California Maritime Academy, we need to consider their relative positions.
      Oakland (where Patten University is located) is generally southwest of Vallejo
      (where California Maritime Academy is located). Given the geography of the Bay
      Area, "east" in this context refers to moving away from the Pacific coast towards
      the interior of the continent. Vallejo is indeed east of Oakland when considering
      their positions relative to the coastline and the overall layout of the Bay
      Area.


      Given these considerations, Patten University in Oakland, CA, is not east of
      California Maritime Academy in Vallejo, CA. Therefore, the answer to the question
      is:


      NO'

    2a309ff8-cdd2-40c7-adf3-c80c80438d6a: 'To determine if Patten University, CA is
      located east of California Maritime Academy, CA, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Patten University and California Maritime Academy. Patten University is located
      in Oakland, California. California Maritime Academy is located in Vallejo, California.


      2. **Determine geographical positions**: Next, we determine the geographical
      positions of these locations. Oakland is situated in the San Francisco Bay Area,
      on the eastern shore of the San Francisco Bay. Vallejo, where the California
      Maritime Academy is located, is also in the San Francisco Bay Area but is situated
      north of Oakland, still on the bay but more towards the northern part of the
      bay.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Now, comparing their locations in terms of east-west
      positioning, both institutions are relatively close to the San Francisco Bay.
      However, the key factor is their position relative to each other, not their
      absolute east-west positions in the state.


      4. **East-west orientation in the Bay Area**: Considering the geography of the
      San Francisco Bay Area, "east" typically refers to areas towards the East Bay
      (where Oakland is located) and "west" refers to areas towards the Pacific Ocean
      or the western shores of the bay. California Maritime Academy in Vallejo is
      more north than east-by-west comparison to Oakland, where Patten University
      is located.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Oakland (Patten University) is generally east
      of the bay and Vallejo (California Maritime Academy) is north of the bay but
      on the western side of the Carquinez Strait (an extension of the San Francisco
      Bay), we can conclude that Patten University is not east of California Maritime
      Academy in the traditional sense of California geography but rather is positioned
      more to the south and can be considered east in a broader, more relative sense
      when strictly comparing east-west without considering north-south movement.
      However, the direct and simple geographical interpretation based on typical
      directions would suggest that Patten University is not "east" of California
      Maritime Academy when considering standard compass directions and the layout
      of the Bay Area.

      University and California Maritime Academy. Patten University is located in
      Oakland, California, and California Maritime Academy is located in Vallejo,
      California.


      2. **Determine the geographical positions**: Next, we determine their geographical
      positions relative to each other. Oakland is situated in the eastern part of
      the San Francisco Bay Area, while Vallejo is located in the northern part of
      the Bay Area but is generally considered to be north and slightly east of San
      Francisco, though it is directly north of the Berkeley/Oakland area.


      3. **Compare their locations**: Since Oakland (where Patten University is located)
      is generally east and slightly south of Vallejo (where California Maritime Academy
      is located), we can conclude that Patten University is south and slightly east,
      but overall more east than west, of California Maritime Academy when considering
      their positions relative to the Bay.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical analysis, Patten University is

      \ University is located in Oakland, California, and California Maritime Academy\
      \ is located in Vallejo, California.\n\n2. **Understand Geographic Directions**:\
      \ Next, we need to understand the geographic layout of California to determine\
      \ what \"east\" means in this context. California is a long, narrow state that\
      \ stretches from the Pacific Ocean in the west to its eastern border with Nevada\
      \ and Arizona. When we say \"east\" in California, we're referring to locations\
      \ that are more towards the Nevada border relative to other points in the state.\n\

      \ the state, the term \"east\" refers to their relative positions to each other,\
      \ not their absolute position in the state.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the\
      \ above steps, since Vallejo (California Maritime Academy) is northeast of Oakland\
      \ (Patten University), and considering we're discussing their relative positions\

      south and slightly east of Missouri. However, the key factor is their east-west
      positioning relative to each other.


      4. **Specific locations**: Southeastern Louisiana University is in Hammond,
      Louisiana. Missouri Baptist University is in St. Louis, Missouri. St. Louis,

      Missouri. Joplin is in the southwestern part of Missouri, near the borders of
      Oklahoma, Kansas, and Arkansas.


      3. **Calvary University Location**: Calvary University is located in Kansas
      City, Missouri. Kansas City is in the western part of Missouri, along the Kansas
      border.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Now, I need to compare the locations of Joplin (MSSU)
      and Kansas City (Calvary University) in terms of their geographical positions
      within Missouri.


      5. **East-West Orientation**: Kansas City is generally east of Joplin. Considering
      the east-west orientation, locations that are more to the east are on the right
      side when looking at a map of Missouri from west to east.


      Based on these steps, since Kansas City (where Calvary University is located)
      is east of Joplin (where MSSU is located), the answer to whether Missouri Southern
      State University is located east of Calvary University is:


      NO'

      University is located east of Calvary University, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations of both universities**: First, we need to know where
      each university is located. Missouri Southern State University is in Joplin,
      MO, and Calvary University is in Kansas City, MO.


      2. **Understand the geography of Missouri**: Missouri is a state located in
      the Midwestern United States. Knowing its general layout can help us understand
      the relative positions of cities within it. Kansas City is in the western part
      of Missouri, and Joplin is in the southwestern part.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Given that Joplin (where Missouri Southern State
      University is located) is southwest and Kansas City (where Calvary University
      is located) is west, we can deduce their relative east-west positions. Since
      southwest is generally southeast of west, Joplin would be east (and slightly
      south) of Kansas City.


      Based on these steps, we can conclude that Missouri Southern State University
      is indeed located east of Calvary University.

      the steps needed to determine if Antioch University Seattle, WA is located east
      of City University of Seattle, WA.


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations
      of both Antioch University Seattle and City University of Seattle within Seattle,
      WA. This involves looking up their addresses or geographical coordinates.


      2. **Understand Seattle''s layout**: Seattle, like many cities, has a specific
      layout with defined directions (north, south, east, west) based on its geography
      and the layout of its streets and neighborhoods.


      3. **Compare locations**: Once we have the locations of both universities, we
      can compare them to determine their relative positions in terms of the cardinal
      directions (east, west, north, south).


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the comparison, we can conclude whether Antioch
      University Seattle is indeed located east of City University of Seattle.


      Given the nature of the question, let''s proceed with the general knowledge
      that might help us answer without needing to look up the exact addresses:


      - Antioch University Seattle is located in the heart of Seattle, and its address
      suggests a central location.

      - City University of Seattle, now known as City University, has a location that
      is also within Seattle but might vary depending on the specific campus or facility.


      However, without the exact addresses or a detailed map, we would typically rely
      on general geographical knowledge of Seattle. Seattle''s geography includes
      water bodies like Puget Sound to the west and Lake Washington to the east, with
      the city''s layout generally spreading out from these bodies.


      Given that both universities are in Seattle and without specific addresses,
      we can consider the general layout of Seattle. If one institution is more towards
      the eastern part of the city and the other towards the western part, the one
      in the east would indeed be "east" of the other.


      But, to provide a precise YES or NO answer without access to real-time data
      or specific addresses, we must acknowledge that the question requires specific
      geographical information that isn''t provided here.


      Given the constraints, I will proceed with a general assumption based on typical
      geographical inquiries and the fact that without exact locations, we cannot
      definitively say. However, in a real-world scenario, you would look up the addresses:


      - Antioch University Seattle: 2400 3rd Ave, Seattle, WA 98104

      - City University of Seattle: 521 Wall St, Seattle, WA 98121 (Note: This might
      not reflect the current or exact location of City University of Seattle, as
      institutions can change names, locations, or campuses.)


      Assuming the addresses provided are correct or close enough for our purposes,
      Antioch University is near the waterfront (west), and City University, based
      on the address, seems to be in a location that could be more central or slightly
      eastward, depending on the reference point.

      across the Charles River from Boston.


      3. **Determine the directional relationship**: To decide if MIT is east of WIT,
      we must consider the geography of the area. Boston, where WIT is located, is
      generally south and slightly west of Cambridge, where MIT is located. However,
      the question is about being east, not north or south.


      4. **Conclusion based on geography**: Given that MIT is in Cambridge and WIT
      is in Boston, and considering the layout of these cities, MIT (in Cambridge)
      is actually north of Boston (where WIT is located), but it can also be considered
      slightly east or northeast of WIT, depending on the exact coordinates or landmarks
      used for comparison. However, in general geographical terms regarding the question''s
      requirement for a simple east-west comparison, the critical factor is whether
      MIT is east of WIT.


      Given these considerations, the answer to whether MIT is located east of WIT
      is somewhat dependent on the precise geographical interpretation. However, in
      a general sense and considering typical understandings of these cities'' layouts,
      MIT can indeed be considered east or more accurately northeast of WIT, given
      the cities'' relative positions.


      The final answer is: YES'

      1. **Identify the locations**: Queens University of Charlotte is in Charlotte,
      North Carolina, and Kent State University at Salem is in Salem, Ohio.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: East refers to the direction towards
      the sunrise, meaning if one location is east of another, it is to the right
      when looking at a map where north is up.


      3. **Compare the longitudes**: Generally, as you move east in the United States,
      the longitude increases (becomes more positive). However, without exact longitudes,
      we can consider the general geographical positions of the states. North Carolina
      is southeast of Ohio.


      4. **Consider state positions**: North Carolina is directly south of Virginia
      and southeast of the states that include Ohio. Since Ohio is north and somewhat
      west of North Carolina, a location in North Carolina would generally be southeast
      of a location in Ohio, not directly east.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since North Carolina is southeast of Ohio, and considering
      the specific locations within these states (Charlotte, NC, and Salem, OH), Queens
      University of Charlotte, NC would indeed be southeast of Kent State University
      at Salem, OH. However, the question specifically asks if it is east, not southeast.
      Given the geographical layout, while it is more east than west relative to Ohio,
      it is also significantly south, making the direct east-west comparison dependent
      on the specific longitudes of the two locations.


      Given the nature of the question and focusing strictly on the east-west axis,
      without precise longitudes but knowing the general geography:


      - North Carolina (where Queens University of Charlotte is located) is generally
      east of Ohio (where Kent State University at Salem is located), considering
      the broad geographical layout of the United States.

      is on the west coast of the United States, and Washington is also on the west
      coast, north of California.


      3. **Compare the east-west positions**: Since both colleges are on the west

      4. **Consider the geographical layout**: The western United States has mountain

      1. **Identify the locations**: Madera Community College is located in California
      (CA), and Heritage University is located in Washington (WA).


      2. **Understand general US geography**: California is located on the West Coast
      of the United States, and Washington is also on the West Coast but is situated
      north of California.


      3. **Determine the relative east-west positions**: Since both institutions are
      on the West Coast, we need to consider their positions relative to each other.
      California is generally southwest of Washington.


      4. **Consider longitudinal positions**: Given that Washington is north and slightly
      east of California due to the curvature of the coastline and the general geography
      of the region, institutions in Washington are typically more to the east (or
      slightly more east in longitude) than those in California when comparing their
      easternmost and westernmost points.


      5. **Conclusion based on geography**: Given the typical geography and assuming
      both institutions are relatively close to the coast or not significantly far
      inland in a way that would drastically alter their east-west positioning relative
      to each other, Madera Community College in California would generally be southwest
      (and thus more west) than Heritage University in Washington.

      2. **Franklin College Clarification**: Franklin College of Arts and Sciences
      is a part of the University of Georgia. It is one of the university''s constituent
      colleges, focusing on arts and sciences.


      3. **Relative Location**: Since Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is a part
      of the University of Georgia, it is not located in a separate geographical location
      from the University of Georgia but is rather an integral part of it.


      4. **East of University of Georgia**: Given that Franklin College of Arts and

      Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is within the University of Georgia, it''s

      \ - Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is in the central part of Oklahoma.\n\n3. **Compare\
      \ the locations**:\n   - To determine if Brownsville, TX, is east of Oklahoma\
      \ City, OK, we need to understand the general geography of the region. Oklahoma\
      \ City is generally north and slightly west of Brownsville. However, the key\
      \ factor here is the east-west positioning.\n\n4. **East-west comparison**:\n\

      \ Oklahoma City, OK, is at a longitude of approximately 97.5\xB0 W as well.\n\
      \nGiven that both cities are at roughly the same longitude (97.5\xB0 W), we\
      \ can conclude that Brownsville, TX, is not significantly east or west of Oklahoma\
      \ City, OK, in terms of longitude. However, since Brownsville is directly south\
      \ of Oklahoma City and they share a similar longitude, the question of being\
      \ \"east\" of Oklahoma City can be answered based on their relative positions.\n\
