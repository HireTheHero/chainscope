    df62ee5e-b4dd-4733-94a9-2fa42a6bebe5: 'Step 1: Identify the locations of both
      institutions.

      - Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education is part of the CUNY School of
      Medicine, located at The City College of New York (CCNY) in Harlem, Manhattan.

      - The Rockefeller University is located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan,
      near the East River.


      Step 2: Understand the relative positioning within Manhattan.

      - Harlem (where CCNY and Sophie Davis are located) is in the northern part of
      Manhattan.

      - The Upper East Side (where Rockefeller University is located) is farther south
      and closer to the East River.


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship.

      - CCNY, and therefore Sophie Davis, is located in western Manhattan, near St.
      Nicholas Park.

      - Rockefeller University is located on the eastern side of Manhattan, near the
      East River.


      Conclusion:

      - Since Sophie Davis is in western Manhattan and Rockefeller University is on
      the eastern side, Sophie Davis is west of Rockefeller University.

      \ **97.5\xB0W** longitude.  \n   - Oklahoma City, OK is positioned at approximately\
      \ **97.5\xB0W** longitude as well.  \n\n4. **Determine which is farther east**:\
