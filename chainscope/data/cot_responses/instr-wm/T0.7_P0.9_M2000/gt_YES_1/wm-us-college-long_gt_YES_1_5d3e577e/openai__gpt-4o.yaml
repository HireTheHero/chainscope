      in Cupertino, California.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Sunnyvale and Cupertino are neighboring cities in the San Francisco Bay Area,
      specifically in Santa Clara County. Sunnyvale is generally situated to the northeast
      of Cupertino.


      Step 4: Determine the relative geographic positions.

      Since Sunnyvale is northeast of Cupertino, California South Bay University (in
      Sunnyvale) is east of Apple University (in Cupertino).


      Based on this analysis, the answer is YES, California South Bay University is
      located east of Apple University.'

      Since Sonnencroft, WV is not an identifiable location, it is impossible to accurately

      3. **Comparison of Locations**: When comparing the two campuses within Spokane,
      Washington State University Spokane is generally located to the east of Gonzaga
      University.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:


      NO. Gonzaga University is not located east of Washington State University Spokane;
      it is located to the west.'

      3. **Compare Longitudes**: Both locations have approximately the same longitude,
      or very close to it. In cases like these, it''s typically considered that neither
      location is definitively east or west of the other in a meaningful sense.


      Therefore, based on the longitudinal comparison, the answer is NO, Ottawa University,

      3. **Compare the longitudinal positions:** Ohio is generally north of Florida,
      but we are concerned with east-west positioning. Florida, being on the eastern
      coast of the United States, generally extends further east than most parts of
      Ohio. Specifically, Fort Myers is positioned at a longitude further west compared
      to many eastern locations in Ohio.


      Based on the geographic coordinates, New Concord, OH, where Muskingum University
      is located, is indeed west of Fort Myers, FL, where Hodges University is located.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Muskingum University is not located east of Hodges
      University.'

      4. **Determine east/west relationship**: Since they are both in Chicago and
      Loyola University is situated along Lake Michigan, we must consider their placement
      relative to the lake. Generally, both institutions are aligned north-south rather
      than east-west due to their positions in the city.


      Thus, the Illinois College of Optometry is not located east of Loyola University
      Chicago. Therefore, the answer is:

      \ within the university itself.\n\n2. **Location of UGA**: The University of\
      \ Georgia is located in Athens, Georgia.\n\n3. **Location of Franklin College**:\
      \ Since Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is a college within UGA, it is\
      \ also located in Athens, Georgia, specifically on the UGA campus.\n\n4. **Directionality**:\
      \ Since both are located on the same campus, the concept of one being east of\
      \ the other does not apply in the context of separate locations. Instead, different\
      \ buildings or sections within the campus could be east or west of each other.\n\
      \nTherefore, the question of whether Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is\
      \ east of the University of Georgia is not applicable in a traditional sense,\
      \ as they are part of the same campus.\n\nThe answer is: **NO**. Franklin College\
      \ of Arts and Sciences is not located separately to the east of the University\
      \ of Georgia; it is part of the university itself."
