      2.  **Determine the relative locations:** We need to know which direction each
      city is from the other. A quick mental map or search reveals that Massachusetts
      is a northern state on the east coast of the US, and Florida is a southern state
      on the east coast of the US.

      3.  **Infer general positions:** Since Florida is south of Massachusetts, and
      both are on the eastern side of the country, New Bedford (MA) is generally north
      and slightly west relative to Masaryktown (FL).

      4.  **Confirm the specific eastern/western relationship:** To be east of something
      means it is located further towards the sunrise relative to that point. Since
      New Bedford is significantly *north* of Masaryktown, and both are relatively
      close to the Atlantic coast, New Bedford is not located *east* of Masaryktown.
      In fact, Masaryktown is located southwest of New Bedford.

      2.  **Understand the relationship being asked:** The question asks about the
      *east/west* relationship between the two cities. Specifically, is Stantonsburg
      *east* of Littleville?

      3.  **Determine the states:** Stantonsburg is in North Carolina (NC). Littleville
      is in Alabama (AL).

      4.  **Visualize the relative locations of the states:** Alabama is generally
      west of the Carolinas on a map of the United States.

      5.  **Consider the specific locations within the states (if necessary):** Stantonsburg
      is in eastern North Carolina. Littleville is in northwestern Alabama.

      6.  **Apply the east/west comparison:** Since Alabama is west of North Carolina,
      and Stantonsburg is in NC while Littleville is in AL, Stantonsburg *must* be
      located east of Littleville. Even though Littleville is in the *northwest* of
      AL and Stantonsburg is in the *east* of NC, the overall geographical relationship
      between the states dictates the primary east/west position. NC is clearly east
      of AL.

      comparing Blauvelt, NY and Magnolia Springs, AL.

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** New York (NY) is on the
      East Coast of the United States. Alabama (AL) is in the southeastern part of
      the United States.

      3.  **Consider the relative positions of the states:** New York is significantly
      further north and east than Alabama.

      4.  **Consider the specific locations within the states:** Blauvelt is in southeastern
      New York, near the border with New Jersey. Magnolia Springs is in southern Alabama,
      near the Gulf Coast.

      5.  **Determine the relative longitude:** Locations further east have a higher
      longitude (closer to 0 degrees or positive values when using a 0-180 east/west
      scale). Locations further west have a lower longitude (further from 0 or negative
      values). Since New York is generally east of Alabama, locations within New York
      are typically east of locations within Alabama.

      6.  **Confirm with a quick mental map or a search if necessary:** Blauvelt,
      NY is around 74 degrees West longitude. Magnolia Springs, AL is around 87.5
      degrees West longitude. A smaller (less negative or more positive) West longitude
      means further East. 74 is greater than 87.5 when considering magnitude of West
      longitude, meaning 74 West is further East than 87.5 West.

      7.  **Formulate the answer:** Yes, Blauvelt, NY is significantly east of Magnolia
      Springs, AL.

      3.  **Consider east/west positioning:** Both states are on the East Coast of
      the United States. To determine if one is *east* of the other, we need to consider
      their longitude.

      4.  **Find the approximate longitude of Silver Ridge, NJ:** Silver Ridge is
      near Toms River. Toms River, NJ is roughly at longitude 74.2 degrees West.

      5.  **Find the approximate longitude of Spring Hill, FL:** Spring Hill, FL is
      near Tampa. Tampa, FL is roughly at longitude 82.5 degrees West. Spring Hill
      is slightly west of Tampa, so its longitude is even further west, maybe around
      82.6-82.7 degrees West.

      6.  **Compare the longitudes:** 74.2 degrees West (Silver Ridge, NJ) is a smaller
      number (closer to 0) than 82.6 degrees West (Spring Hill, FL). On a map, smaller
      West longitude numbers are further *east*.

      is about Noank, CT and Vander, NC.

      2.  **Determine the states:** Noank is in Connecticut (CT) and Vander is in
      North Carolina (NC).

      3.  **Visualize or approximate the relative positions of the states:** Connecticut
      is in the northeastern US. North Carolina is in the southeastern US, significantly
      south of Connecticut.

      4.  **Consider the general East/West relationship of the states:** While both
      are on the East Coast, North Carolina is generally southwest of Connecticut.

      5.  **Refine the comparison:** To determine if Noank, CT is *east* of Vander,
      NC, we need to compare their longitudes. However, given the significant difference
      in latitude and the relative position of the states (NC being southwest of CT),
      it''s highly likely that locations in CT are *west* of locations in NC when
      comparing locations at roughly the same latitude, or that CT is further north
      and west. Since NC is southwest of CT, moving from NC to CT generally involves
      moving north and east. Therefore, locations in CT are generally northwest of
      locations in NC.

      6.  **Conclusion based on relative state positions:** If CT is northwest of
      NC, then a point in CT (like Noank) will be further west than a point in NC
      (like Vander). Being further west means it is *not* east of the other point.


      Therefore, Noank, CT is *not* located east of Vander, NC.


      The answer is NO.'

      is about the relative positions of Highlandville, Missouri and Antonito, Colorado.

      2. **Determine the states:** Highlandville is in Missouri. Antonito is in Colorado.

      3. **Consider the general positions of the states:** Colorado is generally west
      of Missouri in the United States.

      4. **Consider specific locations within the states (if necessary):** While specific
      locations within large states can vary, the overall east-west relationship between
      Missouri and Colorado is quite clear. Highlandville is in the southwestern part
      of Missouri, and Antonito is in the southern part of Colorado. This doesn''t
      change the fundamental east-west relationship between the states.

      5. **Compare the longitudes:** While not strictly required for a YES/NO answer
      based on general state positions, a more precise check confirms that Colorado
      has a more westerly longitude than Missouri. Therefore, locations in Missouri
      will generally be east of locations in Colorado.


      Therefore, Highlandville, MO is located east of Antonito, CO.

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** Tennessee (TN) is in the
      southeastern US. Texas (TX) is in the south-central US.

      3.  **Consider the common geographic relationship between TN and TX:** Generally,
      Texas is located to the *west* of Tennessee.

      4.  **Consider potential exceptions:** While states have general orientations,
      specific cities within those states could be at extreme eastern or western edges,
      potentially altering the general relationship. However, both New Tazewell and
      Zavalla are not extreme edge cities of their respective states in a way that
      would likely reverse the overall East/West relationship between TN and TX. New
      Tazewell is in eastern Tennessee, and Zavalla is in eastern Texas, but eastern
      Tennessee is still significantly east of eastern Texas.

      5.  **Confirm with a map or coordinates (mental or actual):** A quick check
      confirms that Tennessee is geographically located entirely to the east of Texas.
      Therefore, any city in Tennessee will be east of any city in Texas.


      Therefore, New Tazewell, TN is located east of Zavalla, TX.


      The answer is YES.'
