      2. **Talco, TX**: Talco is a city located in the northeastern part of Texas.


      Now, consider the relative positions of Michigan and Texas:


      - Michigan is located in the northern Midwest of the United States, while Texas
      is located in the southern part of the country.

      - Michigan is generally east of Texas.


      When considering the specific locations within each state:


      - White Pigeon is in the southwest of Michigan, which places it toward the western
      side of the state.

      - Talco is in the northeast of Texas, which places it toward the eastern side
      of the state.


      Even though White Pigeon is on the western side of Michigan and Talco is on

      located in the state of Delaware, which is on the eastern side of the United
      States.


      2. **Identify the location of Pennington Gap, VA**: Pennington Gap is located
      in the state of Virginia, specifically in the southwestern part of the state.


      3. **Compare the longitudinal positions**: Delaware is generally east of Virginia.
      Specifically, Pike Creek Valley, being in Delaware, is further east than Pennington
      Gap, which is in the southwestern part of Virginia.


      Based on this analysis, the answer is:


      YES'
