      places.


      1. **Locate Whiskey Creek, FL**: Whiskey Creek is an unincorporated community
      in Lee County, Florida. Florida is located in the southeastern region of the
      United States.


      2. **Locate St. Anthony, MN**: St. Anthony is a city in Hennepin County, Minnesota.
      Minnesota is located in the northern part of the United States, bordered by
      Canada to the north.


      3. **Compare their longitudes**: Florida (and thus Whiskey Creek) is generally
      situated further south and east compared to Minnesota (and St. Anthony). Specifically,
      Florida is located at a lower latitude and a more easterly longitude compared
      to Minnesota.


      4. **Determine relative east-west position**: Since Whiskey Creek is in Florida
      and St. Anthony is in Minnesota, and considering the typical east-west orientation
      of the two states, Whiskey Creek is indeed located east of St. Anthony.

      1. **Locate Juniata Terrace, PA**: Juniata Terrace is a small borough located
      in Pennsylvania, situated to the east of the state.


      2. **Locate Ullin, IL**: Ullin is a village located in Illinois, in the southern
      part of the state.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: To find out if Juniata Terrace is east
      of Ullin, we need to compare their longitudes. Pennsylvania (where Juniata Terrace
      is located) is generally to the east of Illinois (where Ullin is located).


      Given that Pennsylvania is east of Illinois, we can conclude that Juniata Terrace,
      PA is indeed located east of Ullin, IL.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'

      2. **Leeds, AL**: This is located in Alabama, which is in the southeastern region

      Next, we can look at their relative positions on a map:


      - Pennsylvania is generally to the north of Alabama.

      - Since Reynolds Heights is in Pennsylvania and Leeds is in Alabama, Reynolds
      Heights is north of Leeds.


      To determine if Reynolds Heights is east of Leeds, we consider that Reynolds
