      5. However, New York is significantly further north than Florida.  East and
      West are relative to North and South.  Since both are on the East Coast, the
      question is whether Wading River is *more east* than Vineyards.  It likely isn''t
      significantly so, and longitude would be needed to determine this.

      6.  For a general idea, one could think about the overall shape of the East
      Coast.  Florida extends further east than much of New York.

      glance at a map reveals that Delaware is considerably further east than the
      westernmost tip of Virginia.


      4. **Conclusion:** Pike Creek Valley, DE is east of Pennington Gap, VA.


      YES

    27605667-17a0-4c53-aefa-c4e029b7fd93: '1. **Locate Pike Creek Valley, DE:** Pike
      Creek Valley is in northern Delaware, near the border with Pennsylvania.  Delaware
      is on the East Coast.


      2. **Locate Pennington Gap, VA:** Pennington Gap is in southwestern Virginia,
      near the border with Kentucky.  Virginia is also on the East Coast, but further
      west than Delaware.


      3. **East vs. West:** Since Delaware is east of Virginia, locations within Delaware
      will generally be east of locations within Virginia.  The proximity of Pike
      Creek Valley to Pennsylvania and Pennington Gap to Kentucky reinforces this
      east-west relationship.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

      east of Arkansas.

      2. **Specific Locations Required:** While Florida is east of Arkansas, it''s
      a large state. We need to know if Fruitland Park is far enough east to be east
      of Mayflower.  Simply knowing the states isn''t enough.

      3. **Look up Longitudes:**  We need to find the longitude of both cities.  A
      city further east will have a higher longitude value (more positive).


      (I would now look up the longitudes, but as an LLM, I can''t browse the internet.)


      *Assuming Fruitland Park, FL is at approximately -81.9 degrees longitude and
      Mayflower, AR is at approximately -92.4 degrees longitude:*


      4. **Compare Longitudes:** -81.9 is greater than -92.4.
