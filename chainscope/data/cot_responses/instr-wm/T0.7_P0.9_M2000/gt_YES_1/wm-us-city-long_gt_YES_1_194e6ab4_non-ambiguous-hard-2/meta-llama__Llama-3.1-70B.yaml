      1. **Identify the locations**: Plain, WI, is in Wisconsin, and Lower Brule,
      SD, is in South Dakota.

      2. **Determine general geographical positions**: Wisconsin is generally located
      in the northern part of the United States, while South Dakota is in the central
      part of the country.

      3. **Consider the longitudinal (east-west) relationship**: Since Wisconsin is
      north of South Dakota, it is generally east of South Dakota in terms of longitude.
      This is because the United States is oriented north-south, and the eastern part
      of the country is to the east of the central part.

      4. **Specific cities**: Plain, WI, and Lower Brule, SD, follow the general geographical
      rule mentioned above. Given that Plain is in Wisconsin and Lower Brule is in
      South Dakota, Plain is more eastward in longitude than Lower Brule.
