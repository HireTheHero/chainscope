      KY?


      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) Spackenkill, NY is in New York state, which is in the northeastern United
      States.


      2) Crittenden, KY is in Kentucky, which is located in the east-central United
      States, west of the Appalachian Mountains.


      3) New York is generally east of Kentucky on a map of the United States.


      4) Specifically, New York state is located to the east and somewhat north of
      Kentucky.


      5) Since Spackenkill is in New York and Crittenden is in Kentucky, and New York
      is east of Kentucky, Spackenkill would be east of Crittenden.


      6) This holds true regardless of the specific locations of these towns within
      their respective states, as the entirety of New York state is east of the entirety
      of Kentucky.


      YES, Spackenkill, NY is located east of Crittenden, KY.'

      Step 2: Recall the general geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Kentucky is located in the east-central United States, but west of New York


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning.

      - States in the eastern US are generally arranged with more eastern states having
      higher longitude values

      - New York is east of Kentucky on a map of the United States


      Step 4: Consider if there might be any unusual geographic arrangements.

      - While specific cities within states could sometimes break the general pattern,
      the states are far enough apart that any city in NY would be east of any city
      in KY


      Step 5: Conclude based on state positions.

      - Since Spackenkill is in NY and Crittenden is in KY, and NY is east of KY,
      Spackenkill must be east of Crittenden


      YES, Spackenkill, NY is located east of Crittenden, KY.'

      Step 2: Consider the relative geographic positions of Massachusetts and New
      Jersey.

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States

      - New Jersey is also in the northeastern United States, but is southwest of
      Massachusetts


      Step 3: On the east coast of the US, locations further northeast are generally
      east of locations further southwest.

      - Since Massachusetts is northeast of New Jersey, cities in Massachusetts are
      generally east of cities in New Jersey


      Step 4: Verify if there are any unusual geographic arrangements that might make
      this specific comparison different.

      - There are no unusual geographic features that would change this general relationship
      for these specific cities


      Based on this reasoning, Cedar Crest, MA would be east of Stirling, NJ.

      Step 2: Compare their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - New Jersey is significantly east of Kentucky on a map of the United States.

      - Since East Millstone is in New Jersey and Moorland is in Kentucky, East Millstone
      would be east of Moorland.


      Step 3: Confirm the directional relationship.

      - Moving from Moorland, KY to East Millstone, NJ would require traveling eastward.

      - Moving from East Millstone, NJ to Moorland, KY would require traveling westward.


      YES, East Millstone, NJ is located east of Moorland, KY.'

      if East Millstone, NJ is located east of Moorland, KY.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both cities.

      - East Millstone is in New Jersey (NJ), which is on the eastern coast of the
      United States.

      - Moorland is in Kentucky (KY), which is in the interior of the United States,
      west of New Jersey.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of the states.

      - New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United States.

      - Kentucky is located in the east-central United States, but significantly west
      of New Jersey.


      Step 3: Compare the longitude of the two states.

      - States on the eastern coast (like New Jersey) have more eastern longitudes
      (higher negative values) than interior states like Kentucky.

      - New Jersey is therefore east of Kentucky on a map of the United States.


      Step 4: Since East Millstone is in New Jersey and Moorland is in Kentucky, and
      New Jersey is east of Kentucky, East Millstone must be east of Moorland.


      NO, wait - I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me verify the actual answer:


      Since East Millstone is in New Jersey (an eastern state) and Moorland is in
      Kentucky (a more western state), East Millstone is indeed east of Moorland.

      East Millstone is in New Jersey, which is on the eastern coast of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Determine the location of Moorland, KY.

      Moorland is in Kentucky, which is located in the eastern half of the United
      States, but west of New Jersey.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      When comparing locations in the United States, places in New Jersey are generally
      east of places in Kentucky. This is because New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast,
      while Kentucky is an inland state several states to the west of New Jersey.


      Step 4: Confirm the east-west relationship.

      New Jersey is approximately at 74-75 degrees west longitude, while Kentucky
      is approximately at 84-89 degrees west longitude. Since a smaller west longitude
      number means further east, New Jersey (and thus East Millstone) is east of Kentucky
      (and thus Moorland).

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Wading River, NY is on Long Island in New York state, which is in the northeastern
      United States.

      - Vineyards, FL would be in Florida, which is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider their positions relative to each other.

      - New York is north of Florida, but the question asks about east-west positioning.

      - On a US map, New York is to the east of Florida. The entire east coast runs
      in a northeast to southwest direction.

      - Long Island, where Wading River is located, is on the easternmost part of
      New York.

      - Florida extends south but is significantly west of Long Island.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Places further east have more easterly longitudes.

      - Long Island (including Wading River) is one of the easternmost points in the
      continental US.

      - All of Florida, including Vineyards, is west of Long Island''s longitude.

      Step 1: Recall the general geographic positions of Montana and California.

      - Montana is in the northern part of the western United States, but east of
      California.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider longitude (east-west position).

      - States further east have higher longitude values (measured in degrees east
      of the Prime Meridian).

      - Montana is located east of California on the U.S. map.


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      - Bozeman is in southern Montana.

      - Fortuna is in northern California near the coast.

      - The east-west relationship between these cities follows the same pattern as
      their states.


      Step 4: Confirm the relationship.

      - Since Montana is east of California, and these cities don''t have unusual
      positions within their states that would reverse this relationship, Bozeman
      must be east of Fortuna.


      YES, Bozeman, MT is located east of Fortuna, CA.'

      - Ellenboro, NC is in North Carolina, which is on the east coast of the United
      States.

      - Pickensville, AL is in Alabama, which is in the southeastern United States
      but west of North Carolina.


      Step 2: Looking at their relative positions:

      - Since Ellenboro is in North Carolina and Pickensville is in Alabama, Ellenboro
      must be east of Pickensville.


      Step 3: To verify this further, North Carolina shares its western border with
      Tennessee, while Alabama is west of Georgia, which is west of South Carolina,
      which is west of North Carolina.


      Therefore, Ellenboro, NC is definitely located east of Pickensville, AL.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both cities.

      - Maybee, MI is in Michigan (MI), which is in the eastern part of the Midwest.

      - Columbus Junction, IA is in Iowa (IA), which is in the western part of the
      Midwest.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions.

      - Michigan is located east of Iowa in the United States.

      - Michigan borders the Great Lakes to the east, while Iowa is further west in
      the interior.


      Step 3: Verify the specific locations within their states.

      - While the exact positions within their states could matter, the east-west
      relationship between Michigan and Iowa is significant enough that any city in
      Michigan would be east of any city in Iowa.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on the geographic positions.

      - Gruver is located in the Texas Panhandle, in the northern part of Texas.

      - Dakota Ridge is located in Colorado, near Denver in the central-eastern part
      of Colorado.


      Step 2: I need to determine their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - Texas is generally east of Colorado on a map of the United States.

      - However, since Gruver is in the Texas Panhandle (the northwestern part of
      Texas) and Dakota Ridge is in the eastern part of Colorado, I need to be more
      precise.


      Step 3: Looking at their specific locations:

      - Gruver, TX is in the far northern Texas Panhandle, near the Oklahoma border.

      - Dakota Ridge, CO is in Jefferson County, in the Denver metropolitan area,
      which is on the eastern side of Colorado.


      Step 4: Comparing their longitudes (east-west position):

      - Places further east have lower longitude numbers in the western hemisphere.

      - The Texas Panhandle, where Gruver is located, is approximately at the same
      longitude as eastern Colorado.

      - However, Gruver is slightly east of the Colorado-Texas line, while Dakota
      Ridge is well into Colorado from its eastern border.

      northern part of the state.

      - Dakota Ridge is in Colorado (CO), in the eastern part of that state.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Texas and Colorado.

      - Colorado is directly west of Kansas, which borders the Texas Panhandle.

      - Texas is generally southeast of Colorado.


      Step 3: Compare their positions more specifically.

      - The Texas Panhandle extends northward along the eastern border of New Mexico,
      which is directly south of Colorado.

      - Gruver is in Hansford County in the northeastern part of the Texas Panhandle.

      - Dakota Ridge is in Jefferson County in the central-eastern part of Colorado,
      near Denver.


      Step 4: Consider their relative positions on a west-east axis.

      - Colorado is entirely west of Texas on a map.

      - Any location in Texas, including the Panhandle where Gruver is located, would
      be east of locations in Colorado.

      - Texas is a large state that extends quite far west, and it borders Mexico.


      Step 3: More specifically, Las Quintas Fronterizas would be near the Texas-Mexico
      border, which is in the far southern part of Texas. Texas extends much further
      west than Iowa.


      Step 4: Epworth, IA would be in eastern Iowa, but even eastern Iowa is generally
      east of the western parts of Texas, but not necessarily east of the eastern
      parts of Texas.


      Step 5: Las Quintas Fronterizas, being near the Mexico border, would be in the
      western or southern part of Texas, which is definitely west of Iowa.


      Therefore, Epworth, IA is located east of Las Quintas Fronterizas, TX.


      NO


      Wait, I made a mistake in my reasoning. The question asks if Epworth, IA is
      east of Las Quintas Fronterizas, TX, not west. Since Epworth, IA is indeed east
      of Las Quintas Fronterizas, TX, the answer is:


      YES'

      Step 3: Compare longitudes.

      - Iowa is generally positioned to the northeast of Texas.

      - Places in Iowa are typically further east than places in western or southern
      Texas.

      - Las Quintas Fronterizas, being a border community in Texas, is likely in the
      southern part of Texas along the Mexico border, which would place it quite far
      west.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Epworth, IA would be positioned in eastern Iowa.

      - Las Quintas Fronterizas, TX would be positioned in southern Texas, likely
      far to the west.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both cities.

      - Noank, CT is in Connecticut, which is a state in the northeastern United States.

      - Vander, NC is in North Carolina, which is a state on the eastern seaboard
      but further south than Connecticut.


      Step 2: Consider their positions relative to each other.

      - Connecticut is located in New England, in the far northeastern part of the
      country.

      - North Carolina is located along the Atlantic coast, but significantly south
      of Connecticut.

      - When comparing east-west positions, I need to consider their longitudes.


      Step 3: Determine their relative east-west positions.

      - Connecticut is generally east of most mainland US states, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean.

      - North Carolina is also an eastern seaboard state, but the eastern edge of
      Connecticut is typically further east than most of North Carolina.

      - Specifically, Noank is located in the southeastern part of Connecticut, very
      close to the Atlantic coast.

      - Vander is in Cumberland County, NC, which is not on the immediate coastline
      but in the eastern part of North Carolina.


      Step 4: Make the final comparison.

      - Noank, CT, being on the Connecticut coast, is further east than Vander, NC,
      which is inland from the North Carolina coast.


      YES, Noank, CT is located east of Vander, NC.'

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Noank is in Connecticut (CT)

      - Vander is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Connecticut is in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern United States

      - Generally, states on the East Coast are arranged north-to-south, with northeastern
      states being east of southeastern states due to the coastline''s curve


      Step 3: More specifically, Connecticut is located significantly northeast of
      North Carolina, and the Atlantic coastline curves so that locations in Connecticut
      are generally east of locations in North Carolina.


      Step 4: Since Noank is in Connecticut and Vander is in North Carolina, and given
      the geographic arrangement of these states on the East Coast, Noank would be
      east of Vander.


      NO


      Wait, I need to double-check my reasoning. The Atlantic coastline does curve,
      but Connecticut is actually northeast of North Carolina. When considering purely
      east-west positioning, Connecticut is indeed east of North Carolina. Therefore,
      Noank, CT would be east of Vander, NC.


      YES'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both cities.

      - Pawtucket, RI is in Rhode Island, which is in the northeastern United States.

      - Lula, GA is in Georgia, which is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on a map.

      - Georgia is also on the Atlantic coast, but much further south and west compared
      to Rhode Island.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions specifically.

      - States on the eastern seaboard generally follow a pattern where the northeastern
      states (like Rhode Island) are east of the southeastern states (like Georgia).

      - Rhode Island is one of the easternmost states in the US, while Georgia is
      set back somewhat from the coast and extends further west.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Pawtucket is in Rhode Island (northeast) and Lula is in Georgia (southeast),
      and northeastern states are generally east of southeastern states, Pawtucket
      would be east of Lula.


      YES, Pawtucket, RI is located east of Lula, GA.'

      - Circleville is in Ohio (OH)

      - Allouez is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Ohio is in the eastern part of the Midwest region, bordering Pennsylvania
      to the east

      - Wisconsin is in the upper Midwest region, west of Michigan and east of Minnesota


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Ohio is generally east of Wisconsin in the United States

      - Cities in Ohio would typically be east of cities in Wisconsin, unless they''re
      at extreme edges of their respective states


      Step 4: Verify the specific cities.

      - Circleville is located in central Ohio

      - Allouez is in northeastern Wisconsin (near Green Bay)


      Since Ohio as a whole is east of Wisconsin, and these cities are not at unusual
      extremes of their states that would reverse this relationship, Circleville,
      OH is indeed east of Allouez, WI.
