      - East Millstone, NJ is in New Jersey, in the northeastern United States

      - Moorland, KY is in Kentucky, in the southeastern United States


      2. To determine if one is east of the other, I need to compare their relative
      positions:

      - New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast

      - Kentucky is an inland state, several states west of New Jersey


      3. Since New Jersey is significantly east of Kentucky on the map, any city in
      New Jersey (including East Millstone) would be east of any city in Kentucky
      (including Moorland).


      Therefore: YES'

      closer to the Atlantic Ocean than Michigan.


      4) Therefore, any city in northern Virginia (including Fairfax Station) will
      be east of any city in Michigan (including Brown City).

      1) First, let me recall the general geography:

      - Fairfax Station, VA is in northern Virginia, near Washington DC

      - Brown City, MI is in Michigan


      2) For east/west comparisons, I can use these facts:

      - Virginia is on the East Coast

      - Michigan is in the Midwest

      - States bordering the East Coast are generally east of Midwestern states


      3) Looking at the specific locations:

      - Fairfax Station, VA is in the eastern part of Virginia

      - Brown City, MI is in the eastern part of Michigan

      - However, even the eastern part of Michigan is still significantly west of
      Virginia


      4) Therefore, since Fairfax Station is in Virginia (an East Coast state) and
      Brown City is in Michigan (a Midwestern state), Fairfax Station must be east
      of Brown City.

      - Lakota is in North Dakota (ND)


      2. Consider the states'' positions:

      - Iowa is directly south of Minnesota

      - North Dakota is directly west of Minnesota


      3. Therefore:

      - North Dakota is west of Iowa

      - Any city in North Dakota will be west of any city in Iowa


      4. Since:

      - Rockwell City is in Iowa

      - Lakota is in North Dakota

      - Rockwell City must be east of Lakota

      1) Let me recall the locations:

      - Orwigsburg is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - Frankenmuth is in Michigan (MI)


      2) Rough geographic orientation:

      - Pennsylvania is on the east coast of the US

      - Torrington, CT is in Connecticut, which is in the northeastern United States

      - Gahanna, OH is in Ohio, which is in the midwestern United States


      2) More specifically:

      - Connecticut is on the East Coast

      - Ohio is several states west of Connecticut


      3) Looking at the relative positions:

      - Torrington, CT is in western Connecticut

      - Gahanna, OH is near Columbus in central Ohio


      4) Even though Torrington is in western Connecticut, any point in Connecticut
      is still significantly east of any point in Ohio, as several states (like Pennsylvania
      and New York) lie between them.


      Therefore: YES, Torrington, CT is located east of Gahanna, OH.'

    050720d2-6f5f-4979-bd23-3e80cade9e3c: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. Let me recall the general locations:

      - Oakboro, NC is in North Carolina

      - Fort Rucker, AL is in Alabama


      2. On a US map:

      - North Carolina is on the East Coast

      - Alabama is west of North Carolina


      3. More specifically:

      - Oakboro is in central North Carolina

      - Fort Rucker is in southeast Alabama


      4. Even though Fort Rucker is in the southeastern part of Alabama, it''s still
      west of Oakboro, NC because:

      - All of Alabama is west of North Carolina

      - Therefore any point in Alabama must be west of any point in North Carolina


      5. If Fort Rucker is west of Oakboro, then Oakboro must be east of Fort Rucker.

      - Fort Rucker, AL is in Alabama


      2. Let me think about their positions:

      - North Carolina is on the East Coast

      - Alabama is west of North Carolina, bordering the Gulf Coast


      3. More specifically:

      - Oakboro is in central North Carolina

      - Fort Rucker is in southeast Alabama


      4. Looking at their relative positions:

      - Any point in North Carolina will be east of any point in Alabama, as Alabama
      is entirely west of North Carolina


      5. Therefore, since Oakboro, NC is in North Carolina, it must be east of Fort
      Rucker, AL.

      1. Let me recall the locations:

      2. Looking at the relative positions:

      - North Carolina is east of Alabama on the US map

      - Both states border the Atlantic coast, with NC being two states over from
      AL


      3. Within their states:

      - Oakboro is in central NC

      - Fort Rucker is in southeast AL

      - Even though Fort Rucker is in the eastern part of AL, Oakboro being in NC
      puts it significantly further east


      4. Conclusion:

      Since North Carolina is east of Alabama, and Oakboro''s position in central
      NC is still well east of even the easternmost parts of Alabama, Oakboro must
      be east of Fort Rucker.

      - Oceanport is on the Atlantic coast

      - Villa Rica is inland, quite far from the coast


      3) When comparing east-west positions in the US:

      - New Jersey is significantly east of Georgia

      - Additionally, being on the Atlantic coast makes Oceanport one of the easternmost
      points possible

      - Villa Rica being in western Georgia puts it even further west


      4) Therefore, since Oceanport, NJ (on the Atlantic coast) is clearly east of
      Villa Rica, GA (in western Georgia)...

    b26474be-ab11-4b83-8725-1fc79bd3e3ca: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let me consider the general locations:

      - Oceanport, NJ is on the Jersey Shore, near the Atlantic Ocean

      - Villa Rica, GA is in western Georgia, not far from the Alabama border


      2) To determine which is further east, I can think about their approximate positions:

      - Oceanport, NJ being on the Atlantic coast, is very far east

      - Villa Rica, GA being in western Georgia, is much further inland and west


      3) Looking at relative positions:

      - New Jersey''s coast is significantly east of Georgia
