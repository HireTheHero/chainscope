      State College of Science is located in Wahpeton, North Dakota.


      2. **Compare States**: Minnesota is located north of North Dakota. This is a
      general geographical fact about the positioning of these two states in the United
      States.


      3. **Consider Specific Locations Within States**: Since Minnesota is north of
      North Dakota, any point in Minnesota is generally north of any point in North
      Dakota, given the states'' overall positions relative to each other.


      Based on this reasoning, Minnesota State Community and Technical College, being
      in Minnesota, would indeed be north of North Dakota State College of Science,
      which is in North Dakota.

      \   - The question is whether Wind River Tribal College, WY is located north\
      \ of Grand Valley State University, MI. Given the general geography and without\

      \ University (PSU):** Portland State University is located in Portland, Oregon.\
      \ Specifically, its address is 724 SW Harrison, Portland, OR 97201. This places\
      \ it in the southwest part of Portland.\n\n2. **Identify the Location of Pacific\
      \ University Health Professions Campus:** Pacific University has multiple campuses,\
      \ but the Health Professions Campus is specifically located in Hillsboro, Oregon.\
      \ Hillsboro is a city to the west of Portland.\n\n3. **Determine the Relative\
      \ Positions:** \n    - **North/South Orientation:** Portland State University\
      \ is in Portland. Hillsboro, where the Pacific University Health Professions\

      \ Positioning:** Considering the geographic layout, Hillsboro (and thus Pacific\
      \ University's Health Professions Campus) is not directly north but rather northwest\
      \ of Portland. However, in terms of being \"north of,\" if we consider the primary\

      \ think it could be considered north. But accurately, it is more to the west\
      \ than directly north.\n\n4. **Conclusion Based on Geographic Relationship:**\
      \ Given that \"north of\" typically implies a direct northern direction and\
      \ considering Hillsboro's position is more accurately described as northwest\
      \ of Portland rather than directly north, the question's YES/NO nature requires\
      \ a precise interpretation of \"north of.\" However, in common geographic descriptions,\
      \ especially without precise directional language, being northwest could be\
      \ colloquially described as being north in a broader sense, depending on the\
      \ context. Yet, for strict accuracy in directional terms, northwest is not the\
      \ same as north.\n\nGiven the need for a strict YES/NO answer and considering\
      \ the above reasoning, the most accurate response based on the specific wording\
      \ of the question (\"located north of\") would be \"NO\" because Pacific University\

      is located north of Fontbonne University, MO, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know the locations of both
      Maryville University and Fontbonne University. Maryville University is located
      in St. Louis, Missouri. Fontbonne University is also located in St. Louis, Missouri.


      2. **Compare the locations**: Since both universities are in St. Louis, MO,
      we need to compare their exact locations within the city to determine their
      relative positions.


      3. **Check addresses or maps**: Looking at their addresses or using a mapping
      service can help determine their exact locations. Maryville University''s address
      is 650 Maryville University Drive, St. Louis, MO 63141. Fontbonne University''s
      address is 6800 Wydown Blvd, St. Louis, MO 63105.


      4. **Determine north-south orientation**: In St. Louis, MO, the general layout
      of the city and the location of these universities need to be considered. Typically,
      the north-south orientation can be understood by looking at major landmarks
      or the city''s grid system.


      5. **Conclusion**: After researching, it appears that Maryville University is
      located west of Fontbonne University but when considering north-south orientation,
      Maryville University is indeed north of Fontbonne University.


      The final answer is: YES'

      \ with the Chicago area. However, to determine if one is north of the other,\
      \ we need more precise locations. \n   - Assuming La Salle Extension University's\
      \ operations or former main location was in the general area of Chicago, and\
      \ considering Robert Morris University Illinois has its main campus in Chicago\
      \ as well, the critical factor would be their exact addresses or the neighborhoods\

      \ based in Chicago and without exact addresses or more specific information\
      \ about their relative positions within the city, it's challenging to definitively\
      \ say one is north of the other without assuming or researching their precise\
      \ locations.\n\nHowever, since the question requires a YES or NO answer and\
      \ considering the need for a more precise location to accurately determine their\
      \ relative positions, I will proceed with the understanding that a definitive\
      \ answer might not be fully informed without this detail.\n\nBased on the general\
      \ information provided and acknowledging the lack of specificity regarding their\
      \ exact locations within Chicago, I must provide an answer that reflects the\

      \ for practical purposes. Thus, Central Methodist University is not north of\
      \ Xavier University; they are essentially at the same latitude.\n\nThe final\

    8d16cfd4-7d14-4278-a7be-ddd8c55abb92: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the University of Richmond School of Professional & Continuing Studies (VA)
      and Virginia Union University (VA).


      2. **University of Richmond School of Professional & Continuing Studies location**:
      The University of Richmond is located in Richmond, Virginia. Specifically, it
      is situated in the western part of the city.


      3. **Virginia Union University location**: Virginia Union University is also
      located in Richmond, Virginia. It is situated in the north part of the city.


      4. **Compare locations**: Given that both universities are in Richmond, Virginia,
      we need to determine their relative positions. Richmond, being the capital of
      Virginia, has a grid-like street pattern with some irregularities, but generally,
      the city is laid out in a way that moving from west to east takes you through
      the downtown area and towards the eastern parts of the city, while moving from
      south to north takes you from the southern suburbs through the city center and
      towards the northern suburbs.


      5. **Determine if University of Richmond is north of Virginia Union University**:
      Since Virginia Union University is in the north part of Richmond and the University
      of Richmond is in the western part, we need to understand that "north" refers
      to the direction relative to the city''s layout. Given the general layout of
      Richmond, being in the "north" part typically means being at a higher latitude
      than locations in the "south" or "west" parts of the city.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the general locations within Richmond, Virginia,
      the University of Richmond (in the west) is not north of Virginia Union University
      (in the north). Therefore, the answer to whether the University of Richmond
      School of Professional & Continuing Studies is located north of Virginia Union
      University is **NO**.'

      School of Professional & Continuing Studies, VA is located north of Virginia
      Union University, VA, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know the locations of both
      institutions. The University of Richmond School of Professional & Continuing
      Studies is located in Richmond, Virginia. Virginia Union University is also
      located in Richmond, Virginia.


      2. **Compare locations within Richmond**: Since both institutions are in Richmond,
      VA, the next step is to compare their specific locations within the city. The
      University of Richmond is situated in the western part of Richmond, and Virginia
      Union University is located in the northern part of Richmond.


      3. **Determine north-south orientation**: Knowing that Virginia Union University
      is in the northern part of Richmond and the University of Richmond (where the
      School of Professional & Continuing Studies is located) is in the western part,
      we can infer their relative positions. Generally, "north" refers to a direction
      towards the northern part of a city, and "west" refers to a direction towards
      the western part. However, without exact coordinates or a detailed map, we rely
      on the general understanding that if one institution is in the northern part
      and the other in the western part, the western location could either be north,
      south, or at the same latitude as the northern location, depending on the specific
      geography of the area.


      4. **Conclusion based on typical city layout**: In a typical city layout, areas
      described as "western" can be at any latitude relative to areas described as
      "northern," depending on the city''s layout and the specific locations within
      it. However, given that Virginia Union University is specifically noted to be
      in the northern part of Richmond, and the University of Richmond is in the western
      part, it suggests that Virginia Union University could be north of the University
      of Richmond, depending on their exact locations.

      the university. Therefore, it cannot be north or south of the university; it
      is part of the university.


      Based on this reasoning, the question seems to be asking about the relative
      location of a component of Angelo State University to the university itself,
      which doesn''t apply in the context of separate geographical locations.


      Therefore, considering the logic and the nature of the question, the answer
      would be: **NO**. The College of Sciences is not located north of Angelo State

      2. **Same Location**: Typically, colleges within a university are located on
      the same campus or in very close proximity to the main university campus. This
      is because universities often organize their colleges or schools by discipline
      (e.g., College of Sciences, College of Arts, College of Business) and these
      are usually part of the university''s main infrastructure.


      3. **Implication of the Question**: The question implies a geographical separation

      often housed in specific buildings but still on the university''s campus.


      4. **Apply This Understanding to the Scenario:** Given that the College of Sciences
      is a part of Angelo State University, it is reasonable to infer that it is located
      on the university''s campus. Universities usually do not have their colleges
      scattered across different parts of a city or state; rather, they are typically

      located north of William Peace University, I will follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: NC State University and William Peace University
      are both located in North Carolina.

      2. **Find specific locations**: NC State University is located in Raleigh, North
      Carolina. William Peace University is also located in Raleigh, North Carolina.

      3. **Compare positions**: Since both universities are in Raleigh, their relative
      positions (north or south) can be determined by their exact addresses or general
      areas within the city.

      4. **Determine north-south orientation**: Given that both are in the same city,
      the difference in their locations would be based on the city''s layout rather
      than their positions within the state.


      However, without exact addresses or a detailed map of Raleigh showing both universities''
      precise locations, it''s challenging to definitively say which one is north
      of the other based solely on the information given. But, considering they are
      both in Raleigh, the question essentially asks for a comparison within the city
      limits.


      Given this context, and knowing that NC State University is generally located
      in the western part of Raleigh and William Peace University is more towards
      the downtown area, it''s still a bit tricky without precise locations. But,
      for the sake of providing an answer based on general knowledge:


      NC State University''s main campus is situated in the southwest part of Raleigh,
      and William Peace University is located closer to the city center. Typically,
      the city center of Raleigh is not considered the northernmost part of the city,
      but without precise GPS coordinates or a detailed map, this question relies
      on general geographic knowledge of Raleigh.


      Given the information and general knowledge about Raleigh''s layout, it''s reasonable
      to consider that NC State might be southwest of the city center, which could
      imply it''s not necessarily north of William Peace University. However, this
      is a simplification and doesn''t account for the specific layout of Raleigh
      or the exact locations of these universities within the city.


      **Answer**: NO'
    2948f164-085a-439d-8525-a419a1f2372e: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of NC State University and William Peace University in North Carolina.


      1. **Location of NC State University**: NC State University is located in Raleigh,
      North Carolina. Raleigh is the capital city of North Carolina and is situated
      in the central part of the state.


      2. **Location of William Peace University**: William Peace University is also
      located in Raleigh, North Carolina. It is situated in the downtown area of Raleigh.


      Given that both universities are in Raleigh, North Carolina, and considering
      their specific locations within the city:


      - NC State University is generally located west and slightly north of the city
      center.

      - William Peace University is in the downtown area, which could be considered
      more central or southeastern part of Raleigh compared to NC State University.


      However, since both are within the same city and not significantly distant from
      each other in terms of north-south orientation, the question of one being definitively
      "north" of the other depends on their exact locations within Raleigh.


      Considering the general layout and without precise GPS coordinates, it might
      seem like a close call. However, given that NC State University is slightly
      northwest of the central downtown area where William Peace University is located,
      we can make an educated guess.


      Therefore, based on their relative positions within Raleigh, NC State University
      is indeed located north (or more accurately, slightly northwest) of William
      Peace University.


      The answer is: **YES**'
    4714b03e-67c1-4242-8aec-97d82a34cead: 'To answer this question, I need to determine
      the locations of NC State University and William Peace University in North Carolina.


      1. **Identify the locations**: NC State University is located in Raleigh, North
      Carolina. William Peace University is also located in Raleigh, North Carolina.


      2. **Compare the locations**: Since both universities are in the same city (Raleigh),
      their relative positions (north or south) depend on their specific addresses
      or campuses within the city.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Without exact addresses, I can consider
      general knowledge about the layout of Raleigh. NC State University is situated
      in the western part of Raleigh, near the intersection of Hillsborough Street
      and Western Boulevard. William Peace University is located in the downtown area
      of Raleigh.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that both universities are in Raleigh and considering
      their general locations within the city, NC State University is not significantly
      north or south of William Peace University in a way that would be universally
      agreed upon without precise GPS coordinates. However, for the purpose of this
      question and acknowledging that downtown Raleigh (where William Peace University
      is located) is generally southeast of the NC State University campus, one could
      argue that NC State University is north of William Peace University, albeit
      not by a large margin.

      2. **Identify the location of Washington Technology University, WA**: However,
      there seems to be a confusion or a lack of information regarding "Washington
      Technology University, WA." It''s possible that the institution is not well-known

      technology in Washington state is Washington State University or the University
      of Washington, but neither of these is directly called "Washington Technology

      to a lesser-known institution or perhaps a misunderstanding of a university''s

      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - Antioch University Seattle is located in Seattle, Washington.

      - Washington Technology University does not appear to be a well-known or easily
      identifiable institution in the context of widely recognized universities in

      confirmed with the information provided, we''ll proceed with the assumption
      that the question intends to compare the relative positions of two institutions
      within Washington State, with one being in Seattle.


      Seattle is located in the western part of Washington State, near the Puget Sound.
      Without specific information on Washington Technology University''s location,
      we can''t directly compare their positions.


      However, considering that the question asks if Antioch University Seattle is
      located north of Washington Technology University, and without the exact location
      of the latter, we must rely on general geographical knowledge of Washington
      State. Seattle itself is not at the northernmost tip of Washington State but
      is more towards the central-western part.


      Given the lack of specific information about Washington Technology University,
      we cannot definitively say whether Antioch University Seattle is north or south
      of it. But, for the purpose of this exercise and to provide an answer based
      on the steps of reasoning:


      If we were to hypothetically place Washington Technology University in a location
      south of Seattle (for example, in Olympia, the state capital, which is south
      of Seattle), then Antioch University Seattle would indeed be north of it.

      \ in a southern part of Washington state, then Antioch University Seattle would\
      \ indeed be north of it.\n\n5. **Decision Based on Known Information**: Given\
      \ the information available and assuming a hypothetical or incorrectly named\
      \ Washington Technology University, if we consider major cities or institutions\
      \ in Washington state, Seattle is generally north of many parts of the state.\
      \ Without the exact location of Washington Technology University, we can't definitively\
      \ say. However, considering the nature of the question and assuming it's based\
      \ on real geographical locations within Washington state, we can attempt a logical\
      \ deduction.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since we cannot verify the existence or location\
      \ of Washington Technology University and given that Antioch University Seattle\
      \ is in Seattle, which is in the northwestern part of Washington state, without\
      \ specific information on the location of Washington Technology University,\
      \ the question becomes speculative. However, if we were to follow the logic\
      \ that Seattle is generally north of many locations in Washington state and\

    7df5611f-f3e1-44fb-b9cb-abe4a679ef38: 'To determine if Antioch University Seattle,
      WA is located north of Washington Technology University, WA, let''s break down
      the process:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations
      of both Antioch University Seattle and Washington Technology University within
      Washington State.


      2. **Antioch University Seattle Location**: Antioch University Seattle is located
      in Seattle, Washington. Seattle is a city in the state of Washington, situated
      in the northwestern part of the United States.


      3. **Washington Technology University Location**: Next, we need to find out
      where Washington Technology University is located. However, as of my last update,
      there isn''t a well-known or prominent university by the name of "Washington
      Technology University" in Washington State. This could imply that the university
      might not exist, is very small, or is known by a different name. Without specific
      coordinates or a known location, it''s challenging to compare its location directly
      to Antioch University Seattle.


      4. **Comparison**: Given the uncertainty about Washington Technology University''s
      existence or location, a direct comparison to determine if Antioch University
      Seattle is north of it isn''t feasible with the provided information.


      However, considering the context of the question and assuming Washington Technology
      University might be intended to refer to a different institution (possibly within
      the Seattle area or elsewhere in Washington State), we still face a challenge
      due to the lack of clear information about the latter''s location.


      Given these steps and the information available, the question cannot be accurately
      answered without assuming or knowing the actual location of Washington Technology
      University. But since the question format demands a YES/NO answer and considering
      Antioch University Seattle''s known location in Seattle, WA, and without a clear
      location for Washington Technology University to make a direct comparison, the
      most straightforward answer based on the available information would lean towards
      not having enough data to confirm the relative positions accurately.


      Therefore, based on the requirement for a YES/NO answer and the steps considered,
      the answer would have to be **NO**, primarily because we cannot confirm the
      location of Washington Technology University to make an accurate comparison.
      However, it''s crucial to note this answer comes with the caveat that the location
      of Washington Technology University could not be verified.'
    b1ff47cc-207e-4036-bc7c-86a048c2adf1: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of Antioch University Seattle, WA, and Washington Technology University,
      WA, and then compare their positions relative to each other, specifically in
      terms of north-south orientation.


      1. **Identify the Location of Antioch University Seattle, WA**: Antioch University
      Seattle is located in Seattle, Washington. Seattle is a major city in the state
      of Washington, known for its tech industry and cultural landmarks.


      2. **Identify the Location of Washington Technology University, WA**: The question
      mentions Washington Technology University, WA. However, as of my last update,
      there isn''t a widely recognized or accredited institution by that exact name
      in Washington State. It''s possible that the university might be less well-known,
      newly established, or perhaps the name is slightly incorrect. For the purpose
      of this exercise, let''s assume it exists or is a stand-in for a real institution
      in Washington State, but without specific details, we''ll proceed with general
      knowledge about university locations in Washington.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Without the exact location of Washington Technology
      University, WA, we can''t directly compare the two. However, since Antioch University
      Seattle is specifically in Seattle, if Washington Technology University is also
      in Seattle or anywhere south of Seattle within the state, then Antioch University
      Seattle would not be north of it.


      4. **Consideration of Geography**: Washington State is long and narrow, stretching
      from the Canadian border in the north to the Oregon border in the south. Seattle
      is located in the northwestern part of the state, near the Puget Sound. Any
      location within the state that is south of Seattle would place Antioch University
      Seattle in a northern position relative to that location.


      Given the lack of specific information about Washington Technology University,
      WA, and assuming it could be anywhere in the state, we cannot definitively say
      whether Antioch University Seattle is north of it without knowing the exact
      location of Washington Technology University. However, the question demands
      a YES or NO answer, so based on the information provided and the steps of reasoning,
      we must make an educated guess or acknowledge the ambiguity.


      Since we cannot accurately determine the relative positions without more specific
      information about Washington Technology University, WA, and given that the question
      seems to require a binary answer, the most appropriate response, considering
      the steps and the ambiguity, would lean towards a cautious approach. But, to
      follow the format requested and acknowledging the ambiguity, the answer based
      on available information and the necessity to choose would be:


      YES'
    c8a6ad2c-fec9-4a9c-b0cf-c82d0a7837e3: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Antioch University Seattle and Washington Technology University. Antioch University
      Seattle is clearly located in Seattle, Washington.


      2. **Washington Technology University Location**: Next, we need to determine
      the location of Washington Technology University. However, there seems to be
      limited information available on a university by this exact name in Washington
      State. It''s possible that it might be a lesser-known institution, a mistaken
      name, or perhaps it''s known by a different name (like Washington State University
      or a specific campus within a larger university system). Without specific information,
      we''ll proceed under the assumption that if it exists, its location could be
      anywhere in Washington State.


      3. **Comparative Location Analysis**: Given the lack of specific information
      about Washington Technology University, we can''t directly compare the locations
      without making assumptions. However, since Antioch University Seattle is in
      Seattle, to answer whether it''s north of Washington Technology University,
      we would need to know if Washington Technology University is located south of
      Seattle.


      4. **General Geographic Knowledge**: Seattle is located in the northwestern
      part of Washington State. If Washington Technology University were located in
      a more southern part of the state (for example, in cities like Tacoma, Olympia,
      or further south), then Antioch University Seattle would indeed be north of
      it.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Available Data**: Without the exact location of Washington
      Technology University, we cannot definitively conclude the relative positions
      of the two universities. However, given the nature of the question, which requires
      a YES or NO answer, and assuming that Washington Technology University could
      be located in a variety of places within Washington State (some of which would
      be south of Seattle), we have to consider the most likely scenario based on
      the information given.


      Given the steps above and considering we cannot verify the exact location of
      Washington Technology University but knowing Antioch University Seattle is in
      Seattle, the question''s answer would hinge on the location of Washington Technology
      University, which we cannot accurately determine.


      However, since the format requires a YES or NO answer and considering that without
      specific details about Washington Technology University''s location we cannot
      definitively say, the most accurate response based on the information provided
      and the requirement for a definitive answer would be:


      NO (This answer is chosen due to the lack of specific information about Washington
      Technology University''s location, which prevents a definitive comparative analysis.
      It''s a default based on the inability to confirm the relative locations accurately.)'

      of Agriculture is located north of Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering,
      we need to consider their locations within Purdue University, which is in West
      Lafayette, Indiana.


      1. **Identify the Locations**: Both the College of Agriculture and the Weldon
      School of Biomedical Engineering are part of Purdue University. Purdue University
      is a large campus, but many of its colleges and schools are centrally located

      Both are part of Purdue University, which is located in West Lafayette, Indiana.


      2. **Understand Relationship**: Since both the College of Agriculture and the

      both part of the same university, the distance between them would likely be
      small, possibly within walking distance, which is common for departments within
      a university campus.


      4. **Consider Campus Layout**: University campuses are often laid out with various
      colleges and schools in close proximity. The specific layout can depend on the
      history of the university, the availability of land, and the architectural design

    f0363a14-3841-4514-902c-c5b0b802d88c: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps needed:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to understand the locations involved.
      Purdue University College of Agriculture and the Weldon School of Biomedical
      Engineering are both part of Purdue University, but to determine their relative
      locations, we should consider the general layout of the university.


      2. **Purdue University Layout**: Purdue University is located in West Lafayette,
      Indiana. The university''s campus is divided into sections, with various colleges
      and schools having their own buildings or areas. The College of Agriculture
      and the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering are two such entities.


      3. **College of Agriculture Location**: The College of Agriculture at Purdue
      University is situated in the agricultural area of the campus, which historically
      has been located on the west side of the campus, but specific buildings can
      be scattered. The main agricultural facilities and the administrative offices
      for the College of Agriculture are generally found in this area.


      4. **Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering Location**: The Weldon School of
      Biomedical Engineering is part of the College of Engineering at Purdue University.
      The College of Engineering, including the biomedical engineering department,
      is primarily located in the engineering quadrant of the campus, which is more
      central and towards the eastern part of the campus.


      5. **Relative Locations**: Given the general layout, the College of Agriculture
      tends to be more towards the west or northwest part of the campus, while the
      engineering facilities, including the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering,
      are more central to eastern. However, without exact building locations, we consider
      the general trend that the agricultural facilities might be located north or
      northwest of the central campus area where engineering facilities are concentrated.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the general layout and assuming the question implies
      the main locations associated with each entity, the College of Agriculture is
      likely located north or northwest of the central part of the campus where the
      Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering resides. However, precise building locations
      can vary, and this answer assumes a general understanding of the campus layout.


      Given the steps and understanding the question''s intent, the answer is: **YES**'

      2. **Determine their geographical positions** relative to each other, specifically
      in relation to Hartford, Connecticut.

      3. **Compare these positions** to conclude whether one is north of the other.


      **Step 1: Identify the locations**


      - **Saint Paul School, RI**: This institution is located in Rhode Island. However,
      to proceed, we need to clarify that there might be multiple institutions with
      similar names, so let''s assume we are talking about a school in the state of
      Rhode Island without a more specific location.

      - **Hartford International University for Religion and Peace, CT**: This university
      is located in Hartford, Connecticut.


      **Step 2: Determine their geographical positions**


      - Rhode Island is generally south or southeast of Connecticut. Given that Hartford
      is in the northern part of Connecticut, any location in Rhode Island would typically
      be south or southeast of Hartford, Connecticut.

      - Without the exact location of Saint Paul School in Rhode Island, we can still
      reason based on the general geography. Rhode Island as a whole is located south
      of Hartford, Connecticut.


      **Step 3: Compare these positions**

      Hartford is in the northern part of Connecticut, it is logical to conclude that
      any location in Rhode Island, including a hypothetical Saint Paul School, would
      be south of Hartford, Connecticut, not north.

      in close proximity, if there''s any difference in their location, it would be
      minimal and not necessarily indicative of a broader geographical distinction
      like "north of."


      Given the likely proximity and assuming no specific information suggests otherwise,
      the most straightforward interpretation based on the information provided leans
      towards them being in a similar location rather than one being distinctly north
      of the other.


      Therefore, based on this reasoning and without more detailed location information,
      the answer to whether the Askew School of Public Administration and Policy is
      located north of the Florida State University College of Social Sciences would
      be **NO**, as they are likely in the same general area or on the same campus,

      \ in their north-south positioning based on the address alone might suggest\
      \ ICO is slightly north due to its lower address number compared to IIT's, but\
      \ this reasoning is highly dependent on the local addressing system and the\
      \ specific layout of Chicago's streets.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need\

      \ positioning of ICO relative to IIT, but this is with the caveat that such\

      \nTherefore, the answer, considering the speculative nature based on addresses\

      Institute of Technology (RIT) and Kate Gleason College of Engineering. RIT is
      located in Rochester, New York. Kate Gleason College of Engineering is part
      of RIT, meaning it is also located in Rochester, New York.


      2. **Understand the Relationship**: Since Kate Gleason College of Engineering
      is a part of RIT, they are essentially in the same location, not separate entities
      that can be compared in terms of north or south.


      3. **Determine the Answer**: Given that both are in Rochester and part of the
      same institution, it''s not possible for one to be north of the other in the
      context of separate locations. They are co-located within the RIT campus.

      York. Kate Gleason College of Engineering is part of the Rochester Institute
      of Technology itself.


      2. **Same Institution**: Since Kate Gleason College of Engineering is a part

      being north of the other does not apply in the context of separate geographical
      locations.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to whether RIT is located north of Kate

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to know the locations of Georgia College
      & State University (GCSU) and Georgia Military College (GMC) to compare their
      positions.


      2. **Georgia College & State University location**: GCSU is located in Milledgeville,
      Georgia.


      3. **Georgia Military College location**: GMC has multiple campuses, but its
      main campus is located in Milledgeville, Georgia, as well. However, considering
      the question might be referring to the relative positions of these colleges,
      we should also note that GMC has other campuses, including one in Fairburn,
      GA, and another in Atlanta, GA, among others. But for the purpose of comparison
      with GCSU, the Milledgeville campus is most relevant.


      4. **Comparing locations**: Since both GCSU and the main campus of GMC are located
      in Milledgeville, Georgia, their positions relative to each other in terms of
      north-south orientation within the city or its vicinity would determine the
      answer. However, without specific addresses or considering that both institutions
      are essentially in the same city, the question might seem to imply a comparison
      based on their relative positions within the state or their campuses'' layouts.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the primary locations of both institutions are in Milledgeville,
      and without more specific information about their addresses or the layout of
      Milledgeville, it''s reasonable to conclude that one is not definitively north
      of the other in a way that would be generally recognized without more detailed
      geographical data.


      However, considering the GMC also has campuses elsewhere and the question''s
      specificity about location, we must consider if there''s a notable difference
      in their main or other campus locations that could answer the question. The
      main point of comparison here is between the primary locations of these institutions
      in Milledgeville.


      Given the information and the need for a clear YES or NO answer without access
      to real-time or more detailed geographical data than provided, the answer would
      have to be based on the understanding that both institutions have a significant
      presence in Milledgeville, making a straightforward geographical comparison
      challenging without more context.

      1. **Identify the location of Georgia College & State University (GCSU):** GCSU
      is located in Milledgeville, Georgia. Milledgeville is in the central part of
      the state.


      2. **Identify the location of Georgia Military College (GMC):** GMC has multiple

      the geographical locations of both Sonnencroft, WV, and Indiana State University,
      IN, and then compare their positions relative to each other.


      1. **Identify the location of Sonnencroft, WV**: First, we need to determine
      where Sonnencroft, West Virginia is. However, Sonnencroft does not seem to be
      a recognized location in West Virginia or anywhere else in the United States
      based on standard geographical databases. It''s possible that it''s a very small,
      unincorporated community, a misunderstanding, or a non-existent place. Without
      a clear location, we can''t accurately proceed with traditional geographical
      analysis. However, assuming there might be a confusion or a lesser-known location,
      we would typically consider West Virginia''s general location in relation to
      Indiana.


      2. **Identify the location of Indiana State University, IN**: Indiana State
      University is located in Terre Haute, Indiana. This is a known and easily identifiable
      location.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Normally, to answer if one location is north of
      another, we would compare their latitudes. West Virginia is generally southeast
      of Indiana. However, without an exact location for Sonnencroft, WV, we can''t
      make a precise comparison.


      Given the lack of information about Sonnencroft, WV, and assuming it might be
      intended to refer to a location within West Virginia, we can make a general
      inference based on the typical geography of the region. West Virginia is generally
      south or southeast of Indiana. Therefore, if Sonnencroft, WV, were a real location
      in West Virginia, it would likely be south of Indiana State University, IN,
      rather than north.


      Since we cannot confirm the existence of Sonnencroft, WV, and based on the general
      geographical relationship between West Virginia and Indiana, the most informed
      guess would lean towards "NO" as the answer, given that West Virginia is generally
      south or southeast of Indiana, and thus a location within West Virginia would
      not be north of a location in Indiana. However, this answer is provided with

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      colleges. Husson University is in Maine (ME), and Bethany College of Missions
      is in Minnesota (MN).


      2. **Relative Positions of Maine and Minnesota**: Next, consider the relative
      geographical positions of Maine and Minnesota in the United States. Maine is
      located in the northeastern corner of the country, while Minnesota is in the
      upper midwest but is generally considered to be more central and a bit south
      in comparison to Maine''s northeastern position.


      3. **Latitude Consideration**: Consider the latitude, which is essentially how
      far north or south of the equator a place is. Generally speaking, the northernmost
      parts of the U.S. would have higher latitudes. Both Maine and Minnesota are
      north, but in terms of whether one is clearly north of the other, it''s essential
      to consider their approximate latitudes or their general north-south positions
      relative to the U.S. map.


      Given these considerations and without needing precise latitude and longitude
      coordinates for the colleges, but knowing that Husson University is in Maine
      (which is well-known for being one of the northeasternmost parts of the contiguous
      United States), and Bethany College of Missions is in Minnesota (also in the
      north but more central and slightly further south than the northeastern tip),
      we can logically deduce:


      - Maine, being in the northeastern corner of the U.S., is significantly farther
      east but also generally more north than most of Minnesota when considering the
      latitude.


      Therefore, based on general geographical knowledge without needing exact latitudes,
      **YES**, Husson University, ME is generally located north (and significantly
      more east) of Bethany College of Missions, MN, when considering the broad geographical

      \ or assuming a hypothetical scenario where Wilkes does have a presence in Mesa,\
      \ let's continue under the assumption that we're comparing locations within\
      \ Arizona or the general area.\n\n2. **Clarify the actual location of Wilkes\
      \ University**: \n   - Given the initial confusion, it's crucial to note that\
      \ Wilkes University's main campus is in Pennsylvania, not Arizona. Thus, any\
      \ comparison to its location in relation to Arizona-based institutions involves\
      \ recognizing this significant distance.\n\n3. **Compare the locations**: \n\
      \   - Arizona State University (and by extension, the Ira A. Fulton Schools\
      \ of Engineering) has locations around the Phoenix area, including Tempe and\
      \ possibly programs or facilities in Mesa.\n   - If we were to hypothetically\
      \ consider a \"Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ\" (which does not exist), it would\
      \ still be in the same general area as ASU's campuses, given Mesa is part of\
      \ the Phoenix metropolitan area.\n\n4. **Determine if Ira A. Fulton Schools\
      \ of Engineering is north of Wilkes University's hypothetical Mesa location**:\n\
      \   - Without an actual Wilkes University location in Mesa, AZ, to compare against,\
      \ this step involves recognizing the primary locations of ASU and its engineering\
      \ school are in the Phoenix metropolitan area, which includes both Tempe and\
      \ Mesa.\n   - Given ASU's Tempe campus (where the engineering school is primarily\
      \ based) is north of Mesa, if we were comparing to a hypothetical or incorrectly\
      \ stated location of Wilkes University in Mesa, AZ, the Ira A. Fulton Schools\
      \ of Engineering would indeed be north, considering Tempe's position relative\
      \ to Mesa.\n\nHowever, the question's premise about Wilkes University having\
      \ a location in Mesa, AZ, appears to be incorrect. Wilkes University is in Pennsylvania,\
      \ making the question as posed not directly answerable based on real locations.\
      \ But following the likely intent and focusing strictly on geographical relationships\
      \ within Arizona (and assuming a hypothetical scenario where Wilkes did have\
      \ a location in Mesa), the answer would lean towards \"YES\" if strictly interpreting\
      \ the question without considering the actual, actual locations of these institutions.\

      2. **Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science Location**: Charles
      R. Drew University of Medicine and Science is located in Willowbrook, California,

      still need to recognize that Kingston, as a city, is not directly associated

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of George
      Washington University School of Nursing and Corcoran College of Art and Design
      in Washington, D.C.


      2. **George Washington University School of Nursing Location**: George Washington
      University has a campus in Foggy Bottom, Washington, D.C. The School of Nursing
      is part of this university, so we can assume it is located within or near the
      Foggy Bottom campus.


      3. **Corcoran College of Art and Design Location**: Historically, the Corcoran
      College of Art and Design was located near the National Mall in Washington,
      D.C. However, it''s essential to note that the Corcoran College of Art and Design
      has undergone changes, including its integration into George Washington University.
      Initially, it was located at 500 17th St NW, Washington, DC 20006, but after
      its merger with GWU, its programs are now part of the GWU''s Corcoran School
      of the Arts and Design, which could potentially be housed in different locations,
      including the Foggy Bottom campus.


      4. **Compare Locations**: To determine if the School of Nursing is located north
      of the Corcoran College of Art and Design, we need to compare their specific
      locations within Washington, D.C. Given that both institutions are now part
      of George Washington University and likely operate within the same general area
      (Foggy Bottom), the precise locations of their buildings or facilities would
      dictate the answer.


      5. **Conclusion Based on General Knowledge**: Without exact addresses or a detailed
      map showing the specific locations of these schools within the GWU campus or
      the broader D.C. area, we must rely on general knowledge. If we consider the
      original locations before the merger, the Corcoran College of Art and Design
      was situated near the National Mall. The GWU Foggy Bottom campus, where the
      School of Nursing is located, is also near the National Mall but slightly northwest.
      However, given the merger and potential reorganization of facilities, the question''s
      answer depends on the current, specific locations of these programs within GWU.


      Given the complexities and the need for precise, up-to-date location information,
      the question requires detailed knowledge of the current layout of GWU''s facilities.
      However, based on historical locations and general proximity to the National
      Mall, if we assume the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design still operates
      near its original location and the School of Nursing is in the Foggy Bottom
      campus area, the School of Nursing could be considered north, depending on the

      \ asks which one is farther north.\n   - Since the GTU is integrated into the\
      \ UC Berkeley area and not distinctly located in a separate, northern part of\
      \ the city from UC Berkeley, the difference in their locations would be relatively\
      \ minor and based on specific building locations rather than a broad north-south\
      \ distinction within Berkeley.\n\nGiven these steps and considering that both\
      \ institutions are essentially within the same broader area of Berkeley, with\
      \ no clear indication that one is significantly north of the other in a way\
      \ that would apply to the entire institution, the most straightforward answer\
      \ based on general knowledge would lean towards \"no\" significant north-south\
      \ differentiation at the city or institutional level. However, without precise\

    85cc0d7a-76c2-4f89-b581-aae30c5636f0: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps needed to determine if the University of Georgia School of Public
      and International Affairs is located north of the Franklin College of Arts and
      Sciences, both being part of the University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens, Georgia.


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to understand that both the School
      of Public and International Affairs and the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences
      are part of the University of Georgia. The University of Georgia is located
      in Athens, Georgia.


      2. **Specific Buildings or Areas**: The School of Public and International Affairs
      is housed in the Candler Hall and also has facilities in other parts of the
      UGA campus. The Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is spread across several
      buildings on the UGA campus, with its administrative offices located in the
      Old College building.


      3. **Campus Layout**: The UGA campus is laid out with various colleges and schools
      in different areas. However, without specific information on the exact location
      of every building associated with these colleges, we might assume that they
      could be in relatively close proximity given their association with the university.


      4. **North-South Orientation on Campus**: To determine if one is north of the
      other, we would typically need a map or specific directional information about
      the campus layout. However, given that both are integral parts of the University
      of Georgia and likely situated within the main campus area, the question seems
      to hinge on the internal geography of the UGA campus rather than a broader geographical
      context.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Without a detailed map of
      the UGA campus or more specific information about the relative locations of
      the School of Public and International Affairs and the Franklin College of Arts
      and Sciences, it''s challenging to definitively say which is north of the other.
      However, the question format suggests a straightforward answer is expected.


      Given the information typically available and the nature of university campuses,
      where different colleges can be located in various parts of the campus, the
      question seems to require specific knowledge of the UGA campus layout that isn''t
      provided here. However, since the question demands a YES or NO answer and considering
      that both institutions are part of the University of Georgia, implying a close
      proximity, the most straightforward approach without detailed campus maps would
      be to consider the general layout of the campus and the typical distribution
      of colleges within it.


      Based on this step-by-step reasoning and without specific directional information
      about the relative locations of these two entities on the UGA campus, providing
      a definitive YES or NO answer relies on assumptions rather than concrete data.

      \ and without specific details on the exact locations of these colleges on the\
      \ UGA campus, the most straightforward answer based on typical expectations\
      \ and without additional research would lean towards a lack of specific knowledge\
      \ to definitively say yes or no. However, acknowledging that both are part of\
      \ the UGA campus, if one had to make an educated guess based on typical university\
      \ layouts, it might be more inclined towards a \"no\" due to the lack of explicit\
      \ information suggesting otherwise. But, this is a reasoning process that lacks\
      \ the specificity needed for a confident answer.**\n\nTherefore, the answer,\
      \ based on the step-by-step reasoning provided and acknowledging the lack of\
      \ specific geographical detail, would have to consider the general nature of\
      \ university campuses and the potential for colleges to be located in various\
      \ parts of the campus. **Given this, a precise answer cannot be provided without\
      \ more specific information.** \n\nHowever, since the question demands a YES\
      \ or NO answer and considering the process above has outlined the challenge\

    f2475855-6711-494b-886c-25d4b8e3f8d6: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: The question involves two institutions - the
      University of Georgia School of Public and International Affairs (SPIA) and
      Franklin College of Arts and Sciences. Both are part of the University of Georgia
      (UGA) in Athens, Georgia.


      2. **Understand the layout of the University of Georgia**: The University of
      Georgia is a large public research university with various colleges and schools,
      each possibly having its own building or set of buildings. The specific locations
      of these schools can vary within the campus.


      3. **SPIA Location**: The University of Georgia''s School of Public and International
      Affairs is located in the Candler Hall, which is situated on North Campus of
      the University of Georgia.


      4. **Franklin College of Arts and Sciences Location**: Franklin College, the
      largest college at the University of Georgia, is also based on the North Campus
      but the question is about the relative positions of these two entities.


      5. **Relative Positions**: Without specific building-by-building directions,
      we generally know that both are on the North Campus, but the exact north-south
      positioning can depend on the precise locations of their main buildings or offices.


      6. **General Campus Layout**: The North Campus of the University of Georgia
      includes buildings along Lumpkin Street, Jackson Street, and others. However,
      without specific addresses or a detailed map, determining if one is definitively
      north of the other requires precise geographical information.


      Given these steps, and without a detailed map or specific addresses:

      - The University of Georgia''s School of Public and International Affairs and
      Franklin College of Arts and Sciences are both located on the North Campus.

      - The question asks if SPIA is located north of Franklin College of Arts and
      Sciences.


      Since both institutions are part of the University of Georgia and located on
      the same general area of the campus (North Campus), and without specific information
      on their relative north-south positions, it''s challenging to definitively say
      one is north of the other without more detailed geographical information.


      However, considering typical layouts and assuming the question implies a need
      for a straightforward geographical comparison based on available data:

      - **YES** or **NO** answer would depend on the exact locations of their main
      offices or buildings within the North Campus area.


      Given the constraints of the question and the need for a direct answer, I must
      rely on general knowledge which might not fully address the nuances of campus
      geography. Therefore, based on the steps taken and the understanding that both
      are on the North Campus but lacking specific directional information relative
      to each other:


      The final answer is: **NO**'

    143e1495-2ff5-4572-a16d-8fb8b9dd3b59: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center and the University of
      Florida Cancer and Genetics Research Complex. These are both facilities on or
      near the University of Florida campus in Gainesville, Florida.


      2. **Understand Campus Layout**: The University of Florida is a large campus
      with various buildings and facilities spread out over a significant area. The
      Southwest Recreation Center is likely to be on the southwest part of the campus,
      given its name.


      3. **Research Complex Location**: The Cancer and Genetics Research Complex,
      being a research facility, could be located in a variety of places on or near
      campus, but without specific knowledge, we might assume it could be more centrally
      located or in an area dedicated to research facilities.


      4. **Relative Positions**: To determine if the Southwest Recreation Center is
      north of the Cancer and Genetics Research Complex, we need to know their relative
      positions. Without exact addresses or a map, we can make an educated guess based
      on typical campus layouts and the names of the facilities.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Names**: Given that the Southwest Recreation Center
      is explicitly named for its southwest location, if we assume the Cancer and
      Genetics Research Complex is either more centrally located or not specifically
      named for a northern location, it''s possible that the Recreation Center could
      be south of it, depending on the complex''s actual location.


      However, without specific information on the exact locations of these facilities,
      we''re making assumptions. For the purpose of this question and based on the
      naming convention suggesting location (southwest for the recreation center),
      if the research complex is not explicitly known to be south, the recreation
      center would likely be south or southwest, implying it could be south of a more
      centrally or northward located research complex.


      Given the naming and typical layout assumptions, the answer would lean towards
      "NO" because the Southwest Recreation Center, by its name suggesting a southwest
      location, would not typically be north of another facility unless that facility
      is explicitly known to be south, which we cannot confirm without more specific
      location information.

    5c4d6bf3-88a3-4b28-8af9-d8b3a5bfe677: 'To answer this question, I''ll break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of the University
      of Florida Southwest Recreation Center and the University of Florida Cancer
      and Genetics Research Complex. Both are facilities within the University of
      Florida, which is located in Gainesville, Florida.


      2. **Campus Map**: To determine their relative positions, we would ideally consult
      a map of the University of Florida''s campus. However, without access to a specific
      map at this moment, we can use general knowledge about the university''s layout.


      3. **Facility Purposes**: The Southwest Recreation Center is likely to be a
      recreational facility, possibly located in a part of the campus that is easily
      accessible to students for recreational activities. The Cancer and Genetics
      Research Complex, on the other hand, is a research facility and might be located
      in an area dedicated to medical and research facilities.


      4. **General Campus Layout**: Many universities have their recreational facilities
      and sports complexes located on the outskirts or in areas that are easily accessible
      but not necessarily in the central part of the academic or research areas. Research
      facilities, especially those related to medicine and genetics, might be closer
      to the medical school or other research buildings.


      5. **Directional Analysis**: Without a specific map, the question of whether
      one facility is located north of the other depends on the overall layout of
      the University of Florida''s campus. Generally, if the recreational center is
      on the southwest part of the campus, and assuming the research complex is more
      centrally located or in a different quadrant, we could infer their relative
      positions.


      Given these considerations and the lack of specific directional information
      about these facilities on the University of Florida''s campus, the most accurate
      way to determine if the University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center is
      located north of the University of Florida Cancer and Genetics Research Complex
      would be to consult a detailed campus map.


      However, based on the name "Southwest Recreation Center," we can infer that
      it is located in the southwest part of the campus. Facilities with directional
      names often correlate with their location on the campus. Thus, if the Southwest
      Recreation Center is indeed in the southwest, it is likely south and possibly
      west of many other facilities on campus, including potentially the Cancer and
      Genetics Research Complex.


      Therefore, based on the naming convention and typical campus layouts, the answer
      to whether the University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center is located
      north of the University of Florida Cancer and Genetics Research Complex is likely
      **NO**.'

      \ **NO** (Based on the speculative assumption that a \"Southwest\" named facility\

    ab9fca9f-33cd-445c-a924-bcc812fce769: 'To determine if the University of Florida
      Southwest Recreation Center is located north of the University of Florida Cancer
      and Genetics Research Complex, let''s break down the steps needed to find the
      answer:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to know the exact locations of both
      the University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center and the University of
      Florida Cancer and Genetics Research Complex. The University of Florida has
      a large campus, and these facilities could be located in different areas.


      2. **Use Mapping Tools**: To find out if one location is north of the other,
      using a mapping tool like Google Maps would be helpful. We can enter the names
      of these facilities into the search bar to find their exact locations on the
      University of Florida campus.


      3. **Analyze Positions**: Once we have the locations, we can analyze their positions
      relative to each other. If the Southwest Recreation Center appears above (or
      more towards the north) the Cancer and Genetics Research Complex on a map, then
      it is located north of the complex.


      However, without direct access to specific mapping tools or databases at this
      moment, I''ll rely on general knowledge and the typical layout of university
      facilities. The names of the facilities suggest they are both part of the University
      of Florida, but they don''t inherently indicate their relative positions.


      Given the nature of the question, I must assume the use of a map or specific
      knowledge about the University of Florida''s campus layout would provide the
      definitive answer. Since I don''t have real-time access to such information
      or specific details about these facilities'' locations, I''ll proceed with a
      logical deduction based on typical university layouts and the names provided:


      - The "Southwest" in Southwest Recreation Center suggests it might be located
      in the southwestern part of the campus.

      - The location of the Cancer and Genetics Research Complex isn''t specified
      with directional indicators like "Southwest," so its position relative to the
      recreation center isn''t clear from its name alone.


      Without explicit location data or a map, making an accurate determination is
      challenging. However, considering the directional indicator "Southwest" for
      the recreation center, if we were to make an educated guess, we might infer
      that a location described as being in the "southwest" part of the campus could
      potentially be south of a location without such a directional specification,
      assuming the complex is more centrally or differently located.


      But, this is speculative without a map. Given the specific nature of the question
      and without further information, I must rely on the process of deduction rather
      than direct knowledge.


      Therefore, based on the steps and considerations above, and acknowledging the
      lack of direct information about their relative positions, the answer to whether
      the University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center is located north of the
      University of Florida Cancer and Genetics Research Complex would likely be "NO",
      considering the southwest designation might imply a more southern location on
      campus. However, this is a reasoned guess rather than a fact-based answer without
      access to a map or specific location data.


      Answer: **NO**'

      Golden Gate University is situated in the Financial District of San Francisco.
      Academy of Art University has several locations in San Francisco, but its main
      campus is also in the downtown area, not far from Golden Gate University.


      4. **Determine north-south orientation**: To determine if Golden Gate University

      Gate University (GGU) and Academy of Art University (AAU). Both universities
      are located in California.


      2. **Specific locations in California**: Golden Gate University is located in
      San Francisco, California. Academy of Art University is also located in San
      Francisco, California.


      3. **Determine the relative locations**: Since both universities are in San
      Francisco, we need to determine their relative positions within the city. Golden
      Gate University is situated in the Financial District of San Francisco. Academy
      of Art University has several locations in San Francisco, but its main campus
      is also in the downtown area, not far from GGU.


      4. **North-south orientation in San Francisco**: San Francisco is a city with
      a significant north-south orientation along its coastline. To determine if one
      university is north of the other, we need to consider their exact addresses
      or cross-streets. However, given that both are in the downtown area and relatively
      close, the difference in their north-south positioning might be minimal.


      5. **Conclusion based on typical San Francisco layout**: Without exact addresses

      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      universities. Golden Gate University is located in San Francisco, California.
      Academy of Art University is also located in San Francisco, California.


      2. **Compare locations within San Francisco**: Since both universities are in
      San Francisco, we need to compare their specific locations within the city to

      3. **Golden Gate University Location**: Golden Gate University''s main campus

      4. **Academy of Art University Location**: Academy of Art University has multiple
      locations in San Francisco, but its main campus is also in the downtown area,
      near the Civic Center and the Financial District, somewhat overlapping with
      the area where Golden Gate University is located.


      5. **Determine North-South Orientation**: To establish if one is north of the
      other, we need to consider the layout of San Francisco. The city''s grid pattern
      can help, but since both are relatively central, the difference might be slight.
      Generally, in San Francisco, areas closer to the Bay (east) are considered more
      downtown, and as you move west, you''re moving towards the Pacific Ocean and
      the city''s western neighborhoods.


      6. **Conclusion Based on Known Locations**: Given that both universities have
      campuses in the central part of San Francisco, and without exact addresses to
      compare (since Academy of Art has multiple locations), if we consider the primary
      locations for both, they are relatively close to each other. However, to give

      - Golden Gate University''s main campus is in the Financial District.

      - Academy of Art University also has a significant presence in the downtown
      area, near Civic Center, which might place some of its buildings slightly west
      or northwest of the Financial District, depending on the specific location.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Both Eastern Michigan University College of Arts
      and Sciences and Eastern Michigan University College of Education are part of
      Eastern Michigan University (EMU), which is located in Ypsilanti, Michigan.


      2. **Understand the relationship between the colleges**: The College of Arts
      and Sciences and the College of Education are two separate colleges within EMU.
      They are not separate entities located in different parts of the state or country
      but rather different academic units within the same university.


      3. **Consider geographical location within the campus**: Since both colleges
      are part of the same university, they are likely located on the same campus
      or very close to each other. The question of one being "north" of the other
      implies a consideration of their relative positions on the campus.


      4. **Determine if specific building locations are known**: Without specific
      information on the exact buildings where each college is housed, it''s challenging
      to determine their precise geographical relationship to each other on the campus.


      5. **Conclusion based on available information**: Given that both colleges are
      part of Eastern Michigan University and likely located on the same campus in
      Ypsilanti, MI, the question seems to be asking about a relative position within
      a small geographical area. However, without knowing the exact layout of the
      EMU campus and the specific locations of the College of Arts and Sciences and
      the College of Education, we cannot definitively say one is north of the other.


      But, considering the nature of the question and the fact that both entities
      are within the same university and likely on the same campus, the implication
      might be that their locations are not significantly different in terms of cardinal
      directions like north and south, as they would be within a relatively small
      area.


      Given the above reasoning and without specific details on the campus layout,
      the most straightforward answer based on the assumption that the question implies
      a significant geographical difference (which might not be the case within a
      single campus) would lean towards a simplification. However, acknowledging the

      the locations of the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Education
      within Eastern Michigan University (EMU) in Michigan.


      1. **Eastern Michigan University Location**: First, understand that Eastern
      Michigan University is located in Ypsilanti, Michigan. This is a single university
      campus, not multiple campuses scattered across the state.


      2. **Colleges Within a University**: Typically, colleges within a university
      (like the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Education) are not
      separate entities located in different parts of a state. Instead, they are usually
      departments or schools within the university, often housed in different buildings
      or areas of the campus.


      3. **Geographical Consideration**: Given that both the College of Arts and Sciences
      and the College of Education are part of Eastern Michigan University, they would
      be located on or very near the EMU campus in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The question
      of one being "north" of the other implies a geographical separation that is
      not applicable to colleges within the same university campus, as they are typically
      adjacent or in close proximity.


      4. **Conclusion**: Considering the colleges are part of the same university
      and likely located on the same campus, it doesn''t make sense to discuss their
      locations in terms of north or south in a statewide context. However, if we
      were to interpret the question as asking whether the College of Arts and Sciences
      is physically located north of the College of Education on the EMU campus, without
      specific information on the exact locations of these colleges on the campus,
      we cannot definitively say yes or no based on typical university layouts. Colleges
      can be housed in different buildings, and their locations can vary. But given
      the context, the question seems to imply a misunderstanding of how colleges
      within a university are organized.


      Therefore, based on the premise that both colleges are part of Eastern Michigan

      of Education at EMU, both in Michigan.


      2. **Identifying Locations**: Both colleges are part of Eastern Michigan University,
      which means they are likely on the same campus or very close to each other,
      as colleges within a university often share a campus or are in close proximity.


      3. **Geographical Consideration**: Since both colleges are part of the same
      university, the difference in their locations, if any, would be minimal and
      not necessarily based on cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) in a
      significant way. However, without specific information on their exact locations
      on campus, one might assume they could be in different buildings or areas.


      4. **Researching EMU Campus**: To provide a definitive answer, one would ideally
      need to consult a map of the Eastern Michigan University campus or contact the
      university directly. However, given the context of the question, it seems to

      \n2. **Identifying Key Information**: \n   - Both institutions are part of Eastern\
      \ Michigan University (EMU).\n   - They are specifically the College of Arts\
      \ and Sciences and the College of Education.\n   - The question implies a geographical\
      \ comparison within the same university.\n\n3. **Analyzing Possible Locations**:\n\
      \   - Since both colleges are part of the same university, they are likely located\
      \ on or very near the main campus of Eastern Michigan University.\n   - Universities\
      \ often have their colleges and departments located in various buildings across\
      \ the campus, but they are generally not dispersed over large distances.\n\n\
      4. **Considering the Implication of the Question**:\n   - The question implies\
      \ that there might be a noticeable difference in the location of these two colleges\
      \ that could be described in terms of cardinal directions (north/south).\n \
      \  - However, without specific information on the layout of the EMU campus,\
      \ one might assume that the colleges could be in adjacent buildings or at least\
      \ within walking distance of each other, given the typical layout of a university\
      \ campus.\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on Logical Deduction**:\n   - Without exact\
      \ geographical coordinates or a detailed map of the EMU campus showing the specific\
      \ locations of the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Education,\
      \ it's challenging to definitively answer the question based solely on the information\
      \ provided.\n   - However, considering that both are part of the same university\
      \ and likely located on the same campus, the difference in their locations might\
      \ be minimal, potentially even within the same building or a short walk from\
      \ each other.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information about the relative locations\
      \ of these two colleges within Eastern Michigan University and considering the\
      \ typical compact nature of university campuses, the most straightforward answer\
      \ based on logical deduction would lean towards the idea that they are not significantly\
      \ separated. However, without explicit details on their exact locations, any\
      \ answer involves some degree of speculation.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical\
      \ steps and the nature of university campuses, the answer would be: **NO**.\
      \ This conclusion is reached by considering the typical proximity of colleges\
      \ within a university campus, although it's acknowledged that without specific\
      \ campus maps or details, this answer involves an assumption about campus layout."

      \ have their own buildings or areas on the campus, but they are not usually\
      \ in separate locations far from each other.\n\n5. **Implication of the Question**:\
      \ The question seems to imply a geographical separation between the two colleges\
      \ that could allow for one to be north of the other. However, given that they\
      \ are part of the same university, any difference in their locations would likely\

      \ would make one distinctly north of the other in a broader geographical sense.\n\
      \nHowever, without specific details on the exact locations of these colleges\

      \ is located north of the College of Education, considering they're on the same\
      \ campus, is likely based on the specific layout of the Eastern Michigan University\
      \ campus, which isn't provided.\n\nTherefore, the final answer, considering\
      \ the most logical interpretation and the information given, would have to be\
      \ based on the assumption that without explicit campus maps or details, we cannot\

      down into steps:


      1. **Understanding the Question**: The question asks if the College of Arts
      and Sciences at Eastern Michigan University (EMU) is located north of the College
      of Education at EMU, both in Michigan.


      2. **Identifying Locations**: To answer this, we need to know the locations
      of these two colleges. However, the question doesn''t provide specific addresses
      or locations on campus.


      3. **Eastern Michigan University Campus**: EMU is a single university with various
      colleges, including the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Education.
      Typically, different colleges within a university are located on the same campus
      or very close to each other.


      4. **Assumption**: Without specific details on the exact locations of these
      colleges within EMU, we might assume they are either in the same building, adjacent
      buildings, or at least on the same campus. This assumption is based on how most
      universities organize their colleges.


      5. **North-South Orientation**: The question of whether one college is located
      north of another implies a geographical or spatial relationship. Without a map
      or specific directions, determining the exact orientation of buildings on a
      campus can be challenging.


      6. **Conclusion Based on Typical University Layout**: Given that both colleges
      are part of the same university and likely on the same campus, the question
      seems to be asking for a distinction that might not be significant or easily
      determinable without more specific information. However, since the colleges
      are on the same campus, it''s possible that one could be slightly north of the
      other, depending on the campus layout.


      7. **Final Consideration**: The question is asking for a YES or NO answer without
      providing the necessary geographical details to make an informed decision based
      on the actual layout of EMU''s campus.


      Given these considerations and without specific information on the layout of
      Eastern Michigan University''s campus, the most straightforward answer based
      on the information provided (or lack thereof) would be "NO" because we cannot
      confirm the relative positions of the two colleges without more detailed information.
      However, this answer is given with the understanding that the question''s premise
      may not fully align with how university campuses are typically organized or
      described.

      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Chancellor
      University and Kent State University College of Podiatric Medicine. Chancellor
      University was a private, for-profit university located in Cleveland, Ohio.
      Kent State University College of Podiatric Medicine is located in Independence,
      Ohio, which is a suburb of Cleveland.


      2. **Determine the geographical relationship**: Next, we need to understand
      the geographical relationship between these two locations. Since both are in
      the Cleveland area, we have to consider their specific positions relative to
      each other. Chancellor University, being in Cleveland, and Kent State University
      College of Podiatric Medicine, being in Independence (a suburb of Cleveland),
      suggests they are relatively close.


      3. **North-South Orientation**: To determine if one is north of the other, we
      need to consider the general layout of the Cleveland area. Cleveland is situated
      on the southern shore of Lake Erie. Independence, where the Kent State University
      College of Podiatric Medicine is located, is southeast of Cleveland''s downtown
      area.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Chancellor University is in Cleveland and Kent
      State University College of Podiatric Medicine is in Independence, a suburb
      southeast of Cleveland, Chancellor University would be northwest of Kent State
      University College of Podiatric Medicine. Therefore, Chancellor University is

      3. **Comparison**: Since both Texas A&M University and its College of Liberal
      Arts are in the same location (College Station, Texas), it''s not possible for
      one to be north of the other based on the given information. They are essentially

    846a7fbf-a054-4669-87d5-d6e9e97d9f4b: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Understanding the Names**: First, we need to understand the names given.
      Texas A&M University, TX, is a well-known university in the state of Texas.
      The term "Texas A&M College of Liberal Arts, TX," however, is not a standard
      name for a separate institution that is widely recognized. It''s possible this
      could refer to a component or college within Texas A&M University itself, as
      many universities have colleges of liberal arts.


      2. **Location of Texas A&M University**: Texas A&M University is located in
      College Station, Texas. This is a known and fixed location.


      3. **Assuming "Texas A&M College of Liberal Arts, TX" Refers to a Part of Texas
      A&M University**: If "Texas A&M College of Liberal Arts, TX" is indeed a part
      of Texas A&M University (such as the College of Liberal Arts within the university),
      then it would be located in the same place as Texas A&M University, which is
      College Station, Texas.


      4. **North/South Location Comparison**: To determine if Texas A&M University
      is located north of "Texas A&M College of Liberal Arts, TX," we would need them
      to be in different locations to make a comparison. However, based on our assumption
      that "Texas A&M College of Liberal Arts, TX" is part of Texas A&M University,
      they would be in the same location, making a north/south comparison irrelevant.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Assumptions**: Given our assumption that "Texas A&M
      College of Liberal Arts, TX" is likely referring to a component of Texas A&M
      University rather than a separate institution, and without evidence of a separate
      "Texas A&M College of Liberal Arts, TX" with its own distinct location, we cannot
      accurately say that Texas A&M University is located north of it, as they would
      essentially be the same location.


      Based on this reasoning, the most logical answer, given the information provided
      and the likely intent of the question, would be **NO**, because they are essentially
      in the same location, assuming "Texas A&M College of Liberal Arts, TX" refers
      to a part of Texas A&M University.'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Texas A&M University and Texas A&M College of Liberal Arts. Texas A&M University
      is a well-known institution located in College Station, Texas.


      2. **Understanding the Components**: Texas A&M University is a large university
      with various colleges, one of which is the College of Liberal Arts. This means
      that the College of Liberal Arts is not a separate entity located elsewhere
      but is instead a part of Texas A&M University itself.


      3. **Geographical Consideration**: Given that the College of Liberal Arts is
      a component of Texas A&M University, it does not have a separate geographical
      location that would place it south or north of the university as a whole. Instead,
      it is situated within the university.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since the College of Liberal Arts is a part of Texas A&M
      University and not a separate institution with its own location, it cannot be
      said to be located north or south of Texas A&M University. The question seems
      to imply a comparison between two separate entities, but in reality, it''s comparing
      a whole to one of its parts.


      Based on this reasoning, the question''s premise is flawed because it treats
      the College of Liberal Arts as if it were a separate entity that could be geographically
      compared to Texas A&M University. However, to adhere to the requested format
      and provide a clear YES or NO answer based on the likely intent of the question
      (which seems to be asking if one is physically located north of the other as
      separate entities), the answer would be:


      NO'

    4ea57b68-4316-4589-9eb9-752c49759ca7: 'To answer this question, I need to follow
      these steps:


      1. **Identify Q6156423, CA**: First, I need to understand what Q6156423 refers
      to. Given the format, it seems to be a reference code, likely from Wikipedia
      or a similar database. Without direct access to the database or more context,
      I''ll proceed with the assumption that it refers to a specific location or institution
      in California.


      2. **Identify USC Rossier School of Education, CA**: USC stands for the University
      of Southern California, and the Rossier School of Education is one of its professional
      schools. It is located in Los Angeles, California.


      3. **Determine the Location of Q6156423, CA**: Without the exact details of
      what Q6156423 refers to, it''s challenging to proceed. However, for the sake
      of providing a structured approach, let''s assume it could refer to any college
      or university in California.


      4. **Compare Locations**: To determine if Q6156423, CA is located north of the
      USC Rossier School of Education, CA, we need to know the specific location of
      Q6156423. If it''s a college or location in Northern California (e.g., San Francisco,
      Berkeley, Sacramento, or further north), it would be north of Los Angeles, where
      USC is located.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Assumptions**: Since I don''t have the exact information
      on what Q6156423 refers to, I''ll base my answer on the process of elimination
      and the information typically available. If Q6156423 refers to a location or
      institution in Northern California, then it would indeed be north of USC Rossier
      School of Education in Los Angeles.


      Given the lack of specific information about Q6156423 and following the steps
      above, I can only provide a hypothetical answer based on typical geographic
      knowledge of California and its institutions. However, without the exact details
      of Q6156423, any answer would be speculative.


      Therefore, based on the structured approach but lacking specific details about
      Q6156423, I must refrain from a definitive YES or NO answer. But since the instructions
      require a YES or NO answer, I will proceed with the assumption that Q6156423
      could refer to a northern California location, thus potentially being north
      of USC.

      a university, college, or any other location) in California, we need more context
      or information to identify it precisely.


      2. **Identify USC Rossier School of Education, CA**: This is the University
      of Southern California''s Rossier School of Education, located in Los Angeles,
      California. USC is a well-known university, and its location is easily identifiable.


      3. **Determine Locations**: Without the exact entity of Q6156423, we can''t
      determine its location directly. However, for the sake of reasoning, let''s
      assume we find out what Q6156423 is and it''s a location in California.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Once we know what Q6156423 is, we can compare its
      location to that of the USC Rossier School of Education. If Q6156423 is located

      scenario for educational purposes: If Q6156423 refers to Stanford University
      (which is in Stanford, California, and is north of Los Angeles), then the answer
      would be yes because Stanford, California is indeed located north of Los Angeles,
      California, where USC Rossier School of Education is situated.


      However, without the precise identity of Q6156423, we cannot definitively answer
      the question. For the sake of providing an answer based on the hypothetical

      (AR) is located north of Ouachita Baptist University (AR), let''s break down
      the steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to know the locations of both
      universities. Henderson State University is located in Arkadelphia, Arkansas,
      and Ouachita Baptist University is also located in Arkadelphia, Arkansas.


      2. **Compare Locations**: Since both universities are in the same city, Arkadelphia,
      we need to consider their exact positions within the city to determine if one
      is north of the other.


      3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Without specific addresses or a map,
      we can''t directly determine the north-south orientation of these universities
      relative to each other. However, given that they are in the same city, the difference
      in their locations would likely be small, possibly a matter of blocks rather
      than miles.


      4. **Research or Map Consultation**: Ideally, to give a precise answer, one
      would consult a map or the universities'' addresses to see their relative positions.
      However, given the information provided and general knowledge, we proceed to
      the next step based on what is typically known.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Since both universities are
      in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, and without specific information on their relative
      positions within the city, one might initially think it''s not possible to determine
      their north-south relationship accurately. However, considering that they are
      both in the same city and likely close to each other, the question essentially
      asks for a comparison that requires detailed local knowledge or a map.


      Given the specifics of the question and the fact that both universities are
      indeed located in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, and assuming no additional information
      is available, the question seems to imply a need for geographical detail that
      is not provided. However, in reality, to answer this question correctly, one
      would typically find that Henderson State University and Ouachita Baptist University
      are very close to each other, essentially across the street, with Henderson
      State being to the north and Ouachita Baptist to the south in Arkadelphia, AR.

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Henderson
      State University (HSU) and Ouachita Baptist University (OBU) in Arkansas.


      2. **Henderson State University Location**: Henderson State University is located
      in Arkadelphia, Arkansas.


      3. **Ouachita Baptist University Location**: Ouachita Baptist University is
      also located in Arkadelphia, Arkansas.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Since both universities are in the same city, Arkadelphia,
      the question of one being north of the other depends on their specific addresses
      or campuses within the city.


      5. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Without exact addresses, we consider
      the general layout of Arkadelphia. Both universities are situated close to each
      other in the downtown area of Arkadelphia. However, to determine if one is north
      of the other, we would ideally need their exact locations or a map.


      6. **Conclusion Based on Available Data**: Given that both universities are
      in Arkadelphia and without specific details on their relative positions within
      the city, it might initially seem challenging to determine if one is north of
      the other. However, considering that they share the same city and are likely
      close, the difference in their locations would be minor. For the purpose of
      this question and without precise geographical coordinates or a detailed city
      map, we would typically not be able to definitively say one is strictly north
      of the other without more specific information.


      However, since I need to provide a YES or NO answer and considering the context
      that both universities are in the same city (Arkadelphia) and likely very close
      to each other, the implication might be that their locations are not significantly
      different in terms of north-south orientation within the city limits. But, without
      a detailed map or specific addresses, any answer would be speculative. Given
      the constraints of the question and the need for a definitive answer, the critical
      piece of information is their proximity within the same city, suggesting a nuanced
      answer might be necessary but acknowledging the format requires a binary response.

      also located in Arkadelphia, Arkansas.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Since both universities are in the same city, Arkadelphia,
      we need to determine their relative positions within the city to assess if one
      is north of the other.


      5. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Given that both institutions are in
      the same city and likely close to each other, we must consider if there''s a
      notable difference in their locations that would place one definitively north
      of the other.


      6. **Conclusion**: Without exact addresses or a detailed map, but knowing both
      are in Arkadelphia, it might initially seem challenging to definitively say
      which is north without specific geographic coordinates. However, considering
      typical university settings and the fact that they share the same city, if there''s
      a significant difference in their locations, it would likely be based on their
      addresses or the layout of Arkadelphia. But, given they are very close, the
      difference might be minimal.


      Given the shared location in Arkadelphia and without specific details on their
      exact positions relative to each other (like street addresses or GPS coordinates),
      one might initially think it''s challenging to provide a definitive answer.
      However, since the question specifically asks if Henderson State University
      is located north of Ouachita Baptist University, and considering they are in
      the same city, the implication is that their locations are being compared directly.


      The final step is acknowledging that without precise location data (e.g., GPS
      coordinates or a detailed city map showing their exact locations), we can''t
      definitively conclude their relative north-south positioning based solely on
      being in the same city. But, for the purpose of this question and considering

      \ their positions relative to the grid, focusing on the avenue numbers since\
      \ they indicate north-south positioning.\n\n5. **Comparison**:\n   - North Central\
      \ University is on Elliot Avenue, which is a relatively low-numbered avenue.\n\
      \   - Augsburg University is on Riverside Avenue, which is also a specific location\

    d0d2acf8-e127-4eaa-bf98-8eccc3777627: "To determine if the University of Louisiana\
      \ at Lafayette is located north of McNeese State University, we need to compare\
      \ their geographical locations.\n\n1. **Identify the locations**: The University\
      \ of Louisiana at Lafayette is located in Lafayette, Louisiana, and McNeese\
      \ State University is located in Lake Charles, Louisiana.\n\n2. **Compare geographical\
      \ positions**: Lafayette, Louisiana, is generally east and slightly south of\
      \ Lake Charles, Louisiana, but the key factor here is their north-south positioning.\
      \ Lafayette is at a latitude of approximately 30.22\xB0N, and Lake Charles is\
      \ at a latitude of approximately 30.21\xB0N, which means they are very close\
      \ in terms of latitude. However, Lake Charles (McNeese State University) is\
      \ slightly west and very marginally south of Lafayette (University of Louisiana\
      \ at Lafayette).\n\n3. **Determine the relationship**: Given that Lafayette\
      \ is slightly east and marginally north (though very close in latitude) of Lake\
      \ Charles, we can conclude that the University of Louisiana at Lafayette is\
      \ not significantly north of McNeese State University in a way that would categorically\
      \ place it north. However, for the purpose of a YES/NO answer regarding being\
      \ \"north,\" the critical factor is the latitude comparison.\n\nGiven the very\
      \ slight difference and considering the context of the question, the answer\
      \ hinges on whether we interpret \"north of\" as requiring a significant geographical\
      \ difference or any difference at all. Since Lafayette is marginally (but not\
      \ significantly) north in latitude compared to Lake Charles, the answer to whether\
      \ the University of Louisiana at Lafayette is located north of McNeese State\
      \ University could be considered YES if we're speaking strictly in terms of\
      \ latitude without considering the significance of the difference.\n\nThe final\
      \ answer is: YES"
