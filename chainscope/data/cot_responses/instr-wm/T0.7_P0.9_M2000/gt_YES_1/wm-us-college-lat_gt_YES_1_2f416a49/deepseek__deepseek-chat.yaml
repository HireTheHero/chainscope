      these steps:


      1. **Locate La Salle Extension University, IL**: La Salle Extension University
      was a correspondence school based in Chicago, Illinois. Its exact location was
      in the Chicago metropolitan area.


      2. **Locate Robert Morris University Illinois, IL**: Robert Morris University
      Illinois has multiple campuses, but its main campus is in Chicago, Illinois.


      3. **Compare the geographical positions**: Both institutions are located in
      Chicago, Illinois. To determine if one is north of the other, we need to identify
      their specific addresses or general locations within the city.


      4. **Verify the locations**: Historically, La Salle Extension University was
      located in the Loop area of downtown Chicago. Robert Morris University Illinois''s
      main campus is also in downtown Chicago, but its exact location would need to
      be compared to La Salle''s.


      5. **Final assessment**: Since both are in downtown Chicago, their relative
      positions would depend on their specific addresses. Without precise addresses,
      it is difficult to definitively say which is further north. However, given that
      both are in close proximity, it is unlikely that one is significantly north
      of the other.

      Extension University, IL is located significantly north of Robert Morris University
      Illinois, IL.

      is located north of William Peace University, we need to consider their geographical
      locations in Raleigh, North Carolina.


      ### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

      1. **Locate NC State University**: NC State University is situated in the western
      part of Raleigh, specifically in the area known as "Centennial Campus" and the
      main campus near Hillsborough Street.

      2. **Locate William Peace University**: William Peace University is located
      in downtown Raleigh, near the intersection of Peace Street and Wilmington Street.

      3. **Compare Their Positions**: Downtown Raleigh (where William Peace University
      is located) is generally to the east of NC State University''s main campus.

      4. **Determine North-South Relationship**: Since both universities are in Raleigh,
      we need to assess their north-south alignment. NC State University is slightly
      northwest of William Peace University.

      campus, their relative positions (north, south, east, or west) would depend
      on their specific locations within the campus. To determine if one is north
      of the other, you would need to look at a campus map.


      However, without a specific campus map, it is reasonable to assume that both
      schools are in close proximity and may not be significantly north or south of
      each other.


      **Final Answer**: NO.'

    e95eb579-e49f-478f-bb29-c86b4f74944e: "Alright, let's tackle this question step\
      \ by step. The goal is to determine whether the Boyer College of Music and Dance\
      \ in Pennsylvania is located north of Temple University, also in Pennsylvania.\
      \ Here's how I can approach this:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Institutions\n\
      First, I need to know where these institutions are located.\n\n- **Temple University**:\
      \ I know that Temple University is a well-known public research university in\
      \ Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n  \n- **Boyer College of Music and Dance**: From\
      \ what I recall, the Boyer College of Music and Dance is a college within Temple\
      \ University, which suggests it's located on the same campus or nearby.\n\n\
      ### 2. Locating Temple University in Philadelphia\nTo determine the relative\
      \ positions, I need to look at a map of Philadelphia.\n\n- **Temple University's\
      \ Main Campus**: It's situated in North Philadelphia. The main campus is bounded\
      \ by Broad Street to the west, Cecil B. Moore Avenue to the south, 10th Street\
      \ to the east, and Diamond Street to the north.\n\n### 3. Finding the Boyer\
      \ College of Music and Dance\nSince the Boyer College is part of Temple University,\
      \ it should be located within or near the main campus.\n\n- **Location of Boyer\
      \ College**: After a quick search, I find that the Boyer College of Music and\
      \ Dance is indeed located on Temple University's main campus in Philadelphia.\n\
      \n### 4. Determining Relative North-South Position\nNow, to answer whether the\
      \ Boyer College is north of Temple University:\n\n- **Understanding the Campus\
      \ Layout**: The main campus of Temple University is relatively compact. Since\
      \ the Boyer College is part of the university, it's located within the campus\
      \ boundaries.\n\n- **Assessing the Location**: The campus spans from Cecil B.\
      \ Moore Avenue (south) to Diamond Street (north). If the Boyer College is situated\
      \ closer to the northern boundary (Diamond Street), then it would be north relative\
      \ to other parts of the campus.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nGiven that the Boyer College\
      \ of Music and Dance is situated within Temple University's main campus, and\
      \ the campus itself has a defined north-south boundary, the Boyer College is\
      \ not located north of Temple University as a whole but is part of it. Therefore,\
      \ it doesn't make sense to say it's north of Temple University since it's an\
      \ integral part of the university.\n\n**Final Answer:** NO."

    b9ea8ade-c7d3-4282-aafc-d9766807d0b3: "Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether\
      \ Oklahoma City University (OK) is located north of Pfeiffer University (NC).\
      \ To answer this, I need to understand the geographical locations of both universities\
      \ and compare their latitudes.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations of Both\
      \ Universities\n\nFirst, I need to know where each university is situated.\n\
      \n- **Oklahoma City University (OK)**: As the name suggests, it's located in\
      \ Oklahoma City, which is the capital of the state of Oklahoma in the United\
      \ States.\n  \n- **Pfeiffer University (NC)**: This university is located in\
      \ North Carolina. I recall that Pfeiffer University is in Misenheimer, but I'm\
      \ not entirely sure. I'll need to confirm that.\n\n### Step 2: Confirm the Specific\
      \ Cities for Both Universities\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I should verify the exact\
      \ cities where these universities are located.\n\n- **Oklahoma City University**:\
      \ Yes, it's in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.\n\n- **Pfeiffer University**: After\
      \ a quick check, I find that Pfeiffer University is indeed located in Misenheimer,\
      \ North Carolina.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Latitude of Each Location\n\n\
      Latitude measures how far north or south a location is from the equator. The\
      \ higher the latitude, the farther north the location is.\n\nI need to find\
      \ the latitude for both Oklahoma City and Misenheimer.\n\n- **Oklahoma City,\
      \ OK Latitude**: I recall that Oklahoma City is at approximately 35.4676\xB0\
      \ N latitude.\n\n- **Misenheimer, NC Latitude**: After checking, I find that\
      \ Misenheimer is at around 35.4852\xB0 N latitude.\n\nWait a minute, that's\
      \ interesting. Both latitudes are very close to each other, around 35.4\xB0\
      \ N.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Latitudes\n\nNow, I'll compare these two latitudes\
      \ to determine which one is farther north.\n\n- Oklahoma City: ~35.4676\xB0\
      \ N\n- Misenheimer: ~35.4852\xB0 N\n\nSince 35.4852\xB0 N is slightly higher\
      \ than 35.4676\xB0 N, Misenheimer is a bit farther north than Oklahoma City.\n\
      \n### Step 5: Re-evaluate the Initial Question\n\nThe original question asks\
      \ if Oklahoma City University is located north of Pfeiffer University.\n\nFrom\
      \ the latitude comparison:\n\n- Misenheimer, NC (Pfeiffer University) has a\
      \ higher latitude than Oklahoma City, OK (Oklahoma City University).\n\nTherefore,\
      \ Pfeiffer University is slightly north of Oklahoma City University.\n\n###\
      \ Step 6: Conclusion\n\nBased on the latitude comparison:\n\n- **Pfeiffer University,\
      \ NC** is located at a higher latitude (~35.4852\xB0 N) than **Oklahoma City\
      \ University, OK** (~35.4676\xB0 N).\n\nThis means that **Oklahoma City University,\
      \ OK is not located north of Pfeiffer University, NC**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\
      \n**NO**, Oklahoma City University, OK is not located north of Pfeiffer University,\
      \ NC."

      The question asks whether the College of Arts and Sciences at Eastern Michigan
      University (EMU) is located north of the College of Education at the same university.
      To answer this, I need to determine the relative positions of these two colleges
      on the EMU campus.


      ### Step 1: Researching EMU''s Campus Layout


      First, I need to find a map or layout of Eastern Michigan University''s campus.
      This will help me locate the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of
      Education.


      Upon looking at the campus map, I see that EMU is located in Ypsilanti, Michigan,
      and the campus is spread out with various buildings housing different colleges
      and departments.


      ### Step 2: Locating the College of Arts and Sciences


      The College of Arts and Sciences at EMU is a large college encompassing many
      departments. It is housed in several buildings across the campus. The primary
      building for the College of Arts and Sciences is Pray-Harrold, which is centrally
      located.


      ### Step 3: Locating the College of Education


      The College of Education at EMU is primarily housed in Porter Hall. This building
      is also centrally located but slightly to the south of Pray-Harrold.


      ### Step 4: Comparing the Locations


      Now, I compare the positions of Pray-Harrold (College of Arts and Sciences)
      and Porter Hall (College of Education) on the campus map.


      - Pray-Harrold is situated to the north of Porter Hall.

      - Therefore, the College of Arts and Sciences is located north of the College
      of Education.


      ### Step 5: Verifying the Information


      To ensure accuracy, I double-check the campus map and confirm that Pray-Harrold
      is indeed north of Porter Hall. This verification supports my initial conclusion.


      ### Conclusion


      Based on the campus layout and the locations of the respective buildings, the
      College of Arts and Sciences at Eastern Michigan University is located north
      of the College of Education.

      in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The College of Arts and Sciences and the College of
      Education are both part of EMU.


      2. **Location of the Colleges**: Both colleges are situated on the same campus
      in Ypsilanti. The College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Education
      are not separate physical entities but rather academic divisions within the
      university.


      3. **Geographical Relationship**: Since both colleges are part of the same campus,
      they share the same geographical location. Therefore, one cannot be north of
      the other in a significant or meaningful way.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since both colleges are located on the same campus, it is
      not accurate to say that the College of Arts and Sciences is north of the College
      of Education.

      1. **Texas A&M University (TAMU)** is the main campus of the Texas A&M University
      System, located in College Station, Texas.

      2. **Texas A&M College of Liberal Arts** is not a separate institution but rather
      a college within Texas A&M University. It is part of the main campus in College
      Station.


      Since both Texas A&M University and the College of Liberal Arts are located
      on the same main campus in College Station, TX, they share the same geographic
      location. Therefore, one cannot be north of the other.


      Final Answer: **NO**.'
