      - Schiller International University''s Florida campus is in Largo, Florida

      - Largo is also on Florida''s west coast


      3. Now let me compare their relative positions

      - Largo is located just west of Tampa

      - On a north-south axis, Largo is slightly south of Tampa


      4. Therefore, since The University of Tampa is positioned slightly more north

      1. First, let me locate both universities in Missouri:

      - Maryville University is located in Town and Country, a suburb of St. Louis

      - Fontbonne University is located in Clayton, also a suburb of St. Louis


      2. Looking at their specific locations:

      - Maryville University is at 650 Maryville University Drive, Town and Country

      - Fontbonne University is at 6800 Wydown Boulevard, Clayton


      3. Comparing their positions:

      - Town and Country is located west and slightly south of Clayton

      - Specifically, Maryville University is located slightly SOUTH of Fontbonne

      - ICO is at 3241 S Michigan Ave (32nd Street)

      - IIT is at 35th Street

      - Since lower street numbers in Chicago are further north, 32nd Street is north
      of 35th Street


      Therefore: YES, Illinois College of Optometry is located north of Illinois Institute
      of Technology.'

      1) First, let me identify the locations of both institutions:

      - Illinois College of Optometry is located at 3241 S Michigan Ave, Chicago,
      IL

      - Illinois Institute of Technology is located at 10 W 35th Street, Chicago,
      IL


      2) Looking at the street addresses:

      - Illinois College of Optometry is on South Michigan Ave at 3241 South

      - IIT is on 35th Street (3500 South)


      3) Since Chicago uses a numbered street system where numbers increase as you
      go south:

      - 3241 South is further north than 3500 South


      4) Therefore, Illinois College of Optometry (3241 S) is located slightly north
      of Illinois Institute of Technology (3500 S)

      1. Both schools are part of the University of Georgia (UGA) campus in Athens,
      GA.


      2. The School of Public and International Affairs (SPIA) is located in Candler
      Hall on North Campus.


      3. Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is spread across multiple buildings
      on campus, but its main administrative offices are in Old College, also on North
      Campus.


      4. Looking at their specific locations:

      - Candler Hall (SPIA) is located on the northern edge of North Campus

      - Old College (Franklin College) is located more centrally on North Campus


      5. Therefore, SPIA''s main building (Candler Hall) is indeed positioned north

      1. Let me identify the locations of both universities:

      - Golden Gate University is located in San Francisco''s Financial District at
      536 Mission Street

      - Academy of Art University is also in San Francisco, with its main campus at
      79 New Montgomery Street


      2. Looking at their specific locations in San Francisco:

      - Both are in the South of Market (SoMa) area

      - Golden Gate University is slightly north of Academy of Art University by a
      few blocks


      3. On a map, Mission Street where GGU is located runs parallel to and is north
      of New Montgomery Street where AAU is located

      \ relative positions:\n- Lafayette is located at approximately 30.2\xB0N latitude\n\
      - Lake Charles is located at approximately 30.2\xB0N latitude\n\n4. Looking\
