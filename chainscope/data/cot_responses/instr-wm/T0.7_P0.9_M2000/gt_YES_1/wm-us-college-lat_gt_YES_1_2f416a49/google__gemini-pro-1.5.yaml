      in Chicago, one cannot be strictly "north" of the other in a meaningful geographic
      sense within the city. They may have been located in different neighborhoods,

      La Salle Extension University was located near or in what became the financial

      is north of WSU Tri-Cities, WSU Vancouver, and WSU Pullman.


      Since the question specifies Washington Technology University, WA and there
      is no such university, one must assume that the question refers to Washington
      State University in some form. Thus, Antioch University Seattle is located north

      Illinois College of Optometry is in Chicago. Illinois Institute of Technology

      A quick search shows Illinois College of Optometry is at 3241 S. Michigan Avenue,
      while Illinois Institute of Technology is near 35th and State Street.  South
      Michigan Avenue addresses increase as you go north. Thus, 32nd Street is north
      of 35th Street.

      A. Fulton Schools of Engineering and Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ.

      2. **Clarify the relationship of Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering:**  Ira
      A. Fulton Schools of Engineering is part of Arizona State University and has
      multiple campuses.  The main campus is in Tempe, AZ.  There is also a significant
      presence at the ASU Polytechnic campus in Mesa, AZ.

      3. **Clarify Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ:** Wilkes University is primarily located
      in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.  There is no Wilkes University in Mesa, AZ.  There
      is a Wilkes University online program, but that doesn''t have a physical location
      in Mesa.  It is highly likely the question intends to refer to Wilkes Honors
      College, which *is* located in Mesa and is part of Arizona State University.

      4. **Determine relative locations:**  Both Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering
      (Polytechnic campus) and Wilkes Honors College are in Mesa, AZ.  The Polytechnic
      campus is significantly northeast of the Wilkes Honors College campus.  "North
      of" is a reasonable description of the relative position, though "northeast"
      would be more precise.



      NO. The question contains a factual error.  Presuming the question meant Wilkes
      Honors College, the Polytechnic campus of Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering
      is northeast of, but not strictly north of it. This doesn''t fit the "north
      of" criterion in the question.

      specific location information within those cities is needed.


      4. **Further research (if available):**  A more detailed look at a map shows
      that Tempe is slightly southwest of Mesa.

      2. **Determine relative location:**  Mesa is part of the Phoenix metropolitan
      area.  Therefore, Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering and Wilkes University,
      Mesa are both generally in the same metropolitan area.  The question uses "north
      of" suggesting a specific directional relationship.


      3. **Consider ASU campuses:** ASU''s Tempe campus is the largest and most well-known.  It''s
      generally considered central within the metro area.  Mesa is east of Tempe.  ASU
      also has a Polytechnic campus in Mesa.


      4. **"North of" is key:**  While there are ASU campuses in various parts of
      the Phoenix metro area, the question specifically asks if the Fulton Schools
      (generally) are *north* of Wilkes University, Mesa.  Since Mesa is east of the
      main Tempe campus, and other campuses are spread throughout the area, "north
      of" is not a consistently accurate description.

      3. **Relative position:**  Since both are in the Phoenix metro area (Fulton
      across the area, and Wilkes specifically in Mesa), the question is whether any
      part of ASU/Fulton Schools is north of Mesa.  ASU has campuses in Tempe, Scottsdale,

      need to determine the geographic location of both George Washington University
      School of Nursing and the Corcoran College of Art and Design.


      2. **Compare their latitudes:**  Once I have their locations, I need to figure
      out which one is further north by comparing their latitude coordinates (higher
      latitude = further north).


      3. **Determine if GW School of Nursing is north of Corcoran:** If the GW School
      of Nursing has a higher latitude than the Corcoran College of Art and Design,
      then the answer is YES. Otherwise, the answer is NO.

      * George Washington University School of Nursing is located around 2300 Eye
      St NW, Washington, DC

      * Corcoran College of Art and Design (now part of GWU) was located at 500 17th
      St NW, Washington, DC.

      north than 500 17th St NW.

      School of Nursing:**  This is in Washington, D.C.

      2. **Locate Corcoran College of Art and Design:** This was also in Washington,
      D.C., but it merged with George Washington University in 2014.  Its building
      is now part of the GWU campus.

      3. **Determine relative locations:** Since they are part of the same university
      and campus, the question of one being "north" of the other is tricky.  They
      might be in the same building, adjacent buildings, or across campus from each
      other.  However, one specific building *could* be considered north of another.


      Since the question implies distinct locations, and the original Corcoran building
      is now part of the GWU campus, it''s possible for the School of Nursing to be
      north of the former Corcoran building.  Further research could pinpoint the
      exact locations.


      However, based on the information provided, a definitive YES or NO is difficult
      without more specific building locations.  If the question is interpreted as
      "is the main School of Nursing building north of the main former Corcoran building?",
      then possibly YES.  If it''s interpreted more generally as "is any part of the
      School of Nursing facilities north of any part of the former Corcoran facilities?",
      then almost certainly YES given the size of the campus.


      Without more information, a simple YES/NO is insufficient.  However, leaning
      towards **YES** as being more likely, but not definitively so.

      3. **Determine if GW Nursing is north of Corcoran:** Based on the comparison

      *Researching the locations*


      George Washington University School of Nursing is generally considered part
      of the main campus and located around 2121 I St NW.


      Corcoran College of Art and Design''s historic building is located at 500 17th
      St NW, Washington, DC.  While it''s now part of GWU, its building remains at
      that location.


      Looking at a map or comparing addresses in NW DC, the lower the numbered street,
      the further south it is. 17th street is south of 21st street.


      Therefore, GW Nursing is north of Corcoran.
