      2. **Campus Layout**: Since both schools are part of the same university, they

      with the Bellamy Building and nearby buildings on the FSU campus.


      4. **Exact Positions on Campus**: To determine the exact north-south positioning
      of the two on the FSU campus, one would need a detailed campus map or floor
      plan that specifies the positions of these departments within or around the
      Bellamy Building.


      Given that both schools share the same building or adjacent areas, it''s unlikely
      that one is distinctly "north" of the other in a significant way.

      2. **Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ**: Wilkes University has a location in Mesa,

      the relative locations of George Washington University School of Nursing and
      Corcoran College of Art and Design within Washington, DC.


      1. **George Washington University School of Nursing:** The School of Nursing
      is part of George Washington University, which has its main campus in the Foggy
      Bottom neighborhood of Washington, DC.


      2. **Corcoran College of Art and Design:** Historically, the Corcoran College
      of Art and Design was located near the White House, which is also in the Foggy
      Bottom/West End area. However, in 2014, the Corcoran merged with George Washington
      University, and its operations were integrated into the GWU campus.


      3. **Relative Locations:** Given that both institutions are now part of the
      same GWU campus area in Foggy Bottom, they are in close proximity to each other.
      However, the exact locations within the campus might vary slightly.


      To determine the specific north-south orientation:


      - The main campus of George Washington University, including many of its facilities,
      is located slightly to the southeast of the original Corcoran building near
      17th Street NW and New York Avenue NW.


      Based on these points, the George Washington University School of Nursing is
      generally located to the southeast of the original Corcoran building area. Thus,
      the School of Nursing is not north of the Corcoran College of Art and Design''s
      historical location.


      **Final Answer: NO**'

      1. **University of Georgia Campus Layout**: Both the School of Public and International
      Affairs and the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences are located on the University
      of Georgia campus in Athens, GA.


      2. **Relative Location on Campus**: The School of Public and International Affairs
      is primarily housed in Candler Hall. The Franklin College of Arts and Sciences
      has various departments located in multiple buildings throughout the campus,
      but its administrative offices are typically associated with Old College.


      3. **Comparing Locations**: Candler Hall is located near the north-central part
      of the University of Georgia campus. Old College, where the administrative offices
      of the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences are housed, is also centrally located
      but slightly south of Candler Hall.


      Based on these considerations, the University of Georgia School of Public and

      2. **Campus Layout**: Within the University of Georgia campus, different colleges
      and schools may have specific buildings or clusters of buildings.


      3. **Specific Building Locations**: The School of Public and International Affairs
      is primarily housed in Candler Hall, and the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences
      is a larger entity with its departments spread across multiple buildings, but
      it is often associated with Old College and other central campus locations.


      4. **Geographic Orientation**: To determine the relative positions, one would
      typically refer to a campus map to see where Candler Hall is positioned relative
      to Old College or the main administrative centers of the Franklin College.


      Based on the typical layout of the University of Georgia campus:


      - Candler Hall (School of Public and International Affairs) is located near
      the north-central part of the campus.

      - Old College (often associated with Franklin College of Arts and Sciences)
      is generally located near the central part of the campus.


      Given this information, Candler Hall is slightly north of Old College.

      3. **Comparison**: Both universities are located in San Francisco, but to determine
      which is further north, we need to compare their specific locations within the
      city. The Financial District, where Golden Gate University is located, is generally
      north of the South of Market area, where the Academy of Art University has its
      main offices.

      University College of Education, we need to consider the geographical locations
      of the buildings or facilities associated with each of these colleges on the
      Eastern Michigan University campus in Ypsilanti, Michigan.


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, identify the specific buildings or facilities
      that house the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Education at
      Eastern Michigan University.


      2. **Campus Map Reference**: Refer to a current campus map of Eastern Michigan
      University to ascertain the relative positions of these buildings.


      3. **Determine the Relative Positions**: Locate the buildings on the map. Determine
      which building is situated to the north relative to the other.


      Based on the above steps, if the building for the College of Arts and Sciences
      is situated to the north of the building for the College of Education, the answer
      is "YES." If it is not, then the answer is "NO."


      Without access to a current campus map or specific information about the buildings,
      I cannot definitively provide the answer. However, if you have access to a campus
      map or detailed information about the campus layout, you could use that to conclusively
      determine the answer.'

      University, meaning it is part of the same campus in College Station, Texas.


      Since both Texas A&M University and the Texas A&M College of Liberal Arts are
      located in the same place (College Station), there is no north-south distinction
      between them in terms of separate locations.


      Thus, the answer is:


      NO'
