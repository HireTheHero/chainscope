      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      universities. Palo Alto University is located in Palo Alto, California, which
      is part of the San Francisco Bay Area. Henley-Putnam University is also located
      in California, but its exact location isn''t specified.


      2. **General Geography**: California is a long, narrow state on the West Coast
      of the United States. The San Francisco Bay Area, where Palo Alto University
      is located, is in the northern part of the state.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Since we don''t have the exact location of Henley-Putnam
      University, we can''t make a precise comparison. However, given the general
      geography of California, it''s likely that Henley-Putnam University is also
      located somewhere in the northern part of the state, but potentially not as
      far north as Palo Alto.


      4. **Comparison**: Given the above information, we can assume that Palo Alto
      University is likely located north of Henley-Putnam University, but without
      the exact location of Henley-Putnam, we can''t say for sure.


      Based on these considerations, the most likely answer is: **YES**'

      the geographical locations of New York University Tandon School of Engineering
      (NYU Tandon) and Pratt Institute. Both institutions are located in New York
      City, New York.


      1. **Identify the locations**: NYU Tandon is located in Brooklyn, New York.
      Pratt Institute is also located in Brooklyn, specifically in the Clinton Hill
      neighborhood.


      2. **Determine the relative positions**: To determine if one location is north
      of another, we need to consider their relative positions. In this case, both
      institutions are in Brooklyn, so we need to look at their positions within the
      borough.


      3. **Compare the positions**: While specific addresses might not be available,
      we can use general knowledge about the layout of Brooklyn to determine their
      relative positions. Brooklyn is a large borough with many neighborhoods, but
      generally, areas closer to the East River (such as Brooklyn Heights and DUMBO)
      are considered more "north" than areas farther inland.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on this general knowledge, and considering that both
      institutions are in Brooklyn, it''s unlikely that NYU Tandon would be considered
      "north" of Pratt Institute. Pratt Institute is in Clinton Hill, which is farther
      inland and not typically considered the "north" of Brooklyn.


      Given these considerations, the answer to whether NYU Tandon is located north
      of Pratt Institute is: **NO**'

      positions of these two locations within West Virginia. Both Vienna and Charles
      Town are in the eastern part of the state, but Vienna is slightly more north
      and west of Charles Town.


      3. **Evaluate North-South Orientation**: To answer whether Ohio Valley University
      is located north of American Military University, we need to evaluate their
      north-south orientation. Since Vienna is slightly more north than Charles Town,
      we can conclude that Ohio Valley University is located north of American Military
      University.

      these steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Laurus Technical Institute and Atlanta University Center. Laurus Technical Institute
      is located in Decatur, Georgia, which is a suburb of Atlanta. Atlanta University
      Center is a consortium of historically black colleges and universities in the
      Atlanta metropolitan area, including Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College,
      and others.


      2. **Determine the Geographical Positions**: Next, we determine their geographical
      positions. Decatur, where Laurus Technical Institute is located, is east of
      downtown Atlanta. The Atlanta University Center institutions are primarily located
      west of downtown Atlanta.


      3. **Compare the Locations**: Since Decatur is east of downtown Atlanta, and
      the Atlanta University Center is primarily west of downtown Atlanta, Laurus
      Technical Institute is likely not located north of Atlanta University Center.


      4. **Specific Locations**: It''s worth noting that while most of the Atlanta
      University Center institutions are west of downtown Atlanta, there are some
      exceptions. For example, Spelman College is slightly east of downtown Atlanta.
      However, the majority of the institutions are west of downtown, which would
      make it unlikely for Laurus Technical Institute to be located north of them.


      Given these considerations, without the exact location of Laurus Technical Institute
      but knowing its general location in Decatur, the most likely answer is NO. However,
      it''s crucial to note that without the precise location of Laurus Technical

      which is a suburb of Atlanta. Atlanta University Center is located in Atlanta,
      Georgia.


      2. **Determine the geographical positions**: Decatur is located east of Atlanta''s
      downtown area. It''s important to note that in the context of this question,
      "north" refers to a cardinal direction and not necessarily a position on a map,
      as cities can be spread out horizontally.


      3. **Compare the positions**: Since Decatur is east of Atlanta and not north,
      Laurus Technical Institute is not located north of Atlanta University Center.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical positions, Laurus Technical Institute
      is not located north of Atlanta University Center.


      The answer is: **NO**'

      1. **Identify the locations**: Both institutions are in Washington, D.C., which
      is a relatively compact city. This means we don''t need to consider large-scale
      geography like we would if the institutions were in different states.


      2. **Use local knowledge**: If you are familiar with the layout of Washington,
      D.C., you might know the relative positions of these institutions. However,
      for those unfamiliar with the city, we can use online maps to help us.


      3. **Check a map**: A quick look at a map of Washington, D.C., shows that George
      Washington University is located in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood, which is
      in the western part of the city. Corcoran College of Art and Design is located
      in the downtown area, which is more central and slightly east of Foggy Bottom.


      4. **Determine north-south orientation**: Since the downtown area is slightly
      east of Foggy Bottom, and east is generally considered "north" in the context

      1. **Identify the locations**: Both UGA SPIA and FCAS are part of the University
      of Georgia (UGA), which is located in Athens, Georgia. Since they are part of
      the same university and in the same city, they are essentially at the same location.


      2. **Consider the campus layout**: Even though both schools are in Athens, they
      might have different buildings or areas within the UGA campus. However, the
      general layout of a university campus does not typically follow a strict north-south
      alignment.


      3. **Evaluate the context**: The question specifically asks about the School
      of Public and International Affairs and the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences.
      While they are both part of UGA, they are separate academic units. The School
      of Public and International Affairs is a specialized school within the university,
      while the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is a broader college encompassing
      various disciplines.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Rosalind Franklin University and Framingham State University. Rosalind Franklin
      University is located in North Chicago, Illinois. Framingham State University
      is located in Framingham, Massachusetts.


      2. **Geographical Positions**: Next, we determine their geographical positions.
      Massachusetts, where Framingham State University is located, is in the northeastern
      United States, sharing a border with New York to the west and Vermont to the
      north. Illinois, where Rosalind Franklin University is located, is in the Midwestern
      United States, with Wisconsin to the north and Indiana to the east.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Rosalind Franklin University is in North Chicago,
      which is in the northeastern part of Illinois, close to the Wisconsin border.
      Framingham, Massachusetts, is west of Boston and south of the New Hampshire
      border.


      4. **Comparison**: Since Illinois is west of Massachusetts, and considering

      in the Midwestern region of the United States, while Ohio is an Eastern state.


      3. **Compare the specific locations**: Lincoln, Nebraska, is the capital city
      of Nebraska, and Canton, Ohio, is located in the northeastern part of Ohio.


      4. **Evaluate the north-south positioning**: Considering the general geography
      and the specific locations, Nebraska Wesleyan University in Lincoln, NE, is
      located west of Malone University in Canton, OH. However, to determine the north-south
      positioning, we need to consider the latitudes of these locations. Without specific
      coordinates, we can''t definitively say whether Lincoln, NE, is north or south
      of Canton, OH.


      Given these steps, we can''t definitively say whether Nebraska Wesleyan University,
      NE is located north of Malone University, OH. However, based on the general

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      colleges. Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College is located in Cumberland,
      Kentucky, while Five Branches University is located in Santa Cruz, California.


      2. **General Geographical Positions**: Next, we determine the general geographical
      positions of both states. Kentucky is located in the southeastern part of the
      United States, while California is located on the West Coast, in the southwestern
      part of the country.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Since both institutions are in different states,

      Cruz, California. Cumberland is located in the southeastern part of Kentucky,
      while Santa Cruz is located on the central coast of California.

    45ed15ef-7ae1-4ac0-b7ae-ac94ad8db2a9: 'To determine whether the University of
      Northern Virginia is located north of George Mason University, we need to follow
      a few steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      universities. The University of Northern Virginia is located in Annandale, Virginia.
      George Mason University is located in Fairfax, Virginia.


      2. **Determine the geographical positions**: Next, we need to determine the
      geographical positions of these locations. Annandale, where the University of
      Northern Virginia is located, is in the northern part of Virginia. Fairfax,
      where George Mason University is located, is also in the northern part of Virginia
      but slightly more south than Annandale.
