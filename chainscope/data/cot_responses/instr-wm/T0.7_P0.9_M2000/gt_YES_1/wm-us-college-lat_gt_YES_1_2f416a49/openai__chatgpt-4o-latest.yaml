      \ in Chicago, Illinois (before it merged with Roosevelt University in 2020).\
      \  \n\n2. **Determine relative positions within Chicago:**  \n   - Since both\
      \ universities were based in Chicago, we need to check if La Salle Extension\
      \ University was north of Robert Morris University Illinois.  \n   - Robert\
      \ Morris University Illinois was located in downtown Chicago (specifically at\

      \   - Without a specific physical campus location for La Salle Extension University,\

      George Washington University, which is based in Washington, DC. However, its
      main nursing programs are primarily conducted at the Virginia Science and Technology
      Campus in Ashburn, VA.

      College of Art and Design was historically located near the White House in Washington,
      DC, before it merged with George Washington University in 2014. Its main building
      was at 500 17th St NW, Washington, DC.


      3. Compare the relative positions of these locations. If considering the original
      Corcoran College of Art and Design location in DC, the main GW campus (which
      has some nursing-related facilities) is nearby, but the primary GW nursing programs
      are in Virginia.


      4. Since the question asks specifically about a "School of Nursing" location
      in DC, we assume it refers to any GW nursing-related site within DC, such as
      the Foggy Bottom campus.


      5. The GW campus buildings in Foggy Bottom are generally located to the northwest
      of the Corcoran building.

      1. **Texas A&M University, TX** refers to the main campus of Texas A&M University,

      2. **Texas A&M College of Liberal Arts, TX** is not a separate location but

      3. Since both entities are part of the same university and are located on the
      same campus, the question can be interpreted as asking whether the entire university
      is north of one of its own colleges.


      4. A university campus consists of multiple buildings and areas, and while specific
      buildings of the College of Liberal Arts may be located in different parts of
      campus, the university as a whole cannot be meaningfully positioned as "north"
      of one of its own colleges.
