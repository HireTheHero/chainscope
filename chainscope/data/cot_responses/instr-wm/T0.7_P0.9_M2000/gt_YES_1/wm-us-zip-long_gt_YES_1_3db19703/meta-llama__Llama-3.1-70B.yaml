      the geographic locations of the two zip codes and compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states associated with the zip codes.

      - 33625 is located in the state of Florida (FL).

      - 28804 is located in the state of North Carolina (NC).


      Step 2: Determine the general geographic location of each state.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern part of the United States, on the Atlantic
      coast.

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern part of the United States, also
      on the Atlantic coast but north of Florida.


      Step 3: Consider the east-west positioning of the states.

      - Florida is generally east of North Carolina.


      Step 4: Since the question asks if 33625, FL is located east of 28804, NC, and
      considering the general east-west positioning of the states, we can conclude
      that Florida, being east of North Carolina, means that 33625, FL is indeed east

      Step 3: Consider the east-west positioning of the states.

      - Massachusetts is generally east of Connecticut.


      Step 4: Since the question asks if 01085, MA is located east of 06051, CT, and
      considering the general east-west positioning of the states, we can conclude
      that Massachusetts, being east of Connecticut, means that 01085, MA is indeed
      east of 06051, CT.

      Step 1: Identify the states associated with the zip codes.

      - 94531 and 95148 are both located in the state of California (CA).


      Step 2: Determine the general geographic location of California.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States.

      - Since both zip codes are in the same state, we need to look at their specific
      locations within California.


      Step 4: Specific locations within California:

      - 94531 is associated with the area around Antioch, California, which is in
      the eastern part of the San Francisco Bay Area.

      - 95148 is associated with the area around San Jose, California, which is in

      Step 2: Determine the general geographic location of the state.

      - Iowa is located in the northern part of the United States, in the Midwest
      region.


      Step 3: Consider the east-west positioning of the zip codes within the state.

      - Zip codes generally increase as you move east and north in the United States.

      - However, zip codes within the same state can have more complex relationships.


      Step 4: Since the question asks if 52402, IA is located east of 52328, IA, and
      considering the general east-west positioning of zip codes, we can conclude
      that 52402, IA is indeed east of 52328, IA.


      The final answer is: YES

      - 91384 is located in the state of California (CA) and corresponds to the area
      around Canoga Park.

      - 93063 is also located in California (CA) and corresponds to the area around
      Simi Valley.


      Step 2: Determine the general geographic location of each zip code.

      - Canoga Park (91384) is located in the western part of the San Fernando Valley,
      which is part of Los Angeles County.

      - Simi Valley (93063) is located in Ventura County, to the west of the San Fernando
      Valley.


      Step 3: Consider the east-west positioning of the zip codes.

      - Since both zip codes are in California and considering their relative positions,
      we can conclude that Canoga Park (91384) is generally east of Simi Valley (93063).

      Step 1: Identify the states associated with the zip codes.

      - Both 08026 and 08867 are located in the state of New Jersey (NJ).


      Step 2: Determine the general geographic location of the state.

      - New Jersey is located in the northeastern part of the United States.


      Step 3: Consider the east-west positioning of the zip codes.

      - Since both zip codes are in the same state, we need to consider their specific
      locations within New Jersey.


      Step 4: Research the specific locations of the zip codes.

      - 08026 corresponds to the area around Glassboro, NJ, which is in the southern
      part of the state.

      - 08867 corresponds to the area around Pittstown, NJ, which is in the northern

      Step 2: Determine the general geographic location of each zip code.

      - 94303 corresponds to the area around Palo Alto, California, which is in the
      San Francisco Bay Area.

      - 94549 corresponds to the area around Lafayette, California, which is also
      in the San Francisco Bay Area.


      Step 3: Consider the east-west positioning of the zip codes.

      - Palo Alto (94303) is located on the western side of the San Francisco Bay
      Area.

      - Lafayette (94549) is located on the eastern side of the San Francisco Bay
      Area.


      Step 4: Since the question asks if 94303, CA is located east of 94549, CA, and
      considering the east-west positioning of the zip codes within the San Francisco
      Bay Area, we can conclude that Palo Alto (94303) is not east of Lafayette (94549).


      The final answer is: NO

      - Louisiana is also located in the southern part of the United States, more
      towards the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 3: Consider the east-west positioning of the states.

      Step 2: Determine the general geographic location of the state.

      - Texas is located in the southern part of the United States, in the South Central
      region.


      Step 3: Consider the east-west positioning of the zip codes within the state.

      - Zip code 78520 is associated with the area around Brownsville, Texas, which
      is in the southern part of the state, close to the border with Mexico.

      - Zip code 76020 is associated with the area around Azle, Texas, which is in
      the northern part of the state, northwest of Dallas.


      Step 4: Since the question asks if 78520, TX is located east of 76020, TX, and
      considering the general east-west positioning of the zip codes within the state,
      we can conclude that 76020, TX (Azle) is indeed east of 78520, TX (Brownsville).


      The final answer is: NO

      - Both zip codes, 78520 and 76020, are located in the state of Texas (TX).


      Step 2: Determine the general geographic location of Texas.

      - Texas is a large state in the southern part of the United States, with a diverse
      geography that includes coastal plains, deserts, and hills.


      Step 3: Consider the east-west positioning of the zip codes.

      - Since both zip codes are in Texas, we need to look at their specific locations
      within the state.


      Step 4: Specific locations of the zip codes:

      - Zip code 78520 is associated with the area around Brownsville, Texas, which
      is located in the southernmost part of the state, near the border with Mexico.

      - Zip code 76020 is associated with the area around Azle, Texas, which is located
      in the northern part of the state, northwest of Dallas.


      Step 5: East-west comparison of the zip codes:

      - Brownsville (78520) is in the southern part of Texas, while Azle (76020) is
      in the northern part.

      - Since Texas extends from the east to the west, the zip codes 78520 and 76020
      are not in a straightforward east-west relationship within the state.
