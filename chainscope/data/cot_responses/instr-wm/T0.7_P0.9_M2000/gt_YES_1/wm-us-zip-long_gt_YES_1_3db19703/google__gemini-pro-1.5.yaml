    1f6cb387-8016-457d-a7e4-f511539e6ca5: '1. **Identify the states:** The zip codes
      are in Washington (WA) and Oregon (OR).


      2. **General US Geography:**  Washington is north of Oregon.  Generally, lines
      of longitude increase as you go east.


      3. **Relationship between North/South and East/West:**  Since Washington is
      north of Oregon, a location in Washington would generally be west of a location
      in Oregon, assuming similar longitudes.  However, the curvature of the earth
      and the specific locations within each state could create exceptions, so simply
      knowing one state is north of the other is insufficient to answer definitively.


      4. **Need for more specific location data:**  To be certain, we need more precise
      location information provided by the zip codes themselves, such as longitude.  A
      quick online search can provide this.


      5. **Lookup Zip Code Locations:**  Zip code 98569 (WA) centers around McKenna,
      WA. Zip code 97459 (OR) is around Pleasant Hill, OR.


      6. **Compare Longitudes:**  McKenna, WA is significantly west of Pleasant Hill,
      OR.

      state and OR is Oregon state.

      2. **General US Geography:** Washington is north of Oregon.  The border between
      them is mostly east-west.

      3. **East vs. West within a state:**  Zip codes generally increase from east
      to west on the west coast.

      4. **Comparing across states:** Since Washington is north of Oregon, and the
      border is mostly east-west, a location in Washington is generally west of a
      location in Oregon.


      Therefore, 98569, WA is likely WEST of 97459, OR.

      2. **General US Geography:** Washington is north of Oregon.  A location in Washington
      would generally be north, not east, of a location in Oregon.  While some parts
      of Washington might be slightly east *and* north of parts of Oregon, the dominant
      directional difference is north.

      3. **Specific Zip Codes (Optional):** While not strictly needed, looking up

      state and OR is Oregon state. Washington is north of Oregon.


      2. **General East/West Direction:**  While Washington is generally north of
      Oregon, the states share a border that runs roughly east-west.  Therefore, a
      location in Washington could be east of a location in Oregon.


      3. **Specific Zip Codes:** We need more specific location information within
      each state for the given zip codes to make a precise East/West comparison. Simply
      knowing the states isn''t enough.  Zip code 98569 (Morton, WA) is in western
      Washington. Zip code 97459 (Pleasant Hill, OR) is in western Oregon.


      4. **West Coast Geography:** The Pacific Ocean is to the west of both locations.  Morton,
      WA is further inland (east) than Pleasant Hill, OR.

      2. **General US Geography:** Washington is north of Oregon.  The border between

      3. **East vs. West with North/South:**  Since Washington is north of Oregon,
      a location in Washington can be both north and east *or* north and west of a
      location in Oregon, depending on the specific longitudes.  Simply knowing one
      is north of the other doesn''t automatically tell us east/west.

      -122.8 degrees longitude. 97459 (Oakridge, OR) is approximately -122.4 degrees

      3. **Relative position:** Since Washington is north of Oregon, a location in
      Washington is generally west of a location in Oregon.  Therefore, a zip code
      in Washington would generally be smaller than one in Oregon as you go from east
      to west.

      2. **Relative position of the states:** Washington is located north of Oregon.  A
      small portion of eastern Washington extends slightly further east than the western
      border of Oregon.

      3. **Consider the zip codes:** Zip codes generally increase from east to west.  A
      lower zip code in Oregon likely indicates a more westerly location than a higher
      zip code in Washington.

      4. **East vs. North:** While 98569, WA might be *north* of 97459, OR, the question
      is whether it''s *east*. Given the general layout of the states and the zip
      code numbering, it''s unlikely 98569, WA is significantly east of 97459, OR.

      2. **General US Geography:** Washington is located north of Oregon.  A location

      the states share a border that runs mostly east-west, but with some curves.  So,
      a location in WA *could* be east of a location in OR if it''s in the eastern

      is the key factor.  Locations further East have a higher longitude value.

      Since -75.5 is greater than -76.2, 18202 is east of 17961.

      some western parts of Virginia might be on the same longitude as eastern parts
      of Pennsylvania.  However, zip code 24416 (Clifton Forge, VA) is in central/western
      Virginia, and 16214 (Brookville, PA) is in western Pennsylvania.

      4. **Refine the relative positions:**  Even though both are in the western portions
      of their respective states, Virginia is still east of Pennsylvania.

      2. **Consider the zip codes within the states:** Zip codes increase from east
      to west.  24416 in VA is a lower number than 16214 in PA.  Lower numbers in
      zip codes generally mean further east.

      3. **Combine the information:** Since VA is east of PA, and the VA zip code
      is lower than the PA zip code, this reinforces the idea that 24416, VA is east
      of 16214, PA.

      4. **Zip Code Specificity:** Zip codes provide more specific location information.
      However, the general north/south relationship between the states supersedes
      minor variations within zip code areas.

      27299, NC is east of 32962, FL, given the general geography.  However, it''s
      not guaranteed without checking.


      **Answer:  I cannot definitively answer YES or NO without looking up the longitudes.**
      While likely YES, it''s important to be precise with geographic information.

      2. **Consider east vs. west within the continental US:**  Longitude lines determine
      east/west position.  Locations further east have higher longitude values.


      3. **Recognize we''re comparing east coast locations:** Since both NC and FL
      are on the east coast, we need to determine which location is further east.  Generally
      speaking, the further north you go on the east coast, the further east you are.

      2. **General US Geography:** Kentucky is generally north and east of Alabama.

      3. **Zip Code Logic:**  A higher zip code number generally indicates a more
      western or northern location within a state (though this isn''t a hard and fast
      rule, the general trend holds, and combined with the state information, it''s
      useful). 42122 is significantly higher than 36054.

      4. **Conclusion:** Given that Kentucky is east of Alabama, and the zip code
      difference reinforces the eastward direction, it''s highly probable 42122, KY
      is east of 36054, AL.

      a specific location in Alabama, especially near the border.  However, zip code

      2. **General US Geography:** Oregon is south of Washington.  While there is
      a small section of Oregon that is slightly east of a small section of Washington,
      generally, Oregon is west of Washington.


      3. **Specific Zip Code Location (not strictly necessary but helpful):** A quick
      search shows 97233 is near Portland, OR and 98580 is near Shelton, WA.  Portland
      is definitely west of Shelton.


      4. **Conclusion:** 97233, OR is west of 98580, WA.

      3. Oregon is south of Washington.

      4. Generally, locations further east have higher longitude values.  However,
      since Oregon is south of Washington, simply comparing zip codes won''t tell
      us which is further east.  We need to consider their relative locations.

      5. A quick map check reveals that while most of Oregon is west of most of Washington,
      the eastern portion of Oregon extends further east than the western portion
      of Washington.

      6.  Zip code 97233 (Portland, OR area) is in western Oregon. Zip code 98580
      (Elma, WA area) is in western Washington.


      Therefore, 97233, OR is *west* of 98580, WA.

      zip code:** 41240 is in Kentucky (KY), which is in the eastern US. 33756 is
      in Florida (FL), which is also in the eastern US, but further south.


      2. **Consider longitude:**  Longitude determines east/west position.  Places
      further east have higher longitude values.


      3. **We need to determine if Kentucky is generally east of Florida.** While
      Florida extends further east than the westernmost parts of Kentucky, the majority,
      and especially central Kentucky (where 41240 is likely to be) is east of the
      majority of Florida.


      4. **Therefore, it is highly probable that 41240, KY is east of 33756, FL.**  A
      quick check online confirms this.
