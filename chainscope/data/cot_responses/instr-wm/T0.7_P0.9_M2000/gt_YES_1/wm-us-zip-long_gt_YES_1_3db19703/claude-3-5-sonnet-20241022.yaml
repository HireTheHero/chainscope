      - 97459 is in Oregon state (OR)


      2) In the US zip code system:

      - First digit 9 indicates the Pacific region

      - 985xx is Western Washington

      3) Since both are in the 9xxxx range, they''re both in the Pacific region

      - Oregon is south of Washington

      - Western Oregon and Western Washington are both along the Pacific coast

      - Neither zip code is in the eastern part of their respective states

      north of Oregon, they are roughly in the same north-south corridor along the
      coast. Therefore, one is not significantly east of the other.

      - 97233 is in Portland, Oregon

      - 98580 is in Roy, Washington


      2) Generally in the US postal code system:

      - First digit indicates a certain geographical region

      - 9 indicates the Pacific Northwest region

      - Lower numbers in the first three digits generally indicate more western locations
      in the region


      3) Comparing the first three digits:

      - 972xx (Portland area)

      - 985xx (South Puget Sound area)

      - 972 is lower than 985, suggesting Portland is more western


      4) Looking at actual geography:

      - Portland, OR is indeed west of Roy, WA

      - Therefore, 97233 is WEST of 98580, not east


      NO'

      - Kentucky is positioned north and east of Florida


      3) In the US ZIP code system:

      - 4xxxx (Kentucky) is more eastern than 3xxxx (Florida)
