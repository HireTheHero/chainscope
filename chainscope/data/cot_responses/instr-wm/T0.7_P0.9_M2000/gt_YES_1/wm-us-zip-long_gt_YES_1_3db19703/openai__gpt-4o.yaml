      in Washington is located east of 97459 in Oregon, we need to look at their geographical
      locations.


      1. **Identify the location of 98569, WA**: The zip code 98569 corresponds to
      Ocean Shores, Washington. It is located on the west coast of Washington state,
      near the Pacific Ocean.


      2. **Identify the location of 97459, OR**: The zip code 97459 corresponds to
      North Bend, Oregon. It is located on the southern Oregon coast, also near the
      Pacific Ocean.


      3. **Compare the longitudinal positions**: Since both locations are on the west
      coast of their respective states, we need to determine which one is further
      east. Ocean Shores (98569) is north of North Bend (97459), but they are both
      coastal cities, and their longitudinal positions determine which is further
      east.


      4. **Geographical analysis**: Generally, as you move north along the west coast
      from Oregon to Washington, the coastline tends to curve slightly eastward. However,
      both Ocean Shores and North Bend are relatively close in longitude due to the
      curvature of the coastline.


      Based on these observations, Ocean Shores, WA (98569) is not significantly east
      of North Bend, OR (97459); in fact, it is slightly to the west.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**.'

      1. **Locate 90602**: This zip code is in Whittier, California, which is in Los
      Angeles County, in the Greater Los Angeles Area. It is situated in the western
      part of Southern California.


      2. **Locate 93552**: This zip code is in Palmdale, California, which is also
      in Los Angeles County, but in the High Desert region of Southern California.
      Palmdale is located to the northeast of the Greater Los Angeles Area.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Whittier (90602) is geographically situated to the
      southwest of Palmdale (93552). Thus, 90602 is west of 93552.

      1. Both 85745 and 85746 are zip codes in Tucson, Arizona.

      2. In general, zip codes in the United States are not perfectly sequential in
      terms of geographical location, but they often follow some numerical pattern
      based on regions.

      3. In Tucson, zip codes beginning with "857" are mostly located in the western
      and central parts of the city.

      4. 85745 is primarily located in the western part of Tucson, near the Tucson
      Mountains.

      5. 85746 is located further south and slightly west of the central part of Tucson.


      Based on these observations, 85745 is generally to the north and slightly west
