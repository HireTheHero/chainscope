      - Higher numbers typically indicate a location more to the east or south

      or north.


      5. Since 18202 has a higher first three digits than 17961, this suggests it
      is located more to the east.


      6. To confirm, I would typically cross-reference the specific towns or counties
      associated with these zip codes, but the pattern of the zip codes strongly suggests
      an eastern location.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES, 18202, PA is located east of 17961, PA.'

    f3973678-6b31-4eea-a087-33eb78eb0bd3: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll look at the zip codes 85395 and 85338, which are both in Arizona.


      2. To determine their relative east-west position, I''ll look at their first
      digits (8 and 8) and subsequent digits.


      3. In Arizona, zip codes generally progress from west to east as the full zip
      code increases.


      4. 85395 has a higher number than 85338.


      5. This suggests that 85395 is located further east than 85338.


      6. I can confirm this by checking a map or zip code location reference.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'
