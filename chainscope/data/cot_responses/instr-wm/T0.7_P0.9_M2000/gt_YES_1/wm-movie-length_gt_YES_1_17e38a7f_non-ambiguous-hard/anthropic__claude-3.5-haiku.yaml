      - Meaghamann is a 2014 Tamil action thriller film directed by Magizh Thirumeni

      - Its runtime is approximately 2 hours and 10 minutes (130 minutes)


      2. Next, I''ll find the runtime of The Wild Chase:

      - The Wild Chase is a 1954 Looney Tunes animated short film by Friz Freleng

      - Animated shorts typically run around 6-8 minutes long

      - A runtime of about 7 minutes seems standard for this type of cartoon


      3. Comparing the runtimes:

      - Meaghamann: 130 minutes

      - The Wild Chase: ~7 minutes

      - 130 minutes is significantly longer than 7 minutes


      4. Conclusion:

      Meaghamann has a much longer total runtime than The Wild Chase.

      2. Then I''ll find the runtime of Lau Kar-leung''s Executioners from Shaolin

      3. Then I''ll compare their total runtimes

      4. Then I''ll determine which is longer


      Step 1: Gardish runtime

      - This is a 1993 Hindi film

      - After checking reliable sources, its runtime is approximately 135 minutes


      Step 2: Executioners from Shaolin runtime

      - This is a 1977 Hong Kong martial arts film

      - After checking reliable sources, its runtime is approximately 98 minutes


      Step 3: Comparison

      - Gardish: 135 minutes

      - Executioners from Shaolin: 98 minutes

      - 135 > 98


      Step 4: Determination

      Gardish has a longer total runtime than Executioners from Shaolin.
