      was released on his album *Nightwatch*, which came out in **1978**. However,
      the song was originally written by Kenny Loggins and Michael McDonald, and the
      version by The Doobie Brothers (with McDonald on vocals) was released in **1978**
      as well, on their album *Minute by Minute*.


      2. *Last Dance* by Donna Summer was released in **1978** as part of the *Thank
      God It''s Friday* soundtrack.


      3. Since both songs were released in 1978, we need to determine which came later.


      4. *Last Dance* was released as a single in **July 1978**.


      5. *What a Fool Believes* (the Doobie Brothers'' version, the most widely recognized),
      was released as a single in **January 1979**, meaning it came after *Last Dance*.
      However, Loggins''s version was on his *Nightwatch* album, which was released
      in **July 1978**, around the same time as *Last Dance*.


      6. Since the question specifically asks about *Kenny Loggins''s* version, and
      his album *Nightwatch* was released in **July 1978**, the same month as *Last
      Dance*, it is difficult to determine an exact order. However, if we assume *Last
      Dance* was released slightly earlier within that month, it might have preceded
      Loggins''s album.


      ### Final Answer: **NO**'
    e42b422d-4840-407d-9fe3-64ca82a95495: "1. *What a Fool Believes* by Kenny Loggins\
      \ was released on his album *Nightwatch* in 1978. However, the song was more\
      \ famously recorded by The Doobie Brothers, who released it as a single in January\
      \ 1979.  \n2. *Last Dance* by Donna Summer was released in 1978 as part of the\
      \ *Thank God It's Friday* soundtrack and became a hit that same year.  \n\n\
      Since *Last Dance* was released in 1978 and Kenny Loggins's version of *What\
      \ a Fool Believes* was also in 1978, the timing is close. However, *Last Dance*\
      \ came out earlier in the year, while *What a Fool Believes* (whether Loggins's\
      \ version or The Doobie Brothers' hit version) gained prominence later.  \n\n\
      Thus, the answer is **NO**\u2014*What a Fool Believes* was not released later\
      \ than *Last Dance* in a definitive sense."
    e9366ad7-4d21-4e2a-976f-4c7a2aed2db7: "1. *Last Dance* by Donna Summer was released\

      \ in December 1978.  \n4. Kenny Loggins also recorded his own version, which\
      \ appeared on his album *Nightwatch*, released in July 1978.  \n\nNow, comparing\
      \ the two:  \n- *Last Dance* (1978) vs. *What a Fool Believes* (Kenny Loggins's\
      \ version, July 1978).  \n- Since July 1978 is not \"later than\" 1978 without\
      \ further clarification, we compare specific dates.  \n- *Last Dance* was part\
      \ of the *Thank God It's Friday* soundtrack, which was released in May 1978.\
      \  \n\nSince May 1978 is earlier than July 1978, the answer is **YES**\u2014\

      \ 1967**.\n\nStep 3: Compare the dates.  \n- Both songs were released in January\
      \ 1967. However, since *The Doors* album was released on January 4, 1967, and\
      \ *I Think We're Alone Now* was released at some point in January without a\
      \ specific earlier date, we can reasonably assume *I Think We're Alone Now*\
      \ came **later** in the month.\n\nFinal Answer: **YES**."
    ff92f87d-c101-4958-86d8-63ac8304c378: "1. *The End* by The Doors is from their\
      \ debut album, *The Doors*, which was released on **January 4, 1967**.\n2. *I\
      \ Think We're Alone Now* by Tommy James and the Shondells was released as a\
      \ single in **January 1967** and later appeared on their album of the same name\
      \ in **April 1967**.\n3. Since both songs were released in early 1967, we compare\
      \ their dates:\n   - *The End* was available as part of *The Doors* album on\
      \ **January 4, 1967**.\n   - *I Think We're Alone Now* was released as a single\
      \ sometime in **January 1967**, but no exact day is specified.\n\nGiven that\
      \ *The End* had a confirmed release on **January 4, 1967**, and *I Think We're\
      \ Alone Now* was released sometime later that same month, it is reasonable to\
      \ conclude that *I Think We're Alone Now* was released **after** *The End*.\n\
