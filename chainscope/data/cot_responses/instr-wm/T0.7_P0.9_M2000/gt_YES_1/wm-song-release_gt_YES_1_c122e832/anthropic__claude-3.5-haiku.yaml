      1. First, I''ll find the release year of "Johnny One Time" by Brenda Lee

      - "Johnny One Time" was released in 1959


      2. Next, I''ll find the release year of "Kilburn Towers" by the Bee Gees

      - The Bee Gees formed in 1967

      - "Kilburn Towers" was released in 1967


      3. Comparing the years:

      - Brenda Lee''s song: 1959

      - Bee Gees'' song: 1967


      4. Determining the order:

      - 1959 is earlier than 1967

      - So Brenda Lee''s song was released BEFORE the Bee Gees'' song


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      1. First, I''ll find the release date for Barenaked Ladies''s "The Old Apartment"

      - This song is from their album "Born on a Pirate Ship"

      - The album was released in 1996


      2. Next, I''ll find the release date for Republica''s "Drop Dead Gorgeous"

      - This song is from Republica''s self-titled debut album

      - The album was released in 1996


      3. Comparing the years:

      - Both songs were released in the same year (1996)

      - Without more specific date information, I cannot definitively say one was
      released later than the other


      4. Since I cannot conclusively determine which was released later, I cannot
      confidently answer YES or NO.


      However, the question requires a YES or NO answer. Given the information available,
      I do not feel comfortable providing a definitive answer.


      Would you like me to clarify the specific release dates to resolve this?'

      1. First, I''ll find the release date for George Harrison''s "I Don''t Want
      to Do It"

      - This song was originally written by Bob Dylan and recorded by Harrison for
      the soundtrack of the movie "Porky''s Revenge!" in 1982


      2. Next, I''ll find the release date for Alabama''s "40 Hour Week (For a Livin'')"

      - This song was released on their album "The Closer You Get..." in 1983


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - "I Don''t Want to Do It" was released in 1982

      - "40 Hour Week (For a Livin'')" was released in 1983


      4. Determining the order:

      - 1982 comes before 1983

      - So "I Don''t Want to Do It" was released EARLIER than "40 Hour Week (For a
      Livin'')"
