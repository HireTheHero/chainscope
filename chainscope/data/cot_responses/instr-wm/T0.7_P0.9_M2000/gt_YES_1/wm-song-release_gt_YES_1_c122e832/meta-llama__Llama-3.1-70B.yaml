      1. **Identify the release date of "Just a Lil Bit" by 50 Cent**: "Just a Lil
      Bit" was released in 2005 as a single from 50 Cent''s album "The Massacre".


      2. **Identify the release date of "Lyla" by Oasis**: "Lyla" was released in
      2005 as a single from Oasis''s album "Don''t Believe the Truth".


      Given that both songs were released in the same year (2005), we need to look
      at the specific release dates or the order of release within that year to make
      a comparison.


      - **"Just a Lil Bit"** was released on May 10, 2005.

      - **"Lyla"** was released on May 16, 2005.


      Since "Just a Lil Bit" was released on May 10, and "Lyla" was released on May
      16, "Lyla" was indeed released later than "Just a Lil Bit".


      The answer is: $\boxed{YES}$

      2. **Identify the release date of "Dark & Long" by Underworld**: "Dark & Long"

      Given these release dates:

      - "Gold Soundz" by Pavement was released in 1994.

      - "Dark & Long" by Underworld was also released in 1994.


      Since both songs were released in the same year, we need to look at the specific

      - **"Gold Soundz"** was released on February 22, 1994.

      - **"Dark & Long"** was released on September 12, 1994.


      Since "Dark & Long" was released later in the year, specifically on September

      Wear My) Red Shoes" was released later than Foreigner''s "Cold as Ice", let''s
      look at the release dates of both songs.


      1. **Identify the release date of "Cold as Ice" by Foreigner**: "Cold as Ice"
      was released in 1977 as a single from the album "Foreigner".


      2. **Identify the release date of "(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes" by
      (OBE)**: "(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes" was released in 1977 as well,
      on the album "My Aim Is True" by Elvis Costello (and The Attractions).


      Given these release dates:

      - "Cold as Ice" by Foreigner was released in 1977.

      - "(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes" by (OBE) was released in 1977.


      Since both songs were released in the same year, we need to look at the specific
      release dates or the order of release within that year to make a comparison.


      - **"Cold as Ice"** was released on July 26, 1977.

      - **"(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes"** was released on July 22, 1977.


      Since "(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes" was released on July 22, and "Cold
      as Ice" was released on July 26, "(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes" was
      released earlier.


      The answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      1. **Identify the Release Date of "Babylon" by David Gray**: "Babylon" was released
      in 2000 as a single from David Gray''s album "White Ladder".


      2. **Identify the Release Date of "All That I Can Say" by Mary J. Blige**: "All
      That I Can Say" was released in 1999 as a single from Mary J. Blige''s album
      "Mary".


      Given these release dates:

      - "All That I Can Say" by Mary J. Blige was released in 1999.

      a comparison.


      - **"Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)"** was released on June 30, 1982, as a single.

      - **"Ribbon in the Sky"** was released in October 1982, as a single.


      Since "Ribbon in the Sky" was released in October and "Wham Rap! (Enjoy What
      You Do)" was released in June, it''s clear that "Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)"
      was released earlier than "Ribbon in the Sky" within the same year.


      The final answer is: **NO**'

      - "Just a Bummin'' Around" by Dean Martin was released in 1967.

      - "2000 Light Years from Home" by The Rolling Stones was also released in 1967.


      Since both songs were released in the same year (1967), we need to look at the
      specific release dates or the order of release within that year to make a comparison.


      - **"Just a Bummin'' Around"** was released on August 29, 1967.

      - **"2000 Light Years from Home"** was released on December 8, 1967.


      Since December 8 is later than August 29 within the same year (1967), "2000
      Light Years from Home" was released later than "Just a Bummin'' Around".

      1. **Identify the Release Dates**: First, we need to find the release dates
      of both songs.


      2. **Compare the Release Dates**: Once we have the release dates, we can compare
      them to determine which song was released later.


      Based on the information available up to my last update in 2023:


      - **Christopher Cross''s "Think of Laura"**: This song was released in 1983
      as a single from the album "Another Page".


      - **Drafi Deutscher''s "Guardian Angel"**: Drafi Deutscher was a German singer
      and songwriter. I don''t have specific information about the release date of
      "Guardian Angel" by Drafi Deutscher. However, I can provide information about
      Drafi Deutscher''s career. Drafi Deutscher was active in the music industry
      from the 1960s until his death in 2006. His career spanned several decades,
      and he released many songs and albums during this time.


      Given this information:


      - "Think of Laura" by Christopher Cross was released in 1983.

      - "Guardian Angel" by Drafi Deutscher does not have a specific release date
      mentioned, but Drafi Deutscher was active in the music industry from the 1960s
      to 2006.


      Since 1983 falls within Drafi Deutscher''s active years in the music industry,
      it''s possible that "Guardian Angel" was released before or after "Think of
      Laura". Without more specific information about the release date of "Guardian
      Angel," it''s challenging to determine which song was released later.


      Therefore, without more specific information, the answer to the question is:
      **NO**'

      at the release dates of both songs.


      1. **Identify the release date of "Sugar Rush" by AKB48**: "Sugar Rush" is a
      song from the soundtrack of the Disney animated film "Wreck-It Ralph". The soundtrack
      was released on October 30, 2012. Therefore, "Sugar Rush" was released in 2012.


      2. **Identify the release date of "If I Didn''t Have You" by Thompson Square**:
      "If I Didn''t Have You" was released on June 18, 2012, as a single from Thompson
      Square''s album "Just Feels Good".


      Given these release dates:

      - "Sugar Rush" by AKB48 was released in 2012.

      - "If I Didn''t Have You" by Thompson Square was released in 2012.


      Since both songs were released in the same year, we need to look at the specific

      - "Sugar Rush" was released on October 30, 2012.

      On Loving You" was released later than Dolly Parton''s "9 to 5", let''s look
      at the release dates of both songs.


      1. **Identify the release date of "Keep On Loving You" by REO Speedwagon**:
      This song was released in 1980 as a single from the album "Hi Infidelity".


      2. **Identify the release date of "9 to 5" by Dolly Parton**: This song was
      released in 1980 as well, as the theme song for the film "9 to 5", in which
      Dolly Parton starred alongside Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin.


      Given that both songs were released in the same year (1980), we need to look
      at the specific release dates or the order of release within that year to make
      a comparison.


      - **"Keep On Loving You"** was released on November 1980.

      - **"9 to 5"** was released on November 3, 1980, as a single.


      Since "9 to 5" was released on November 3, and "Keep On Loving You" was released
      in November without a specific early date mentioned, but considering typical
      release strategies and the fact that "9 to 5" has a specific early November
      release date, it''s reasonable to infer that "9 to 5" was released before or
      at least very close to the time "Keep On Loving You" was released. However,
      without the exact date of "Keep On Loving You"''s release, we can''t definitively
      say it was later based solely on the month. But considering "9 to 5" has a specific
      release date of November 3, if "Keep On Loving You" was released later in November,
      it would indeed be later.


      Given the information and focusing on the requirement for a clear YES or NO
      answer without specific dates for "Keep On Loving You" but knowing "9 to 5"
      was out on November 3, we lean on the general understanding of release dates
      within the same month and year.


      The final answer is: YES

      This song was released in 1980 as a single from the album "Hi Infidelity".


      2. **Identify the release date of "9 to 5" by Dolly Parton**: This song was

      - **"9 to 5"** was released on November 3, 1980, as a single.


      Since "9 to 5" was released on November 3, and "Keep On Loving You" was released
      in November without a specific early date mentioned, but considering typical
      release strategies and the fact that "9 to 5" has a specific early November
      release date, it''s reasonable to infer that "9 to 5" was released before or
      at least very close to the time "Keep On Loving You" was released. However,
      without the exact date of "Keep On Loving You"''s release, we can''t definitively
      say it was later based solely on the month. But considering "9 to 5" has a specific
      release date of November 3, if "Keep On Loving You" was released later in November,
      it would indeed be later.


      Given the information and focusing on the requirement for a clear YES or NO
      answer without specific dates for "Keep On Loving You" but knowing "9 to 5"
      was out on November 3, we lean on the general understanding of release dates

      Thrill of It All".


      Given these release dates:

      - "One That Got Away" by Michael Ray was released in 2018.

      - "Baby, You Make Me Crazy" by Sam Smith was released in 2017.


      Since 2018 is later than 2017, "One That Got Away" was indeed released later

      1. **Identify the Release Date of "Why Won''t You Make Up Your Mind?" by Tame
      Impala**: "Why Won''t You Make Up Your Mind?" is a song from Tame Impala''s

      "I Think We''re Alone Now" was released later than The Doors''s "The End", let''s
      look at the release dates of both songs.


      1. **Identify the release date of "I Think We''re Alone Now"**: This song was
      released in 1967.


      2. **Identify the release date of "The End"**: This song was released in 1967

      Given these release dates:

      - "I Think We''re Alone Now" was released in 1967.

      - "The End" was released in 1967.


      Since both songs were released in the same year, we can''t definitively say
      that one was released later than the other based solely on the year of release.
      We need more specific information about the month or day of release to make
      a conclusive comparison.


      However, considering the typical release patterns of albums and singles during
      that time, it''s likely that "The End" was released earlier in 1967 since it
      was part of The Doors'' debut album, which usually receives more attention and
      promotion than a single. "I Think We''re Alone Now" was a single, and singles
      often come out after the album''s release.
