    e0a0b08e-6ea1-40d8-bb9e-c65c96294b32: '1. **Find release date of Barenaked Ladies''s
      "The Old Apartment":**  The original studio version was released on their 1992
      album "Gordon".  However, the more popular acoustic version (and likely the
      one most people think of) was released on the 1996 album "Rock Spectacle".


      2. **Find release date of Republica''s "Drop Dead Gorgeous":** This song was
      released in 1996.


      3. **Compare the release dates:**  "The Old Apartment" (studio version) was
      released in 1992, which is earlier than 1996. The acoustic version of "The Old
      Apartment" was released in 1996, the same year as "Drop Dead Gorgeous".  We
      don''t know which one was released first in 1996.  Therefore, the studio version
      was released *earlier*, but the acoustic version may have been released the
      same year or later.


      4. **Answer the question:** Since the question doesn''t specify which version
      of "The Old Apartment", we can''t definitively say it was released *later*.

      3. **Determine which was released later:** While both songs were released in
      the same year, further research shows "Rock Steady" was released in March 1987,
      and "Never Say Goodbye" was released in May 1987.


      Therefore, "Never Say Goodbye" was released *after* "Rock Steady".


      **YES**

      to Somethin''" on June 12, 2007.


      2. **Find release date of Timbaland''s Apologize:** Timbaland''s "Apologize"
      (featuring OneRepublic) was released on Timbaland''s album "Shock Value" on
      April 3, 2007.  However, the more widely known OneRepublic version was released
      on their album "Dreaming Out Loud" on November 17, 2007.


      3. **Compare release dates:** June 12, 2007 (Diamonds) is earlier than November
      17, 2007 (OneRepublic version of Apologize) but later than April 3, 2007 (Timbaland
      version of Apologize).


      Since the question does not specify which version of "Apologize," and both exist,
      we must consider both.  Diamonds was released *after* the Timbaland version,
      making the answer potentially YES.  However, Diamonds was released *before*
      the OneRepublic version, making the answer potentially NO.


      Since both are possible depending on which version is being referred to, the
      question is ambiguous. However, if we assume the more popular OneRepublic version
      is the intended reference, the answer would be NO.  If we assume the original
      Timbaland version, the answer would be YES.


      Given the ambiguity, while a simple YES/NO is requested, a qualified answer
      is more appropriate.  Therefore, a YES/NO alone is insufficient.  However, if
      forced to answer YES or NO based on the likely intent, NO (referring to the
      OneRepublic version) is the more appropriate choice.


      **So, for a forced YES/NO: NO**

      Video Games:**  Video Games was initially released in June 2011.  The wider
      release and the one generally considered its official release was October 2011.

      2. **Find release date of Zedd''s Shave It:** Shave It was released in October
      2011. (originally as a free download, then commercially later that month).


      3. **Compare the dates:** Both songs were released around October 2011.  While
      Zedd''s *might* have technically been available a few days earlier as a free
      download, the official commercial releases were very close together. For a definitive
      answer, more specific dates within October 2011 would be needed.  However, since
      the question asks if Video Games was released *later* than Shave It, and it''s
      likely they were released extremely close together, the most accurate answer
      based on available information is probably no.

      a song called "I''m Not the Only One" released in 2014 and a song with Normani
      called "Dancing With a Stranger" released in 2019. There may be confusion with
      the Sam Smith song and the song "Drive Me Crazy" by Britney Spears, released

    9bd03a60-16bd-4e0c-8705-fb53a049711c: '1. **Find release date of Michael Ray''s
      One That Got Away:**  A quick search shows it was released in 2017 (specifically,
      June 23, 2017).


      2. **Find release date of Sam Smith''s Baby, You Make Me Crazy:** Sam Smith
      has no song officially titled "Baby, You Make Me Crazy." There''s a song called
      "Make It to Me" released in 2014, but this doesn''t seem to be the intended
      song given the wording of the question.  There is also a song by Sam Smith *featuring*
      Naughty Boy titled "La La La" which contains the lyric "Baby, you make me crazy,"
      but the song is primarily credited to Naughty Boy and was released in 2013.


      3. **Compare the dates:** Assuming the intended song by Sam Smith is "La La
      La" (feat. Naughty Boy) from 2013, then "One That Got Away" (2017) was released
      *after* it. If the target song was "Make It To Me" from 2014, "One That Got
      Away" was *still* released after.

      "One That Got Away":**  A quick search shows it was released in 2017. More specifically,
      January 27, 2017.


      2. **Find release date of Sam Smith''s "Baby, You Make Me Crazy":** This song
      appears to not exist. Sam Smith *does* have a song called "Like I Can", which
      was released in 2014. There''s also a song called "Make It To Me" released in
      2016.  Assuming this is a typo and one of those songs is meant, both are *prior*
      to 2017.


      3. **Compare the dates:** Since "One That Got Away" was released in 2017, and
      any potential Sam Smith song was released earlier, Michael Ray''s song was released
      *later*.

      "One That Got Away":**  A quick search shows it was released in 2017 (specifically,
      June 16, 2017).


      2. **Find release date of Sam Smith''s "Baby, You Make Me Crazy":** This song
      appears to be misattributed. Sam Smith doesn''t have a commercially released
      song with this title. There''s a song called "Make It To Me" from *In the Lonely
      Hour* (2014), and other songs about love and infatuation, but no "Baby, You
      Make Me Crazy".


      3. **Compare release dates (if possible):** Since Sam Smith doesn''t have a
      song with that name, a direct comparison isn''t possible.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.  The question presupposes the existence of
      a Sam Smith song that doesn''t exist, making a chronological comparison impossible.

      to.

      research might be needed to determine if one was released earlier in the month
      than the other. If no further information is found, then it cannot be confirmed.


      NO (with the caveat that they were released the same month and without more

      C''est la Vie:**  C''est la Vie was released in June 1998.

      2. **Find release date of System of a Down''s Sugar:** Sugar was released in
      June 1998. Although on the *System of a Down* album released in 1998, *Sugar*
      was originally released as a single on their 1995 demo tape.  Depending on which
      release is being referenced, the answer changes.

      3. **Compare the dates:** If we are talking about the single, C''est la Vie
      came out later. If we are talking about both tracks appearing on officially
      released albums, they were released around the same time.  Since the question
      doesn''t specify, the most accurate answer based on the official album release
      would be approximately the same time.

      Since both songs were released in the same month, further research is needed

      regarding "later than", the answer is potentially NO, unless more specific release
      dates within June 1998 can be found.  It''s possible they were released on the

      Since they were both released in June 1998, further information is needed to
      determine which was released *later* in the month.  Without that information,
      a definitive YES or NO is impossible.  However, if the question is interpreted
      as "Was C''est la Vie released *after* Sugar?", and "after" means at any point
      after, even in the same month, then further research shows C''est la Vie was
      released June 5th, 1998 and Sugar was released June 29th, 1998.




      Therefore, C''est la Vie was released *earlier* than Sugar.
