      - It was released in 1982 as part of his album "Original Musiquarium I"


      2. Let me find the release date of "Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)" by Wham!

      - It was first released in June 1982

      - It was later re-released in January 1983

      - Even the re-release of Wham Rap! was in 1983, which is later than Ribbon in

      album


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - Both songs were actually released in 1991

      - However, "I Lost My Little Girl" was written much earlier in 1956


      4. Since we''re specifically asking about release dates and both were released
      in the same year, I need to check the specific months

      - "Love and Understanding" was released in June 1991

      - "Unplugged" album was released in May 1991


      Therefore: NO (Cher''s song was not released later than McCartney''s song)'

      1. First, let me find when "Love and Understanding" by Cher was released

      - It was released in 1991 as a single from her album "It''s a Man''s World"


      2. Next, let me find when "I Lost My Little Girl" by Paul McCartney was released

      - This was actually the first song McCartney ever wrote

      - He wrote it in 1956 when he was 14 years old

      - It was officially released in 1991 on his "Unplugged (The Official Bootleg)"
      album


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - Both songs were actually released in 1991

      - However, "I Lost My Little Girl" was written much earlier in 1956

      - The question specifically asks about release dates, not when they were written


      4. Since both were released in 1991, I need to check the specific months

      - However, even without that detail, since they were released the same year,
      Cher''s song cannot be "later than" McCartney''s song


      NO'
