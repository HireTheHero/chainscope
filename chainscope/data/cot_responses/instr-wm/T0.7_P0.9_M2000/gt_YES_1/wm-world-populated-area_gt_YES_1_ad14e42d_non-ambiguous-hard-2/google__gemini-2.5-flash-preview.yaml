    ea8bc685-0669-4665-97f0-93859a869cc9: '1.  Identify the two places being compared:
      Yunnan and Wagoner County, Oklahoma.

      2.  Determine the geographical scale of each place. Wagoner County is a county
      in the US state of Oklahoma. Yunnan is a province in China.

      3.  Recall or look up the typical size difference between a province in a large
      country like China and a county in a US state. Provinces are generally much
      larger than counties.

      4.  Confirm the relative areas. Yunnan has an area of approximately 383,000
      square kilometers. Wagoner County, Oklahoma has an area of approximately 574
      square miles (about 1,487 square kilometers).

      5.  Compare the two areas: 383,000 sq km (Yunnan) vs 1,487 sq km (Wagoner County).

      6.  Conclusion: Yunnan is significantly larger than Wagoner County.


      YES'
