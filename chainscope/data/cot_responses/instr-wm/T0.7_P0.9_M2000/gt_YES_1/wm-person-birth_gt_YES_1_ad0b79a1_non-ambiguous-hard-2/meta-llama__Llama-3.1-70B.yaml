      3. **Comparison**: Given that Bridget of York was born in 1480 and Guillaume
      Arrufat lived in the 16th century, it''s likely that Guillaume Arrufat was born
      before Bridget of York. This is because the 16th century encompasses the years
      1501 to 1600, and Bridget of York was born in 1480, which is earlier.

      3. **Comparison**: Given that both figures lived in different centuries (12th
      century for Berengar I and 11th century for Gerard I), it is likely that Berengar
      I, Count of Sulzbach, was born later than Gerard I of Toul.

      \ Petru Aron, lived in the 15th century. He was a prince (voivode) of Moldavia,\
      \ ruling at different times between 1451 and 1457, and then briefly in 1454-1455,\
      \ and again from 1455 until his death in 1457.\n\n2. **Identify Gervais de Ch\xE2\
      teau-du-Loir**: Gervais de Ch\xE2teau-du-Loir was a French nobleman. Without\
      \ specific details on his birth and death dates in the initial query, we must\
      \ consider historical figures with similar names or titles, but given the name,\
      \ it suggests a connection to the Ch\xE2teau-du-Loir, which has historical significance.\
      \ However, without a specific birth date, this step requires more research.\
      \ Typically, nobles with such specific titles are associated with medieval times,\
      \ but the exact dates can vary widely.\n\n3. **Research Specific Dates**:\n\
      \   - **Petru III of Moldavia (Petru Aron)**: Born around 1422-1423.\n   - **Gervais\
      \ de Ch\xE2teau-du-Loir**: Without a precise historical figure matching this\
      \ name and providing birth and death dates, it's challenging to proceed directly.\
      \ However, for the sake of this comparison, let's assume we're discussing a\
      \ figure from a similar medieval period, potentially in the 14th or 15th century,\
      \ given the nature of historical records and the specificity of the title.\n\
      \n4. **Comparison**:\n   - If Gervais de Ch\xE2teau-du-Loir was born in the\
      \ early 15th century or before, Petru III of Moldavia, born around 1422-1423,\
      \ would be born later.\n   - Without exact dates for Gervais, the comparison\
      \ relies on the assumption of his birth period. Given the typical range for\
      \ such nobility, it's plausible that Gervais could have been born before Petru\
      \ III, especially if we consider the possibility of him being from an earlier\

      \ Guillaume de Harsigny was a French nobleman. Without specific details on his\

      \ with similar names or titles, but given the name, it suggests a connection\
      \ to the Harsigny family, which has historical significance. However, without\
      \ a specific birth date, this step requires more research. Typically, nobles\
      \ with such specific titles are associated with medieval times, but the exact\
      \ dates can vary widely.\n\n3. **Research Specific Dates**:\n   - **Giovanni\

      \ a precise historical figure matching this name and providing birth and death\

      \ period, potentially in the 14th or 15th century, given the nature of historical\
