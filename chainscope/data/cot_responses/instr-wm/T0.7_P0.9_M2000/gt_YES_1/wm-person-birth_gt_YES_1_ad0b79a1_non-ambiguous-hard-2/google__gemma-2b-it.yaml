      so we cannot determine his exact birthdate.

      * Lorenzo Salimbeni''s date of birth is not explicitly mentioned in the context,
      so we cannot determine his exact birthdate.


      **Step 2:** Analyze the relationship between the two individuals.


      * Konstantin Thon and Lorenzo Salimbeni were contemporaries, meaning they lived
      around the same time.

      * However, their exact dates of birth are not provided in the context, so we
      cannot conclude their relationship.
