      3.  **Compare the birth years:** 1855 is numerically larger than 1587 (or 1589).

      4.  **Conclusion:** A later year means someone was born later. Therefore, Jesko
      Albert Eugen von Puttkamer (born 1855) was born later than Filippo Napoletano
      (born c. 1587/1589).

      \ and the father of the famous Hywel Dda (Hywel the Good). Llywelyn's father,\
      \ Merfyn Frych, died in 844 AD. Llywelyn's son, Hywel Dda, was born around 880\

    f8a30b4f-d498-46db-92e4-f0593f66ce59: 'Okay, let''s break this down:


      1.  **Identify Li Linfu:** Li Linfu was a prominent chancellor during the Tang
      Dynasty in China. He died in 752 or 753 AD. While his exact birth year isn''t
      universally agreed upon, historical estimates place it around 683 AD or the
      late 680s.

      2.  **Identify Llywelyn ap Merfyn:** Llywelyn ap Merfyn was a Welsh figure,
      the father of the famous king Hywel Dda (Hywel the Good). Hywel Dda died around
      950 AD. Llywelyn ap Merfyn''s father, Merfyn ap Rhodri, died around 900 AD,
      and Llywelyn himself likely died around 904 AD. This places Llywelyn ap Merfyn''s
      life firmly in the late 9th and early 10th centuries. His birth would likely
      be in the mid-to-late 9th century (e.g., sometime between 850 and 880 AD).

      3.  **Compare the time periods:** Li Linfu lived primarily in the late 7th and
      first half of the 8th century (born c. 683, died 752/753). Llywelyn ap Merfyn
      lived primarily in the late 9th and very early 10th century (born c. mid-late
      800s, died c. 904).

      4.  **Conclusion:** Llywelyn ap Merfyn''s estimated birth period (mid-late 9th
      century) is significantly later than Li Linfu''s estimated birth period (late
      7th century).

      1.  **Identify Bridget of York''s birth date:** Bridget of York was an English
      princess, the daughter of King Edward IV. She was born on 10 November 1480.

      2.  **Identify Guillaume Arrufat''s birth date:** The most prominent historical
      figure named Guillaume Arrufat (also known as Guillaume Arrufat de Roccafolio)
      was a French cardinal, nephew of Pope Clement V. He was created a cardinal in
      1305 and died in 1311. While his exact birth year isn''t precisely documented,
      he must have been born significantly before 1305, likely in the mid-to-late
      13th century.

      3.  **Compare the dates:** Bridget of York was born in 1480. Guillaume Arrufat
      lived much earlier, dying in 1311 (meaning he was born well before that, in
      the previous century).

      4.  **Conclusion:** 1480 is significantly later than any possible birth year
      for Cardinal Guillaume Arrufat (who died almost 170 years before Bridget was
      born).

      4.  **Find his birth year/period:** Arnold II von Isenburg was Archbishop of
      Trier from 1169 until his death in 1183. While his exact birth year isn''t commonly
      cited, he lived and was active in the 12th century. He must have been born well
      before 1169, likely in the first half of the 12th century.

      5.  **Compare the birth dates/periods:** James Douglas (born c. 1426) was born
      in the 15th century. Arnold II von Isenburg (died 1183) was born in the 12th
      century.

      6.  **Conclusion:** The 15th century (1426) is later than the 12th century.

      1.  **Identify the first figure:** Carlo Maderno.

      2.  **Find Carlo Maderno''s birth year:** Carlo Maderno was born in 1556.

      3.  **Identify the second figure:** Saint Arsenije I Sremac.

      4.  **Find Saint Arsenije I Sremac''s birth year/period:** Saint Arsenije I
      Sremac lived in the 13th century. While his exact birth year is unknown, he
      died in 1266 and served as the second Archbishop of the Serbian Orthodox Church
      from 1233 to 1263. This firmly places his birth in the 13th century (1200s),
      or possibly the very late 12th century.

      5.  **Compare the birth years/periods:** Carlo Maderno''s birth year (1556)
