      1. To answer this, I''ll need to know the birth dates of both Bernard II, Lord
      of Lippe and Hartwig von Passau.


      2. Bernard II, Lord of Lippe was a medieval nobleman who lived in the late 12th/early
      13th century (around 1190-1225).


      3. Hartwig von Passau was a historical figure from the same general time period,
      who was a bishop of Passau in the late 12th century (around 1164-1206).


      4. Given their overlapping time periods, I would need precise birth dates to
      definitively say who was born later.


      5. However, based on the available historical information, Hartwig von Passau
      seems to have been active slightly earlier than Bernard II, Lord of Lippe.


      6. This suggests Hartwig was likely born earlier than Bernard.


      Therefore, my answer is: NO, Bernard II, Lord of Lippe was NOT born later than
      Hartwig von Passau.'

      1. Phillis Wheatley:

      - Phillis Wheatley was an African-born American poet

      - She was born in West Africa around 1753

      - She was brought to Boston as a slave in 1761

      - She became the first published African-American woman poet


      2. Viola of Teschen:

      - Viola of Teschen was a Silesian princess

      - She lived from 1290 to 1317

      - She was a member of the Piast dynasty


      3. Comparing their birth years:

      Let me research these dates:

      - Eduard Duller was a Czech writer and historian, born in 1804.

      - Marie de Coucy was a medieval French noblewoman who lived in the 13th century,
