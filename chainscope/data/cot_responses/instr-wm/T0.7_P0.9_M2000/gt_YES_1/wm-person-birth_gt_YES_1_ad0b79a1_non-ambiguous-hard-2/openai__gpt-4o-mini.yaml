      1. **Odo, Count of Champagne**: Odo was born around 1030 and died in 1115. His
      lifetime falls within the 11th to early 12th century.


      2. **Sebastian Peregrin Zwyer**: He was born in 1500 and died in 1558.

      - Sebastian Peregrin Zwyer was born in 1500.


      Since 1500 is later than 1030, Sebastian Peregrin Zwyer was indeed born later

      figure, and historical records indicate that he was born in the late 15th century,
      specifically around 1450.


      3. **Compare the two dates**: Now we compare the two birth years. Roger Niger
      (circa 1160) was born in the 12th century, while Jacobus Voorda (circa 1450)
      was born in the 15th century.


      Since 1450 is later than 1160, we conclude that Jacobus Voorda was indeed born
      later than Roger Niger.

      1. **Identify the birth year of Roger Niger**: Roger Niger was an English writer
      and scholar known to have lived during the 12th century. His exact birth year
      is not precisely documented, but he is generally believed to have been active
      around the early to mid-1100s.


      2. **Identify the birth year of Jacobus Voorda**: Jacobus Voorda was a Dutch
      humanist and scholar who was born in the early 16th century, specifically around
      1490.


      3. **Compare the birth years**: Since Roger Niger is from the 12th century (around
      the 1100s) and Jacobus Voorda was born in the 1490s, it is clear that Jacobus
      Voorda was born significantly later than Roger Niger.
