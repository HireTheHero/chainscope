      1. **Louis King**: Since "Louis King" is a generic name, it''s important to
      identify which Louis King you are referring to. However, assuming you mean a
      prominent historical figure with the name "Louis King," it is likely you are
      referring to Louis XIV of France, known as Louis the Great or the Sun King,
      who was born on September 5, 1638.


      2. **Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt**: He was a Prince-Bishop of Bamberg,
      born on September 20, 1577.


      Now, comparing the birth years:

      - Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt was born in 1577.

      - Louis XIV (if this is the correct Louis King you are referring to) was born
      in 1638.

      Given the lack of information on Albert Windey, and assuming there is no prominent
      historical figure by this name, we cannot definitively compare his birth year

      NO, we cannot determine if Albert Windey was born later than Franciscus Titelmans
      without more context or information about Albert Windey.'

      Windey was born later than Franciscus Titelmans, we need to determine the birth
      years of both individuals.


      1. Franciscus Titelmans was born in 1502. He was a Flemish Franciscan philosopher
      and theologian.


      2. Albert Windey was born in 1910. He was a Belgian Jesuit priest and social
      worker known for his efforts in community development.


      Now, we compare the two birth years:


      - Franciscus Titelmans: 1502

      - Albert Windey: 1910


      Albert Windey was indeed born later than Franciscus Titelmans.

      Given the information available, without a known birth year for Albert Windey,

      Given that Franciscus Titelmans was born in 1502, unless Albert Windey is a

      to assume that any such figure named Albert Windey, if existing in a historical

      a member of the English royal family, the daughter of King Edward IV of England.


      2. **Guillaume Arrufat**: There is limited information readily available about
      a historical figure named Guillaume Arrufat. However, it is possible that this
      refers to a figure from an earlier period, possibly a medieval figure. Without
      specific details, we can make an educated guess based on the commonality of
      the name and historical context.


      Given these points, and without specific birth information for Guillaume Arrufat,
      historical naming conventions suggest that Guillaume Arrufat would likely be
      from an earlier medieval period, potentially prior to the late 15th century.


      Therefore, based on this reasoning, Bridget of York was likely born later than
      Guillaume Arrufat.


      **YES**, Bridget of York was born later than Guillaume Arrufat.'
    d620a3cd-7a60-4bf1-b71e-199c1bc7dda9: 'To determine whether Bridget of York was
      born later than Guillaume Arrufat, we need to consider their birthdates:


      1. **Bridget of York**: She was born on November 10, 1480. Bridget of York was
      an English princess, the seventh daughter of King Edward IV of England.


      2. **Guillaume Arrufat**: He was a French cardinal who lived during the 14th
      century. His birthdate is not precisely documented, but he was active in the
      early 1300s and died in 1311.


      Given that Guillaume Arrufat was active and died in the early 14th century,
      it is clear that he was born well before Bridget of York, who was born in the
      late 15th century.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is **YES**, Bridget of York was born later
      than Guillaume Arrufat.'

      Now we compare the two birth years:


      - Jacques of Savoy, Count of Romont, was born in 1450.

      - Malatesta Ungaro was born in 1327.


      Since 1450 is later than 1327, Jacques of Savoy, Count of Romont was indeed
      born later than Malatesta Ungaro.


      The answer is: YES.'
