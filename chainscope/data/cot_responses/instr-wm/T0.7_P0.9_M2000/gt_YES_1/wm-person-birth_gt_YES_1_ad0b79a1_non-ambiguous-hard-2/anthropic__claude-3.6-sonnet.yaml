      1. First, let me recall when Hermann Bonitz lived

      - Hermann Bonitz lived from 1814 to 1888


      2. Now, let me recall when Johann Spies lived

      - Johann Spies lived in the 16th century

      - He died in 1594

      - He was born around the mid-16th century


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - Spies: mid-16th century (around 1550s) to 1594

      - Bonitz: 1814 to 1888

      - There''s approximately 250-260 years between them


      4. Since Bonitz was born in 1814, and Spies died in 1594 (having been born earlier
      in the 16th century), Bonitz was clearly born later.

      1) Adam Friedrich Glafey was a German jurist and historian who lived from 1692
      to 1753.


      2) Stephen Hagiochristophorites was a Byzantine official who died in 1185. He
      was active during the reign of Andronikos I Komnenos.


      3) Since Hagiochristophorites died in 1185, he must have been born sometime
      before that, likely in the early or mid-12th century.


      4) Glafey was born in 1692, which is about 500 years after Hagiochristophorites
      died.


      Therefore:

      - Stephen Hagiochristophorites was a Byzantine official who died in 1185

      - He was active in the late 12th century, so he was born sometime in the mid-12th

      - Arnold II von Isenburg was born around 1341


      3. Now let me compare:

      - 1426 (James Douglas) is later than 1341 (Arnold von Isenburg)

      - The difference is about 85 years

      - James Douglas was born several decades after Arnold von Isenburg


      Therefore:


      YES'

      3. Now I can compare:

      - 1747 is later than 1275

      3. To determine who was born later, I need to compare these dates:

      - 1904 comes after 1646 chronologically

      - Therefore, Jacques Tourneur was born later


      4. Since Tourneur (1904) was born centuries after Weissenkircher (1646), the
      answer is clear.


      YES'

      2. Let me find when Saint Arsenije I Sremac was born

      - Arsenije I Sremac died in 1266

      - While his exact birth date is not known, he lived in the 13th century

      - Even if he was born at the very end of the 12th century, it would still be
      before 1200


      3. Compare the dates

      - Arsenije I Sremac: born before 1200, died 1266

      - Carlo Maderno: born 1556

      - 1556 is clearly later than any possible birth date for Arsenije I Sremac

      3. Comparing the birth years:

      - Park Won-soon: 1956

      - Justus Menius: 1499


      4. 1956 comes after 1499, meaning Park Won-soon was born later.
