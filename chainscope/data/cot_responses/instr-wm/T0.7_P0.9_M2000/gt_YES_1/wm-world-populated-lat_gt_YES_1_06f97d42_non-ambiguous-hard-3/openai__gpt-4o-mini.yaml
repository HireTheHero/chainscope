      2. **Identify Agame**: Agame may refer to various locations or regions, but
      it is not a widely recognized name like Nala Local Municipality. If we consider
      Agame within the context of South Africa, there is no notable place directly
      named Agame in the vicinity of the Free State.


      3. **Geographical Relations**: Since the specific location of Agame is unclear
      and seems less prominent compared to Nala Local Municipality, it is difficult
      to ascertain its exact position relative to Nala.


      Based on the information available, without a clear identification of Agame
      or its location, I cannot definitively state if it is located north of Nala
      Local Municipality.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO** (based on the assumption that Agame is not
      recognized as a notable place in relation to Nala Local Municipality).'
    c9fe81ac-daad-4ddf-a019-5fce0b4ae0da: 'To determine if Agame is located north
      of Nala Local Municipality, we need to identify the geographical positions of
      both places.


      1. **Identify Agame**: Agame is a town in the Tigray region of Ethiopia.


      2. **Identify Nala Local Municipality**: Nala Local Municipality is located
      in South Africa, specifically in the Free State province.


      3. **Geographical Context**: Since Agame is in Ethiopia and Nala Local Municipality
      is in South Africa, we need to consider the overall geography of both countries.


      4. **Relative Position**: Ethiopia is located to the north of South Africa.
      Therefore, any location in Ethiopia, including Agame, would be situated north
      of any location in South Africa, including Nala Local Municipality.


      Based on this reasoning, we can conclude that:


      Agame is indeed located north of Nala Local Municipality.


      The answer is: **YES**.'

      of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong.


      2. **Ranau District**: Ranau is a district located in the state of Sabah in
      Malaysia, on the island of Borneo. It is situated inland and is known for its
      mountainous terrain and proximity to Mount Kinabalu.


      Next, we need to consider the relative positions of these two locations:


      - Fujian is in China, which is to the north of Malaysia.

      - Ranau is in Malaysia, specifically in the northern part of the island of Borneo.


      Since Fujian is located in China and is positioned to the north of Malaysia,
      we can conclude that it is indeed located north of Ranau District.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.'
