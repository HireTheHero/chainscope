      2. **Locate Ranau District**: Ranau is a district in the Malaysian state of
      Sabah, which is on the island of Borneo.


      3. **Determine relative positions**: Fujian, being on the southeastern coast
      of China, is situated north of Borneo, where Ranau District is located.


      Hence, Fujian is indeed located north of Ranau District.


      The answer is: YES.'
    6b7440f8-df38-4863-874e-425b2a5f88c1: 'To determine whether Fujian is located
      north of Ranau District, we need to identify the locations of both places:


      1. Fujian is a province on the southeastern coast of China.

      2. Ranau District is located in the state of Sabah on the island of Borneo,
      which is part of Malaysia.


      Next, we consider their relative positions:


      - Fujian, being in southeastern China, is situated at a more northern latitude
      compared to the island of Borneo.

      - Sabah, where Ranau District is located, lies closer to the equator than Fujian.


      Based on this geographical information, Fujian is indeed located north of Ranau
      District.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.'

      2. **Ranau District**: This is a district in the Malaysian state of Sabah, which
      is on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia.


      Now, we compare their relative positions:


      - Fujian, being in China, is situated much further north compared to the island
      of Borneo, where Ranau District is located.


      Therefore, the answer is YES, Fujian is located north of Ranau District.'
    9ae4b836-ab7d-4a6b-a942-747023894986: 'First, let''s identify the locations in
      question:


      1. **Fujian**: Fujian is a province located on the southeastern coast of China.

      2. **Ranau District**: Ranau is a district located in the Malaysian state of
      Sabah on the island of Borneo.


      Now, let''s determine their relative positions:


      - Fujian, being on the southeastern coast of China, is situated in the northern
      hemisphere, quite far north relative to Borneo.

      - Ranau District, located in Sabah, Malaysia, is situated much closer to the
      equator.


      Comparing the latitudes of the two locations, Fujian is significantly north
      of Ranau District.


      Thus, the answer to the question is: **YES**.'

      2. **Identify the location of Ranau District**: Ranau District is located in
      the Malaysian state of Sabah on the island of Borneo.


      3. **Compare the relative positions**: China, and specifically Fujian, is located
      to the north of Borneo, where Ranau District is situated.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      YES.'
