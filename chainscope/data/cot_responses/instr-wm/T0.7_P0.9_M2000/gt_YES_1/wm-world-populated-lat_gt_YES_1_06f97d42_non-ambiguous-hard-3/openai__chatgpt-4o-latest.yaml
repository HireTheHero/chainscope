    fcdab19d-e647-48f1-908e-eddeae1058ff: "To determine whether Fujian is located\
      \ north of Ranau District, let's go step by step:\n\n1. **Locate Fujian**: Fujian\
      \ is a province on the southeastern coast of China. It faces the Taiwan Strait\
      \ and includes cities like Fuzhou and Xiamen.\n\n2. **Locate Ranau District**:\
      \ Ranau District is located in the Malaysian state of Sabah on the island of\
      \ Borneo. It is situated in the northern part of Borneo, near Mount Kinabalu.\n\
      \n3. **Compare their latitudes**:\n   - Fujian lies roughly between latitudes\
      \ 23\xB0N and 27\xB0N.\n   - Ranau District lies near latitude 6\xB0N.\n\n4.\
      \ **Determine relative position**: Since Fujian is at a significantly higher\
      \ (more northern) latitude than Ranau District, it is geographically north of\
      \ Ranau.\n\nAnswer: **YES**."
