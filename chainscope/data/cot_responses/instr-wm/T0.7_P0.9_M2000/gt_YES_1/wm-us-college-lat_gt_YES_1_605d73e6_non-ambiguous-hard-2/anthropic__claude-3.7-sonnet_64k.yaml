      \ as Selma is at approximately 32.4\xB0 N and Fredericksburg is at approximately\
      \ 30.3\xB0 N.\n\nSo my answer is YES, Selma University, AL is located north\

      \ if there really is a Texas Tech campus in Fredericksburg. I'm not aware of\
      \ one, so it's possible this is a hypothetical question or there's some confusion.\n\
      \nTo my knowledge, Texas Tech University does not have a campus in Fredericksburg,\
      \ TX. Texas Tech's main campus is in Lubbock, with satellite locations in places\

      \ TX. In that case, Selma is indeed north of Fredericksburg.\n\nSo my answer\
      \ remains YES.\n\nHmm, to be extra careful, let me check once more if there's\
      \ any indication of a Texas Tech campus in Fredericksburg that I might have\
      \ missed.\n\nAfter reconsideration, I still don't believe there is a Texas Tech\

      Let me think about the geographic locations of these states in the US:


      North Dakota (ND) is a state in the upper Midwest region of the United States,
      bordering Canada to the north.


      Iowa (IA) is also a Midwestern state, but it''s located south of North Dakota.
      Iowa borders Minnesota to the north, Wisconsin to the northeast, Illinois to
      the east, Missouri to the south, Nebraska to the west, and South Dakota to the
      northwest.


      So just based on the states, North Dakota is definitely north of Iowa.


      Now, let''s consider the specific locations of these universities within their
      states:


      The University of Mary is located in Bismarck, which is the capital city of
      North Dakota. Bismarck is in the south-central part of North Dakota.


      Mount Mercy University is located in Cedar Rapids, which is in the eastern part
      of Iowa.


      Even though the University of Mary is in the southern part of North Dakota,
      North Dakota as a whole is significantly north of Iowa. So the University of
      Mary is almost certainly north of Mount Mercy University.


      Let me confirm this by thinking about the approximate latitudes:


      North Dakota''s southern border is at approximately 46 degrees north latitude.

      Iowa''s northern border is at approximately 43 degrees north latitude.


      So the southernmost part of North Dakota is still north of the northernmost
      part of Iowa. This means that any location in North Dakota, including the University
      of Mary, is north of any location in Iowa, including Mount Mercy University.


      Therefore, the University of Mary, ND is located north of Mount Mercy University,
      IA.

      - North Dakota is in the upper Midwest, bordering Canada

      - Iowa is also in the Midwest, but is located south of North Dakota

      - North Dakota''s southern border is north of Iowa''s northern border


      Step 3: Even though University of Mary is in the southern part of North Dakota,
      and Mount Mercy is in the eastern part of Iowa, the entire state of North Dakota
      lies north of Iowa.


      YES, the University of Mary in North Dakota is located north of Mount Mercy

      Lake Michigan College is located in Michigan, likely near Lake Michigan (as\

      \ Falls, WI is approximately around 44.8\xB0 N latitude\n- Benton Harbor, MI\
      \ is approximately around 42.1\xB0 N latitude\n\nSince 44.8\xB0 N is north of\

      \ University of Advancing Technology (UAT) is located in Tempe, Arizona, which\
      \ is in the Phoenix metropolitan area in central Arizona.\n\n2. Sul Ross State\

      \ state that borders Mexico to the south\n- Generally, Arizona is to the west\
      \ of Texas\n\nHowever, the question isn't about east-west positioning but north-south\

      - The location within each state matters significantly\n\nLet me try to recall\
      \ more specific information:\n- Tempe, AZ is in the Phoenix area in central\
      \ Arizona, at approximately 33.4\xB0 N latitude\n- Alpine, TX (home of Sul Ross\

      \ (30.4\xB0 N), as 33.4 is greater than 30.4.\n\nLet me double-check this reasoning:\n\
      - The Phoenix metropolitan area (including Tempe) is indeed in central Arizona\n\
      - Alpine, TX is in the western part of Texas, in the Big Bend region\n- Central\
      \ Arizona is generally north of the Big Bend region of Texas\n\nBased on my\

      \ than Alpine, Texas. Therefore, the University of Advancing Technology is located\

      \ TX (West Texas)\n- Tempe, AZ is at approximately 33.4\xB0 N latitude\n- Alpine,\
      \ TX is at approximately 30.4\xB0 N latitude\n- Since 33.4 > 30.4, Tempe is\

      Colorado University (in Colorado) is located north of Georgia Military College
      (in Georgia).


      Let me think about the locations of these states:


      - Colorado (CO) is a state in the western United States, in the Rocky Mountain
      region. It''s relatively far north in the US.

      - Georgia (GA) is a state in the southeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean and extending south to Florida. It''s relatively far south in the US.


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - Colorado is definitely north of Georgia on a map of the United States.


      Now, for the specific institutions:

      - Western Colorado University is in Colorado, so it inherits Colorado''s northern
      position

      - Georgia Military College is in Georgia, so it inherits Georgia''s southern
      position


      Since Colorado is north of Georgia, Western Colorado University (in CO) should
      be north of Georgia Military College (in GA).


      To be completely certain, I could try to find the exact latitudes of these institutions,
      but based on state locations alone, I''m confident that Western Colorado University
      is north of Georgia Military College.


      So the answer should be YES.</think># Is Western Colorado University, CO located
      north of Georgia Military College, GA?


      Let me determine this by examining the geographic locations of both institutions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions

      - Colorado is located in the western United States, in the Rocky Mountain region

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, bordering Florida and
      the Atlantic Ocean


      ## Step 2: Compare the states'' latitudes

      - Colorado is positioned significantly farther north than Georgia on the map
      of the United States

      - Georgia is one of the southern states, while Colorado is more centrally positioned
      in terms of north-south orientation


      ## Step 3: Consider the specific institutions

      - Western Colorado University is in Colorado, so it inherits Colorado''s northern
      position

      - Georgia Military College is in Georgia, so it inherits Georgia''s southern
      position


      Since any location in Colorado will be north of virtually any location in Georgia
      due to their geographical positions, Western Colorado University must be north
      of Georgia Military College.

      \ is further north.\n\nLet me think about these locations:\n\nCentral Washington\
      \ University is located in Ellensburg, Washington. Washington state is in the\
      \ northwestern United States, bordering Canada.\n\nBrown College in Minnesota\
      \ - I need to be careful here, as there might be some confusion. There's Brown\
      \ University in Rhode Island, but the question specifically mentions Brown College\
      \ in Minnesota. I need to find information about this institution.\n\nLet me\
      \ consider what I know about Minnesota's geographic location. Minnesota is in\
      \ the northern part of the United States, also bordering Canada. It's in the\
      \ Upper Midwest region.\n\nTo determine which is further north, I need to find\
      \ or estimate the latitude coordinates of both institutions.\n\nCentral Washington\
      \ University in Ellensburg, WA is located at approximately 47\xB0N latitude.\n\
      \nFor Brown College in Minnesota, I need to find its specific location. However,\
      \ I'm not immediately certain about a \"Brown College\" in Minnesota. There's\
      \ a Brown College of Court Reporting in Georgia, and there's also potentially\
      \ been schools that have changed names or merged with other institutions.\n\n\
      Let me think about this. Minnesota is generally between about 43.5\xB0N and\
      \ 49\xB0N latitude. Washington state ranges from about 45.5\xB0N to 49\xB0N\
      \ latitude.\n\nGiven that Central Washington University is in central Washington\
      \ (as the name suggests), it would be roughly in the middle of Washington's\

      \ it could be anywhere in Minnesota's latitude range (43.5\xB0N to 49\xB0N).\n\
      \nWithout knowing the exact location of Brown College in Minnesota, I can't\
      \ give a definitive answer. However, I believe there may have been a \"Brown\
      \ College\" that was a for-profit institution in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area\
      \ of Minnesota. The Twin Cities are located around 45\xB0N latitude.\n\nIf that's\
      \ the case, then Central Washington University (approx. 47\xB0N) would be north\
      \ of Brown College (approx. 45\xB0N).\n\nLet me double-check my knowledge:\n\
      \nCentral Washington University is in Ellensburg, Washington, which is at approximately\
      \ 47\xB0N latitude.\n\nThere was a Brown College in Minnesota, which I believe\
      \ was in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, at approximately 45\xB0N latitude.\n\
      \nTherefore, Central Washington University in Washington would be north of Brown\
      \ College in Minnesota.\n\nHowever, I want to be cautious because I'm not 100%\
      \ certain about the exact location of Brown College in Minnesota, or even if\
      \ it currently exists under that name. If Brown College was/is located in the\
      \ northern part of Minnesota (above 47\xB0N), then my answer would be different.\n\
      \nBased on my best knowledge, I believe Central Washington University, WA is\
      \ located north of Brown College, MN.\n\nActually, let me try to recall more\
      \ precisely. \n\nCentral Washington University is in Ellensburg, Washington,\
      \ which is at approximately 47.0\xB0N latitude.\n\nBrown College in Minnesota\
      \ was located in Mendota Heights, a suburb of St. Paul, which is at approximately\
      \ 44.9\xB0N latitude.\n\nComparing these:\n- Central Washington University:\
      \ ~47.0\xB0N\n- Brown College, MN: ~44.9\xB0N\n\nSince 47.0\xB0N is greater\
      \ than 44.9\xB0N, Central Washington University is further north than Brown\
      \ College, MN.\n\nTherefore, the answer is YES.\n\nActually, let me be even\
      \ more precise and check the exact coordinates:\n\nCentral Washington University\
      \ is in Ellensburg, Washington at approximately 47.0\xB0N latitude.\n\nBased\
      \ on my knowledge, Brown College in Minnesota was located in the Minneapolis-St.\

      \ University in Washington state (WA)\n2. Brown College in Minnesota (MN)\n\n\
      Specifically, I need to determine if Central Washington University is located\
      \ north of Brown College.\n\nLet me think about the locations of these states\
      \ first. Washington state is in the northwest corner of the contiguous United\
      \ States, bordering Canada. Minnesota is in the upper Midwest, also bordering\
      \ Canada.\n\nIn terms of latitude (north-south positioning):\n- Washington state\
      \ extends roughly from 45.5\xB0N to 49\xB0N latitude\n- Minnesota extends roughly\
      \ from 43.5\xB0N to 49.4\xB0N latitude\n\nLooking at these ranges, both states\
      \ extend quite far north, reaching close to the Canadian border. However, I\
      \ need to know the specific locations of these institutions within their states.\n\
      \nCentral Washington University is located in Ellensburg, Washington. Ellensburg\
      \ is in the central part of Washington state, as the university's name suggests.\n\
      \nNow I need to identify Brown College in Minnesota. This is where I need to\
      \ be careful. There's Brown University in Rhode Island, which is well-known,\
      \ but the question specifically mentions Brown College in Minnesota.\n\nAfter\
      \ reflection, I believe Brown College is (or was) a private college in Minnesota.\
      \ Let me try to recall its location within Minnesota.\n\nBrown College was located\
      \ in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area in Minnesota, which is in the\
      \ eastern central part of the state.\n\nNow I need to compare the latitudes:\n\
      - Ellensburg, WA (where Central Washington University is located) is at approximately\
      \ 47.0\xB0N latitude\n- Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN (where Brown College would\
      \ be located) is at approximately 45.0\xB0N latitude\n\nIf these approximations\
      \ are correct, then Central Washington University in Ellensburg, WA would be\
      \ about 2 degrees of latitude north of Brown College in Minneapolis/St. Paul,\
      \ MN.\n\nSo based on this reasoning, Central Washington University is located\
      \ north of Brown College, Minnesota.\n\nLet me double-check this by looking\
      \ at the exact coordinates if I can recall them:\n\nCentral Washington University\
      \ in Ellensburg, WA is located at approximately 47.0\xB0N latitude.\nBrown College\
      \ in the Minneapolis area of Minnesota would be at approximately 45.0\xB0N latitude.\n\
      \nSince 47.0\xB0N is north of 45.0\xB0N, Central Washington University is indeed\
      \ north of Brown College.\n\nTherefore, the answer is YES.\n\nWait, I should\
      \ be more precise about the locations.\n\nCentral Washington University is in\
      \ Ellensburg, Washington, which is at approximately 47.0\xB0N latitude.\n\n\
      Brown College in Minnesota - I believe it had campuses in the Minneapolis area,\
      \ which is at approximately 45.0\xB0N latitude.\n\nSince 47.0\xB0N is north\
      \ of 45.0\xB0N, Central Washington University is indeed north of Brown College.\n\
      \nTherefore, the answer is YES.\n\nActually, let me be even more cautious here.\
      \ Brown College in Minnesota could potentially have multiple campuses, and I'm\
      \ not 100% certain of its precise location(s). The Minneapolis-St. Paul area\
      \ is in the eastern central part of Minnesota, at around 45\xB0N latitude.\n\
      \nCentral Washington University in Ellensburg, WA is at approximately 47\xB0\
      N latitude.\n\nGiven that 47\xB0N is north of 45\xB0N, and assuming Brown College\
      \ is in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, Central Washington University would be\
      \ north of Brown College.\n\nSo the answer would be YES, Central Washington\
      \ University, WA is located north of Brown College, MN.\n\nActually, I realized\
      \ I might be conflating Brown College with other institutions. Let me clarify\
      \ what I know about Brown College in Minnesota.\n\nBrown College was a private,\
      \ for-profit college with campuses in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan\
      \ area of Minnesota. It's possible it has closed or merged with another institution\
      \ since I was last updated.\n\nThe Minneapolis-St. Paul area is located in the\

      \ College in Minnesota has (or had) campuses in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area,\
      \ including locations in Brooklyn Center and Mendota Heights, which are both\
      \ in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area.\n\n- Brooklyn Center, MN is\

      \ 44.9\xB0N latitude\n\nCentral Washington University in Ellensburg, WA is at\
      \ approximately 47.0\xB0N latitude.\n\nSince 47.0\xB0N is north of both 45.1\xB0\

      \nBrown College appears to be located in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan\

      \ state is generally north of Minnesota when looking at a map, but central Washington\
      \ is lower than the northern parts of Minnesota. Minneapolis is in the southern\

      Washington state extends roughly from about 45.5\xB0N to 49\xB0N latitude.\n\

      \ (the Northwest Angle) extends slightly further north than the northernmost\
      \ part of Washington. However, we're comparing specific locations within these\
      \ states.\n\nCentral Washington University is in Ellensburg, which is in the\
      \ central part of Washington state. Its approximate latitude is 47.0\xB0N.\n\
      \nFor Brown College in Minnesota, I'm trying to determine its exact location.\
      \ If it's in the Twin Cities area (Minneapolis-St. Paul), then its latitude\
      \ would be around 45.0\xB0N, which would make it south of Central Washington\
      \ University.\n\nHowever, if Brown College is in a different part of Minnesota,\
      \ especially the northern part, it could potentially be north of 47.0\xB0N.\n\
      \nGiven that most colleges in Minnesota are in more populated areas, and the\
      \ major population centers in Minnesota (like the Twin Cities, Duluth, and Rochester)\
      \ are generally in the southern part of the state, it's likely that Brown College\
      \ is in one of these areas, which would place it south of 47.0\xB0N.\n\nIf Brown\
      \ College is in the Twin Cities area (the most likely scenario), then it's at\
      \ approximately 45.0\xB0N, which is south of Central Washington University at\
      \ 47.0\xB0N.\n\nTherefore, I believe the answer is YES, Central Washington University\
      \ is north of Brown College in Minnesota.\n\nHowever, I should note that I'm\
      \ making an assumption based on the likely location of Brown College in Minnesota.\
      \ Without knowing its exact location, there's a small possibility that this\
      \ answer could be incorrect.\n\nLet me try to think more broadly here. I don't\
      \ know for sure about a \"Brown College\" in Minnesota, so let's consider the\
      \ possibility that the reference might be to another institution.\n\nCollege\
      \ of St. Scholastica in Duluth, MN? Duluth is at approximately 46.8\xB0N, which\
      \ is slightly south of Ellensburg at 47.0\xB0N.\nBemidji State University in\
      \ Bemidji, MN? Bemidji is at approximately 47.5\xB0N, which is slightly north\
      \ of Ellensburg at 47.0\xB0N.\nUniversity of Minnesota Crookston? Crookston\
      \ is at approximately 47.8\xB0N, which is north of Ellensburg at 47.0\xB0N.\n\
      \nSo, if the question is referring to a college in one of the northernmost cities\
      \ of Minnesota, like Bemidji or Crookston, then it's possible that the college\
      \ is north of Central Washington University. However, if the reference is to\
      \ a college in the Twin Cities area or Duluth (which are more populous areas\
      \ with more colleges), then Central Washington University is likely north of\
      \ it.\n\nWithout more specific information about \"Brown College\" in Minnesota,\
      \ I'm inclined to believe it's referring to the for-profit institution that\
      \ was in the Twin Cities area, which would place it south of Central Washington\
      \ University. But I acknowledge there's some uncertainty here.\n\nGiven all\

      \ Paul metropolitan area of Minnesota. Both locations are around 45\xB0 N latitude.\n\
      \nCentral Washington University in Ellensburg, WA is at approximately 47\xB0\
      \ N latitude.\n\nSince 47\xB0 N is further north than 45\xB0 N, Central Washington\
      \ University is indeed located north of Brown College, MN.\n\nTherefore, my\
      \ answer is: YES.\n\nActually, before I finalize my answer, let me double-check\
      \ that I'm not confusing Brown College with any other institution. The question\
      \ specifically asks about Brown College in Minnesota, not Brown University in\
      \ Rhode Island.\n\nBrown College in Minnesota was a for-profit institution that\
      \ was acquired by Globe University/Minnesota School of Business and later closed.\
      \ It had campuses in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.\n\nGiven this information,\
      \ and comparing the latitudes of:\n- Central Washington University (Ellensburg,\
      \ WA): ~47\xB0 N\n- Brown College (Minneapolis-St. Paul area, MN): ~45\xB0 N\n\
      \nI can conclude that Central Washington University is located further north\
      \ than Brown College.\n\nBut I'm concerned that I might be making an error here.\
      \ Let me think once more to be sure.\n\nWait, I think I'm conflating some things\
      \ in my memory. Let me be more precise about the locations, because the existence\
      \ of \"Brown College\" in Minnesota is now uncertain to me.\n\nCentral Washington\
      \ University is definitely in Ellensburg, Washington, at approximately 47\xB0\
      \ N latitude.\n\nAs for Brown College in Minnesota, I need to be clear about\
      \ what institution this refers to. It could be:\n\n1. A college that I'm not\
      \ familiar with or that my knowledge is outdated about\n2. A community college\
      \ or technical school\n3. A division or school within a larger university in\
      \ Minnesota\n\nIf we're referring to a college in Minnesota named \"Brown College\"\
      , it was most likely located in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area,\
      \ which is at approximately 45\xB0 N latitude.\n\nGiven this information, if\
      \ Brown College was indeed in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, then Central Washington\
      \ University (at ~47\xB0 N) would be north of Brown College (at ~45\xB0 N).\n\
      \nSo, my final answer would be: YES, Central Washington University, WA is located\
      \ north of Brown College, MN. But this assumes Brown College was in the Minneapolis-St.\
      \ Paul area, which is the most likely location based on my understanding of\
      \ educational institutions in Minnesota.\n\nActually, I think I might be confusing\
      \ things. Let's try a different approach.\n\nCentral Washington University is\
      \ in Ellensburg, WA at about 47.0\xB0 N latitude.\n\nMinnesota's latitude ranges\
      \ from about 43.5\xB0 N at its southern border to about 49.4\xB0 N at its northern\
      \ border. The Twin Cities (Minneapolis-St. Paul) are at about 45.0\xB0 N.\n\n\
      Now, for Brown College in Minnesota:\n- If it's in the southern part of Minnesota,\
      \ it would be at around 43-44\xB0 N.\n- If it's in the central part (like the\
      \ Twin Cities), it would be at around 45\xB0 N.\n- If it's in the northern part,\
      \ it could be at up to 49.4\xB0 N.\n\nSo, for me to determine if Central Washington\
      \ University (47\xB0 N) is north of Brown College, I need to know where in Minnesota\
      \ Brown College is located. If Brown College is in the southern or central part\
      \ of Minnesota (below 47\xB0 N), then Central Washington University would be\
      \ north of it. If Brown College is in the northern part of Minnesota (above\
      \ 47\xB0 N), then Central Washington University would be south of it.\n\nBased\
      \ on the colleges and universities I know of in Minnesota, if there's a \"Brown\
      \ College\" in Minnesota, it's most likely in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan\
      \ area, which would put it at around 45\xB0 N. If that's the case, then Central\
      \ Washington University (at 47\xB0 N) would be north of Brown College.\n\nSo,\
      \ if Brown College in Minnesota is in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area or the southern\
      \ part of Minnesota, the answer would be YES, Central Washington University\
      \ is north of Brown College. If Brown College is in the northern part of Minnesota\
      \ (above 47\xB0 N), the answer would be NO.\n\nI'm going to go with the assumption\
      \ that Brown College, if it exists in Minnesota, is most likely in the Minneapolis-St.\
      \ Paul metropolitan area or the southern part of Minnesota, which would put\
      \ it below 47\xB0 N latitude. Therefore, Central Washington University (at 47\xB0\
      \ N) would be north of Brown College.\n\nFinal answer: YES, Central Washington\
      \ University, WA is located north of Brown College, MN.\n\nOK, let me just double-check\
      \ if Brown College is actually in Minnesota.\n\nUpon reflection, I think I was\
      \ thinking of Brown Institute, which was a technical school in the Minneapolis\
      \ area that later became a part of Sanford-Brown (a chain of career schools).\
      \ Brown Institute was indeed in the Minneapolis area, which is at around 45\xB0\
      \ N latitude.\n\nGiven this corrected information, and comparing the latitudes\
      \ of:\n- Central Washington University (Ellensburg, WA): ~47\xB0 N\n- Brown\
      \ Institute/Sanford-Brown (Minneapolis area, MN): ~45\xB0 N\n\nI can confidently\
      \ conclude that Central Washington University is located further north than\
      \ the institution formerly known as Brown Institute (which might be what the\
      \ question is referring to as \"Brown College\").\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\
      \ YES, Central Washington University, WA is located north of Brown College,\
      \ MN, assuming the institution referred to as \"Brown College\" is the same\
      \ as or related to Brown Institute/Sanford-Brown in the Minneapolis area.\n\n\
      Let me check one more time by comparing the locations.\n\nCentral Washington\
      \ University is in Ellensburg, Washington, which is at a latitude of about 47.0\xB0\
      \ N.\n\nMinnesota spans from about 43.5\xB0 N to 49.4\xB0 N in latitude.\n\n\
      For the college in Minnesota, I've been considering Brown Institute (later Sanford-Brown),\
      \ which was in the Minneapolis area at about 45.0\xB0 N.\n\nSince 47.0\xB0 N\
      \ is further north than 45.0\xB0 N, and if \"Brown College, MN\" refers to the\
      \ institution I'm thinking of, then Central Washington University would be north\
      \ of it.\n\nHowever, if \"Brown College, MN\" refers to a different institution\
      \ located in the northernmost part of Minnesota (above 47.0\xB0 N), then Central\
      \ Washington University would be south of it.\n\nGiven my knowledge of educational\
      \ institutions in Minnesota, and the most likely interpretation of \"Brown College,\
      \ MN,\" I'm going to stick with my conclusion that Central Washington University\
      \ (at 47.0\xB0 N) is north of Brown College, MN (assumed to be in the Minneapolis\
      \ area at 45.0\xB0 N).\n\nFinal answer: YES.\n\nActually, I need to be more\
      \ careful about the exact name \"Brown College, MN\" as it might refer to a\
      \ specific institution that I'm not properly recalling. Let me now focus more\
      \ on Minnesota institutions.\n\nIn Minnesota, there was a Brown College (formerly\
      \ Brown Institute) that was a for-profit institution specializing in broadcasting,\
      \ design, and technology. It had campuses in Mendota Heights and Brooklyn Center,\
      \ both in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area.\n\n- Mendota Heights,\
      \ MN is at approximately 44.9\xB0 N latitude.\n- Brooklyn Center, MN is at approximately\
      \ 45.1\xB0 N latitude.\n\nCentral Washington University in Ellensburg, WA is\
      \ at approximately 47.0\xB0 N latitude.\n\nGiven these specific locations and\
      \ coordinates, I can now make a more informed comparison:\n\nCentral Washington\
      \ University (47.0\xB0 N) is indeed north of both campuses of Brown College\
      \ in Minnesota (44.9\xB0 N and 45.1\xB0 N).\n\nTherefore, my final answer is:\
      \ YES, Central Washington University, WA is located north of Brown College,\
      \ MN.\n\nActually I just realized something important. Central Washington University\
      \ is located in Ellensburg, Washington. \n\nEllensburg, Washington is located\
      \ in central Washington state, at coordinates roughly around 47.0\xB0N, 120.5\xB0\
      W.\n\nBrown College (or Brown Institute) in Minnesota, had two main locations:\n\
      - Mendota Heights: approximately 44.9\xB0N, 93.1\xB0W\n- Brooklyn Center: approximately\
      \ 45.1\xB0N, 93.3\xB0W\n\nComparing the latitudes:\n- Ellensburg, WA: ~47.0\xB0\
      N\n- Mendota Heights, MN: ~44.9\xB0N\n- Brooklyn Center, MN: ~45.1\xB0N\n\n\
      Since 47.0\xB0N is greater than both 44.9\xB0N and 45.1\xB0N, Ellensburg (home\
      \ of Central Washington University) is indeed further north than both locations\
      \ of Brown College in Minnesota.\n\nSo, YES, Central Washington University in\
      \ Washington is located north of Brown College in Minnesota.\n\nActually, let\
      \ me look at this differently. The latitude of a location tells us how far north\
      \ or south it is. The higher the latitude, the further north the location.\n\
      \nEllensburg, Washington (home of Central Washington University) is at approximately\
      \ 47.0\xB0 N latitude.\nThe Minneapolis-St. Paul area of Minnesota (where Brown\
      \ College was located) is at approximately 45.0\xB0 N latitude.\n\nSince 47.0\xB0\
      \ is greater than 45.0\xB0, Ellensburg (and therefore Central Washington University)\
      \ is further north than the Minneapolis-St. Paul area (and therefore Brown College).\n\
      \nSo, YES, Central Washington University is located north of Brown College.\n\
      \nI'm overthinking this. Let's be concrete.\n\nCentral Washington University's\
      \ campus is in Ellensburg, WA at approximately 47.0\xB0N latitude.\nBrown College\
      \ had campuses in Mendota Heights and Brooklyn Center, both in the Minneapolis-St.\
      \ Paul area of Minnesota, at approximately 45.0\xB0N latitude.\n\nSince 47.0\xB0\
      N is greater than 45.0\xB0N, Central Washington University is further north\
      \ than Brown College.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is: YES, Central Washington\
      \ University, WA is located north of Brown College, MN.</think># Is Central\
      \ Washington University, WA located north of Brown College, MN?\n\nTo determine\
      \ this, I need to find the approximate latitudes of both institutions and compare\
      \ them.\n\n## Step 1: Locate Central Washington University\nCentral Washington\
      \ University is located in Ellensburg, Washington, which is in the central part\
      \ of Washington state. Ellensburg is at approximately 47.0\xB0 N latitude.\n\
      \n## Step 2: Locate Brown College\nBrown College was a for-profit institution\

      \ that I'm working with somewhat limited information about Brown College in\

      Let''s break this down:


      1. Cincinnati Christian University is in Cincinnati, Ohio (OH).

      2. Texas Tech University College of Architecture is in Lubbock, Texas (TX).


      Now, I need to determine which one is farther north. In the United States, generally:

      - Texas is in the South/Southwest region, and is generally south of Ohio


      So just based on the states, Cincinnati, OH should be north of Lubbock, TX.


      To be more precise, I can think about approximate latitudes:

      - Cincinnati, OH is around 39 degrees North latitude

      - Lubbock, TX is around 33-34 degrees North latitude


      Since a higher value of N latitude means farther north, Cincinnati would be

      - Cincinnati Christian University is in Cincinnati, Ohio (OH)

      - Texas Tech University College of Architecture is in Lubbock, Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Compare their geographical positions

      - Ohio is in the northern United States

      - Texas is in the southern United States

      - All of Ohio is at a higher latitude than all of Texas

      - Cincinnati is in the southern part of Ohio, but still much further north than
      any part of Texas

      - Lubbock is in the northwestern part of Texas, but still significantly south
      of Ohio


      ## Step 3: Draw conclusion

      Since Ohio is entirely north of Texas geographically, Cincinnati Christian University
      must be north of Texas Tech University College of Architecture.

      \n1. We need to determine if Washburn University in Kansas is located north\
      \ of Grayson College in Texas.\n\n2. To answer this, I need to know the relative\
      \ geographical positions of these two institutions.\n\nLet's first establish\
      \ some basic facts:\n\n- Washburn University is located in Kansas (KS).\n- Grayson\
      \ College is located in Texas (TX).\n\nGenerally, Kansas is north of Texas in\
      \ the United States. Kansas is in the central part of the US, while Texas is\
      \ in the southern part.\n\nBut to be more precise, let me think about the specific\
      \ locations of these institutions:\n\n- Washburn University is located in Topeka,\
      \ which is the capital city of Kansas.\n- Grayson College is located in Denison,\
      \ Texas, which is in the northern part of Texas, near the border with Oklahoma.\n\
      \nGeographically, states in the US are generally arranged as follows (from north\
      \ to south in the central region):\n- North Dakota, South Dakota\n- Nebraska\n\
      - Kansas\n- Oklahoma\n- Texas\n\nSo Kansas is indeed north of Texas. Even though\
      \ Grayson College is in northern Texas and Washburn is in Kansas, Kansas as\
      \ a whole is still north of even the northernmost part of Texas.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ Washburn University in Kansas is located north of Grayson College in Texas.\n\
      \nActually, let me double check by looking at the latitudes of the cities where\
      \ these institutions are located:\n\n- Topeka, Kansas (where Washburn University\
      \ is located) is at approximately latitude 39.0473\xB0 N.\n- Denison, Texas\
      \ (where Grayson College is located) is at approximately latitude 33.7556\xB0\
      \ N.\n\nSince 39.0473\xB0 N is a higher latitude than 33.7556\xB0 N, and higher\
      \ latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere mean locations that are more northerly,\
      \ this confirms that Washburn University is indeed north of Grayson College.\n\
      \nThe answer is YES.</think># Is Washburn University, KS located north of Grayson\
      \ College, TX?\n\nTo answer this question, I need to determine the geographic\
      \ locations of both universities and compare their positions.\n\nStep 1: Identify\
      \ the locations of both universities.\n- Washburn University is in Topeka, Kansas\
      \ (KS)\n- Grayson College is in Denison, Texas (TX)\n\nStep 2: Consider the\
      \ geographic arrangement of these states.\nKansas is located in the central\
      \ United States, while Texas is in the south-central region. In the U.S. map,\
      \ Kansas is situated directly north of Oklahoma, which is north of Texas.\n\n\
      Step 3: Compare the approximate latitudes.\n- Topeka, Kansas is at approximately\
      \ 39\xB0 North latitude\n- Denison, Texas is at approximately 33.7\xB0 North\
      \ latitude\n\nSince Washburn University has a higher latitude than Grayson College\
      \ (39\xB0 N vs 33.7\xB0 N), and higher northern latitudes indicate more northerly\
      \ positions, Washburn University is indeed north of Grayson College.\n\nYES"

      \ \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes in New York:\n\n\xC9cole libre des hautes\
      \ \xE9tudes (ELHE) is a French term that translates to \"Free School of Advanced\

      \ latitude 40.7\xB0 N, and Danville, Virginia is located at approximately latitude\
      \ 36.6\xB0 N. Since 40.7\xB0 N is higher than 36.6\xB0 N, and higher latitudes\

      - Virginia's northern border is approximately at latitude 39\xB0 N\n- New York's\
      \ southern border is approximately at latitude 40.5\xB0 N\n\nThis confirms that\
      \ even the southernmost part of New York is north of the northernmost part of\

      \ location in Virginia.\n\nSo, \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes in NY is\
      \ located north of Averett University in VA.\n\nActually, I should double-check\

      step.


      1. I need to find the locations of St. Andrews University in North Carolina
      (NC) and Columbus Technical College in Georgia (GA).


      2. St. Andrews University is in North Carolina (NC). Specifically, it''s in
      Laurinburg, NC.


      3. Columbus Technical College is in Georgia (GA). Specifically, it''s in Columbus,
      GA.


      4. Now I need to determine which one is further north. North Carolina is generally
      north of Georgia, as Georgia is in the Deep South along the Atlantic coast,
      while North Carolina is further up the Atlantic coast.


      5. Let me visualize the US map. Georgia borders Florida to the south, and borders
      North Carolina to the north (with South Carolina in between). So generally speaking,
      locations in North Carolina would be north of locations in Georgia.


      6. To be more precise, let me consider the specific cities. Laurinburg, NC (where
      St. Andrews University is located) is in the southern part of North Carolina,
      near the South Carolina border. Columbus, GA (where Columbus Technical College
      is located) is in the western part of Georgia, near the Alabama border.


      7. Despite Laurinburg being in the southern part of North Carolina, it''s still
      north of Columbus, GA, because North Carolina as a whole is north of Georgia.


      So, St. Andrews University in NC is located north of Columbus Technical College
      in GA.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.</think>To determine if St. Andrews University,
      NC is located north of Columbus Technical College, GA, I need to analyze their
      geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the specific locations of both schools.

      - St. Andrews University is located in Laurinburg, North Carolina

      - Columbus Technical College is located in Columbus, Georgia


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of North Carolina and Georgia.

      - Georgia is a southern state that borders Florida

      - North Carolina is located north of Georgia (with South Carolina in between)


      Step 3: Check the specific cities'' locations within their states.

      - Even though Laurinburg is in southern North Carolina, the entire state of
      North Carolina lies north of Georgia

      - Columbus is located in western Georgia, but still entirely south of North
      Carolina


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      - Any location in North Carolina (including Laurinburg) would be north of any
      location in Georgia (including Columbus)


      YES, St. Andrews University, NC is located north of Columbus Technical College,
      GA.'
    2855a192-d036-4d4d-b145-6661e159ebe5: '<think>This question asks whether St. Andrews
      University in North Carolina (NC) is located north of Columbus Technical College
      in Georgia (GA).


      To answer this, I need to understand the relative positions of these two locations.
      Both are in the southeastern United States. Let me think about their relative
      north-south positions.


      North Carolina (NC) and Georgia (GA) are both southeastern states in the US.
      In general, NC is located north of GA. North Carolina borders Georgia''s northern
      neighbor, South Carolina.


      The full geographic arrangement from north to south is:

      - North Carolina

      - South Carolina

      - Georgia


      Since St. Andrews University is in North Carolina, and Columbus Technical College
      is in Georgia, and North Carolina is generally north of Georgia, St. Andrews
      University should be north of Columbus Technical College.


      However, I should be careful because specific locations within states can sometimes
      create exceptions to the general state-to-state relationships. Let''s check
      the specific locations:


      St. Andrews University is located in Laurinburg, NC, which is in the southern
      part of North Carolina, close to the border with South Carolina.


      Columbus Technical College is located in Columbus, GA, which is in the western
      part of Georgia, close to the border with Alabama. Columbus is not in the northernmost
      part of Georgia.


      Even though St. Andrews is in the southern part of NC, NC is still entirely
      north of Georgia. The southernmost point of NC is still north of the northernmost
      point of GA.


      Therefore, St. Andrews University in NC is indeed north of Columbus Technical
      College in GA.


      The answer is YES.</think>To determine if St. Andrews University in North Carolina
      is located north of Columbus Technical College in Georgia, I need to analyze
      their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      North Carolina is located north of Georgia in the United States. North Carolina
      borders Georgia''s northern neighbor (South Carolina).


      Step 2: Consider specific locations within states.

      St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, North Carolina, in the southern portion
      of the state.

      Columbus Technical College is in Columbus, Georgia, which is not in the extreme
      northern part of Georgia.


      Step 3: Compare latitudes.

      Even though St. Andrews is in southern North Carolina, North Carolina as a whole
      lies north of Georgia. The southernmost points of North Carolina are generally
      still north of Georgia locations.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since St. Andrews University is in North Carolina, which is entirely north of
      Georgia where Columbus Technical College is located, St. Andrews University
      is indeed north of Columbus Technical College.

      \ north of Georgia in the United States. North Carolina borders Georgia's northern\

      \ in Georgia.\n\nLet's think more specifically about these two institutions:\n\
      \nSt. Andrews University is in North Carolina. After checking my knowledge,\
      \ I believe St. Andrews University is located in Laurinburg, NC, which is in\

      \nEven though Laurinburg is in the southern part of North Carolina, North Carolina\
      \ as a whole is north of Georgia. So it's very likely that Laurinburg, NC is\
      \ north of Columbus, GA.\n\nLet me double-check by thinking about the approximate\

      - Laurinburg, NC is approximately at latitude 34.77\xB0N.\n- Columbus, GA is\
      \ approximately at latitude 32.46\xB0N.\n\nSince 34.77\xB0N is higher than 32.46\xB0\

      Step 1: Identify the locations.\n- Waynesburg University is in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania\
      \ (PA)\n- National Paralegal College is in Arizona (AZ)\n\nStep 2: Consider\
      \ the geographic positions of these states.\n- Pennsylvania is located in the\

      Since both possible locations for Mildred Elley (Albany at 42.6\xB0 N and NYC\

      \ City and Pittsfield, MA. Pittsfield is even further north than Albany, so\
      \ this doesn't change my conclusion.\n\nSo, to answer the question \"Is Mildred\

      \ it's located at 855 Central Avenue, Albany, NY 12206.\nWidener University\
      \ Delaware Law School - Located at 4601 Concord Pike, Wilmington, DE 19803.\n\
      \nNow I can determine their latitudes more precisely:\nAlbany, NY location:\
      \ approximately 42.6782\xB0 N\nWilmington, DE location: approximately 39.7924\xB0\
      \ N\n\nSo Mildred Elley in Albany is about 2.88 degrees of latitude north of\

      \ Elley (NY) is located north of Widener University (DE).</think># Step-by-Step\
      \ Reasoning\n\nTo determine if Mildred Elley, NY is located north of Widener\
      \ University, DE, I need to identify the specific locations of both institutions\
      \ and compare their latitudes.\n\nStep 1: Identify the location of Mildred Elley\
      \ in New York.\n- Mildred Elley has its main campus in Albany, NY, which is\
      \ located in the northeastern part of New York state.\n- Albany, NY is situated\
      \ at approximately 42.65\xB0 N latitude.\n\nStep 2: Identify the location of\
      \ Widener University in Delaware.\n- Widener University has a law school campus\
      \ in Wilmington, Delaware.\n- Wilmington, DE is located at approximately 39.75\xB0\
      \ N latitude.\n\nStep 3: Compare the latitudes of both locations.\n- Albany,\
      \ NY (42.65\xB0 N) is at a higher latitude than Wilmington, DE (39.75\xB0 N).\n\
      - Higher latitude in the northern hemisphere means further north.\n- The difference\
      \ is about 2.9 degrees of latitude.\n\n# Answer: YES\n\nMildred Elley in NY\
      \ is indeed located north of Widener University in DE."

      \ their latitudes (higher latitude = further north).\n\nStep 1: Location of\
      \ Mildred Elley, NY\nMildred Elley is a college in New York, but I need to identify\
      \ which city in New York it's located in. If I recall correctly, Mildred Elley\
      \ has campuses in Albany, NY, which is the capital of New York state. Albany\
      \ is located in the eastern part of New York state.\n\nStep 2: Location of Widener\
      \ University, DE\nWidener University is in Delaware. Specifically, I believe\
      \ Widener University is located in Chester, Pennsylvania, which is just outside\
      \ of Delaware. However, the question specifies \"Widener University, DE\" so\
      \ there might be a campus in Delaware. Let me think about this. Widener University's\
      \ main campus is in Chester, PA, but it might have a satellite campus in Delaware.\
      \ \n\nActually, let me re-evaluate this. Widener University is primarily located\
      \ in Chester, Pennsylvania, which is near the Pennsylvania-Delaware border.\
      \ Delaware is a small state located between Pennsylvania, Maryland, and New\
      \ Jersey.\n\nIt seems there might be some confusion. Let me verify the locations\
      \ more precisely.\n\nAfter reconsideration:\n- Mildred Elley has a campus in\
      \ Albany, NY.\n- Widener University's main campus is in Chester, PA, not Delaware.\
      \ \n\nHowever, the question specifically mentions \"Widener University, DE\"\
      , so I'll assume there is a Widener campus in Delaware for this question.\n\n\
      Now let's compare the latitudes:\n\nAlbany, NY is at approximately 42.6526\xB0\
      \ N latitude.\nDelaware is a small state located between approximately 38.5\xB0\
      \ N and 40\xB0 N latitude.\n\nEven if Widener University has a campus in the\

      \ more carefully:\n\nMildred Elley in Albany, NY: Albany is at approximately\
      \ 42.6526\xB0 N latitude.\n\nFor Widener University in Delaware, I need to find\
      \ which city in Delaware it's located in. Let me see if I can recall...\n\n\
      Upon reflection, I think there might be confusion in the question. Widener University's\
      \ main campus is in Chester, Pennsylvania, just outside of Delaware. It has\
      \ satellite campuses, but I don't recall one specifically in Delaware. It has\
      \ a law school in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nSo let's assume the question is referring\
      \ to Widener University's law school in Wilmington, Delaware:\n\nWilmington,\
      \ DE is at approximately 39.7459\xB0 N latitude.\n\nComparing:\n- Albany, NY:\
      \ ~42.6526\xB0 N\n- Wilmington, DE: ~39.7459\xB0 N\n\nSince 42.6526\xB0 is greater\
      \ than 39.7459\xB0, Albany is north of Wilmington.\n\nTherefore, Mildred Elley\
      \ in Albany, NY is north of Widener University in Wilmington, DE.\n\nActually,\
      \ let me double-check both locations once more to make sure:\n\nMildred Elley\
      \ has a campus in Albany, NY, which is around 42.65\xB0 N latitude.\n\nI'm still\
      \ uncertain about Widener University in Delaware because its main campus is\
      \ in Pennsylvania. Let me assume it refers to Widener University School of Law\
      \ in Wilmington, Delaware, which is around 39.75\xB0 N latitude.\n\nGiven these\
      \ locations, Mildred Elley in Albany, NY is indeed north of Widener University's\
      \ Delaware location.\n\nSo the answer is YES, Mildred Elley, NY is located north\
      \ of Widener University, DE.\n\nWait, I want to verify Mildred Elley's location\

      \ to determine the geographic locations of these two universities and compare\
      \ their latitudes.\n\n1. First, I'll identify where Oklahoma City University\
      \ (OCU) is located:\n   - Oklahoma City University is in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma\
      \ (as the name suggests)\n   - Oklahoma City is in the central part of Oklahoma\
      \ state\n\n2. Next, I'll identify where Tarleton State University is located:\n\
      \   - Tarleton State University is in Texas (TX)\n   - I believe Tarleton State\
      \ University is located in Stephenville, Texas\n   - Stephenville is in north\
      \ central Texas\n\n3. Now I need to determine their relative positions:\n  \
      \ - Oklahoma is north of Texas in general\n   - But I need to check if Oklahoma\
      \ City is specifically north of Stephenville, Texas\n\nLet me think about the\
      \ geography of these states:\n- Oklahoma is directly north of Texas\n- Oklahoma\
      \ City is in the central part of Oklahoma\n- Stephenville (where Tarleton State\
      \ University is) is in north central Texas\n\nSince Oklahoma is north of Texas,\
      \ and Oklahoma City is not in the far southern part of Oklahoma, and Stephenville\
      \ is not in the far northern part of Texas, it's very likely that Oklahoma City\
      \ University is north of Tarleton State University.\n\nTo be more precise, I\
      \ would need the exact coordinates:\n- Oklahoma City, OK is approximately at\
      \ latitude 35.4676\xB0 N\n- Stephenville, TX is approximately at latitude 32.2208\xB0\
      \ N\n\nSince 35.4676\xB0 N is greater than 32.2208\xB0 N, Oklahoma City is north\
      \ of Stephenville.\n\nTherefore, Oklahoma City University, OK is located north\
      \ of Tarleton State University, TX.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nI need\
      \ to determine the relative north-south positions of these two universities.\n\
      \nStep 1: Identify the locations of both universities.\n- Oklahoma City University\
      \ is located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma\n- Tarleton State University is located\
      \ in Stephenville, Texas\n\nStep 2: Consider the general geographic relationship\
      \ between Oklahoma and Texas.\n- Oklahoma borders Texas to the north\n- This\
      \ gives us a general indication, but we need to check the specific cities\n\n\
      Step 3: Compare the latitudes of the specific locations.\n- Oklahoma City is\
      \ located at approximately 35.5\xB0 N latitude\n- Stephenville, Texas is located\
      \ at approximately 32.2\xB0 N latitude\n\nStep 4: Make the comparison.\n- Since\
      \ 35.5\xB0 is greater than 32.2\xB0, Oklahoma City is farther north than Stephenville\n\
      \n# Answer: YES\n\nOklahoma City University is indeed located north of Tarleton\
      \ State University."
