    d9a5891b-204d-4c34-a093-b2fe15ad14ee: '**Step 1: Identify the location of University
      of Mary, ND.**

      University of Mary is located in Bismarck, North Dakota.


      **Step 2: Identify the location of Mount Mercy University, IA.**

      Mount Mercy University is located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.


      **Step 3: Compare the latitudes of Bismarck, ND and Cedar Rapids, IA.**

      Bismarck, ND is at approximately 46.85 degrees North latitude.

      Cedar Rapids, IA is at approximately 41.98 degrees North latitude.


      **Step 4: Determine which location is further north based on latitude.**

      A higher North latitude indicates a more northerly location. Since 46.85 is
      greater than 41.98, Bismarck, ND is located north of Cedar Rapids, IA.


      **Step 5: Relate the university locations to their respective cities.**

      University of Mary is in Bismarck, ND. Mount Mercy University is in Cedar Rapids,
      IA.


      **Step 6: Conclude whether University of Mary, ND is located north of Mount
      Mercy University, IA.**

      Since Bismarck, ND is located north of Cedar Rapids, IA, and the universities
      are located in those cities, University of Mary, ND is located north of Mount
      Mercy University, IA.


      **Answer:** YES'

      of Mary is in North Dakota (ND). Mount Mercy University is in Iowa (IA).

      2.  **Understand the question:** It asks if the ND university is *north* of
      the IA university.

      3.  **Compare the states:** North Dakota is generally north of Iowa on a map
      of the United States.

      4.  **Consider within-state variation:** While precise city locations matter
      for exact comparisons, North Dakota is geographically situated significantly
      further north than Iowa overall. It is highly improbable that even the southernmost
      point in ND would be south of the northernmost point in IA, especially considering
      the primary locations of the universities (Bismarck, ND and Cedar Rapids, IA,
      respectively). Bismarck is considerably further north than Cedar Rapids.

      5.  **Conclusion:** Since North Dakota is north of Iowa, a university located
      in North Dakota is located north of a university located in Iowa.


      The answer is YES.'

      \ MI\n    *   Location 2: Mount Mary College, WI\n\n3.  **Determine the general\
      \ location/city for each institution:**\n    *   Michigan Technological University\
      \ is located in Houghton, Michigan.\n    *   Mount Mary College is located in\
      \ Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\n4.  **Determine the approximate latitude of each\
      \ city:**\n    *   Houghton, Michigan: I know Houghton is in the Upper Peninsula\
      \ of Michigan, relatively far north. A quick search confirms its approximate\
      \ latitude is around 47.1\xB0 N.\n    *   Milwaukee, Wisconsin: I know Milwaukee\
      \ is in southeastern Wisconsin, on Lake Michigan. A quick search confirms its\
      \ approximate latitude is around 43.0\xB0 N.\n\n5.  **Compare the latitudes:**\n\
      \    *   Houghton latitude: ~47.1\xB0 N\n    *   Milwaukee latitude: ~43.0\xB0\
      \ N\n\n6.  **Interpret the comparison:** A higher latitude number in the Northern\
      \ Hemisphere means the location is further north. Since 47.1\xB0 N is greater\
      \ than 43.0\xB0 N, Houghton, MI (and thus MTU) is further north than Milwaukee,\
      \ WI (and thus MMC).\n\n7.  **Formulate the final answer:** The question asks\
      \ for a \"YES\" or \"NO\" answer based on whether MTU is north of MMC. Based\
      \ on the latitude comparison, MTU is indeed north of MMC.\n\n8.  **Provide the\
      \ YES/NO answer:** YES.\n\nThis step-by-step process ensures the correct locations\
      \ are identified, their relative positions (specifically latitude) are determined,\
      \ and the comparison is made accurately to arrive at the final YES/NO conclusion.1.\
      \  **Identify the two locations:**\n    *   Location A: Michigan Technological\
      \ University, MI (located in Houghton, MI)\n    *   Location B: Mount Mary College,\
      \ WI (located in Milwaukee, WI)\n\n2.  **Determine the approximate geographical\
      \ position (latitude) of each city:**\n    *   Houghton, MI is located in the\
      \ Upper Peninsula of Michigan, which is quite far north.\n    *   Milwaukee,\
      \ WI is located in southeastern Wisconsin, on Lake Michigan.\n\n3.  **Compare\
      \ the latitudes:** Cities further north have higher latitude values in the Northern\
      \ Hemisphere. Houghton, MI is significantly further north than Milwaukee, WI.\n\
      \n4.  **Conclusion:** Since Houghton, MI is geographically north of Milwaukee,\
      \ WI, Michigan Technological University is located north of Mount Mary College.\n\

      \ Imagine the relative positions of Pennsylvania and Kentucky on a map. Pennsylvania\
      \ is clearly positioned to the north of Kentucky. Since Scranton is in Pennsylvania\
      \ and Owensboro is in Kentucky, Scranton will be located north of Owensboro.\n\
      \n6.  **Formulate the answer based on the relative locations:** Because Pennsylvania\
      \ is a state located north of Kentucky, any point in Pennsylvania will be north\
      \ of any point in Kentucky, *generally speaking*. Specifically comparing Scranton,\
      \ PA to Owensboro, KY confirms this relative position.\n\n7.  **Determine the\
      \ final YES/NO answer:** Based on the fact that Scranton, PA is located geographically\
      \ north of Owensboro, KY, the answer to the question \"Is University of Scranton,\
      \ PA located north of Western Kentucky University-Owensboro, KY?\" is YES.\n\

      (TN).

      2.  **Understand the question:** The question asks if the Colorado university
      is *north* of the Tennessee university.

      3.  **Compare the states'' general locations:** Colorado is a western state.
      Tennessee is a southeastern state.

      4.  **Determine relative latitude:** Western states are generally located further
      north than southeastern states when considering the contiguous United States.
      Specifically, Colorado is further north than Tennessee.

      5.  **Relate state location to university location:** Since the universities
      are located within their respective states, the university in the northern state
      will be located north of the university in the southern state.


      Therefore, University of Northern Colorado, CO is located north of Johnson University,

      Step 3: Determine the location of Alcorn State University, MS. A quick search
      reveals Alcorn State University is near Lorman, Mississippi.


      Step 4: Determine the approximate latitude of Lorman, Mississippi. Lorman is
      in southwestern Mississippi, roughly around 31.9 degrees North latitude.


      Step 5: Compare the latitudes. Harding University (Searcy, AR) is at approximately
      35.2 degrees North latitude, and Alcorn State University (Lorman, MS) is at
      approximately 31.9 degrees North latitude. A higher North latitude means a location
      is further north.

      San Marcos is in California.

      Step 3: Determine the general geographical relationship between North Carolina
      and California within the United States. North Carolina is on the east coast,
      and California is on the west coast. When considering latitude (north-south
      position), the states span a range of latitudes.

      Step 4: Consider the specific latitudes of Winston-Salem, NC and San Marcos,
      CA. While a precise latitude isn''t needed for a general comparison, we know
      that California is a large state that extends further south than North Carolina.
      Specifically, San Marcos is in Southern California. Winston-Salem is in the
      northern half of North Carolina. Generally, locations on the east coast at similar
      latitudes to Southern California are further south than North Carolina.

      Step 5: Compare the relative north-south positions based on the general location
      of the cities and states. San Marcos, being in Southern California, is significantly
      further south than Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

      \ states:**\n    *   Oklahoma City is in central Oklahoma.\n    *   Tarleton\
      \ State University is in Stephenville, Texas, which is in central Texas, south\
      \ of the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\n4.  **Compare the latitudes:** Since Oklahoma\
      \ is generally north of Texas, and Oklahoma City is in the central part of Oklahoma\
      \ while Stephenville is in the central part of Texas (but south of the major\
      \ northern TX cities), Oklahoma City will be at a higher latitude (further north)\
      \ than Stephenville.\n\n5.  **Formulate the answer:** Oklahoma City University\
      \ is in Oklahoma City, OK. Tarleton State University is in Stephenville, TX.\
      \ Oklahoma is north of Texas. Therefore, Oklahoma City is north of Stephenville.\n\
