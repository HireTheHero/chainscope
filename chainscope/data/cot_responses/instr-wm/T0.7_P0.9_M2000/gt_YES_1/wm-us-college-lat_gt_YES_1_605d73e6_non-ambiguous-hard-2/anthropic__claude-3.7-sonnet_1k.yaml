      by Step


      To determine if Capital University in Ohio is located north of Claflin University
      in South Carolina, I need to consider the geographic locations of these two
      states.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Capital University is in Ohio (OH)

      - Claflin University is in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States

      - South Carolina is in the Southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes of these states.

      - Ohio is significantly further north than South Carolina

      - Ohio borders Lake Erie to the north and Kentucky to the south

      - South Carolina is positioned along the Atlantic coast, much further south


      Since Ohio is geographically north of South Carolina, and the universities are
      located within these respective states, Capital University (OH) is indeed north

      The universities in question are:

      1. Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) - located in Pennsylvania (PA)

      2. University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) - located in North Carolina
      (NC)


      To figure out if IUP is north of UNCW, I need to think about the relative geographic
      positions of Pennsylvania and North Carolina in the United States.


      Pennsylvania is a northern state, located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the
      US. North Carolina is located in the southeastern region of the US, south of
      Pennsylvania.


      On a north-south axis (latitude), Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina. This
      means that cities in Pennsylvania are generally north of cities in North Carolina.


      Indiana, PA (where IUP is located) is in western Pennsylvania. Wilmington, NC
      (where UNCW is located) is in southeastern North Carolina near the coast.


      Since Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina, Indiana University of Pennsylvania

      - Indiana University of Pennsylvania is located in Indiana, Pennsylvania

      - University of North Carolina Wilmington is located in Wilmington, North Carolina


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Pennsylvania and North
      Carolina.

      - Pennsylvania is a northern state in the Mid-Atlantic region

      - North Carolina is a southeastern state, positioned south of Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations within their states.

      - Indiana, PA is in western Pennsylvania

      - Wilmington, NC is on the southeastern coast of North Carolina


      Step 4: Determine the north-south relationship.

      - Any location in Pennsylvania would be north of any location in North Carolina,

      First, let me identify where each university is located:

      - University of Mary is in North Dakota (ND)

      - Mount Mercy University is in Iowa (IA)


      To answer this question, I need to know the relative geographical positions
      of these states. North Dakota is a northern border state in the US, while Iowa
      is in the Midwest.


      Looking at the US map mentally, North Dakota is significantly north of Iowa.
      North Dakota borders Canada to the north, while Iowa is several states south
      of the Canadian border. Iowa borders Missouri to the south, Illinois and Wisconsin
      to the east, Minnesota to the north, and Nebraska and South Dakota to the west.


      Since North Dakota is entirely north of Iowa, any location in North Dakota (including
      University of Mary) would be north of any location in Iowa (including Mount
      Mercy University).</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of Mary is in North Dakota (ND)

      - Mount Mercy University is in Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - North Dakota is a northern border state that sits along the Canadian border

      - Iowa is in the Midwest, positioned several states south of North Dakota


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - On a map of the United States, North Dakota is entirely north of Iowa

      - This means any location in North Dakota would be geographically north of any
      location in Iowa


      Therefore, University of Mary in North Dakota is indeed located north of Mount
      Mercy University in Iowa.

      1. Bryant University in Rhode Island (RI)

      2. Central Methodist University in Missouri (MO)


      Then I''ll compare their latitudes to determine which one is more north.


      Rhode Island is a northeastern state, located in New England. Missouri is a
      midwestern state.


      Generally speaking, northeastern states like Rhode Island are north of midwestern
      states like Missouri. So my initial hypothesis would be that Bryant University
      is north of Central Methodist University.


      Let''s be more precise. Rhode Island is roughly around 41-42 degrees north latitude.
      Missouri is roughly around 36-40 degrees north latitude.


      Bryant University is in Smithfield, Rhode Island, which would be in that 41-42
      degrees north range.


      Central Methodist University is in Fayette, Missouri, which would be in that
      36-40 degrees north range.

      is likely north of Central Methodist University in Missouri.</think># Is Bryant
      University, RI located north of Central Methodist University, MO?


      To answer this question, I''ll compare the geographical locations of these two
      universities.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Bryant University is located in Smithfield, Rhode Island (RI), which is in
      the northeastern United States

      - Central Methodist University is located in Fayette, Missouri (MO), which is
      in the midwestern United States


      ## Step 2: Compare latitudes

      - Rhode Island is one of the northernmost states, located in New England, with
      latitudes around 41-42 degrees north

      - Missouri is a midwestern state with latitudes around 36-40 degrees north

      - Northeastern states like Rhode Island are generally north of midwestern states
      like Missouri


      ## Step 3: Conclusion

      Based on their geographic positions in their respective states, Bryant University
      in Rhode Island is indeed located north of Central Methodist University in Missouri.

      1. Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina (NC)

      2. Florida A&M University - Florida State University College of Engineering
      in Florida (FL)


      Let me think about the states first. North Carolina is located north of Florida
      on the US East Coast. The states from north to south in that region are roughly:

      - Virginia

      - North Carolina

      - South Carolina

      - Georgia

      - Florida


      Since Elizabeth City State University is in North Carolina, and the Florida
      A&M/FSU College of Engineering is in Florida, and North Carolina is north of
      Florida, I can conclude that Elizabeth City State University is located north
      of the Florida institution.


      To be completely certain, I should consider the specific locations within each
      state. Elizabeth City is located in the northeastern part of North Carolina.
      The Florida A&M/FSU College of Engineering would be in Tallahassee (where both
      universities are located), which is in the northern part of Florida.


      Even though the Florida institution is in northern Florida, it''s still south
      of North Carolina. So Elizabeth City State University is definitely north of
      Florida A&M/FSU College of Engineering.</think># Determining the North-South
      Relationship Between Two Universities


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Elizabeth City State University is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Florida A&M University - Florida State University College of Engineering is
      in Florida (FL)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship of these states

      North Carolina is significantly north of Florida on the U.S. East Coast. The
      coastal states descend roughly in this order: Virginia, North Carolina, South
      Carolina, Georgia, and then Florida.


      ## Step 3: Consider specific locations within states

      - Elizabeth City State University is located in Elizabeth City, in the northeastern
      part of North Carolina

      - The joint FAMU-FSU College of Engineering would be in Tallahassee, in northern
      Florida


      ## Step 4: Draw conclusion

      Even though the Florida institution is in northern Florida, any location in
      North Carolina (including Elizabeth City) is still geographically north of any
      location in Florida.


      YES, Elizabeth City State University in NC is located north of Florida A&M University

      - North Carolina is a state on the east coast of the United States.

      - Florida is the southernmost state on the east coast of the United States.

      - North Carolina is positioned north of Florida on the map.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      Since Elizabeth City State University is in North Carolina, and any location
      in North Carolina is north of any location in Florida, Elizabeth City State
      University must be north of Florida A&M University - Florida State University

      relative geographic locations of two US universities:

      1. Viterbo University in Wisconsin (WI)

      2. Mountain State University in West Virginia (WV)


      Specifically, it''s asking if Viterbo University is located north of Mountain
      State University.


      Let me think about the general geographic positions of Wisconsin and West Virginia
      in the United States:


      Wisconsin (WI) is in the northern part of the United States, in the Midwest
      region, bordering the Great Lakes.


      West Virginia (WV) is in the eastern part of the United States, specifically
      in the Appalachian region.


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - Wisconsin is generally much further north than West Virginia

      - Wisconsin is close to the Canadian border

      - West Virginia is more mid-Atlantic in position


      Since Viterbo University is in Wisconsin and Mountain State University is in
      West Virginia, it''s very likely that Viterbo University is located north of
      Mountain State University. But let me think about the specific locations of
      these universities within their states to be certain.


      Viterbo University is in La Crosse, Wisconsin, which is in the western part
      of Wisconsin.

      Mountain State University was located in Beckley, West Virginia, in the southern
      part of West Virginia.


      Given that Wisconsin as a whole is significantly north of West Virginia, even
      the southern parts of Wisconsin would likely be north of the northern parts
      of West Virginia. Since Viterbo is in Wisconsin and Mountain State was in West
      Virginia, Viterbo University is almost certainly north of Mountain State University.</think>#
      Is Viterbo University, WI located north of Mountain State University, WV?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two universities.

      - Wisconsin (WI) is located in the northern Midwest region of the United States

      - West Virginia (WV) is located in the Appalachian region in the eastern United
      States


      ## Step 2: Compare the general latitudes

      - Wisconsin is much further north, bordering Lake Superior and near the Canadian
      border

      - West Virginia is significantly further south, in the mid-Atlantic region


      ## Step 3: Locate the specific universities

      - Viterbo University is in La Crosse, Wisconsin, in the western part of the
      state

      - Mountain State University was in Beckley, West Virginia, in the southern part
      of WV


      ## Step 4: Make the comparison

      Even the southernmost parts of Wisconsin are generally north of the northernmost
      parts of West Virginia due to their significant latitude difference.


      YES, Viterbo University is located north of Mountain State University.'

      Actually, let me be more precise. The specific locations within their states
      could theoretically matter if the states were adjacent or very close. But Wisconsin

      - Viterbo University is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - Mountain State University is in West Virginia (WV)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states in the United States.

      - Wisconsin is located in the northern Midwest region of the US

      Illinois is a northern state bordering Wisconsin to the north and Kentucky to
      the south.

      Kentucky is more southern, bordering Illinois to the north.


      So generally speaking, any location in Illinois would be north of any location
      in Kentucky. There might be exceptions if we''re talking about the very southern

      1. Webb Institute in New York

      2. University of North Carolina at Pembroke in North Carolina


      Then I need to compare their latitudes to see which one is further north.


      Webb Institute is located in Glen Cove, New York, on Long Island. New York is
      in the northeastern United States.


      The University of North Carolina at Pembroke (UNCP) is located in Pembroke,
      North Carolina. North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States, but
      south of New York.


      In general, New York is north of North Carolina. Looking at the US map, New
      York state is significantly further north than North Carolina.


      So Webb Institute in NY would be north of UNC Pembroke in NC.</think># Is Webb
      Institute, NY located north of University of North Carolina at Pembroke, NC?


      Let me think about this step by step:


      1) Webb Institute is located in Glen Cove, New York, which is on Long Island
      in the northeastern United States.


      2) The University of North Carolina at Pembroke is located in Pembroke, North
      Carolina, which is in the southeastern United States.


      3) Geographically, New York State is entirely north of North Carolina. On a

      4) Since Webb Institute is in New York and UNC Pembroke is in North Carolina,
      Webb Institute must be further north.

      locations of two colleges:

      1. Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs, OH

      2. Ohio Valley University, WV


      First, let me identify their locations:


      Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs is located in Ohio (OH). It appears
      to be part of Cleveland State University in Cleveland, Ohio, which is in northern
      Ohio near Lake Erie.


      Ohio Valley University is in West Virginia (WV). From its name, I can infer
      it''s likely located in the Ohio Valley region, probably in the northwestern
      part of West Virginia along the Ohio River.


      Geographically:

      - Cleveland, Ohio is located in the northern part of Ohio, bordering Lake Erie

      - The Ohio Valley region follows the Ohio River, which creates the border between
      Ohio and West Virginia

      - West Virginia is south of Ohio


      Since Cleveland is in the northern part of Ohio, and West Virginia is entirely
      south of Ohio, a college in Cleveland would be north of a college in West Virginia.


      Therefore, Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs in Cleveland, Ohio
      would be north of Ohio Valley University in West Virginia.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the geographic locations of both institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs,
      OH.

      This college is part of Cleveland State University, located in Cleveland, Ohio.
      Cleveland is in northern Ohio, situated along Lake Erie.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Ohio Valley University, WV.

      Ohio Valley University was located in Vienna, West Virginia (near Parkersburg).
      This area is in the northwestern part of West Virginia, along the Ohio River.


      Step 3: Compare their geographic positions.

      Ohio is north of West Virginia. Specifically, Cleveland, Ohio is significantly
      north of any point in West Virginia. The Ohio River forms part of the border
      between these states, with Ohio being north of the river and West Virginia south
      of it.


      YES, Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs is located north of Ohio

      I need to determine if Cincinnati Christian University is located north of Texas
      Tech University College of Architecture.


      First, let''s identify the states:

      - Cincinnati Christian University is in Ohio (OH)

      - Texas Tech University College of Architecture is in Texas (TX)


      Ohio is a northern state in the US, while Texas is a southern state. Geographically,
      Ohio is located much further north than Texas.


      Cincinnati is a city in the southern part of Ohio, but even southern Ohio is
      still considerably north of Texas.


      Texas Tech University is located in Lubbock, Texas, which is in the northwestern
      part of Texas, but Texas overall is still much further south than Ohio.


      So Cincinnati Christian University in Ohio must be located north of Texas Tech
      University College of Architecture in Texas.</think>To determine whether Cincinnati
      Christian University in Ohio is located north of Texas Tech University College
      of Architecture in Texas, I''ll compare their geographic locations:

      2) Texas Tech University College of Architecture is located in Lubbock, Texas


      Looking at their positions on the US map:

      - Ohio is a northern state, situated in the Midwest region

      - Texas is a southern state, positioned much further south


      Even though Cincinnati is in the southern part of Ohio, the entire state of
      Ohio is significantly north of Texas. Lubbock (where Texas Tech is located)
      is in the northwestern part of Texas, but still lies much further south than
      any part of Ohio.


      Therefore, Cincinnati Christian University is indeed located north of Texas
      Tech University College of Architecture.

      - University of Wisconsin-Marinette is located in Marinette, Wisconsin

      - Grand View University is located in Des Moines, Iowa


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Wisconsin and Iowa.

      Wisconsin is a state that borders the northern edge of Iowa. Wisconsin is positioned
      north of Iowa in the United States.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Marinette is in northeastern Wisconsin, situated on the border with Michigan''s
      Upper Peninsula

      - Des Moines (where Grand View University is located) is in central Iowa


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      Since Wisconsin is entirely north of Iowa, and Marinette is in the northeastern
      part of Wisconsin (far from the Wisconsin-Iowa border), University of Wisconsin-Marinette
      must be significantly north of Grand View University in Iowa.


      YES, University of Wisconsin-Marinette, WI is located north of Grand View University,
      IA.'

    f61ce7d6-c1cc-44f9-b973-41717f325461: '<think>Let me think step by step about
      the geographic locations of these two colleges:


      1) Northeast Wisconsin Technical College is in Wisconsin (WI), as indicated
      by the name.

      2) Andrews University is in Michigan (MI).


      To determine which is more northern, I need to understand their specific locations
      within their respective states.


      Northeast Wisconsin Technical College is likely in the northeastern part of
      Wisconsin, as its name suggests. Wisconsin is a state in the Upper Midwest.


      Andrews University is in Michigan, which is east of Wisconsin. Michigan has
      two main parts: the Lower Peninsula (which looks like a mitten) and the Upper
      Peninsula (which is north of Wisconsin).


      The key question is: where exactly in Michigan is Andrews University? If it''s
      in Michigan''s Upper Peninsula, it might be further north than a location in
      northeastern Wisconsin. If it''s in the Lower Peninsula, especially the southern
      part, then Northeast Wisconsin Technical College would likely be further north.


      Let me recall what I know about Andrews University''s location: Andrews University
      is located in Berrien Springs, Michigan, which is in the southwestern part of
      Michigan''s Lower Peninsula, very close to the border with Indiana. This is
      one of the southernmost parts of Michigan.


      Northeast Wisconsin Technical College is in Green Bay, Wisconsin, which is indeed
      in the northeastern part of Wisconsin.


      Green Bay, WI is definitely further north than Berrien Springs, MI. The southern
      parts of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula are at a similar latitude to central or
      even southern Wisconsin, while Green Bay is in the northern half of Wisconsin.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the geographic locations of both colleges
      and compare their latitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the specific locations of both colleges.

      - Northeast Wisconsin Technical College is located in Green Bay, Wisconsin,
      in the northeastern part of the state.

      - Andrews University is located in Berrien Springs, Michigan, which is in the
      southwestern corner of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula, near the Michigan-Indiana
      border.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions on a north-south axis.

      - Green Bay, Wisconsin is positioned in the northern half of Wisconsin, on the
      shore of Lake Michigan.

      - Berrien Springs, Michigan is in the far southern portion of Michigan, close
      to Indiana.

      - Michigan''s Lower Peninsula extends south of Wisconsin''s southern border,
      and Berrien Springs is in the southern part of this peninsula.


      Step 3: Determine which location has a higher latitude.

      - Green Bay, Wisconsin has a significantly higher latitude than Berrien Springs,
      Michigan.

      - Berrien Springs is one of the southernmost locations in Michigan, while Green
      Bay is in the northern part of Wisconsin.


      YES, Northeast Wisconsin Technical College is located north of Andrews University.'

      south, while Texas is south of Oklahoma.


      Since Washburn University is in Kansas, and Grayson College is in Texas, it''s
      very likely that Washburn University is located north of Grayson College simply
      based on the states they''re in.


      To be more precise:

      - Washburn University is in Topeka, Kansas

      - Grayson College is in Denison, Texas

      of Texas, any location in Kansas (including Washburn University) would be north
      of any location in Texas (including Grayson College).</think>To determine if
      Washburn University in Kansas is located north of Grayson College in Texas,

      - Grayson College is located in Denison, Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Kansas and Texas.

      - Kansas is a state in the central United States

      - Texas is a state in the south-central United States

      - Kansas is entirely north of Texas on the map


      Step 3: Since Kansas is geographically north of Texas, and the universities
      are in their respective states, I can determine that Washburn University in
      Kansas must be north of Grayson College in Texas.

      Let me think about the geographical locations of Indiana and Oklahoma:


      Indiana is a state in the Midwest region of the United States, roughly aligned
      with states like Illinois and Ohio. It''s in the northern part of the country.


      Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States, below Kansas and north
      of Texas.


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - Indiana is further north than Oklahoma

      - Therefore, cities in Indiana would generally be north of cities in Oklahoma


      Since Anderson University is in Indiana, and Oklahoma State University-Oklahoma
      City is in Oklahoma, it''s very likely that Anderson University is north of
      Oklahoma State University-Oklahoma City.


      To be even more specific:

      - Anderson, Indiana is likely in the central part of Indiana

      - Oklahoma City is in the central part of Oklahoma


      Given the general north-south relationship between these states, Anderson University
      (IN) should be north of Oklahoma State University-Oklahoma City (OK).</think>To
      determine if Anderson University in Indiana is located north of Oklahoma State
      University-Oklahoma City in Oklahoma, I need to compare their geographical positions.


      Step 1: Identify the approximate locations of both universities.

      - Anderson University is located in Anderson, Indiana

      - Oklahoma State University-Oklahoma City is located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positioning of Indiana and Oklahoma.

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Oklahoma is in the south-central region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes (north-south positioning).

      - Indiana is generally positioned significantly further north than Oklahoma

      - Cities in Indiana will therefore have higher latitudes (more northerly positions)
      than cities in Oklahoma


      Step 4: Specific locations - Anderson, Indiana is in the central part of Indiana,
      while Oklahoma City is in the central part of Oklahoma. The overall state positioning
      determines their relative north-south relationship.


      YES, Anderson University in Indiana is located north of Oklahoma State University-Oklahoma
      City in Oklahoma.'

    27d24b6d-9e74-4d37-a95d-7631e251d010: '<think>To determine if St. Andrews University
      in North Carolina is located north of Columbus Technical College in Georgia,
      I need to consider the relative positions of these two states and then the positions
      of these schools within their states.


      First, North Carolina (NC) is generally located north of Georgia (GA) on a map
      of the United States. North Carolina borders Georgia''s northern border.


      So geographically, locations in North Carolina tend to be north of locations
      in Georgia. However, I need to consider the specific locations of these schools
      within their states:


      St. Andrews University is in North Carolina. I need to determine where in North
      Carolina.

      Columbus Technical College is in Georgia. I need to determine where in Georgia.


      Columbus, Georgia is in the western part of Georgia, near the Alabama border,
      and not far from the northern border with North Carolina.


      St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, North Carolina, which is in the southern
      part of North Carolina.


      If St. Andrews is in southern NC and Columbus Technical College is in northern
      GA, then their relative positions might be closer, but NC is still north of
      GA.


      Since North Carolina is north of Georgia, and these locations are not at extreme
      opposite ends of their states that would reverse this general relationship,
      St. Andrews University in NC should be north of Columbus Technical College in
      GA.</think>I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two
      institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - St. Andrews University is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Columbus Technical College is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - North Carolina is located directly north of Georgia on the US map

      - Georgia''s northern border connects with North Carolina''s southern border


      Step 3: Identify the specific locations within their states.

      - St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, NC, which is in the southern portion
      of North Carolina

      - Columbus Technical College is in Columbus, GA, which is in the west-central
      part of Georgia


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      - Even though St. Andrews is in southern NC, any location in North Carolina
      will still be north of central Georgia due to the states'' relative positions


      YES, St. Andrews University in North Carolina is located north of Columbus Technical
      College in Georgia.'
    484efe7b-062d-477d-8ae2-da466f92f9fb: '<think>I need to determine the locations
      of both institutions and compare their north-south positions.


      St. Andrews University, NC is in North Carolina (abbreviated as NC). The "NC"
      in the question indicates this.


      Columbus Technical College, GA is in Georgia (abbreviated as GA). The "GA" in
      the question indicates this.


      Now I need to determine which state is located further north. In the United
      States:

      - North Carolina is located on the East Coast

      - Georgia is also on the East Coast, but is south of North Carolina


      Since North Carolina is north of Georgia, St. Andrews University in NC would
      be north of Columbus Technical College in GA.


      So the answer should be YES.


      But let me double-check my geographic knowledge. The states on the East Coast
      from north to south include:

      Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New
      Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,
      and Florida.


      This confirms that North Carolina is indeed north of Georgia. So my answer is
      YES.</think>To answer this question, I need to analyze the geographic locations
      of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these colleges are located.

      - St. Andrews University is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Columbus Technical College is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of these states.

      - North Carolina is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Georgia is also on the eastern seaboard, but is positioned south of North
      Carolina


      Step 3: Since the colleges are in their respective states, their relative positions
      follow the same north-south relationship as their states.

      - A college in North Carolina would be north of a college in Georgia


      YES, St. Andrews University in North Carolina is located north of Columbus Technical
      College in Georgia.'

      2. We have Columbus Technical College in Georgia (GA)

      3. I need to determine if St. Andrews University is north of Columbus Technical
      College


      To answer this, I need to understand the geographic relationship between these
      two locations. I know that:


      - North Carolina (NC) is a state that is generally north of Georgia (GA)

      - St. Andrews University is in NC

      Since North Carolina is north of Georgia, and the two colleges are in their
      respective states, St. Andrews University (in NC) would be north of Columbus
      Technical College (in GA).


      Let me confirm this by thinking about the general geography of the US East Coast:

      - From north to south, these states are arranged roughly: NY, PA, MD, VA, NC,
      SC, GA, FL

      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1. St. Andrews University is located in North Carolina (NC)

      2. Columbus Technical College is located in Georgia (GA)

      3. Looking at the geographic arrangement of US states on the east coast, North
      Carolina is located north of Georgia

      4. Since St. Andrews University is in North Carolina and Columbus Technical
      College is in Georgia, the university must be north of the technical college

      I need to figure out if the Tennessee institution is north of the Mississippi
      institution.


      Generally speaking, Tennessee is north of Mississippi on the map of the United
      States. Tennessee borders Mississippi to the north.


      To be more specific about these particular institutions:

      - Bethel University is in Tennessee (TN)

      - University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry is in Mississippi
      (MS)


      Since Tennessee is north of Mississippi, and these institutions are in their
      respective states, it''s very likely that Bethel University in TN is north of
      the University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry in MS.


      To be even more precise, Bethel University is located in McKenzie, Tennessee,
      which is in the northwestern part of Tennessee.


      The University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry would likely
      be in Jackson, Mississippi (the capital and location of the main medical center

      University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry in MS.</think>#
      Is Bethel University, TN located north of University of Mississippi Medical
      Center School of Dentistry, MS?


      Let me think about this step by step:


      1) First, I need to consider the states: Tennessee (TN) and Mississippi (MS).

      2) Geographically, Tennessee is located directly north of Mississippi on the
      US map.

      3) Bethel University is in McKenzie, Tennessee, in the northwestern part of
      the state.

      4) The University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry is located
      in Jackson, Mississippi, which is in the central part of Mississippi.

      5) Since Tennessee is entirely north of Mississippi, any location in Tennessee
      (including Bethel University) would be north of any location in Mississippi
      (including the dental school in Jackson).


      Therefore, YES, Bethel University in Tennessee is located north of the University
      of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry in Mississippi.'

      This requires me to determine the locations of both institutions and then compare
      their north-south positioning.


      Step 1: Determine where Bethel University, TN is located.

      Bethel University is in McKenzie, Tennessee.


      Step 2: Determine where University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry
      is located.

      The University of Mississippi Medical Center is in Jackson, Mississippi.


      Step 3: Compare the north-south positioning.

      Tennessee is generally north of Mississippi in the United States. More specifically,
      I need to compare the latitudes of McKenzie, TN and Jackson, MS.


      McKenzie, TN is in the northwestern part of Tennessee.

      Jackson, MS is in the central part of Mississippi.


      Since Tennessee is north of Mississippi, and both cities are not on the extreme
      edges of their states that would change this relationship, Bethel University
      in McKenzie, TN is north of the University of Mississippi Medical Center School
      of Dentistry in Jackson, MS.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the geographic locations of both institutions and compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Bethel University is located in McKenzie, Tennessee

      Jackson, Mississippi


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      Tennessee is located directly north of Mississippi on the map of the United
      States. McKenzie, TN is in the northwestern part of Tennessee, while Jackson,
      MS is in the central part of Mississippi.


      Step 3: Determine relative position.

      Since Tennessee is entirely north of Mississippi, and the specific cities maintain
      this north-south relationship, Bethel University in Tennessee is indeed north
      of the University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry in Mississippi.

      Oklahoma City University is located in Oklahoma City, OK. Oklahoma is generally
      north of Texas.


      Tarleton State University is in Texas. Let me recall where exactly it is. Tarleton
      State University is located in Stephenville, Texas, which is in central Texas.


      Now, to be more precise:

      - Oklahoma City is located in the central part of Oklahoma

      - Stephenville, TX is located in north-central Texas


      Generally speaking, locations in Oklahoma are north of locations in Texas because
      Oklahoma is directly north of Texas on the map.


      Since Oklahoma City is in central Oklahoma, and Stephenville is in north-central
      Texas, Oklahoma City University should be north of Tarleton State University.
      The fact that Tarleton is in north-central Texas (rather than southern Texas)
      doesn''t change the fact that it''s still south of Oklahoma.

      - Oklahoma is a state that borders Texas to the north

      - Oklahoma City is in the central part of Oklahoma

      - Stephenville, Texas (home of Tarleton State) is in north-central Texas


      Since Oklahoma is entirely north of Texas on the map, and Oklahoma City is well

      State University, which is located in Texas.

      \ Oklahoma City University (in Oklahoma) is located north of Tarleton State\
      \ University (in Texas), I need to think about the geographic locations of these\
      \ universities.\n\nFirst, let me consider the states:\n- Oklahoma City University\
      \ is in Oklahoma (OK)\n- Tarleton State University is in Texas (TX)\n\nGenerally\
      \ speaking, Oklahoma is north of Texas, as Oklahoma borders Texas on Texas's\
      \ northern border. However, I need to be more specific about these particular\
      \ universities.\n\nLet me consider the specific locations:\n- Oklahoma City\
      \ University is in Oklahoma City, which is in the central part of Oklahoma\n\
      - Tarleton State University is in Stephenville, Texas, which I believe is in\
      \ central-to-northern Texas\n\nSince Oklahoma is directly north of Texas, and\
      \ Oklahoma City is not in the southern part of Oklahoma (it's more central),\
      \ while Stephenville, Texas is not in the far southern part of Texas, I believe\
      \ that Oklahoma City University would indeed be north of Tarleton State University.\n\
      \nTo be more precise:\n- Oklahoma City is roughly at latitude 35.5\xB0 N\n-\
      \ Stephenville, Texas (where Tarleton State is located) is roughly at latitude\
      \ 32.2\xB0 N\n\nSince 35.5\xB0 is greater than 32.2\xB0, Oklahoma City is further\
      \ north than Stephenville.</think># Is Oklahoma City University, OK located\
      \ north of Tarleton State University, TX?\n\nTo determine this, I need to identify\
      \ the geographic locations of both universities and compare their latitudes.\n\
      \n## Step 1: Identify locations\n- Oklahoma City University is located in Oklahoma\
      \ City, Oklahoma\n- Tarleton State University is located in Stephenville, Texas\n\
      \n## Step 2: Consider state positions\nOklahoma is directly north of Texas on\
      \ the US map, with the entire state of Oklahoma being above Texas.\n\n## Step\
      \ 3: Compare specific locations\n- Oklahoma City is in the central part of Oklahoma,\
      \ positioned at approximately 35.5\xB0 N latitude\n- Stephenville, Texas (home\
      \ of Tarleton State) is in north-central Texas, at approximately 32.2\xB0 N\
      \ latitude\n\nSince 35.5\xB0 N is higher (more northerly) than 32.2\xB0 N, Oklahoma\
      \ City University is indeed north of Tarleton State University.\n\n## Answer:\
      \ YES"
