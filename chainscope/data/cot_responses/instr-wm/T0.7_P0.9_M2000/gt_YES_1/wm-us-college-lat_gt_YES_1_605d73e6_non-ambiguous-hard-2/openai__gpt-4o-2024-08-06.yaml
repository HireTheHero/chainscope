      Williams University in Rhode Island, and then compare their latitudes to see
      which one is further north.


      1. **Location of Seattle Bible College, WA**: Seattle Bible College is located
      in the state of Washington, in the city of Seattle. Seattle is in the northwestern
      part of the United States and is known for being relatively far north compared
      to many other major U.S. cities.


      2. **Location of Roger Williams University, RI**: Roger Williams University
      is located in Bristol, Rhode Island. Rhode Island is in the northeastern part
      of the United States, but further south compared to Seattle.


      3. **Comparing Latitudes**: Seattle is situated at approximately 47.6 degrees
      north latitude. Bristol, Rhode Island is located at approximately 41.7 degrees
      north latitude.


      Since 47.6 is greater than 41.7, Seattle is indeed further north than Bristol.
