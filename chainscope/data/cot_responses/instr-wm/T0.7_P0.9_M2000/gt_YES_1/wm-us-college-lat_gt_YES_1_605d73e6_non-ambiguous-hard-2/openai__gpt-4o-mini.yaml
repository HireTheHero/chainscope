      2. **Locate Arkansas State University-Newport, AR**: Arkansas State University-Newport
      is located in Newport, Arkansas. Newport is situated in the southern part of
      the United States.


      3. **Geographical Comparison**: Connecticut is generally located to the north
      of Arkansas. Hartford, Connecticut, is further north than Newport, Arkansas,
      when looking at a map of the United States.


      Given this reasoning, we can conclude that the University of Hartford is indeed
      located north of Arkansas State University-Newport.


      The answer is: **YES**.'

    e8cb7fb9-769f-42e5-bc5b-d97b1a085960: 'To determine whether Cincinnati Christian
      University in Ohio is located north of Texas Tech University College of Architecture
      in Texas, we need to consider their geographical positions:


      1. **Cincinnati Christian University, OH**: Cincinnati is located in the southwestern
      part of Ohio.

      2. **Texas Tech University College of Architecture, TX**: Texas Tech is located
      in Lubbock, Texas, which is in the northwestern part of Texas.


      Next, we can look at the relative positions of Ohio and Texas:


      - Ohio is generally situated to the northeast of Texas on the map of the United
      States.

      - Since Cincinnati is in Ohio, and Texas is south of Ohio, it follows that Cincinnati
      Christian University is indeed north of Texas Tech University.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      YES'

      University in Ohio is located north of Texas Tech University College of Architecture
      in Texas, we need to consider the geographical locations of both universities.


      1. **Location of Cincinnati Christian University**: Cincinnati Christian University
      is located in Cincinnati, Ohio. Ohio is situated in the Midwestern region of
      the United States.


      2. **Location of Texas Tech University College of Architecture**: Texas Tech
      University is located in Lubbock, Texas. Texas is in the southern part of the
      United States.


      3. **Geographical Relation**: When we look at a map of the United States, Ohio
      (where Cincinnati is located) is directly north of Texas. Cincinnati is situated
      in the northern part of Ohio, and Lubbock is located in the northern part of
      Texas.


      Since Cincinnati is north of Lubbock, we conclude that Cincinnati Christian
      University is indeed located north of Texas Tech University College of Architecture.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'
