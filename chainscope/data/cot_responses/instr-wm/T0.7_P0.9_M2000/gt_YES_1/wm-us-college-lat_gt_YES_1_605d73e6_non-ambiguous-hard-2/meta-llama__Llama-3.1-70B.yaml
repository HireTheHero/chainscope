      2. Alcorn State University is located in Lorman, Mississippi (MS).


      Now, let''s consider the general geography of the United States. Arkansas is
      located in the southern part of the country, and Mississippi is also in the
      southern United States but is situated to the southeast of Arkansas.


      Given these locations:

      - Searcy, Arkansas is generally north of Lorman, Mississippi, because Arkansas
      is north of the southern part of Mississippi.


      So, comparing the two locations:

      - Harding University, AR is indeed located north of Alcorn State University,
      MS.


      The answer is: YES
