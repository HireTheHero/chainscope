      \n### Step 1: Identify the Locations of Both Universities\n\nFirst, we need\
      \ to know where Saint Martin's University and Gannon University are situated.\n\
      \n- **Saint Martin's University**: Located in Lacey, Washington.\n- **Gannon\
      \ University**: Located in Erie, Pennsylvania.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the\

      down step by step:


      1. **Locate Ohio Dominican University (ODU)**: ODU is located in Columbus, Ohio,
      which is in the northern part of the United States.

      2. **Locate Whitacre College of Engineering (WCE)**: WCE is part of Texas Tech
      University, located in Lubbock, Texas, which is in the southern part of the
      United States.

      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Ohio (Columbus) is significantly farther north
      than Texas (Lubbock). Generally, the entire state of Ohio is north of the entire
      state of Texas.


      Thus, **YES**, Ohio Dominican University, OH is located north of Whitacre College
