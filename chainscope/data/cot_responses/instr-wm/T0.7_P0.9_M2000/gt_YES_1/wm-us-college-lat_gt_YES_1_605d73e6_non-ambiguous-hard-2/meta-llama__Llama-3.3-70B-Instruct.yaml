      the stated location as a point of reference in Texas.


      1. **Identify the location of Selma University**: Selma University is located
      in Selma, Alabama.

      2. **Identify the intended location of Texas Tech University**: The question

      to refer to a location in Texas, let''s note that Fredericksburg, Texas, is
      in the central part of the state, and Lubbock is in the northwest part of Texas.

      3. **Compare the locations**: Alabama, where Selma University is located, is
      east of Texas. Considering the general geography of the United States, Alabama
      is also east and somewhat southeast of the majority of Texas.

      4. **Determine the relative north-south position**: Since the question asks
      if Selma University is north of a location in Texas, we need to understand that
      Alabama is generally at a lower latitude (more south) than the northern parts
      of Texas but can be at a similar or slightly higher latitude than the southern
      parts of Texas.


      Given these considerations, Texas is a large state, and its northern parts are
      indeed north of Alabama. However, since the specific reference to "Fredericksburg,
      TX" suggests a central part of Texas (though Texas Tech University is actually
      in Lubbock), and considering Alabama''s position relative to Texas:


      - Selma, Alabama, is generally southeast of Texas.

      - Parts of Texas, especially the northern parts, are north of Alabama.

      2. **Determine the geographical relationship**:\n   - Alabama is generally east\

      \ Southeast, while Texas is in the Southwest.\n   - Lubbock, Texas (the location\

      \ south compared to Selma, Alabama, when considering the U.S. map.\n\n3. **North-South\
      \ Comparison**:\n   - Selma, Alabama, is at a latitude of approximately 32.4\xB0\
      N.\n   - Lubbock, Texas (Texas Tech University's main location), is at a latitude\
      \ of approximately 33.6\xB0N.\n   - Fredericksburg, Texas, is at a latitude\
      \ of about 30.3\xB0N, which is actually south of both Selma, Alabama, and Lubbock,\
      \ Texas.\n\nGiven the above steps, comparing Selma University, AL, to a Texas\
      \ Tech University location (and considering the main campus in Lubbock for a\
      \ more direct comparison), Selma, Alabama, is indeed south of Lubbock, Texas.\
      \ However, since the question references \"Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg,\
      \ TX,\" and considering Fredericksburg, Texas, is actually south of Selma, Alabama,\
      \ the correct comparison based on the question's specifics would indicate that\
      \ Selma University is north of Fredericksburg, Texas.\n\nTherefore, the answer\
      \ to whether Selma University, AL, is located north of Texas Tech University\
      \ at Fredericksburg, TX (considering the given and clarifying the actual location\
      \ references), is **YES**."

    b180d24f-1155-4118-bb03-5808314e8d1a: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Wisconsin Lutheran College is located in Wisconsin
      (WI), and Oaksterdam University is located in California (CA).


      2. **Determine the general geographic locations**: Wisconsin is in the northern
      United States, while California is on the west coast, generally south of Wisconsin.


      3. **Consider the specific locations within the states**: Wisconsin Lutheran
      College is in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Oaksterdam University is in Oakland, California.


      4. **Compare the latitudes**: Milwaukee, WI, is at a higher latitude than Oakland,
      CA. Latitude measures how far north or south a place is, with higher latitudes
      being further north.


      Based on these steps, since Wisconsin is north of California, and considering
      the specific locations of Milwaukee (Wisconsin Lutheran College) and Oakland
      (Oaksterdam University), we can conclude that Wisconsin Lutheran College is
      indeed north of Oaksterdam University.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      1. First, we need to identify the location of California State University, San

      2. Next, we need to identify the location of Howard Payne University. Howard
      Payne University is located in Brownwood, Texas.


      3. Now, we compare their locations. California is a state on the West Coast
      of the United States, while Texas is a state in the South-Central United States.
      San Bernardino, California is generally southwest of Brownwood, Texas.


      4. Considering the general geography of the United States, Southern California
      (where San Bernardino is located) is south of Texas (where Brownwood is located).
