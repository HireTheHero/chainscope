      \ So, the user is asking if Capital University in Ohio is located north of Claflin\

      \ exactly these two universities are. \n\nStarting with Capital University.\
      \ I know it's in Ohio, but where in Ohio? I think it's in the capital city,\
      \ which is Columbus. Let me confirm that. Yes, Capital University is indeed\
      \ located in Columbus, Ohio. Now, Columbus is in the central part of Ohio, right?\
      \ So I need the coordinates or at least the latitude of Columbus, OH.\n\nNext,\
      \ Claflin University. That's in South Carolina. The city is Orangeburg, I believe.\
      \ Let me check. Yes, Claflin University is in Orangeburg, SC. Now, where is\
      \ Orangeburg located in South Carolina? It's in the central part of the state,\
      \ maybe a bit south. So I need the latitude of Orangeburg, SC.\n\nThe key here\
      \ is comparing the latitudes of the two cities. The further north a place is\
      \ (higher latitude), the more north it is. So if Columbus, OH has a higher latitude\
      \ than Orangeburg, SC, then the answer is YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nLet me recall\
      \ the approximate latitudes. Columbus, Ohio's latitude is around 39.98 degrees\
      \ North. Orangeburg, SC is at approximately 33.5 degrees North. Wait, that's\
      \ a significant difference. 39.98 vs 33.5. Since 39.98 is higher than 33.5,\
      \ Columbus is indeed north of Orangeburg. Therefore, Capital University in Ohio\
      \ is north of Claflin University in South Carolina.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check\
      \ the exact coordinates to be sure. Maybe I'm mixing up cities. For Columbus,\
      \ OH: Latitude 39.9612\xB0 N. For Orangeburg, SC: Latitude 33.4918\xB0 N. Yep,\

      \nNext, Claflin University in South Carolina. South Carolina is in the southeastern\

      Claflin University is in South Carolina. I remember that Claflin is a historically\

      \ Orangeburg, SC.\n\nNow I need to compare the latitudes of Columbus, Ohio,\

      \ north, so Ohio is north of South Carolina. But to be precise, let me recall\
      \ approximate latitudes. \n\nColumbus, OH is around 40\xB0N latitude. South\
      \ Carolina is further south. For example, Columbia, SC is about 34\xB0N. Orangeburg\

      yes, that's correct. So now I need the latitude of Orangeburg, SC.\n\nThe key\
      \ here is comparing the latitudes of Columbus, OH, and Orangeburg, SC. Since\
      \ the question is about whether one is north of the other, latitude is the determining\
      \ factor. The higher the latitude, the farther north a location is.\n\nFrom\
      \ what I remember, Columbus, OH, is around 40\xB0N latitude. Let me think\u2014\
      Ohio is north of states like Kentucky and West Virginia, which are around 37\xB0\
      N to 39\xB0N. So Columbus being in central Ohio might be around 40\xB0N. \n\n\
      On the other hand, South Carolina is further south. Orangeburg, SC, is in the\
      \ central part of the state. South Carolina's latitude ranges from about 32\xB0\

      \ if Claflin were in the northern part of SC and Capital in southern Ohio, maybe\
      \ the latitudes could be closer. But I think Columbus is pretty centrally located\
      \ in Ohio, which is a northern state relative to South Carolina. \n\nAnother\
      \ way to think about it: South Carolina is part of the Deep South, while Ohio\
      \ is part of the Midwest, which is more northern. So generally, any university\
      \ in Ohio would be north of one in South Carolina. Unless there's a specific\
      \ location in Ohio that's unusually south, but Columbus isn't. \n\nSo putting\

      Waukesha, WI's coordinates: I think it's around 43.01\xB0 N latitude. St. Louis,\

    131dc6cb-11fb-498e-91e4-f77db2564dcf: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The user is asking whether the University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Waukesha, WI is located north of Concordia Seminary, MO. They want a clear YES\
      \ or NO answer, but it requires some reasoning, so I need to break it down.\n\
      \nFirst, I need to figure out the locations of both places. Let's start with\
      \ the University of Wisconsin\u2013Waukesha. I know that Waukesha is a city\
      \ in Wisconsin. The University of Wisconsin system has several campuses, and\
      \ Waukesha is one of them. Now, where exactly is Waukesha, WI located within\
      \ the state? I recall that Wisconsin is in the northern part of the Midwest,\
      \ bordering Lake Michigan. Milwaukee is a major city in Wisconsin, and I think\
      \ Waukesha is a suburb of Milwaukee. Let me confirm that. Yes, Waukesha is about\
      \ 15 miles west of Milwaukee. So the coordinates for UW-Waukesha would be around\
      \ the same as the city of Waukesha. Looking up the latitude, Waukesha, WI is\
      \ approximately at 43.0117\xB0 N latitude.\n\nNext, Concordia Seminary in Missouri.\
      \ Concordia Seminary is a well-known Lutheran seminary. I think it's located\
      \ in St. Louis, Missouri. Let me verify that. Yes, Concordia Seminary is in\
      \ St. Louis, MO. So, I need the coordinates of St. Louis. St. Louis is in the\
      \ eastern part of Missouri, near the Mississippi River. The latitude of St.\
      \ Louis is approximately 38.6270\xB0 N.\n\nNow, comparing the latitudes. The\
      \ higher the latitude, the farther north a location is. Waukesha is at around\
      \ 43.01\xB0 N, and St. Louis is at about 38.62\xB0 N. Since 43.01 is greater\
      \ than 38.62, that means Waukesha, WI is indeed north of St. Louis, MO. Therefore,\
      \ the University of Wisconsin\u2013Waukesha, WI is located north of Concordia\
      \ Seminary in St. Louis, MO.\n\nWait a second, let's make sure there isn't another\
      \ Concordia Seminary in Missouri that's farther north. But to my knowledge,\
      \ the main Concordia Seminary is in St. Louis. There might be other Concordia\
      \ institutions, like Concordia University in other states, but the specific\
      \ one referred to here is the Seminary in St. Louis, MO. So unless there's another\
      \ one in northern Missouri, which I don't think exists, the answer should be\
      \ yes.\n\nAnother check: Maybe look up the exact coordinates. University of\
      \ Wisconsin-Waukesha's address is 1500 N University Dr, Waukesha, WI 53188.\
      \ The latitude here is approximately 43.0176\xB0 N. Concordia Seminary in St.\
      \ Louis is at 801 Seminary Place, St. Louis, MO 63105, with coordinates around\
      \ 38.6325\xB0 N. Comparing 43.0176\xB0 N vs. 38.6325\xB0 N confirms that UW-Waukesha\
      \ is north of Concordia Seminary. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>YES\
      \  \nThe University of Wisconsin\u2013Waukesha, WI, located at approximately\
      \ **43.0176\xB0 N**, is indeed north of Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, MO,\
      \ which sits at around **38.6325\xB0 N**. Since latitude increases northward,\
      \ Waukesha's higher latitude confirms its position north of the seminary."

      \ let me check the exact latitudes to be sure.\n\nFrom what I remember, St.\
      \ Louis, MO is around 38.6 degrees north latitude. Waukesha, WI is probably\

      \ Seminary is part of the Concordia University System, and the main one is in\
      \ St. Louis. Yes, Concordia Seminary is located in St. Louis, MO. Now, St. Louis\

      \ is around 43\xB0N, and Concordia Seminary is at about 38.6\xB0N. Since 43\

      \ Which one is further north? To do this, I should compare their latitudes.\
      \ \n\nI recall that Wisconsin is generally north of Missouri. For example, the\
      \ northern border of Missouri is around 40 degrees latitude, while Wisconsin's\
      \ southern border is around 42 degrees. So cities in southern Wisconsin like\
      \ Waukesha would be around 43 degrees north latitude. St. Louis, being in eastern\
      \ Missouri, is around 38.6 degrees north latitude. \n\nWait, let me confirm\

      \ Milwaukee is about 43\xB0N, and Waukesha is a suburb west of Milwaukee, so\
      \ it's probably around the same latitude, maybe 43.0\xB0N. St. Louis, MO is\

      \ St. Louis: The coordinates of St. Louis are about 38.6270\xB0 N, 90.1994\xB0\
      \ W. Comparing 43.0086\xB0N to 38.6270\xB0N, yes, Waukesha is definitely further\
      \ north. So the answer should be YES. But wait, did I get the locations right?\
      \ The question says Concordia Seminary, MO. Are there other Concordia Seminaries\
      \ in Missouri? I think the main one is in St. Louis, but maybe there's another\
      \ one? Hmm. Let me think. Concordia Seminary is a specific institution. I believe\
      \ there's Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, which is part of the Lutheran Church\u2013\
      Missouri Synod. There's also a Concordia University in other places, but the\
      \ seminary is in St. Louis. So that's correct. Therefore, since St. Louis is\

      \ the two: Waukesha, WI vs. St. Louis, MO. Generally, cities further north have\
      \ higher latitudes. Wisconsin is north of Missouri, but St. Louis is in the\
      \ eastern part of Missouri, which might be further north than some parts of\

      \ the actual latitudes.\n\nLooking up approximate latitudes: Waukesha, WI is\
      \ around 43.01\xB0 N. St. Louis, MO is approximately 38.63\xB0 N. So, 43\xB0\
      N vs. 38.6\xB0N. That would mean Waukesha is significantly north of St. Louis.\
      \ Therefore, the University of Wisconsin\u2013Waukesha would be north of Concordia\
      \ Seminary in St. Louis, MO.\n\nWait, but I should confirm if the Concordia\
      \ Seminary in question is indeed in St. Louis. Let me check. Yes, Concordia\
      \ Seminary is a well-known Lutheran seminary located in St. Louis, Missouri.\
      \ So, the coordinates for the seminary would be the same as St. Louis. Therefore,\
      \ since 43\xB0N is higher than 38.6\xB0N, the answer should be YES.\n</think>The\

      \ St. Louis, MO: St. Louis's coordinates are around 38.6270\xB0 N latitude,\

      \ is indeed north of St. Louis. Therefore, the University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Waukesha is located north of Concordia Seminary in Missouri.\n</think>YES  \n\
      The University of Wisconsin\u2013Waukesha, WI is located at approximately 43.01\xB0\

    f92ace8e-9f43-4a48-9b4b-fb3f19010470: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, I need to figure out if Eastern University in Pennsylvania is located\
      \ north of Texas Tech University's College of Human Sciences in Texas. Hmm,\
      \ okay. First, I should probably figure out the locations of both institutions.\
      \ \n\nStarting with Eastern University, PA. I know there's an Eastern University\
      \ in Pennsylvania, but where exactly? I think it's in the Philadelphia area.\
      \ Maybe St. Davids? I remember hearing that's a suburb of Philly. Let me confirm.\
      \ Yes, Eastern University's main campus is in St. Davids, Pennsylvania. \n\n\
      Next, Texas Tech University College of Human Sciences. That's part of Texas\
      \ Tech University, which is located in Lubbock, Texas. So the College of Human\
      \ Sciences would be in Lubbock as well. Okay, so now I need to compare the latitudes\
      \ of St. Davids, PA, and Lubbock, TX.\n\nTo determine which is further north,\
      \ I can check their approximate latitudes. Philadelphia, PA, is around 39.95\xB0\
      \ N latitude. St. Davids is a suburb, so probably similar. Lubbock, TX, I believe\
      \ is in the panhandle area of Texas. What's the latitude there? Let me think.\
      \ Lubbock's latitude is approximately 33.58\xB0 N. \n\nComparing 39.95\xB0 N\
      \ (St. Davids) vs. 33.58\xB0 N (Lubbock). Since latitude increases as you go\
      \ north, the higher number is further north. So 39.95 is definitely north of\
      \ 33.58. Therefore, Eastern University, PA, is north of Texas Tech's College\
      \ of Human Sciences in TX. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the exact location\
      \ of Eastern University. Maybe I'm mixing it up with another school. Eastern\
      \ University in St. Davids, PA, correct. And Texas Tech in Lubbock. Yes, Lubbock\
      \ is in the northern part of Texas, but still, Pennsylvania as a state is much\
      \ further north than Texas. Even the northernmost point of Texas (which is the\
      \ panhandle) is around 36.5\xB0 N. So St. Davids at almost 40\xB0 N is way north\
      \ of that. So the answer should be YES.\n</think>To determine if Eastern University\

      \ So, the user is asking whether Wayland Baptist University in Texas is located\
      \ north of the University of New Orleans in Louisiana. I need to figure out\
      \ the answer step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably find the locations of\
      \ both universities. Let me start with the University of New Orleans (UNO).\
      \ I know that New Orleans is a major city in Louisiana, right on the Gulf Coast.\
      \ From what I remember, New Orleans is pretty far south in Louisiana, near the\
      \ mouth of the Mississippi River. So the University of New Orleans being there\
      \ would have a latitude that's relatively low, meaning it's further south.\n\
      \nNow, Wayland Baptist University in Texas. I'm not as familiar with its exact\
      \ location. Let me think. Texas is a big state, so the latitude can vary a lot.\
      \ Wayland Baptist has several campuses, but the main one is in Plainview, Texas,\
      \ if I'm not mistaken. Let me confirm that. Yes, the main campus is in Plainview,\
      \ TX. Where is Plainview? It's in the Texas Panhandle region, which is the northern\
      \ part of Texas. The Panhandle is up near Amarillo, right? So Plainview would\
      \ be northwest of Lubbock, maybe. That area is definitely in the northern part\
      \ of Texas.\n\nNext, I need to compare the latitudes of Plainview, TX and New\
      \ Orleans, LA. Latitude determines how far north or south a place is. The higher\
      \ the latitude, the further north. So if Plainview's latitude is higher than\
      \ New Orleans', then the answer is yes.\n\nLet me get approximate coordinates.\
      \ New Orleans is around 29.95\xB0 N latitude. That's pretty far south. Now,\
      \ Plainview, Texas: looking it up, Plainview is at approximately 34.18\xB0 N\
      \ latitude. Comparing the two, 34.18\xB0 N is definitely higher than 29.95\xB0\

      \ the Gulf of Mexico. It's a coastal city, so its latitude is probably lower\
      \ (more south) compared to many other places in the US. On the other hand, Texas\
      \ is a big state, so Wayland Baptist could be anywhere in Texas. Wait, Wayland\
      \ Baptist University\u2014I think there are multiple campuses, but the main\
      \ one is in Plainview, Texas. Let me confirm that. Yeah, the main campus is\
      \ in Plainview, TX.\n\nNow, where is Plainview? I remember that Texas has regions\
      \ like the Panhandle, which is the northern part. Plainview, Texas\u2014I think\
      \ it's in the Panhandle area. Let me check in my mind: cities like Amarillo\
      \ are in the Texas Panhandle, and Plainview is actually southwest of Amarillo.\
      \ So Plainview is in the northern part of Texas, maybe around 34\xB0N latitude?\
      \ \n\nNew Orleans, LA: I know it's at around 29.95\xB0N latitude. So if Plainview\
      \ is at, say, 34.18\xB0N, then yes, it would be north of New Orleans. Let me\
      \ think of other reference points. For example, Dallas is around 32.78\xB0N,\
      \ which is north of New Orleans. Since Plainview is north of Dallas, being in\
      \ the Panhandle, that would make it even further north. \n\nSo comparing the\

      \ which is definitely northern Texas. If Plainview is near there, that would\
      \ be higher latitude. Let me think. Yes, Plainview is in the Texas Panhandle\

    68fbfdb0-316f-4c9c-9ff9-a7f54b0d3e24: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the user wants to know if Wayland Baptist University in Texas is located\
      \ north of the University of New Orleans in Louisiana. The answer needs to be\
      \ a simple yes or no, but they want the reasoning first.\n\nOkay, first, I need\
      \ to figure out the locations of both universities. Let's start with the University\
      \ of New Orleans (UNO). I know that New Orleans is a major city in Louisiana,\
      \ situated in the southeastern part of the state. From what I remember, New\
      \ Orleans is near the Gulf of Mexico, which would mean it's at a lower latitude,\
      \ more southern. So, its coordinates are probably around 29.95\xB0 N latitude.\
      \ Let me confirm that... Yes, the University of New Orleans is in New Orleans,\
      \ LA, and the city's coordinates are approximately 29.9511\xB0 N, 90.0715\xB0\
      \ W.\n\nNow, Wayland Baptist University (WBU) in Texas. I'm less familiar with\
      \ its exact location. Let me think. Texas is a big state, so the latitude can\
      \ vary. Wayland Baptist has multiple campuses, but the main one is in Plainview,\
      \ Texas. Plainview is in the Texas Panhandle region, which is the northern part\
      \ of Texas. The Texas Panhandle is known for being more flat and agricultural.\
      \ The latitude there should be higher than New Orleans. Let me check the coordinates\
      \ for Plainview, TX. A quick search shows that Plainview is at approximately\
      \ 34.1848\xB0 N, 101.7068\xB0 W. \n\nComparing the two latitudes: 34.1848\xB0\
      \ N for Plainview (WBU) versus 29.9511\xB0 N for New Orleans (UNO). Since latitude\
      \ increases as you go north, 34.18 is definitely higher than 29.95. Therefore,\
      \ Wayland Baptist University in Texas is located north of the University of\
      \ New Orleans in Louisiana. \n\nWait, but let me make sure there's no mistake.\
      \ Maybe I mixed up the campuses? The question specifies Wayland Baptist University,\
      \ TX, so it's the main campus in Plainview. There are other campuses, like in\
      \ San Antonio or elsewhere, but the main one is Plainview. So yes, that's correct.\
      \ The latitude difference is significant enough\u2014about 4 degrees, which\
      \ translates to several hundred miles north. So the answer should be yes.\n\
      </think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Locate University of New\

      \ campus is in Plainview, TX, with coordinates approximately 34.18\xB0 N latitude.\
      \  \n3. **Compare Latitudes:** Since 34.18\xB0 N (WBU) is farther north than\
      \ 29.95\xB0 N (UNO), WBU is indeed north of UNO.  \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    a25fb03b-ff71-409d-9b19-7fb87f15c8bd: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Wayland Baptist University in Texas is north of the University of New Orleans\
      \ in Louisiana. Let me start by recalling where these two cities are. \n\nFirst,\
      \ I know that New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana, right along the Mississippi\
      \ River near the Gulf of Mexico. It's a major city in the southern part of the\
      \ state. The University of New Orleans (UNO) is there.\n\nNow, Wayland Baptist\
      \ University is in Texas. But Texas is a big state. I need to pinpoint where\
      \ exactly this university is located. Wayland Baptist has its main campus in\
      \ Plainview, Texas. Wait, Plainview... I think that's in the northern part of\
      \ Texas, maybe the Panhandle region? Let me check mentally. The Texas Panhandle\
      \ is up near Amarillo, right? Plainview might be near there. If that's the case,\
      \ then that area is definitely in the northern part of Texas.\n\nBut to compare\
      \ latitudes, I need to think about the actual coordinates. New Orleans is at\
      \ a lower latitude because it's closer to the Gulf. For example, the approximate\
      \ latitude of New Orleans is around 29.95\xB0 N. What about Plainview, TX? I'm\
      \ not exactly sure, but Amarillo is around 35.22\xB0 N. Since Plainview is in\
      \ the Panhandle, maybe it's similar. Let's say Plainview is around 34.18\xB0\
      \ N (I might be making a rough estimate here). If that's the case, then Plainview,\
      \ TX (Wayland Baptist) would be north of New Orleans, LA (29.95\xB0 N). So 34\xB0\
      \ N is definitely higher than 30\xB0 N, so yes, it's further north.\n\nWait,\
      \ but maybe I should double-check the exact cities. Let me think: University\
      \ of New Orleans is in New Orleans, which is in the southern tip of Louisiana.\
      \ Wayland Baptist in Plainview, TX. If I visualize a map, Texas is south of\
      \ Oklahoma, and the Panhandle is that rectangular part sticking up. So cities\
      \ like Amarillo, Lubbock, and Plainview would be in that northern area. Therefore,\
      \ their latitudes are higher than New Orleans, which is near the Gulf. So yes,\
      \ Wayland Baptist University in Texas would be north of the University of New\
      \ Orleans.\n</think>To determine if Wayland Baptist University (TX) is north\
      \ of the University of New Orleans (LA):  \n1. **Locations**:  \n   - Wayland\

      \ of both cities. Latitude measures how far north or south a place is. The higher\
      \ the latitude, the farther north it is. \n\nLet me recall: New Orleans is in\
      \ the southern part of Louisiana, near the Gulf of Mexico. It's a coastal city,\
      \ so its latitude should be relatively low. I remember that New Orleans is around\
      \ 30 degrees north latitude. Maybe 29.95\xB0 N or something like that. \n\n\
      Plainview, Texas, on the other hand, is in the Texas Panhandle. The Panhandle\
      \ is the northern part of Texas, which is more towards the center of the US.\
      \ Cities like Amarillo are in the Panhandle, and they have higher latitudes.\
      \ Let me think, Amarillo is around 35 degrees north. Plainview is west of Amarillo,\
      \ but still in the Panhandle. So maybe Plainview's latitude is around 34\xB0\
      \ N. \n\nIf Plainview is at 34\xB0 N and New Orleans is at around 30\xB0 N,\
      \ then Plainview is indeed north of New Orleans. Therefore, Wayland Baptist\

      \ how far north or south a place is. The higher the latitude, the further north\
      \ it is. So if Muncie, IN has a higher latitude than Charlottesville, VA, then\
      \ the answer is yes.\n\nLet me recall the approximate latitudes. Indiana is\

      \ Maybe I should look up the exact coordinates. \n\nWait, I remember that the\
      \ general latitude for Indiana is around 40\xB0N. For example, Indianapolis\
      \ is about 39.7684\xB0 N. Muncie is a bit north of Indianapolis, so maybe around\
      \ 40.2\xB0 N. \n\nCharlottesville, VA is in central Virginia. I think Virginia's\
      \ latitude is lower than Indiana's. For example, Richmond, VA is around 37.5407\xB0\
      \ N. Charlottesville is a bit west of Richmond, but still in Virginia. Let me\
      \ think, Charlottesville's latitude is approximately 38.0293\xB0 N. \n\nComparing\
      \ 40.2\xB0 N (Muncie) to 38.03\xB0 N (Charlottesville), Muncie is indeed further\

      \ Ball State University in Indiana is located north of the University of Virginia\

      \ exactly each institution is. Ball State University is in Indiana. I think\
      \ it's in Muncie, Indiana. Right? Let me confirm that. Yes, Ball State is indeed\
      \ in Muncie. Now, the University of Virginia is in Charlottesville, Virginia.\
      \ The Center for Politics is part of UVA, so it's probably also in Charlottesville.\n\
      \nNext step is to find the latitude of Muncie, IN, and Charlottesville, VA.\
      \ Latitude determines how far north or south a place is. The higher the latitude,\
      \ the farther north. \n\nI remember that Indiana is in the Midwest, while Virginia\
      \ is on the East Coast, more to the south. But I need exact coordinates to be\
      \ sure. Let me think. Muncie's latitude... maybe around 40 degrees north? And\
      \ Charlottesville is somewhere in Virginia. Virginia's latitude is lower than\
      \ Indiana's? Wait, Virginia is south of the Mason-Dixon line, which traditionally\
      \ separates the northern and southern states. Indiana is north of that line.\
      \ So that might mean Ball State is north of UVA's Center for Politics.\n\nBut\
      \ let me get more precise. If I can recall, Charlottesville's latitude is approximately\
      \ 38 degrees north. Muncie, being in Indiana, is a bit further north. Let me\
      \ check mentally: Indianapolis is around 39.76\xB0 N. Muncie is northeast of\
      \ Indianapolis, so maybe a similar or slightly higher latitude. Let's say Muncie\
      \ is around 40.2\xB0 N. Charlottesville, VA is at about 38.03\xB0 N. So 40.2\
      \ compared to 38.03. Since 40.2 is higher, that would mean Muncie (Ball State)\
      \ is north of Charlottesville (UVA Center for Politics). \n\nTherefore, the\
      \ answer should be YES. But wait, I want to make sure. Maybe I should recall\
      \ some cities. For example, Washington D.C. is around 38.9\xB0 N. Charlottesville\
      \ is a bit south of D.C. So Charlottesville's latitude is lower than D.C.'s.\
      \ Indianapolis is at almost 40\xB0 N, which is north of D.C. So if Muncie is\
      \ in Indiana, even more north, then yes, it's definitely north of Charlottesville.\
      \ \n\nAnother way to check: looking at states. Indiana is directly north of\
      \ Kentucky, which is south of the Ohio River. Virginia is east of Kentucky.\
      \ The northern part of Virginia (like near D.C.) is around 39\xB0 N, but Charlottesville\
      \ is further south in Virginia. So comparing Muncie, IN (40.2\xB0 N) to Charlottesville,\
      \ VA (38\xB0 N), the latitude difference is about 2 degrees, which is significant.\
      \ Each degree is about 69 miles, so 2 degrees would be roughly 138 miles difference\
      \ north. \n\nTherefore, Ball State University in Indiana is indeed located north\
      \ of the University of Virginia Center for Politics in Virginia. So the answer\
      \ should be YES.\n</think>To determine if Ball State University, IN is north\

      \nStarting with Ball State University (BSU), I know it's in Indiana. More specifically,\
      \ I recall that Ball State is in Muncie, Indiana. Now, where exactly is Muncie?\
      \ Indiana is in the Midwest, and Muncie is in the east-central part of the state.\
      \ To get the precise latitude, I might need to look it up, but from memory,\

      \nNext, the University of Virginia Center for Politics is part of the University\

      \ 40.1934\xB0 N for Muncie (Ball State) and 38.0293\xB0 N for Charlottesville\
      \ (UVA Center for Politics). Since latitude increases as you go north, a higher\

      \ the latitudes of Muncie, Indiana and Charlottesville, Virginia to see which\
      \ is farther north.\n\nLatitude is the key here. The higher the latitude, the\
      \ farther north a place is. So I need to find the latitude coordinates for both\
      \ cities. Let me recall... Muncie, Indiana. I think Indiana is in the Midwest,\
      \ so maybe around 40 degrees north latitude? Charlottesville, Virginia is on\
      \ the East Coast, but Virginia is south of Pennsylvania, so maybe lower latitude.\
      \ Wait, actually, Virginia is south of the Mason-Dixon line, so its latitude\
      \ might be lower than Indiana's. Let me try to remember specific coordinates.\n\
      \nWait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of major cities nearby. For example,\
      \ Indianapolis, Indiana's capital, is around 39.7684\xB0 N. Muncie is northeast\
      \ of Indianapolis, so maybe a bit higher? Let's say around 40.2\xB0 N. Charlottesville,\

      \ Indiana is west of Virginia but how about north? Let's visualize the US map.\
      \ The northern border of Virginia is at around 39.5\xB0 N (like the northern\

      \ can't be right. Let me get specific.\n\nActually, the latitude of Muncie,\
      \ IN is approximately 40.1984\xB0 N. Charlottesville, VA is approximately 38.0293\xB0\
      \ N. Comparing these, 40.1984 is definitely north of 38.0293. So Ball State\

      Starting with Selma University in Alabama. Selma is a city in Alabama, right?\
      \ I remember that Alabama is in the southeastern US, so probably around the\

      \ Antonio is 29.4, and Fredericksburg is north of that, perhaps 30.2 or 30.3.\
      \ \n\nComparing the two: Selma, AL at ~32.4\xB0 N versus Fredericksburg, TX\
      \ at ~30.3\xB0 N. Since 32.4 is higher than 30.3, Selma would be north of Fredericksburg.\
      \ Therefore, the answer is YES, Selma University in Alabama is north of Texas\

      \ the exact locations? Let me visualize a map. Alabama is east of Mississippi,\
      \ and Texas is to the west. Selma is in central Alabama. Fredericksburg is in\
      \ central Texas. Generally, the southern states like Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,\
      \ and Texas are at lower latitudes, but Alabama is a bit more to the east and\

      \ the southern tip of Texas is at about 26\xB0 N, but central Texas cities are\
      \ around 30-31\xB0 N. Alabama's latitude ranges from around 30\xB0 N at the\

      \ name \"Indiana\" in the university's name might be confusing because there's\
      \ also a state called Indiana, but this university is in Pennsylvania. Specifically,\
      \ I think IUP is located in the town of Indiana, Pennsylvania. Now, where exactly\
      \ is that in PA? Pennsylvania is bordered by New York to the north, so the northern\
      \ part of PA would be closer to NY. But Indiana, PA, I believe is actually in\
      \ the western part of the state. Let me confirm that. Yes, Indiana is a borough\
      \ in Indiana County, western Pennsylvania. So, coordinates-wise, maybe around\
      \ 40\xB037' N latitude.\n\nNext, the University of North Carolina Wilmington.\
      \ Wilmington is a city in southeastern North Carolina, right near the coast.\
      \ NC is south of Virginia, so it's in the southeastern US. Wilmington's latitude\
      \ should be lower (more south) compared to Indiana, PA. Let me think about the\
      \ approximate latitude of Wilmington, NC. I recall that cities like Raleigh,\
      \ NC are around 35\xB0 N. Wilmington is further south and east, so maybe around\
      \ 34\xB0 N latitude.\n\nComparing the two: if Indiana, PA is at approximately\
      \ 40.6\xB0 N and Wilmington, NC is around 34.2\xB0 N, then Indiana, PA is indeed\
      \ north of Wilmington, NC. Latitude increases as you go north, so the higher\
      \ the latitude, the more northern the location. Therefore, 40.6\xB0 N is definitely\
      \ north of 34.2\xB0 N. \n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check the exact coordinates\
      \ to be sure. Let me verify. Looking up Indiana University of Pennsylvania's\
      \ location: the city of Indiana, PA has coordinates approximately 40.6206\xB0\
      \ N, 79.1589\xB0 W. For UNC Wilmington, the coordinates are about 34.2257\xB0\
      \ N, 77.8717\xB0 W. Comparing the latitudes: 40.62 vs. 34.22. Yes, 40.62 is\
      \ higher, so Indiana, PA is north of Wilmington, NC. Therefore, the answer should\
      \ be YES.\n</think>YES  \nIndiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) is located\
      \ in Indiana, PA, at approximately **40.62\xB0 N** latitude. The University\
      \ of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) is in Wilmington, NC, at roughly **34.22\xB0\
      \ N** latitude. Since latitude increases as you move north, IUP is definitively\
      \ north of UNCW."
    338c26d0-505b-4eaa-bd36-f665150d3452: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) in PA is located north of\
      \ the University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) in NC. Hmm, I need to figure\
      \ out the geographic locations of these two universities and compare their latitudes.\n\
      \nFirst, I should recall where each of these schools is. Indiana University\
      \ of Pennsylvania is in Indiana, PA. Wait, Indiana is a town in Pennsylvania,\
      \ right? So the university is in the state of Pennsylvania. On the other hand,\
      \ the University of North Carolina Wilmington is in Wilmington, North Carolina.\
      \ \n\nNow, I need to determine the approximate latitudes of these two cities.\
      \ Pennsylvania is a northern state compared to North Carolina, which is in the\
      \ southeastern U.S. But I should get more specific. Let me think about the states'\
      \ positions. Pennsylvania is north of Maryland, which is north of Virginia,\
      \ which is north of North Carolina. So generally, Pennsylvania is further north\
      \ than North Carolina. But cities within states can vary. For example, the southern\
      \ part of a northern state might be further south than the northern part of\
      \ a southern state. But in this case, I think Indiana, PA is in western Pennsylvania,\
      \ maybe near Pittsburgh? And Wilmington, NC is on the coast, near the southern\
      \ part of the state.\n\nWait, let me check the approximate coordinates. Indiana,\
      \ PA's latitude is around 40\xB037' N. Wilmington, NC is at about 34\xB013'\
      \ N. If that's accurate, then Indiana, PA is definitely north of Wilmington,\
      \ NC. But how sure am I about these coordinates? Maybe I should think of other\
      \ reference points. For example, the Mason-Dixon line, which separates Pennsylvania\
      \ from Maryland, is around 39\xB043' N. So Pennsylvania is above that line.\
      \ North Carolina is much further south. Wilmington, NC is a coastal city, so\
      \ it's in the southeastern part of the state. So even the northernmost part\
      \ of NC would be around 36\xB030' N (the VA-NC border), but Wilmington is at\
      \ the coast, which is lower. So 34\xB0N makes sense for Wilmington. Indiana,\
      \ PA being around 40\xB0N would be significantly north of that. Therefore, the\
      \ answer should be YES.\n</think>To determine if Indiana University of Pennsylvania\

      \ NC (latitude ~34.2\xB0N).  \n2. **Latitude Comparison**: 40.6\xB0N (IUP) is\
      \ significantly north of 34.2\xB0N (UNCW).  \n\nANSWER: YES"
    3b4bda09-e066-4276-9050-2b67cbd996d2: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) is located north of the University\
      \ of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW). Let me start by recalling where these\
      \ two schools are.\n\nFirst, Indiana University of Pennsylvania. The name is\
      \ a bit tricky because \"Indiana\" is a state, but here it's part of the university's\
      \ name in Pennsylvania. IUP is in Indiana, Pennsylvania. Wait, so the town is\
      \ called Indiana, and it's in Pennsylvania. Got it. Now, where exactly is that\
      \ in PA? I think Pennsylvania is in the northeastern part of the US. Indiana,\
      \ PA, maybe in the western part? Let me check mentally. Pennsylvania's major\
      \ cities are Philadelphia in the east, Pittsburgh in the west. Indiana, PA,\
      \ I think is near Pittsburgh. Maybe northwest of Pittsburgh? So the coordinates\
      \ for Indiana, PA would be around 40\xB037'N latitude. Let me confirm that later.\n\
      \nThen, University of North Carolina Wilmington. Wilmington is a city in North\
      \ Carolina, which is a southern state. North Carolina is south of Virginia,\
      \ so Wilmington would be on the coast. The coordinates for Wilmington, NC are\
      \ approximately 34\xB013'N latitude. \n\nSo comparing the two latitudes: Indiana,\
      \ PA is around 40.6\xB0N and Wilmington, NC is around 34.2\xB0N. Since latitude\
      \ increases as you go north, 40.6 is higher than 34.2, so Indiana, PA is indeed\
      \ north of Wilmington, NC. Therefore, Indiana University of Pennsylvania is\
      \ located north of the University of North Carolina Wilmington.\n</think>To\

      N**.  \n3. Since 40.62\xB0N (IUP) is farther north than 34.21\xB0N (UNCW), the\
      \ answer is **YES**.  \n\nANSWER: YES"
    422d460d-2365-4164-aca0-baa8d849949f: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\

      \ Pennsylvania, right? Not the state of Indiana. So that's in the western part\
      \ of PA, maybe? Then UNC Wilmington is in Wilmington, North Carolina, which\
      \ is on the coast, probably southeastern part of NC.\n\nTo get the exact coordinates,\
      \ maybe I should think about the states' positions. Pennsylvania is north of\
      \ North Carolina, generally. But the specific locations of the universities\
      \ might vary. For example, if IUP is in northern PA and UNCW is in southern\
      \ NC, then the answer is definitely yes. But if IUP is in southern PA and UNCW\
      \ is in northern NC, maybe they could be closer in latitude.\n\nWait, Pennsylvania\
      \ is a state that's more to the north compared to North Carolina. The southern\
      \ border of PA is around the same latitude as the northern border of NC. Let\
      \ me think: the southern border of Pennsylvania is the Mason-Dixon line, which\
      \ separates it from Maryland. Then below Maryland is West Virginia and Virginia,\
      \ and then North Carolina. So the latitude of PA's southern border is roughly\
      \ around 39\xB043' N (like the southernmost point near Maryland). North Carolina's\
      \ northern border is around 36\xB030' N, but Wilmington is on the coast, so\
      \ maybe around 34\xB0 N? Because North Carolina's southern border is at 33\xB0\
      50' N. Wait, no, that's the border with South Carolina. So Wilmington, NC is\
      \ at the southeastern part, so its latitude is probably around 34\xB014' N.\
      \ Let me check that in my mind. For example, Wilmington, NC is at approximately\
      \ 34.21\xB0N latitude. \n\nIndiana, PA is in Indiana County, PA. Let me think\
      \ where that is. Indiana, PA is in western Pennsylvania, maybe around 40\xB0\
      N. For example, the coordinates of Indiana University of Pennsylvania are approximately\
      \ 40.62\xB0N, 79.15\xB0W. So that's about 40.6\xB0N. \n\nComparing that to Wilmington,\
      \ NC's latitude of 34.21\xB0N, 40.6 is definitely north of 34.21. So yes, Indiana\
      \ University of PA is north of UNC Wilmington. \n\nWait, but maybe I should\
      \ double-check the approximate latitudes. Let me think of other cities. For\
      \ example, Philadelphia, PA is around 39.95\xB0N. Pittsburgh is around 40.44\xB0\
      N. Indiana, PA is east of Pittsburgh, maybe a bit north? Wait, no, Indiana is\
      \ northeast of Pittsburgh. But regardless, if Pittsburgh is 40.44\xB0N, then\
      \ Indiana, PA being in the same state but more east might be similar. So 40.6\xB0\
      N sounds right. \n\nWilmington, NC is a coastal city. For reference, Myrtle\
      \ Beach, SC is around 33.7\xB0N, so Wilmington, being in NC, is a bit north\
      \ of that, maybe 34.2\xB0N. So 40.6 vs 34.2, so yes, IUP is significantly north.\
      \ Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \nIndiana University of Pennsylvania\
      \ (IUP) is located in Indiana, PA, at approximately **40.62\xB0N** latitude.\
      \ The University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) is in Wilmington, NC, at\
      \ roughly **34.21\xB0N** latitude. Since 40.62\xB0N is significantly north of\
      \ 34.21\xB0N, IUP is indeed located north of UNCW.  \n\n**Answer:** YES"

      \ 39.7 degrees N. So the southern part of PA is still north of the northern\
      \ part of NC. So if Indiana, PA is in central or northern PA, it's definitely\
      \ north. But where exactly is Indiana, PA located?\n\nLet me get more precise.\
      \ Indiana, PA is in Indiana County. Looking at a map, Indiana, PA is about 40-50\

      \ whether Colorado Mesa University in Colorado is located north of Antioch University\
      \ Santa Barbara in California. Hmm, I need to figure out the latitudes of both\

      \ universities are. Colorado Mesa University is in Grand Junction, Colorado.\
      \ Antioch University Santa Barbara is in Santa Barbara, California. So I need\
      \ the latitude coordinates for both cities.\n\nI know that latitude measures\
      \ how far north or south a place is. The higher the latitude, the farther north\
      \ it is. So if Grand Junction, CO has a higher latitude than Santa Barbara,\
      \ CA, then the answer is yes.\n\nLet me try to remember or estimate the latitudes.\
      \ Santa Barbara is in Southern California, along the coast. I think Southern\
      \ California is around 34 degrees north latitude. For example, Los Angeles is\
      \ about 34\xB0 N. Santa Barbara is a bit north of LA, maybe around 34\xB025'\
      \ N or so. \n\nGrand Junction, Colorado is in western Colorado. Colorado's latitude\
      \ ranges from around 37\xB0N to 41\xB0N. Grand Junction is in the western part,\
      \ so maybe around 39 degrees north. For example, Denver is at about 39.7\xB0\
      N, but Grand Junction is further west, but still in Colorado. Wait, actually,\
      \ Grand Junction's latitude is approximately 39.06\xB0 N. Let me confirm that.\
      \ \n\nIf Santa Barbara is around 34.42\xB0 N (I think that's correct), and Grand\
      \ Junction is 39.06\xB0 N, then 39.06 is definitely north of 34.42. So Colorado\
      \ Mesa University would be north of Antioch University Santa Barbara. \n\nWait,\
      \ but maybe I should double-check the exact coordinates. Let me think. Santa\
      \ Barbara, CA: I recall that the city's coordinates are approximately 34\xB0\
      25\u2032N 119\xB042\u2032W. So converting 34\xB025' N to decimal, that's 34\
      \ + 25/60 \u2248 34.4167\xB0 N. \n\nGrand Junction, CO: The coordinates are\
      \ approximately 39\xB003\u2032N 108\xB033\u2032W. Converting 39\xB003' N to\
      \ decimal is 39 + 3/60 = 39.05\xB0 N. \n\nComparing 39.05\xB0 N (Grand Junction)\
      \ vs. 34.4167\xB0 N (Santa Barbara). Since 39.05 is higher than 34.4167, Grand\
      \ Junction is indeed north of Santa Barbara. Therefore, Colorado Mesa University\
      \ is located north of Antioch University Santa Barbara. \n\nSo the answer should\
      \ be YES.\n</think>YES  \nColorado Mesa University in Grand Junction, CO (latitude\
      \ ~39.05\xB0N) is located north of Antioch University Santa Barbara, CA (latitude\

      \ I'm not exactly sure, but Colorado is a northern state compared to California.\
      \ Wait, but California is on the west coast. Let me think, Santa Barbara is\

      \ degrees, and Santa Barbara is a bit north of LA, maybe 34.4 or something.\
      \ \n\nGrand Junction, CO. Colorado's latitude ranges. Denver is at about 39.7\
      \ degrees north. Grand Junction is west of Denver but still in Colorado. Since\
      \ Colorado is a rectangle, the latitude shouldn't vary too much from east to\
      \ west. So Grand Junction might be around 39 degrees north. If that's the case,\
      \ then 39 degrees north (Colorado Mesa) versus 34 degrees north (Antioch in\

      \ First, I need to figure out where each university is located geographically.\n\
      \nStarting with Colorado Mesa University (CMU). I know Colorado is a state in\

      \ Colorado itself is a rectangular state, kind of in the middle of the western\

      Comparing the two latitudes: 39.06\xB0 N vs. 34.42\xB0 N. Since latitude increases\

      \ Grand Junction, CO, and Santa Barbara, CA.\n\nI remember that in the US, latitude\
      \ increases as you go north. California is on the west coast, and Colorado is\
      \ more inland. Santa Barbara is in Southern California, so its latitude should\

      \ coast. Its latitude is around 34 degrees north, maybe? Like 34\xB025\u2032\
      N or something like that. Grand Junction, Colorado, I'm less sure about. Colorado\
      \ is a more northern state than California, but Grand Junction is in the western\

      N. \n\nSo comparing 39.06\xB0N vs. 34.42\xB0N, 39 is definitely north of 34.\
      \ So Colorado Mesa University in Grand Junction would be north of Antioch in\

      \ up the cities? Let me confirm quickly. Yes, Grand Junction is in western Colorado,\
      \ and Santa Barbara is in southern California. Since Colorado is north of New\
      \ Mexico and Arizona, which are south of Utah and Colorado, Santa Barbara being\
      \ in Southern CA would be lower in latitude. So yeah, the Colorado location\

      \ Lake Michigan College is in Benton Harbor, Michigan, I think. Wait, maybe\
      \ I should confirm that. Let me recall: Lake Michigan College has its main campus\

      \ positions of River Falls, WI and Benton Harbor, MI.\n\nNext, I need to determine\
      \ their latitudes. The one with the higher latitude is further north. So, if\
      \ River Falls, WI has a higher latitude than Benton Harbor, MI, then the answer\
      \ is yes. Otherwise, no.\n\nLet me recall the approximate locations. River Falls\
      \ is in western Wisconsin, near the Minnesota border. Benton Harbor is in southwestern\
      \ Michigan, near the Indiana border and along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan.\
      \ So, generally, the Upper Midwest versus the lower part of Michigan. But where\
      \ in terms of latitude?\n\nI know that the southernmost part of Wisconsin is\
      \ around the same latitude as the northern part of Indiana. Benton Harbor is\
      \ in Michigan's lower peninsula, near the Indiana border. So Benton Harbor is\
      \ pretty far south in Michigan. River Falls is in western Wisconsin, which is\
      \ north of the southern part of Wisconsin. So maybe River Falls is north of\
      \ Benton Harbor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of major cities. For example,\
      \ Chicago is around 41.8781\xB0 N. Milwaukee is around 43.0389\xB0 N. Benton\
      \ Harbor is near the Michigan-Indiana border, so maybe around 42\xB0 N? Let\
      \ me check approximate coordinates.\n\nLooking up River Falls, WI: I think it's\
      \ around 44\xB0 51' N latitude. Benton Harbor, MI is approximately 42\xB0 7'\
      \ N. So 44.85 vs 42.12. That would mean River Falls is significantly north of\
      \ Benton Harbor. Therefore, the answer would be YES.\n\nWait, but let me make\
      \ sure. Maybe I'm mixing up the exact coordinates. Let me think again. The latitude\
      \ of Benton Harbor, MI: since it's near the Indiana border, and Indiana's northern\
      \ border is at 41.7\xB0 N. Michigan's southern border is along 41.7\xB0 N, so\
      \ Benton Harbor, being in the southwest of Michigan, is probably around 42.1\xB0\
      \ N. River Falls, WI is in St. Croix County, which is in western Wisconsin.\
      \ The latitude of River Falls is approximately 44.85\xB0 N. So 44.85 is definitely\
      \ north of 42.1. Therefore, the University of Wisconsin\u2013River Falls is\
      \ north of Lake Michigan College in Benton Harbor, MI. So the answer is YES.\n\

      \ of both universities. \n\nMinot State is in North Dakota, right? I remember\
      \ Minot is a city in ND. I think North Dakota is in the upper Midwest, near\
      \ the northern border with Canada. So the latitude there should be pretty far\
      \ north. On the other hand, SUNY Cortland is in New York State. Cortland is\
      \ a town in upstate New York. But where exactly? Upstate New York is generally\
      \ north of New York City, but how far north compared to North Dakota?\n\nWait,\
      \ let me recall some approximate latitudes. North Dakota is one of the northernmost\
      \ states, bordering Canada. Its capital is Bismarck, and cities like Fargo are\
      \ there. Minot is actually in the northern part of North Dakota. Whereas New\
      \ York State, even upstate, is further east. For example, Syracuse is in upstate\
      \ NY, and that's around 43\xB0N latitude. Cortland is near Syracuse, maybe similar\
      \ latitude. \n\nNow, checking the latitude of Minot, ND. If I remember correctly,\
      \ Minot's latitude is about 48.2\xB0N. Let me confirm that. Yes, Minot, ND is\
      \ around 48.2323\xB0 N. SUNY Cortland is in Cortland, NY, which has a latitude\
      \ of approximately 42.6\xB0N (I think Cortland's exact coordinates are 42.6012\xB0\
      \ N, 76.1801\xB0 W). \n\nComparing the two, 48.2\xB0N vs. 42.6\xB0N, Minot is\
      \ definitely further north. Since latitude increases as you go north, any location\
      \ with a higher latitude number is further north. So 48\xB0N is about 5.6 degrees\
      \ north of 42.6\xB0N. Each degree is roughly 69 miles, so that's a significant\
      \ difference. Therefore, Minot State University in ND is indeed north of SUNY\

      \ latitude is approximately 43.0\xB0N. Cortland is a bit south of Syracuse,\

      \ latitude increases as you go north, Minot is indeed north of Cortland. \n\n\
      Therefore, the answer should be YES. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the\

      \ \n\nFirst, I should probably start by recalling or finding out the approximate\
      \ latitudes of both universities. Latitude is the north-south position on the\
      \ Earth, right? The higher the latitude, the farther north a place is. So, if\
      \ Minot State's latitude is higher than SUNY Cortland's, then the answer is\
      \ yes.\n\nLet me start with SUNY Cortland. Cortland is a city in New York. I\
      \ know that New York State is in the northeastern part of the US. Cities like\
      \ New York City are around 40 degrees north latitude. But Cortland is upstate.\
      \ Let me think, Syracuse, NY is around 43 degrees north. Cortland is near Syracuse,\
      \ maybe a bit south? Wait, maybe I should look it up. But I can't actually search,\
      \ so I'll have to estimate. Let's say SUNY Cortland is around 42-43 degrees\
      \ north latitude.\n\nNow Minot State University in North Dakota. North Dakota\
      \ is one of the northernmost states, bordering Canada. Minot is a city there.\
      \ I remember that Fargo, ND is around 46.8 degrees north. Minot is further north\
      \ than Fargo. So maybe Minot is around 48 degrees north latitude? If that's\
      \ the case, then 48 is definitely north of 42-43. So Minot State would be north\
      \ of SUNY Cortland.\n\nWait, but I should check if my estimates are correct.\
      \ Let me think. The northern border of the contiguous US is at 49 degrees north,\
      \ so North Dakota's northern border is around 49. Minot isn't at the very top,\
      \ but maybe around 48.3 or so? Whereas Cortland, NY. Let me think about other\
      \ cities. Albany, NY is around 42.6 degrees. Cortland is west of Albany, but\
      \ I'm not sure if it's further north. Maybe it's similar. If Albany is 42.6,\
      \ Cortland might be slightly lower, maybe 42.5? Or maybe higher. Wait, if Syracuse\
      \ is 43.0, and Cortland is south of Syracuse, then maybe 42.6. Hmm. Either way,\
      \ if Minot is around 48, that's significantly north of 42-43.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ even if there's some variation in the exact latitude, Minot State University\

      \ to be a simple YES or NO, but I have to reason through it step by step first.\n\
      \nOkay, first, I need to figure out the locations of both universities. Let's\
      \ start with New Mexico State University Carlsbad. Carlsbad is a city in New\
      \ Mexico. I know that New Mexico is a state in the southwestern United States,\
      \ and Carlsbad is probably in the southern part of the state because there's\
      \ the famous Carlsbad Caverns National Park there. But I should confirm the\
      \ exact location.\n\nThen, Texas A&M University\u2013Kingsville is in Kingsville,\
      \ Texas. Texas is south of New Mexico, right? So Kingsville is in Texas. But\
      \ where exactly? Kingsville is a city in southern Texas, maybe near the Gulf\
      \ Coast? I think it's in the southern part of Texas, perhaps closer to Corpus\
      \ Christi. Let me recall: Corpus Christi is a coastal city in Texas, and Kingsville\
      \ is a bit southwest of there. So Kingsville is in the southern part of Texas,\
      \ near the Gulf.\n\nNow, to determine if Carlsbad, NM is north of Kingsville,\
      \ TX, I need to compare their latitudes. Latitude measures how far north or\
      \ south a place is. The higher the latitude, the further north. So I need to\
      \ find the latitude coordinates of both cities.\n\nLet me look up the latitude\
      \ of Carlsbad, NM. From what I remember, Carlsbad, NM is at approximately 32.4207\xB0\
      \ N. Wait, but that's actually a latitude that's similar to parts of Texas.\
      \ For example, Dallas is around 32.7767\xB0 N. But Kingsville, TX: let me check.\
      \ Kingsville's latitude is about 27.5158\xB0 N. Wait, that's a big difference.\
      \ 27.5\xB0 N is much further south than 32.4\xB0 N. So if Carlsbad is at 32.4\xB0\
      \ N and Kingsville is at 27.5\xB0 N, then Carlsbad is indeed north of Kingsville.\n\
      \nWait, but wait a second. Let me confirm these coordinates because sometimes\
      \ cities can be in different parts. For example, maybe I mixed up Carlsbad,\
      \ NM with another Carlsbad. But no, the question specifies New Mexico State\
      \ University Carlsbad, so that's in Carlsbad, New Mexico. Let me double-check\
      \ the latitude of Carlsbad, NM. A quick check (even though I can't access the\
      \ internet, but from memory) Carlsbad, NM is indeed in the southeastern part\
      \ of New Mexico, near the Texas border. Its latitude is around 32.4\xB0 N. Kingsville,\
      \ TX is in South Texas, near the Rio Grande Valley. Its latitude is around 27.5\xB0\
      \ N. Since 32.4 is higher than 27.5, Carlsbad is north of Kingsville.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ the answer should be YES. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the directions.\
      \ Sometimes, people might think that because New Mexico is west of Texas, but\
      \ latitude is strictly north-south. So even if a place is further west, if its\
      \ latitude is higher, it's more north. So even if Carlsbad is in the southeast\
      \ of New Mexico, which is west of Texas, but its latitude is higher than Kingsville's,\
      \ which is in southern Texas. So yes, Carlsbad is north of Kingsville.\n</think>To\

      \ Carlsbad. Carlsbad is a city in southeastern New Mexico, right? I know Carlsbad\
      \ Caverns are there, which is a big national park. So the university in Carlsbad,\
      \ NM would be in that area. Now, Texas A&M University\u2013Kingsville is in\
      \ Kingsville, Texas. Kingsville is in southern Texas, near Corpus Christi. So\
      \ I need to see if Carlsbad, NM is north of Kingsville, TX.\n\nLooking at a\
      \ map, New Mexico is west of Texas, but Carlsbad is in the southeastern part\
      \ of New Mexico, close to the Texas border. Kingsville is in southern Texas,\
      \ closer to the Gulf of Mexico. Let me think about their approximate latitudes.\
      \ Latitude lines run east-west, so the higher the latitude, the farther north\
      \ a place is.\n\nCarlsbad, NM: Let me recall. The approximate latitude for Carlsbad,\
      \ NM is around 32.4 degrees north. Wait, but wait\u2014if I'm not sure, maybe\
      \ I should check approximate coordinates. Let me think. For example, El Paso,\
      \ TX is around 31.8\xB0N. Carlsbad is further east in New Mexico but still in\
      \ the southern part. Maybe around 32.4\xB0N. \n\nKingsville, TX: Kingsville\
      \ is in South Texas. Corpus Christi is at about 27.8\xB0N, but Kingsville is\
      \ a bit inland. Maybe around 27.5\xB0N? Wait, that seems too low. Wait, no,\
      \ Corpus Christi is at around 27.7\xB0N, so Kingsville, being inland but still\
      \ in that area, might be around 27.5\xB0N. Wait, but actually, I might be mixing\
      \ up. Let me think again. The southern tip of Texas is around 25\xB0N, but Kingsville\
      \ is more towards the central southern part. Maybe around 27.5\xB0N. \n\nWait,\
      \ but if Carlsbad, NM is at 32.4\xB0N and Kingsville is at 27.5\xB0N, then Carlsbad\
      \ would be north. But I need to confirm these latitudes. Maybe I'm making a\
      \ mistake here. Let me try to get more accurate estimates.\n\nAlternatively,\
      \ I can think of major cities near these places. For example, Carlsbad, NM is\
      \ near the Texas-New Mexico border. Let's think of nearby cities. For example,\
      \ Midland, Texas is at 31.9\xB0N. Carlsbad is a bit north of there, perhaps?\
      \ Wait, Midland is in western Texas. So if Carlsbad is in southeastern New Mexico,\
      \ it might be a bit north of Midland. So maybe Carlsbad is around 32.4\xB0N.\
      \ \n\nKingsville, TX: Let's consider. Corpus Christi is at 27.8\xB0N, and Kingsville\
      \ is about 40 miles southwest of Corpus Christi. So that would put Kingsville\
      \ around 27.5\xB0N. So yes, 27.5\xB0N. \n\nSo comparing 32.4\xB0N vs. 27.5\xB0\
      N, Carlsbad is definitely north of Kingsville. Therefore, the answer would be\
      \ YES.\n</think>YES  \nNew Mexico State University Carlsbad, NM (latitude \u2248\
      32.4\xB0N) is located north of Texas A&M University\u2013Kingsville, TX (latitude\
      \ \u224827.5\xB0N). The higher latitude of Carlsbad places it farther north\
      \ than Kingsville."

      \ it's in Greenville, SC. Greenville is in the upstate region of South Carolina,\
      \ which is the northern part of the state. Then Georgia Southern's Armstrong\
      \ Campus is in Georgia. I believe the Armstrong Campus is in Savannah, Georgia.\
      \ Savannah is a coastal city in the southeastern part of Georgia, near the border\
      \ with South Carolina.\n\nNow, to determine which is further north, I need to\
      \ compare the latitudes of Greenville, SC, and Savannah, GA. Latitude measures\
      \ how far north a place is. The higher the latitude, the further north it is.\
      \ Let me try to remember or estimate their latitudes. \n\nI know that Atlanta,\
      \ Georgia is around 33.7\xB0 N. Savannah is south of Atlanta, so its latitude\
      \ should be lower. Maybe around 32.1\xB0 N? And Greenville, SC. Since it's in\
      \ the upstate, maybe it's around 34.8\xB0 N? For example, Greenville's coordinates\
      \ might be approximately 34.85\xB0 N, 82.39\xB0 W. Savannah's coordinates are\
      \ approximately 32.08\xB0 N, 81.09\xB0 W. \n\nComparing those, 34.85\xB0 N (Greenville)\
      \ is definitely higher than 32.08\xB0 N (Savannah). That would mean Furman University\
      \ is north of Georgia Southern's Armstrong Campus. \n\nWait, but I should double-check\
      \ the exact locations. Maybe I'm mixing up campuses. Let me confirm: Georgia\
      \ Southern University has multiple campuses. The Armstrong Campus was previously\
      \ Armstrong State University, which merged with Georgia Southern in 2018. The\
      \ Armstrong Campus is indeed in Savannah. So that's correct. Furman University\
      \ is in Greenville, SC. \n\nSo yes, Greenville, SC (Furman) is north of Savannah,\
      \ GA (Georgia Southern-Armstrong). Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES\
      \  \nFurman University in Greenville, SC (latitude ~34.85\xB0 N) is located\
      \ north of Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus in Savannah, GA (latitude\
      \ ~32.08\xB0 N). The higher latitude of Greenville confirms this.  \n\n**Answer:**\

      \ I think Sul Ross State is in Alpine, Texas. Alpine is in West Texas, near\
      \ Big Bend National Park, right? So Alpine is a town in the western part of\
      \ Texas, close to the border with Mexico. \n\nNext, I need to compare the latitudes\

      \ Arizona is to the west of Texas, but in terms of north-south positioning,\
      \ Arizona might be more southern. Wait, no. Let me think. The southern border\
      \ of Arizona is along the Mexican border, same as Texas. But Texas extends further\
      \ east. But in terms of latitude, cities in southern Arizona, like Tucson, are\
      \ around 32 degrees north. Phoenix is about 33.5 degrees north. \n\nNow, Alpine,\
      \ Texas. Let me think. Texas cities like El Paso are at around 31.8 degrees\

      \ at a slightly higher latitude than El Paso? Let me check (mentally). Since\
      \ Alpine is north of Big Bend, which is around the same latitude as the Rio\
      \ Grande. Wait, Big Bend is south of Alpine. So Alpine's latitude might be around\
      \ 30 degrees? Or maybe a bit higher? I'm getting a bit confused here. \n\nAlternatively,\
      \ I can think about major cities. El Paso, TX is at about 31.8\xB0N. Phoenix,\
      \ AZ is around 33.4\xB0N. So Phoenix is north of El Paso. If Alpine is in West\
      \ Texas, perhaps around the same latitude as El Paso or slightly north. Let\
      \ me try to recall. Alpine is in Brewster County. Brewster County's coordinates...\
      \ I think Alpine's latitude is approximately 30.36\xB0N. Wait, that can't be\
      \ right because 30\xB0N would be further south. Wait, Houston is around 29.7\xB0\
      N, so Alpine, being in West Texas, might be a bit north of that. Wait, no, actually,\
      \ the latitude might be around 30\xB0N. Let me confirm. If Phoenix is at 33.4\xB0\
      N and Alpine, TX is at, say, 30.5\xB0N, then Phoenix is definitely north. But\
      \ if Alpine is at a higher latitude than Phoenix, then the answer would be no.\
      \ \n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit mixed up. Maybe I should think about the states'\
      \ positions. Arizona is north of the Mexico border, same as Texas. But Texas\
      \ is a large state, stretching further north. The northernmost part of Texas\
      \ is at around 36\xB0N, while Arizona's northern border is at 37\xB0N. But cities\
      \ in Arizona like Flagstaff are at higher latitudes (around 35\xB0N). However,\
      \ the major cities in Arizona (Phoenix, Tucson) are in the southern part. Similarly,\
      \ in Texas, the major cities are spread out. But Sul Ross State is in Alpine,\
      \ which is in West Texas. So maybe Alpine is at a latitude lower than Phoenix.\
      \ \n\nIf Phoenix is at 33.4\xB0N and Alpine is at, say, 30.3\xB0N, then Phoenix\
      \ is north. If Alpine is higher than 33.4, then no. But I think Alpine is actually\
      \ around 30\xB0N. Let me check my knowledge. For example, El Paso is at 31.8\xB0\
      N. Alpine is east of El Paso, so moving east in Texas, but latitude-wise, maybe\
      \ similar. Wait, moving east along the same latitude would keep it around 31\xB0\
      , but Alpine is actually further north. Wait, no. Let me think of Texas geography.\
      \ The Trans-Pecos region in West Texas includes the Davis Mountains. Alpine\
      \ is in that area. Let me recall that the latitude of Alpine, TX is approximately\
      \ 30.36\xB0N. Wait, that seems too far south. Wait, that can't be right. Wait,\
      \ 30\xB0N is the latitude that passes through the southern tip of Texas, like\
      \ the Rio Grande Valley. But Alpine is in West Texas, which is more northern.\
      \ Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me think differently. \n\nIf I compare the\
      \ latitudes of Phoenix, AZ and Alpine, TX. Phoenix is at about 33.45\xB0N. Alpine,\
      \ TX is at approximately 30.36\xB0N. So Phoenix is north of Alpine. Therefore,\
      \ the University of Advancing Technology in AZ (assuming it's in Phoenix) would\
      \ be north of Sul Ross State in TX. \n\nWait, but I need to confirm where exactly\
      \ UAT is located. Let me recall. The University of Advancing Technology's address\
      \ is 2625 W. Baseline Rd, Tempe, AZ 85283. Tempe is a city in the Phoenix metropolitan\
      \ area. So Tempe, AZ is at the same latitude as Phoenix, around 33.4\xB0N. \n\
      \nTherefore, comparing Tempe, AZ at ~33.4\xB0N and Alpine, TX at ~30.36\xB0\
      N, Tempe is indeed north of Alpine. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>The\
      \ University of Advancing Technology (UAT) is located in Tempe, Arizona (latitude\
      \ ~33.4\xB0N). Sul Ross State University is in Alpine, Texas (latitude ~30.36\xB0\
      N). Since 33.4\xB0N is north of 30.36\xB0N, **YES**, UAT in Arizona is located\
      \ north of Sul Ross State University in Texas. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    44ce567a-9540-4596-b0f6-8dda416c7857: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the University of Advancing Technology in Arizona is located north of Sul\
      \ Ross State University in Texas. Let me start by breaking this down step by\
      \ step.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out where each of these universities\
      \ is located. The University of Advancing Technology (UAT) is in Arizona, and\
      \ Sul Ross State University is in Texas. I know that Arizona is west of Texas,\
      \ but north/south positioning can vary depending on the specific cities. \n\n\
      Let me start with UAT. A quick check tells me that the University of Advancing\
      \ Technology is located in Tempe, Arizona. Wait, no, actually, I think UAT is\
      \ in Phoenix. Let me confirm that. Yes, the University of Advancing Technology\
      \ is in Tempe, Arizona. Wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Let me double-check.\
      \ Oh, actually, their official website says they're located in Tempe, AZ. Tempe\
      \ is part of the Phoenix metropolitan area. So Tempe, AZ is the city.\n\nNow,\
      \ Sul Ross State University. That's in Texas. Where exactly? Let me recall.\
      \ Sul Ross State is in Alpine, Texas. I think Alpine is in West Texas, near\
      \ the Big Bend region. Let me confirm that. Yes, Sul Ross State University is\
      \ located in Alpine, Brewster County, Texas. Alpine is a town in the western\
      \ part of Texas, near the border with Mexico. \n\nNext, I need to compare the\
      \ latitudes of these two cities to see which is further north. Latitude determines\
      \ how far north a location is. So if Tempe, AZ has a higher latitude than Alpine,\
      \ TX, then the answer is YES; otherwise, NO.\n\nLet me find the latitude coordinates\
      \ for both cities. For Tempe, Arizona: The latitude is approximately 33.4255\xB0\
      \ N. For Alpine, Texas: The latitude is approximately 30.3586\xB0 N. \n\nComparing\
      \ these numbers: 33.4255\xB0 N (Tempe) versus 30.3586\xB0 N (Alpine). Since\
      \ 33.4255 is higher than 30.3586, Tempe is indeed north of Alpine. Therefore,\
      \ the University of Advancing Technology in Tempe, AZ is located north of Sul\
      \ Ross State University in Alpine, TX.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't\
      \ mix up the cities. Sometimes people confuse Tempe with Tucson, which is further\
      \ south in Arizona. But Tempe is near Phoenix, which is in central Arizona.\
      \ Alpine is in West Texas. Another way to check: Phoenix is around 33\xB0 N,\
      \ and Alpine, TX is around 30\xB0 N. So Phoenix (and thus Tempe) is definitely\
      \ north of Alpine. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \nThe\
      \ University of Advancing Technology is in Tempe, AZ (latitude ~33.43\xB0N),\
      \ while Sul Ross State University is in Alpine, TX (latitude ~30.36\xB0N). Since\
      \ 33.43\xB0N is farther north than 30.36\xB0N, the answer is YES."

      But wait, maybe I should double-check the exact coordinates. Let me think. Tempe,\
      \ AZ: According to Google Maps, Tempe's coordinates are approximately 33.4255\xB0\

    99cc5e76-7d32-4aca-8d13-3caec3ef38a2: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\

      \ Let me start with the University of Advancing Technology (UAT). I remember\

      \ I think UAT is in Tempe. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The University\
      \ of Advancing Technology's website says their address is 2625 W. Baseline Rd,\
      \ Tempe, AZ. So that's in Tempe, Arizona.\n\nNow, Sul Ross State University.\
      \ That's in Texas. Where in Texas? The main campus is in Alpine, Texas. There\
      \ are also campuses in Uvalde, Del Rio, and Eagle Pass, but the main one is\
      \ Alpine. So Alpine, Texas. \n\nOkay, so next step is to determine the latitude\
      \ of Tempe, AZ and Alpine, TX. Because latitude determines north-south position.\
      \ The higher the latitude, the further north a location is.\n\nI remember that\
      \ Phoenix, AZ (Tempe is a suburb) is around 33 degrees north latitude. Alpine,\
      \ Texas is in West Texas. Let me think, Texas's latitude ranges from about 25\
      \ degrees at the southern tip to around 36 degrees at the northern border. Alpine\
      \ is in the Big Bend region, near the border with Mexico. I believe Alpine's\
      \ latitude is around 30 degrees north. Wait, no. Let me think: Austin is about\
      \ 30.25\xB0N. San Antonio is around 29.4\xB0N. Alpine is further west but also\
      \ in the southern part of Texas. Wait, maybe Alpine is around 30.3\xB0N? Or\
      \ is that incorrect? Maybe I should recall specific coordinates.\n\nAlternatively,\
      \ I can think of major cities. El Paso, Texas is at 31.8\xB0N. Alpine is east\
      \ of El Paso but more south. Wait, no. Alpine is actually southeast of El Paso.\
      \ Let me check mentally: Big Bend National Park is in that area, and Alpine\
      \ is a town near there. Let me approximate. If El Paso is around 31.8\xB0N,\
      \ then Alpine, being to the southeast, might be slightly lower in latitude.\
      \ Let's say around 30.3\xB0N. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's higher.\
      \ Wait, maybe I should recall that the latitude of Alpine, TX is approximately\
      \ 30.36\xB0N. And Tempe, AZ is at about 33.42\xB0N. Wait, yes, Phoenix's latitude\
      \ is around 33.45\xB0N, and Tempe is part of the Phoenix metro area, so same\
      \ latitude. \n\nSo if Tempe is at approximately 33.4\xB0N and Alpine is at 30.36\xB0\
      N, then Tempe (UAT) is north of Alpine (Sul Ross). Therefore, the answer would\
      \ be YES.\n\nWait, but let me confirm these latitudes. Let me recall: The approximate\
      \ latitude for Alpine, TX. Let me think of another way. The Texas state's southernmost\
      \ point is at about 25.84\xB0N (Brownsville), and the northern border is at\
      \ 36.5\xB0N. So Alpine is in West Texas, but how far north? Let me think, Midland,\
      \ TX is around 31.99\xB0N. El Paso is 31.8\xB0N. So Alpine, which is south of\
      \ Midland and east of El Paso, maybe around 30.3\xB0N. So 30.3\xB0N for Alpine,\
      \ 33.4\xB0N for Tempe. That would mean Tempe is north of Alpine. So YES, University\
      \ of Advancing Technology in AZ is north of Sul Ross State University in TX.\n\

    b50c7efd-097c-4fe7-b09b-99aed2a6e4da: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, I need to figure out if the University of Advancing Technology in Arizona\
      \ is located north of Sul Ross State University in Texas. Hmm, first, I should\
      \ probably figure out where each of these universities is located. \n\nStarting\
      \ with the University of Advancing Technology (UAT) in Arizona. I know Arizona\
      \ is a state in the southwestern US. The main city in Arizona I can think of\
      \ is Phoenix. Maybe UAT is there? Let me check... Wait, I recall that UAT is\
      \ in Tempe, Arizona. But I'm not 100% sure. Tempe is part of the Phoenix metropolitan\
      \ area, so that makes sense. Let me confirm: yes, the University of Advancing\
      \ Technology is indeed in Tempe, AZ. \n\nNow, Sul Ross State University is in\
      \ Texas. Texas is a big state, and I'm not exactly sure where Sul Ross is located.\
      \ Let me think. Sul Ross might be in a more western part of Texas. Maybe near\
      \ the Big Bend area? Because I remember that Sul Ross is in Alpine, Texas. Alpine\
      \ is a town in West Texas. Correct\u2014Sul Ross State University is in Alpine,\
      \ TX.\n\nNext step is to compare the latitudes of Tempe, AZ, and Alpine, TX.\
      \ Latitude determines how far north or south a place is. The higher the latitude,\
      \ the farther north. \n\nLet me get the approximate latitudes. For Tempe, Arizona:\
      \ I think Phoenix is around 33\xB0N. Tempe is part of that area, so probably\
      \ similar. Let's say approximately 33.4\xB0N. \n\nFor Alpine, Texas: West Texas\
      \ is generally in a higher latitude compared to southern Texas. For example,\
      \ El Paso is around 31.8\xB0N, but Alpine is a bit north of there. Checking\
      \ my memory, Alpine's latitude is approximately 30.36\xB0N. Wait, that can't\
      \ be right. Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think again. If El Paso is\
      \ 31.8\xB0N, and Alpine is further east but maybe not too much north. Wait,\
      \ maybe I should look it up. Wait, but since I can't search, I need to rely\
      \ on my existing knowledge. Alternatively, considering that Alpine is in the\
      \ Big Bend region, which is in the southwestern part of Texas, but perhaps at\
      \ a latitude similar to, say, around 30\xB0N. Wait, maybe higher. Let me think:\
      \ Austin is around 30.25\xB0N, but that's central Texas. El Paso is at 31.8\xB0\
      N. So Alpine, being west of Austin but maybe not as far south as the Rio Grande.\
      \ Maybe Alpine is around 30.3\xB0N? Hmm, but I'm not confident. Alternatively,\
      \ maybe I should think of major cities. For example, Dallas is around 32.8\xB0\
      N. But Alpine is in West Texas, more south. Let me approximate. If Tempe is\
      \ at 33.4\xB0N and Alpine is, say, around 30.3\xB0N, then Tempe would be north\
      \ of Alpine. \n\nWait, but wait: 33.4\xB0N vs. 30.3\xB0N\u2014so yes, 33.4 is\
      \ higher, meaning Tempe is north of Alpine. Therefore, the University of Advancing\
      \ Technology in AZ (Tempe) would be north of Sul Ross State University in TX\
      \ (Alpine). \n\nBut wait, maybe I messed up the latitudes. Let me double-check.\
      \ Suppose I'm wrong about Sul Ross's location. If Sul Ross is in a more northern\
      \ part of Texas, then maybe it's higher. But no, I'm pretty sure Alpine is in\
      \ West Texas, near the Big Bend National Park, which is close to the Mexico\
      \ border. So that area is more southern. So Alpine's latitude should be lower\
      \ (more south) than Tempe's. \n\nSo, the answer would be YES. Because Tempe,\

    d618bec6-0008-4fe8-95a3-27e298fbdba4: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The user wants to know if the University of Advancing Technology\
      \ (UAT) in Arizona is located north of Sul Ross State University in Texas. \n\
      \nFirst, I need to figure out where each university is located. Let me start\
      \ with the University of Advancing Technology. I remember that UAT is in Arizona,\
      \ specifically in the city of Tempe. Wait, no, maybe it's in Phoenix? Let me\
      \ confirm. A quick check tells me that UAT is actually located in Tempe, Arizona.\
      \ Tempe is part of the Phoenix metropolitan area, so that's correct.\n\nNext,\
      \ Sul Ross State University. That's in Texas, right? There are a couple of campuses.\
      \ The main campus is in Alpine, Texas. There's also a branch in Uvalde, but\
      \ the main one is Alpine. So Alpine, TX is the location to consider here.\n\n\
      Now, I need to compare the geographical positions of Tempe, AZ, and Alpine,\
      \ TX. To determine if one is north of the other, I should look at their latitudes.\
      \ Latitude measures how far north or south a place is. The higher the latitude,\
      \ the farther north.\n\nLet me find the latitude for Tempe, Arizona. Tempe's\
      \ latitude is approximately 33.4255\xB0 N. For Alpine, Texas, the latitude is\
      \ around 30.3586\xB0 N. \n\nComparing these two, 33.4255\xB0 N (Tempe) is higher\
      \ than 30.3586\xB0 N (Alpine). Since higher latitude means more north, Tempe,\
      \ AZ is indeed north of Alpine, TX. Therefore, the University of Advancing Technology\
      \ in Arizona is located north of Sul Ross State University in Texas.\n\nWait,\
      \ just to make sure I didn't mix up the cities. Maybe I should double-check\
      \ the coordinates. Tempe, AZ: 33.4255\xB0 N. Alpine, TX: 30.3586\xB0 N. Yes,\
      \ 33 is higher than 30, so Tempe is Therefore Therefore, the answer should be\
      \ YES.\n</think>The University of Advancing Technology (UAT) is in Tempe, AZ\

      \ than 30.3586\xB0 N, **YES**, UAT, AZ is located north of Sul Ross State University,\
      \ TX."

      \ (UAT) in Arizona. I think Arizona is a state in the southwestern US. The main\
      \ city there is Phoenix, maybe that's where UAT is? I remember hearing that\
      \ UAT is in Tempe, Arizona. Wait, Tempe is part of the Phoenix metropolitan\
      \ area. So, the coordinates for Tempe, AZ would be around 33.4255\xB0 N latitude.\n\
      \nNow, Sul Ross State University is in Texas. Texas is a big state, but where\
      \ exactly? The university is in Alpine, Texas, I believe. Let me confirm that.\
      \ Yes, Sul Ross State University's main campus is in Alpine, TX. So I need the\

      \ The latitude for Alpine is approximately 30.3586\xB0 N.\n\nComparing the two\
      \ latitudes: Tempe, AZ is at about 33.4\xB0 N, and Alpine, TX is around 30.36\xB0\
      \ N. Since latitude increases as you go north, a higher latitude means a location\
      \ is further north. So 33.4\xB0 is definitely north of 30.36\xB0. Therefore,\
      \ the University of Advancing Technology in Arizona is located north of Sul\

      \ whether Bryant University in Rhode Island is located north of Central Methodist\
      \ University in Missouri. Hmm, I need to figure out the latitudes of both universities\
      \ to compare their positions. \n\nFirst, I should recall where each university\
      \ is. Bryant University is in Rhode Island, which is in the northeastern US.\
      \ Central Methodist University is in Missouri, which is in the Midwest. Generally,\
      \ the northeastern states are further north than the Midwest, but I'm not sure\
      \ exactly where each university is within their respective states.\n\nLet me\
      \ start with Bryant University. I think it's in Smithfield, RI. Let me confirm\
      \ that. Yes, a quick check in my mind (since I can't look it up right now) tells\
      \ me Bryant University is indeed in Smithfield, Rhode Island. Now, where is\
      \ Smithfield located in RI? Rhode Island is a small state, so Smithfield is\
      \ probably in the northern part, but maybe not the very northernmost point.\
      \ The approximate latitude of Rhode Island's northern areas might be around\
      \ 41.8\xB0N to 42\xB0N. For example, Providence, the capital, is around 41.82\xB0\
      N. Smithfield is a bit north of Providence, so maybe around 41.92\xB0N or so.\n\
      \nNext, Central Methodist University. That's in Missouri. The city is Fayette,\
      \ Missouri. Where is Fayette located in the state? Missouri is a larger state,\
      \ stretching from about 36\xB0N in the southern part (like the Bootheel) up\
      \ to around 40.6\xB0N at the Iowa border. Fayette is in central Missouri, I\
      \ believe. Let me think. Columbia, MO is around 38.95\xB0N, and Fayette is a\
      \ bit north of there? Or maybe not. Wait, Fayette is in Howard County, which\
      \ is in the central part. Let me estimate the latitude. Maybe around 39.15\xB0\
      N? \n\nIf Bryant is at 41.9\xB0N and Central Methodist is at 39.15\xB0N, then\
      \ Bryant would be north of Central Methodist. But I need to be more precise.\
      \ Let me think of other cities. St. Louis, MO is around 38.63\xB0N. Kansas City\
      \ is around 39.10\xB0N. So Fayette, being in central Missouri, perhaps a bit\
      \ north of Columbia (which is 38.95\xB0N), maybe around 39.15\xB0N. \n\nSo comparing\
      \ 41.9\xB0N (Bryant) vs. 39.15\xB0N (Central Methodist). That would mean Bryant\
      \ is indeed north. Therefore, the answer should be YES. But wait, maybe I'm\
      \ miscalculating the exact coordinates. Let me try to recall specific coordinates.\
      \ \n\nAlternatively, I can think of the general regions. Rhode Island is in\
      \ New England, which is definitely north of Missouri. Even the southernmost\
      \ part of Rhode Island would be north of the northernmost part of Missouri.\
      \ Wait, is that true? Let's see. The northernmost point of Missouri is around\
      \ 40.6\xB0N (near Iowa), and the southernmost part of Rhode Island is around\
      \ 41.3\xB0N (since the state is from about 41.3\xB0N to 42.0\xB0N). So even\
      \ the southern tip of RI is north of the northern tip of MO. Therefore, any\
      \ location in RI is north of any location in MO. \n\nWait, that can't be right.\
      \ Wait, Missouri's northern border is at 40\xB036'N (40.6\xB0N), and Rhode Island's\
      \ southern border is at about 41\xB018'N (41.3\xB0N). So yes, the southernmost\
      \ part of RI is still north of the northernmost part of MO. Therefore, any point\
      \ in RI is north of any point in MO. Therefore, Bryant University in RI is definitely\
      \ north of Central Methodist University in MO. So the answer is YES.\n</think>To\
      \ determine if Bryant University, RI is north of Central Methodist University,\
      \ MO, we compare their latitudes. \n\n1. **Bryant University** is in Smithfield,\
      \ RI. Rhode Island's latitude ranges from approximately 41.3\xB0N (southernmost)\
      \ to 42.0\xB0N (northernmost). Smithfield is in northern RI, around **41.92\xB0\
      N**.  \n2. **Central Methodist University** is in Fayette, MO. Missouri's northern\
      \ border is at ~40.6\xB0N, and Fayette, in central MO, lies near **39.15\xB0\
      N**.  \n\nSince even the southernmost point of Rhode Island (41.3\xB0N) is north\
      \ of Missouri's northernmost point (40.6\xB0N), **all of Rhode Island is north\
      \ of Missouri**. Thus, Bryant University is north of Central Methodist University.\

      \ exactly? Let me remember. Bryant University's location\u2014maybe Smithfield,\
      \ RI? Yes, I think that's right. So Smithfield, RI's latitude.\n\nThen Central\
      \ Methodist University in Missouri. Missouri is in the Midwest. The university\
      \ is in Fayette, Missouri, if I'm not mistaken. So I need the latitude of Fayette,\
      \ MO.\n\nLatitude is measured in degrees north. The higher the latitude, the\
      \ farther north. So if Bryant's latitude is higher than Central Methodist's,\
      \ then yes, it's north.\n\nNow, I need approximate latitudes. Let me think.\
      \ Rhode Island's general latitude. Since it's in New England, cities like Providence\
      \ are around 41.8\xB0N. Smithfield is near Providence, so maybe similar. Let's\
      \ say around 41.9\xB0N.\n\nMissouri is further south. Fayette, MO\u2014where\
      \ is that? Central Missouri. The latitude of Missouri cities... St. Louis is\
      \ around 38.6\xB0N, but that's in the east. Columbia, MO is around 38.95\xB0\
      N. Fayette might be a bit north of Columbia? Wait, Fayette is in Howard County,\
      \ which is north-central MO. Let me check approximate latitude. Maybe around\
      \ 39.15\xB0N? Or maybe 39.2\xB0N. Not sure exactly, but roughly around there.\n\
      \nSo comparing 41.9\xB0N (Bryant) vs. ~39.2\xB0N (Central Methodist). 41.9 is\

      \ A quick search tells me Bryant University is located in Smithfield, Rhode\

      \ Bryant University is in Rhode Island, and Central Methodist University is\
      \ in Missouri. But where exactly are these states in the US? I remember that\
      \ Rhode Island is a small state in the New England area, which is in the northeastern\
      \ part of the US. Missouri, on the other hand, is in the Midwest. So, generally,\
      \ I think the Northeast is more north than the Midwest, but I need to check\
      \ specific latitudes.\n\nLet me recall the approximate latitudes. States like\

    fdc77cc4-e3f0-4c70-9207-9b38f47933a0: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out whether\
      \ Bryant University in Rhode Island is located north of Central Methodist University\
      \ in Missouri. Hmm, let's start by recalling where each of these universities\
      \ is located. \n\nFirst, Bryant University is in Rhode Island. I know Rhode\
      \ Island is a state in the northeastern part of the US, so probably somewhere\
      \ near the Atlantic coast. I'm not exactly sure of the city, but maybe Smithfield?\
      \ I think I remember that Bryant is in Smithfield, RI. \n\nThen there's Central\
      \ Methodist University in Missouri. Missouri is a Midwestern state, so more\
      \ towards the center of the country. Central Methodist might be in a town like\
      \ Fayette? I think that's correct. So I need to compare the latitudes of Smithfield,\
      \ RI and Fayette, MO.\n\nLatitude is the key here because north-south position\
      \ is determined by that. Higher latitude means further north. Let me try to\
      \ recall or estimate the approximate latitudes. \n\nRhode Island, being in New\
      \ England, is generally at a higher latitude than Missouri. For example, Boston,\
      \ MA is around 42.36\xB0 N, and Rhode Island is just south of Massachusetts,\
      \ so maybe around 41.8\xB0 N or so. Smithfield, RI specifically: a quick mental\
      \ note\u2014I think it's in the northern part of Rhode Island, maybe around\
      \ 41.9\xB0 N.\n\nMissouri, on the other hand, is further south. Let's think\
      \ of major cities. St. Louis, MO is about 38.63\xB0 N. Fayette, MO is a smaller\
      \ town; perhaps it's in central or northern Missouri? Wait, Central Methodist\
      \ University's location: Fayette, MO. Let me think\u2014Missouri's latitude\
      \ ranges from about 36\xB0 N in the southern tip to around 40.6\xB0 N at the\
      \ Iowa border. If Fayette is in central Missouri, maybe around 39\xB0 N? Wait,\
      \ Columbia, MO is around 38.95\xB0 N. Maybe Fayette is a bit north of there?\
      \ Or perhaps west? Alternatively, maybe I should look up the exact coordinates,\
      \ but since I can't do that right now, I need to estimate.\n\nWait, another\
      \ approach. Let's think about states' general positions. Missouri is south of\
      \ Iowa, which is at a higher latitude. Rhode Island is north of states like\
      \ Connecticut and New York, which are around 41-42\xB0 N. So if Bryant University\
      \ is in Rhode Island at around 41.9\xB0 N, and Central Methodist in Missouri\
      \ is around, say, 39\xB0 N, then yes, Bryant would be north. But wait, could\
      \ Fayette, MO be further north than that? If it's in northern Missouri, maybe\
      \ up near 40\xB0 N. But even then, Rhode Island's latitude would still be higher.\n\
      \nWait, the northernmost point of Missouri is around 40.6\xB0 N, as mentioned\
      \ before. So if Fayette is in the northern part, it might be up to 40.6\xB0\
      \ N. Meanwhile, Smithfield, RI is about 41.9\xB0 N. So 41.9 is higher than 40.6,\
      \ so even if Fayette is at the northern edge of Missouri, Bryant would still\
      \ be north of it. Therefore, the answer is YES. Unless I have the locations\
      \ of the universities wrong. Let me confirm: Is Bryant University indeed in\
      \ Smithfield, RI? Yes, I believe that's correct. And Central Methodist University\
      \ is in Fayette, MO. So Fayette, MO's latitude is approximately 39.15\xB0 N.\
      \ Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the exact coordinates. Let me think again. If Fayette,\
      \ MO is around 39\xB0 N, and Smithfield, RI is 41.9\xB0 N, then yes, 41.9 is\
      \ definitely north of 39. So Bryant is north of Central Methodist.\n\nAlternatively,\
      \ maybe Fayette, MO is more in the central part. Let me check my geographical\
      \ knowledge. Fayette, MO is the county seat of Howard County. Looking at Missouri\
      \ counties, Howard County is in central Missouri, north of the Missouri River.\
      \ Let's see, Columbia, MO is in Boone County, which is south of Howard. So maybe\
      \ Howard County is a bit north. The coordinates for Fayette, MO: I think it's\
      \ approximately 39.14\xB0 N latitude. So that's about 39.14\xB0 N. Smithfield,\
      \ RI is at 41.92\xB0 N. So 41.92 is definitely north of 39.14. Therefore, Bryant\
      \ University in RI is north of Central Methodist University in MO.\n</think>To\
      \ determine if Bryant University, RI is north of Central Methodist University,\
      \ MO:\n\n1. **Locations**:  \n   - Bryant University is in Smithfield, RI. \

      \ MI's latitude is around 47.1 degrees North. Milwaukee, WI is around 43.04\

      \ So, the user wants to know if the Frederick S. Pardee RAND Graduate School\

      \ through it step by step first.\n\nOkay, first, I need to figure out the locations\
      \ of both schools. Let's start with the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.\
      \ That's in Lafayette, Louisiana. I know Louisiana is in the southern part of\
      \ the United States, near the Gulf of Mexico. Lafayette is a city in the southern\
      \ part of the state. I think its coordinates are roughly around 30\xB013' N\

      \ in Santa Monica. Let me check that. Yes, the Pardee RAND Graduate School is\
      \ indeed located in Santa Monica, CA. \n\nSanta Monica's coordinates are approximately\
      \ 34.0195\xB0 N, 118.4912\xB0 W. So, comparing the latitudes: Santa Monica is\
      \ at around 34\xB0 N, and Lafayette is at about 30\xB0 N. Since latitude increases\
      \ as you go north, Santa Monica is further north than Lafayette. Therefore,\

      First, I should probably determine the geographical locations of both institutions.\
      \ The question is about their relative positions, specifically whether one is\

      \ that Georgia Military College has its main campus in Milledgeville, Georgia.\
      \ Let me confirm that. Yes, I think that's correct. So Milledgeville is the\

      \ Let me check that. Yes, Georgia Military College's primary campus is in Milledgeville,\
      \ Georgia.\n\nNext step: Determine the latitude of both cities. Because latitude\

      \nGunnison, CO: Let me recall. Colorado is a northern state compared to Georgia.\
      \ Georgia is in the southeastern US. But where exactly? Gunnison's latitude.\

      \ is south of Denver. Wait, no, Gunnison is in the mountains, maybe a bit south.\
      \ Let me look it up mentally. If I remember correctly, Gunnison, CO has a latitude\
      \ of approximately 38.5449\xB0 N.\n\nMilledgeville, GA: Georgia is further south.\
      \ The latitude of Milledgeville. Atlanta is around 33.7\xB0 N. Milledgeville\

      \ Since 38.5 is higher than 33, Gunnison is indeed north of Milledgeville. Therefore,\
      \ Western Colorado University is north of Georgia Military College.\n\nWait,\

      \nLooking up, Milledgeville, GA's latitude is approximately 33.0801\xB0 N. Gunnison,\

      \ in Gunnison, CO (latitude ~38.5\xB0 N) is located north of Georgia Military\
      \ College in Milledgeville, GA (latitude ~33.08\xB0 N). Since 38.5\xB0 N is\
      \ farther north than 33.08\xB0 N, the answer is YES."
    60497c1e-d8ad-482d-aea2-2bb5570ea329: "<think>Alright, so I need to figure out\
      \ if Western Colorado University in Colorado is located north of Georgia Military\
      \ College in Georgia. Let me start by breaking this down step by step.\n\nFirst,\
      \ I should probably determine the locations of both institutions. Let's start\
      \ with Western Colorado University in Colorado. I know Colorado is a state in\
      \ the western United States, but where exactly is the university situated? If\
      \ I recall correctly, there's a Western Colorado University in Gunnison, Colorado.\
      \ Let me confirm that. Yes, a quick check in my memory tells me that's right.\
      \ Gunnison is in the central part of Colorado, but I need to know its latitude\
      \ to compare.\n\nNext, Georgia Military College is in Georgia, which is in the\
      \ southeastern U.S. The main campus is in Milledgeville, GA. So I need the latitude\
      \ of both Gunnison, CO, and Milledgeville, GA. Latitude is the north-south position,\
      \ so comparing those will answer the question.\n\nLet me recall or estimate\
      \ the latitudes. Milledgeville, GA: Georgia is a southern state, so its latitude\
      \ should be around 33\xB0N. Maybe Milledgeville is approximately 33\xB0N. Now\
      \ Gunnison, CO: Colorado is further north. For example, Denver is around 39.7\xB0\
      N. But Gunnison is more in the mountains, maybe a bit south of Denver? Wait,\
      \ Gunnison is in the southern part of Colorado? Or central? Colorado's southern\
      \ border is at 37\xB0N, I think. Wait, actually, Colorado's latitude ranges\
      \ from 37\xB0N to 41\xB0N. Let me think: the southern border of Colorado is\
      \ at 37\xB0N, and the northern border is at 41\xB0N. So Gunnison, which is in\
      \ the central part, maybe around 38.5\xB0N? Let me check: I believe Gunnison,\
      \ CO is at approximately 38.5458\xB0 N latitude. \n\nMilledgeville, GA is at\
      \ about 33.0801\xB0 N. So comparing 38.5\xB0N vs. 33.08\xB0N. Since latitude\
      \ increases as you go north, 38.5 is north of 33.08. Therefore, Western Colorado\
      \ University in Gunnison, CO is indeed north of Georgia Military College in\
      \ Milledgeville, GA. \n\nWait, but I should make sure I'm not mixing up the\
      \ exact locations. Let me consider another way: Georgia is in the Deep South,\
      \ so cities there are generally at lower latitudes (more south). Colorado is\
      \ in the Mountain West, definitely further north than Georgia. For example,\
      \ Atlanta, GA is around 33.7\xB0N, which is still south of Colorado's southern\
      \ border. So even the southernmost part of Colorado is north of Georgia. Therefore,\
      \ any location in Colorado would be north of any location in Georgia. Is that\
      \ correct? Wait, Georgia's northern border is with Tennessee and North Carolina,\
      \ which are around 35\xB0N. So the northernmost part of Georgia is around 35\xB0\
      N. Colorado's southern border is at 37\xB0N, which is higher than 35\xB0N. Therefore,\
      \ the entire state of Colorado is north of the entire state of Georgia. If that's\
      \ true, then any point in Colorado is north of any point in Georgia. Therefore,\
      \ Western Colorado University in CO is definitely north of Georgia Military\
      \ College in GA.\n\nWait, but wait, is Georgia's northernmost point above 35\xB0\
      N? Let me think: The 35th parallel north passes through the southern United\
      \ States, including parts of North Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, etc. Georgia's\
      \ northern border is along the 35th parallel? Let me check approximate coordinates:\
      \ The northernmost point of Georgia is at approximately 35\xB0N, and Colorado's\
      \ southern border is at 37\xB0N. So Colorado starts at 37\xB0N, which is 2 degrees\
      \ north of Georgia's northern border. Therefore, yes, all of Colorado is north\
      \ of all of Georgia. Therefore, regardless of where in Colorado or Georgia the\
      \ universities are, Western Colorado University in CO is north of Georgia Military\
      \ College in GA. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>To determine if Western\
      \ Colorado University (WCU) in Colorado is north of Georgia Military College\
      \ (GMC) in Georgia:  \n1. **Locations**: WCU is in Gunnison, CO (\u224838.5\xB0\

      \ latitude).  \n2. **Latitude Comparison**: Colorado\u2019s southern border\
      \ (37\xB0N) is north of Georgia\u2019s northern border (35\xB0N). Thus, **every\
      \ point in Colorado is north of every point in Georgia**.  \n\nANSWER: YES"

      \ Western Colorado University. I know it's in Colorado, but where exactly? I\
      \ think it's in Gunnison, Colorado. Let me confirm that. Yeah, a quick check\
      \ in my mind\u2014yes, Western Colorado University is in Gunnison, CO. Now,\
      \ what's the latitude of Gunnison? I remember that Colorado is in the Rocky\
      \ Mountains, so it's a northern state compared to, say, the southern states.\
      \ Gunnison's latitude is approximately 38.5 degrees north.\n\nNext, Georgia\
      \ Military College. That's in Georgia, right? The main campus is in Milledgeville,\
      \ GA. Let me make sure. Yes, Georgia Military College's main campus is in Milledgeville.\
      \ Now, the latitude of Milledgeville. Georgia is a southern state, so it's further\
      \ south. Milledgeville's latitude is around 33.1 degrees north.\n\nComparing\
      \ the two: 38.5 degrees (Gunnison, CO) versus 33.1 degrees (Milledgeville, GA).\
      \ Since latitude increases as you go north, 38.5 is definitely north of 33.1.\
      \ Therefore, Western Colorado University is north of Georgia Military College.\
      \ \n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check the exact locations. Sometimes cities\
      \ can be in different parts of the state. But Colorado is generally north of\
      \ Georgia. For example, the southern border of Colorado is around 37 degrees\
      \ north, while Georgia's northern border is about 35 degrees. So even the southern\
      \ part of Colorado is north of Georgia's northern part. Therefore, any university\
      \ in Colorado would be north of any in Georgia. But wait, is that always true?\
      \ Let me think. Georgia extends from about 30.5 to 35 degrees north. Colorado\
      \ is from 37 to 41 degrees north. So yes, the entire state of Colorado is north\
      \ of the entire state of Georgia. Therefore, any point in Colorado is north\
      \ of any point in Georgia. So Western Colorado University, being in Colorado,\
      \ is north of Georgia Military College in Georgia. \n\nTherefore, the answer\
      \ should be YES.\n</think>YES  \nWestern Colorado University in Gunnison, CO,\

      \nFirst, I should identify where each school is. Western Colorado University\
      \ (WCU) is in Colorado. Let me recall where exactly. I think it's in Gunnison,\

      \ is actually more towards the central-southern part. Hmm, so maybe Gunnison's\
      \ latitude is around 38.5\xB0N. Let me check that... Wait, from memory, places\
      \ like Aspen are around 39\xB0N, so Gunnison might be a little south of that.\
      \ Let's say 38.5\xB0N.\n\nMilledgeville, GA is in central Georgia. The latitude\
      \ of Georgia ranges from about 30.4\xB0N to 35\xB0N. Milledgeville is in the\
      \ middle, so maybe around 33\xB0N. For example, Macon, GA is about 32.8\xB0\
      N, and Milledgeville is northeast of Macon. So maybe 33.2\xB0N.\n\nComparing\
      \ 38.5\xB0N (Gunnison) to 33.2\xB0N (Milledgeville), Gunnison is indeed north\
      \ of Milledgeville. Therefore, Western Colorado University is located north\

      \ YES"
    797c5983-7da7-41b7-bf9b-68223ef49ea3: "<think>Alright, let's figure this out.\
      \ So the question is whether Western Colorado University in Colorado is located\

      \ \n\nFirst, I should recall where these two states are. Colorado is in the\
      \ western part of the US, kinda in the middle, north of states like Arizona\
      \ and New Mexico. Georgia is in the southeastern part, bordering Florida. So,\
      \ generally, Colorado is more to the northwest compared to Georgia. But just\
      \ because the state is more north doesn't necessarily mean the specific university\
      \ is, but maybe there's a general trend.\n\nLet me get specific. Western Colorado\
      \ University\u2014I think that's in Gunnison, Colorado. Let me confirm. Yes,\
      \ Western Colorado University is located in Gunnison, CO. Now, Georgia Military\
      \ College has multiple campuses, but the main one is in Milledgeville, GA. So\

      \ lower than 38.5\xB0. Even the northernmost part of Georgia is around 35\xB0\
      \ N, but the main campus in Milledgeville is 33.08\xB0, and other campuses are\
      \ in similar or lower latitudes. \n\nSo even if there's a campus in a northern\
      \ part of Georgia, like maybe Dalton or something, but I don't think GMC has\
      \ a campus there. Let me check their locations again. From their website, main\
      \ campuses are in Milledgeville, Augusta, Fairburn, Valdosta, etc. Valdosta\
      \ is even further south. So all their campuses are in Georgia, which maxes out\
      \ around 35\xB0 N latitude (like the Georgia-Tennessee border). Gunnison, CO\
      \ is 38.5\xB0 N, which is higher. So regardless of the specific campus in Georgia,\
      \ Western Colorado U is north of all Georgia Military College campuses. \n\n\

    28522572-1d6d-4b07-b204-bd3a26927cf9: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the question is whether Wisconsin Lutheran College in Wisconsin is located\
      \ north of Oaksterdam University in California. Hmm, okay. First, I need to\
      \ figure out where these two colleges are located geographically. \n\nStarting\
      \ with Wisconsin Lutheran College. I know Wisconsin is in the Midwest, and the\
      \ college is in Milwaukee, right? Let me confirm that. Yes, Wisconsin Lutheran\
      \ College is indeed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Now, Milwaukee's latitude. I remember\
      \ that Milwaukee is on the western shore of Lake Michigan. The approximate latitude\
      \ for Milwaukee is around 43\xB0N. Let me check that... Yeah, Milwaukee's latitude\
      \ is roughly 43.0389\xB0 N.\n\nNow, Oaksterdam University. I'm less familiar\
      \ with this one. The name sounds like a play on \"Oakland\" and \"Amsterdam,\"\
      \ maybe? I think it's in California. Let me think. Oakland is in California,\
      \ and Oaksterdam University is known for cannabis education, right? So it's\
      \ probably in Oakland, CA. Let me verify. Yes, Oaksterdam University is located\
      \ in Oakland, California. Now, the latitude of Oakland. Oakland is in the Bay\
      \ Area, so its latitude is around 37.8\xB0 N. For example, San Francisco is\
      \ about 37.7749\xB0 N, and Oakland is just across the bay, so similar latitude.\
      \ Let's say approximately 37.8\xB0 N.\n\nComparing the two latitudes: Milwaukee\
      \ at ~43\xB0N and Oakland at ~37.8\xB0N. Since latitude increases as you go\
      \ north, 43 is higher than 37.8, so Milwaukee is indeed north of Oakland. Therefore,\
      \ Wisconsin Lutheran College (Milwaukee, WI) is north of Oaksterdam University\
      \ (Oakland, CA). \n\nWait, but the question mentions Oaksterdam University,\
      \ CA. So if both of my location assumptions are correct, then the answer is\
      \ yes. But let me double-check the locations once more to be sure. Wisconsin\

      \ Let's start with Wisconsin Lutheran College. I think it's in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\
      \ Wait, maybe I should confirm that. Let me recall\u2014Wisconsin Lutheran College\
      \ is a private Lutheran college in Milwaukee, WI. Yes, that's right. So Milwaukee\
      \ is in the southeastern part of Wisconsin, right along Lake Michigan.\n\nNow,\
      \ Oaksterdam University. The name sounds familiar. Oaksterdam... I think that's\
      \ related to Oakland, California, maybe? Because \"Oaksterdam\" is a portmanteau\
      \ of Oakland and Amsterdam, referencing the cannabis culture there, right? So\
      \ Oaksterdam University is in Oakland, CA. They focus on cannabis business and\

      \ So, I need to figure out whether Wisconsin Lutheran College in Wisconsin is\
      \ located north of Oaksterdam University in California. Hmm, okay, let's break\
      \ this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the locations of both\
      \ institutions. Wisconsin Lutheran College is in Wisconsin, and Oaksterdam University\
      \ is in California. But where exactly in those states are they? I know that\
      \ states can have varying latitudes, so their positions within the state matter.\n\
      \nStarting with Wisconsin Lutheran College. If I recall correctly, Wisconsin\
      \ is in the Midwest, and its major cities include Milwaukee and Madison. I think\
      \ Wisconsin Lutheran College is in Milwaukee. Let me confirm that... Yes, I\
      \ believe that's right. So Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Now, what about Oaksterdam\
      \ University? The name Oaksterdam sounds like a play on \"Oakland\" and \"Amsterdam,\"\
      \ which makes me think it might be in Oakland, California. Let me check that.\
      \ Oaksterdam University is indeed located in Oakland, California. Okay, so the\
      \ two cities in question are Milwaukee, WI, and Oakland, CA.\n\nNext step: determining\
      \ the latitude of both cities because the question is about which is further\
      \ north. Latitude measures how far north or south a place is from the equator.\
      \ The higher the latitude, the further north.\n\nI need to find the approximate\
      \ latitudes of Milwaukee and Oakland. From what I remember, California is generally\
      \ further south than Wisconsin. But cities in northern California can still\
      \ be at a higher latitude than some southern parts of other states. Let me think.\
      \ Oakland is in the San Francisco Bay Area. San Francisco is around 37\xB0N\
      \ latitude. Milwaukee, being in the upper Midwest, is probably higher. Maybe\
      \ around 43\xB0N? Let me get specific numbers.\n\nLooking it up (mentally),\
      \ Milwaukee, WI is at approximately 43.0389\xB0 N latitude. Oakland, CA is around\
      \ 37.8044\xB0 N. Comparing these, 43.0389 is definitely higher than 37.8044.\
      \ Therefore, Milwaukee is north of Oakland. Since Wisconsin Lutheran College\
      \ is in Milwaukee and Oaksterdam University is in Oakland, the answer would\
      \ be YES, Wisconsin Lutheran College is north of Oaksterdam University.\n\n\
      Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the cities. Is there any\
      \ chance that Oaksterdam University is in a different part of California that's\
      \ further north? For example, if it were in a place like Eureka, CA, which is\
      \ much further north, that would change things. But no, Oaksterdam University\

      \ exact locations of both universities. Let's start with Indiana University-Purdue\
      \ University Columbus. I know that Indiana University and Purdue University\
      \ have several campuses in Indiana. The Columbus one is probably in Columbus,\
      \ Indiana. I've heard of Columbus, IN before, but I'm not exactly sure where\

      \ From what I remember, Columbus is southeast of Indianapolis, maybe about 40-50\

      \ would be in the southern part but not at the very southern border. \n\nNow,\
      \ Old Dominion University POD, VA. Wait, the question says \"POD, VA.\" I'm\

      \ University-Purdue University Columbus, IN would be located north of Old Dominion\
      \ University in Norfolk, VA. \n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that Old Dominion\
      \ University's location is indeed in Norfolk. Let me confirm. Yes, Old Dominion's\
      \ main campus is in Norfolk. So unless there's a different campus in a more\

      \ probably get the exact locations of both universities to compare their latitudes.\n\
      \nStarting with Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Columbus. Wait,\
      \ I think that's actually called Indiana University-Purdue University Columbus,\
      \ or IUPUC, in Columbus, Indiana. Let me confirm that. Yes, IUPUC is a regional\
      \ campus of Indiana University and Purdue University, located in Columbus, Indiana.\
      \ So Columbus, IN is the city. Now, where is Columbus, Indiana? Let me recall.\
      \ Indiana is in the Midwest, and Columbus is a city in the southern part of\
      \ Indiana, maybe around 40-41 degrees north latitude? Not sure exactly. I might\
      \ need to look up the coordinates.\n\nThen, Old Dominion University POD, VA.\
      \ Wait, Old Dominion University is in Norfolk, Virginia, right? But POD might\
      \ refer to a specific campus or location. Maybe it's a typo or abbreviation.\
      \ Let me check. Old Dominion University's main campus is in Norfolk, Virginia.\
      \ I'm not sure what POD stands for here. Perhaps a satellite campus or a specific\
      \ facility? But maybe the question is referring to the main campus. Alternatively,\
      \ could it be a typo for \"POC\" or something else? Maybe the user meant \"\
      VA\" as Virginia. Let me assume that it's Old Dominion University in Norfolk,\
      \ VA. Perhaps POD is a part of the university, but for the purpose of location,\
      \ the main campus should be sufficient.\n\nNow, comparing the latitudes. Norfolk,\
      \ VA is in the southeastern part of Virginia, near the coast. Its latitude is\
      \ around 36.85\xB0 N. Columbus, Indiana's latitude is higher. Let me think:\
      \ Indiana is a northern state compared to Virginia. Wait, Virginia is further\
      \ south than Indiana, so maybe cities in Indiana are north of those in Virginia.\
      \ But Columbus, IN is in southern Indiana. So what's the latitude of Columbus,\
      \ IN?\n\nLooking up (mentally), Columbus, IN is at approximately 39.20\xB0 N.\
      \ Norfolk, VA is at approximately 36.85\xB0 N. So 39.20 is north of 36.85. Therefore,\
      \ IUPUC in Columbus, IN is north of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA.\
      \ So the answer would be YES.\n\nWait, but wait, if the POD is a different location,\
      \ maybe in northern Virginia? Let me double-check. Old Dominion University does\
      \ have some extension centers. For example, they have a Peninsula Higher Education\
      \ Center in Hampton, VA. But Hampton is still in the southeastern part, near\
      \ Norfolk. The latitude would still be around 37\xB0 N, which is south of Columbus,\
      \ IN's 39.2\xB0 N. So even if POD refers to another location in Virginia, unless\
      \ it's somewhere in the northern part like near DC, but Old Dominion's main\
      \ presence is in Norfolk. Unless there's a specific campus I'm unaware of. But\

    ed3d0ace-b10f-483e-adc9-c1409ba00be3: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the user is asking if Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Columbus,\
      \ IN is located north of Old Dominion University POD, VA. Hmm, first, I need\
      \ to make sure I understand the institutions correctly. \n\nWait, Indiana University-Purdue\
      \ University Columbus, IN. I think that's a branch campus. But I should confirm.\
      \ Indiana University and Purdue University have several joint campuses in Indiana,\
      \ like IUPUI in Indianapolis. But Columbus, IN\u2014yes, there's a campus there\
      \ called IUPUC, Indiana University-Purdue University Columbus. So that's in\
      \ Columbus, Indiana.\n\nThen, Old Dominion University POD, VA. POD might stand\
      \ for a specific campus or location. Old Dominion University is in Norfolk,\
      \ Virginia. Maybe POD refers to a particular facility or campus? Wait, ODU has\
      \ multiple locations, like the Peninsula Higher Education Center in Hampton,\
      \ VA, or the Tri-Cities Center in Portsmouth. But the main campus is in Norfolk.\
      \ Maybe POD is an abbreviation for a specific site. Alternatively, could it\
      \ be a typo? Maybe they meant \"ODU, VA\" as in Old Dominion University, Virginia.\
      \ But the user wrote \"POD, VA\". Hmm. Let me check. \n\nAlternatively, maybe\
      \ \"POD\" is part of the name. Wait, Old Dominion University's main campus is\
      \ in Norfolk, VA. So perhaps the question is comparing the location of IUPUC\
      \ in Columbus, IN, to ODU in Norfolk, VA. But the user wrote \"POD, VA\". Maybe\
      \ that's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe there's a campus or center called POD.\
      \ Let me think. Old Dominion University has a Professional and Continuing Education\
      \ (PCE) division, but I don't recall a POD acronym. Alternatively, could it\
      \ be a typo for \"Portsmouth, VA\"? Because Portsmouth is near Norfolk, and\
      \ ODU has a center there. But the user wrote \"POD\". Maybe it's a typo. Alternatively,\
      \ maybe the user meant \"Norfolk, VA\" but wrote \"POD\". \n\nAlternatively,\
      \ perhaps the user is referring to the Old Dominion University Peninsula Center\
      \ in Hampton, VA. But Hampton is part of the Virginia Peninsula, so maybe POD\
      \ stands for Peninsula something. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's\
      \ a specific building or a different abbreviation. \n\nBut given that the user\
      \ might have made a typo, perhaps the intended comparison is between IUPUC in\
      \ Columbus, IN, and Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA. Let's proceed with\
      \ that assumption unless there's a clear POD location. \n\nSo, first, find the\
      \ coordinates of both universities. \n\nIUPUC is in Columbus, Indiana. Let me\
      \ get the latitude. Columbus, IN is at approximately 39.2014\xB0 N, 85.9214\xB0\
      \ W. \n\nOld Dominion University in Norfolk, VA is at 36.8854\xB0 N, 76.3056\xB0\
      \ W. \n\nComparing the latitudes: 39.2014\xB0 N vs. 36.8854\xB0 N. Since latitude\
      \ increases as you go north, 39.2 is north of 36.88. Therefore, Columbus, IN\
      \ is north of Norfolk, VA. So, if the question is comparing IUPUC in Columbus,\
      \ IN to ODU in Norfolk, VA, then the answer is YES. \n\nBut wait, the user specified\
      \ \"POD, VA\". If POD is a different location, perhaps in a more northern part\
      \ of Virginia, then the answer might change. Let me check if there's a POD in\
      \ VA. \n\nAlternatively, maybe POD is a typo for \"Portsmouth, VA\". ODU has\
      \ a Tri-Cities Center in Portsmouth, VA. The coordinates for Portsmouth, VA\
      \ are approximately 36.8354\xB0 N, 76.2983\xB0 W. That's even slightly south\
      \ of Norfolk, so latitude 36.83, which is still south of Columbus, IN's 39.2.\
      \ So even if it's Portsmouth, the answer remains YES. \n\nAlternatively, if\
      \ POD refers to another location, but I can't find any ODU campus in Virginia\
      \ that's north of 39.2\xB0 N. The northernmost part of Virginia is around 39.2\xB0\
      \ N (the state's northern border is at 39.466\xB0 N, near the panhandle). So,\
      \ for example, Arlington, VA is around 38.88\xB0 N. So even the northern parts\
      \ of Virginia are around 39\xB0 N, but Columbus, IN is at 39.20\xB0 N. So if\
      \ ODU had a campus in, say, Arlington, VA (38.88\xB0 N), then Columbus, IN would\
      \ still be north. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the specific location in Virginia\
      \ (assuming it's within the state), IUPUC in Columbus, IN is north of Old Dominion\
      \ University's locations in Virginia. \n\nWait, but let me confirm the exact\
      \ coordinates again. \n\nIUPUC's address is 4601 Central Ave, Columbus, IN 47203.\
      \ The coordinates are approximately 39.2014\xB0 N, 85.9214\xB0 W. \n\nOld Dominion\
      \ University's main campus in Norfolk, VA: 36.8854\xB0 N, 76.3056\xB0 W. \n\n\
      So 39.2\xB0 N is definitely north of 36.88\xB0 N. Therefore, the answer is YES.\
      \ \n\nBut the user wrote \"POD, VA\". If that's a specific location that's in\
      \ a more northern part of Virginia, but I can't find any such location. Alternatively,\
      \ maybe it's a typo for \"POE\" (Point of Entry?) or another abbreviation, but\
      \ that's unclear. Given the information, the safest assumption is that the user\
      \ intended ODU in Norfolk, VA, and thus the answer is YES.\n</think>To determine\

      \ Central Washington University (CWU). I know Washington state is in the Pacific\
      \ Northwest. CWU's main campus is in Ellensburg, WA. I should check the latitude\
      \ of Ellensburg. Maybe around 47 degrees north? Because Seattle is around 47.6,\
      \ and Ellensburg is east of Seattle but still in the same general latitude.\n\
      \nNext, Brown College. Wait, there are a few Brown Colleges. But in Minnesota,\
      \ maybe it's the one in Mendota Heights? Let me confirm. Yes, Brown College\
      \ is a former for-profit college in Mendota Heights, Minnesota. So I need the\
      \ latitude of Mendota Heights, MN. Minnesota is north of Iowa, so Mendota Heights\

      \ Central Washington University in Washington state is located north of Brown\
      \ College in Minnesota. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should\
      \ find the locations of both universities. Let me start with Central Washington\
      \ University (CWU). I know that in Washington state, the major cities include\
      \ Seattle, Spokane, Tacoma, etc. Central Washington University\u2014maybe it's\
      \ in the central part of the state. I think Ellensburg is a city in central\

      \ Yes, a quick check in my mind (since I can't look it up right now) tells me\
      \ that CWU's main campus is indeed in Ellensburg, WA.\n\nNow, for Brown College\
      \ in Minnesota. Wait, Brown College might be a common name. There's Brown University\
      \ in Rhode Island, but that's not this. There was a Brown College in Minnesota,\
      \ but I think it might have closed or merged. Wait, Brown College was a for-profit\
      \ college in Minnesota, located in Mendota Heights. But I should make sure.\
      \ Alternatively, maybe there's another Brown College there. But as far as I\
      \ remember, Brown College in Minnesota was part of the Minnesota School of Business\
      \ or something similar. Let me try to remember. I think it's in Mendota Heights,\
      \ MN. But let me think, Mendota Heights is near the Twin Cities, like St. Paul.\
      \ So the coordinates would be around that area.\n\nNow, I need to compare the\
      \ latitudes of Ellensburg, WA, and Mendota Heights, MN. Latitude determines\
      \ how far north a place is. So which is further north? Let's think about the\
      \ general regions. Washington state is in the Pacific Northwest. Central Washington\
      \ is east of the Cascade Mountains. Ellensburg's latitude: I think it's around\
      \ 46.9\xB0 N. Mendota Heights, MN, is near Minneapolis-St. Paul, which is around\
      \ 44.9\xB0 N latitude. Wait, so if Ellensburg is at 46.9\xB0N and Mendota Heights\
      \ at 44.9\xB0N, then CWU is indeed north of Brown College. Because higher latitude\
      \ means further north.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the approximate latitudes\
      \ of both cities. Minneapolis is at about 44.98\xB0N. Ellensburg, WA is approximately\
      \ 46.997\xB0N. So yes, 46.997 is higher than 44.98, so Ellensburg is further\
      \ north. Therefore, Central Washington University (in Ellensburg) is located\

      \ have to go with what I remember. Let's say Brown College is in Mendota Heights,\
      \ MN.\n\nNow, I need to compare the latitudes of Ellensburg, WA and Mendota\
      \ Heights, MN. Latitude determines how far north a place is. The higher the\
      \ latitude, the further north.\n\nI know that Washington state is in the northwest\
      \ of the US, while Minnesota is more in the upper Midwest. Let's think about\
      \ major cities. Seattle, WA is at around 47.6\xB0 N. Minneapolis, MN is approximately\
      \ 44.9\xB0 N. Since Mendota Heights is a suburb of Minneapolis-St. Paul, its\
      \ latitude should be similar, so around 44.8\xB0 N to 45\xB0 N. Ellensburg is\
      \ in central Washington. If I remember correctly, it's a bit east of the Cascades\

      \ Spokane is in eastern Washington and is around 47.6\xB0 N as well. Wait, but\
      \ Ellensburg is more central. Maybe around 46.9\xB0 N? Let me check my mental\
      \ map... Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up cities. Alternatively, maybe I should use\
      \ approximate coordinates. \n\nAlternatively, think about state locations. Minnesota's\
      \ southern border is at about the same latitude as northern Oregon. Washington\
      \ is further north. For example, the northern border of Washington is at 49\xB0\
      \ N (the US-Canada border). So even central Washington would be somewhere in\
      \ the mid-40s. Let's see: Spokane is around 47.6\xB0 N. Ellensburg's coordinates\

      \ I'll need the locations of both universities. Strayer University in DC\u2014\
      DC stands for Washington, District of Columbia. So that's the capital of the\
      \ US, on the east coast. Arkansas State University in Paragould, AR. Paragould\
      \ is a city in Arkansas, right? Arkansas is a state in the southern part of\

      \ Latitude measures how far north or south a place is. The higher the latitude,\

      \ I recall, Washington, DC's latitude is approximately 38.9072\xB0 N. Let me\
      \ double-check that\u2014yeah, that sounds right. It's somewhere around 38.9\xB0\
      N.\n\nNow, Paragould, Arkansas. I'm less familiar with this. Arkansas is further\
      \ south, but how far exactly? Let me think. Arkansas is south of Missouri. Cities\
      \ in northern Arkansas, like Jonesboro, are around 35.8\xB0N. Paragould is in\
      \ northeastern Arkansas, near the Missouri border. Maybe its latitude is similar.\
      \ Quick check: Paragould, AR latitude is approximately 36.0570\xB0 N. Wait,\
      \ that's actually a bit higher than 36\xB0N. So that would put Paragould at\

      N (DC) is higher than 36.057\xB0N (Paragould). That would mean Washington, DC\

      \ Carolina. The other one is part of Florida State University, located in Florida.\
      \ Now, geographically, North Carolina is a state that's above South Carolina,\

      \ to the border with Virginia. On the other hand, Florida A&M University \u2013\

      \ be south of the southernmost point in North Carolina, right? Let me visualize\
      \ the map. Florida is a peninsula that goes southward. North Carolina is several\
      \ states north. So even if ECSU is in the northeastern part of NC, and the Florida\

      \ is around 36.5\xB0 N, so Elizabeth City would be a bit south of that. Maybe\
      \ around 36.3\xB0 N?\n\nIf Tallahassee is at 30.45\xB0 N and Elizabeth City\
      \ is at around 36.3\xB0 N, then Elizabeth City is significantly north of Tallahassee.\
      \ Therefore, the answer should be YES. But wait, let me be careful. Is there\
      \ any way that a part of Florida could be north of a part of NC? For example,\

      \ 31\xB0 N, and North Carolina's southern border is around 34\xB0 N. Wait, no.\
      \ Wait, states' borders: Florida's northern border is at approximately 31\xB0\
      \ N, bordering Georgia and Alabama. Georgia is from about 30.36\xB0 N (southern\

      \ NO, but they want the reasoning steps first.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out\
      \ where each of these universities is located. Let's start with Elizabeth City\
      \ State University (ECSU) in North Carolina. I know that Elizabeth City is a\
      \ city in northeastern North Carolina. To get more precise, maybe I should look\
      \ up the exact coordinates or at least the general location relative to the\
      \ state. From what I remember, North Carolina is above South Carolina and Georgia,\
      \ and Florida is south of Georgia. So, North Carolina is definitely north of\
      \ Florida as a state. But the question is about the specific universities.\n\
      \nNow, Florida A&M University \u2013 Florida State University College of Engineering\
      \ is in Florida. Florida is the southernmost state in the southeastern U.S.\
      \ The exact city for the College of Engineering might be Tallahassee, since\
      \ Florida A&M and Florida State University are both located there. Let me confirm\
      \ that. Yes, both Florida A&M University and Florida State University are in\
      \ Tallahassee, which is the capital of Florida. So the College of Engineering\
      \ part of that joint program would be in Tallahassee as well.\n\nNext, I need\
      \ to compare the latitudes of Elizabeth City, NC, and Tallahassee, FL. Latitude\
      \ determines how far north or south a location is. The higher the latitude,\
      \ the farther north. So if Elizabeth City has a higher latitude than Tallahassee,\
      \ then the answer is YES.\n\nLooking up the approximate latitudes: Elizabeth\
      \ City, NC is around 36.3\xB0 N. Tallahassee, FL is around 30.45\xB0 N. Comparing\
      \ those, 36.3\xB0 N is definitely north of 30.45\xB0 N. Therefore, Elizabeth\

      \ of Engineering in Tallahassee, FL.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, maybe I should\
      \ double-check the cities. Elizabeth City is indeed in NC, and Tallahassee is\
      \ in Florida. Since NC is north of Florida, and both cities are in their respective\
      \ states, the NC city should be north of the FL city. Even if the exact cities\
      \ were closer to the state borders, the latitude difference would still hold.\
      \ For example, the northern border of Florida is at about 31\xB0 N, and Elizabeth\

      \nNow, the other institution is Florida A&M University \u2013 Florida State\
      \ University College of Engineering, which is in Florida. Florida is the southernmost\
      \ state in the southeastern U.S., so geographically, it's south of Georgia and\

      \ as well.\n\nNext, I need to compare the latitudes of Elizabeth City, NC, and\
      \ Tallahassee, FL. Latitude determines how far north or south a location is.\
      \ The higher the latitude, the further north. Let me recall approximate latitudes.\
      \ Tallahassee, FL, is around 30.44\xB0 N latitude. Elizabeth City, NC, I think\

      \ to find out where exactly these universities are located within their respective\
      \ states.\n\nStarting with Viterbo University in Wisconsin. I recall that Wisconsin\

      \ I think Viterbo is in La Crosse, Wisconsin. Let me confirm that... Yes, Viterbo\

      \ right, Mountain State University closed in 2013. But assuming the question\
      \ refers to its former location, it was in Beckley, West Virginia. So Beckley,\
      \ WV is the city.\n\nNow, I need to compare the latitudes of La Crosse, WI and\
      \ Beckley, WV to see which is further north. Latitude is the key here. Let me\
      \ recall the approximate latitudes. \n\nLa Crosse, Wisconsin: I know that Wisconsin\
      \ is in the northern part of the US. For example, Madison, WI is around 43\xB0\
      N latitude. La Crosse is in the western part of Wisconsin, near the Minnesota\
      \ border. Maybe around 43.8\xB0N? \n\nBeckley, West Virginia: West Virginia\
      \ is further south. For example, Charleston, WV is around 38.35\xB0N. Beckley\
      \ is in the southern part of WV, so perhaps around 37.8\xB0N? \n\nSo comparing\
      \ 43.8\xB0N (La Crosse) vs. 37.8\xB0N (Beckley). The higher the latitude, the\
      \ further north. Therefore, Viterbo University in La Crosse, WI is indeed north\

      \ in the upper Midwest, near the Mississippi River. Beckley, WV is in the Appalachian\
      \ region, which is more southern. So yes, Wisconsin is north of West Virginia\
      \ overall. For example, the northern border of West Virginia is around 40\xB0\
      N, while Wisconsin's southern border is around 42\xB0N. So even the southern\

      \ \n\nWait, is that true? Let me visualize a map. West Virginia is south of\
      \ Pennsylvania, which is at around 40\xB0N. Pennsylvania's northern border is\
      \ about 42\xB0N, but West Virginia is to the south of that. Wisconsin starts\
      \ around 42\xB0N at its southern border and goes up to about 47\xB0N. So even\
      \ the southernmost point in Wisconsin (42.5\xB0N) is north of the northernmost\
      \ point in West Virginia (around 40.6\xB0N). Therefore, yes, any point in Wisconsin\
      \ is north of any point in West Virginia. That makes the answer a definitive\
      \ yes. So Viterbo University, WI is located north of Mountain State University,\
      \ WV.\n</think>YES  \nViterbo University is located in La Crosse, Wisconsin\
      \ (approximately 43.8\xB0N latitude), while Mountain State University was in\

      \ figure out where each university is. \n\nStarting with Viterbo University\
      \ in Wisconsin. I remember that Viterbo is a private Franciscan university.\
      \ I think it's in La Crosse, Wisconsin. Let me confirm that. Yeah, a quick check\
      \ in my mind\u2014La Crosse is a city in western Wisconsin, along the Mississippi\
      \ River. Now, Mountain State University. Wait, isn't there a Mountain State\
      \ University in West Virginia? But I think Mountain State University closed\
      \ around 2012-2013 due to accreditation issues. Maybe it's now part of another\
      \ institution? Or perhaps the question refers to its former location. Assuming\
      \ it's the original location in Beckley, West Virginia.\n\nSo, next step is\
      \ to get the approximate latitudes of both cities. La Crosse, WI and Beckley,\
      \ WV. Latitude determines north-south position. The higher the latitude, the\
      \ farther north. Let's recall the approximate latitudes. \n\nLa Crosse, WI:\
      \ I think Wisconsin is in the upper Midwest. La Crosse should be around 43 degrees\
      \ north latitude. Let me confirm. Yes, looking it up mentally, La Crosse is\
      \ at approximately 43.8\xB0 N.\n\nBeckley, WV: West Virginia is further south.\
      \ Beckley is in the southern part of the state. Maybe around 37.7\xB0 N? I remember\
      \ that West Virginia's latitude ranges from about 37\xB0 N to 40\xB0 N. Beckley\
      \ would be in the southern part. So, approximately 37.7\xB0 N.\n\nComparing\
      \ 43.8\xB0 N (La Crosse) and 37.7\xB0 N (Beckley). Since 43.8 is higher than\
      \ 37.7, La Crosse is indeed north of Beckley. Therefore, Viterbo University\
      \ in La Crosse, WI is north of the former Mountain State University in Beckley,\
      \ WV. \n\nWait, but I should make sure that Mountain State University was indeed\
      \ in Beckley. Let me double-check. Yes, Mountain State University was based\
      \ in Beckley, WV before it closed. So, yes, their location was there.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ the answer should be YES. Viterbo University, WI is located north of Mountain\
      \ State University, WV.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1.\
      \ **Locate the Universities:**  \n   - Viterbo University is in La Crosse, Wisconsin.\
      \  \n   - Mountain State University was in Beckley, West Virginia (closed in\
      \ 2013).  \n\n2. **Compare Latitudes:**  \n   - La Crosse, WI: ~43.8\xB0 N latitude.\
      \  \n   - Beckley, WV: ~37.7\xB0 N latitude.  \n\n3. **Determine North/South\
      \ Position:**  \n   Since 43.8\xB0 N (La Crosse) is farther north than 37.7\xB0\
      \ N (Beckley), Viterbo University is north of Mountain State University\u2019\
      s former location.  \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    7455b7fa-253b-49fa-b292-dec2ca3ffc53: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. So, the question is asking whether Viterbo University in Wisconsin\
      \ is located north of Mountain State University in West Virginia. The answer\
      \ needs to be a simple YES or NO, but getting there requires some reasoning.\n\
      \nFirst, I need to figure out the locations of both universities. Let's start\
      \ with Viterbo University in Wisconsin. I know Wisconsin is a state in the Midwest,\
      \ and I believe Viterbo University is in La Crosse, Wisconsin. Let me confirm\
      \ that. Yes, a quick check in my memory\u2014Viterbo is indeed in La Crosse,\
      \ which is in the western part of Wisconsin, near the Mississippi River.\n\n\
      Next, Mountain State University in West Virginia. Wait, Mountain State University...\
      \ Hmm, isn't there a Mountain State University that closed down? Let me think.\
      \ Oh, right, Mountain State University was located in Beckley, West Virginia,\
      \ but it lost its accreditation around 2012-2013 and closed. However, the question\
      \ is about its location regardless of its current operational status. So assuming\
      \ the location is Beckley, WV.\n\nNow, the main task is to determine if La Crosse,\
      \ WI is north of Beckley, WV. To do this, I need to compare the latitudes of\
      \ both cities. Latitude measures how far north or south a place is. The higher\
      \ the latitude, the further north.\n\nLet me recall approximate latitudes. La\
      \ Crosse, WI is in the upper Midwest. I think its latitude is around 43.8 degrees\
      \ North. Beckley, WV is in the southern part of West Virginia. West Virginia\
      \ itself is in the eastern US, south of Pennsylvania. Beckley's latitude is\
      \ approximately 37.8 degrees North. \n\nComparing 43.8\xB0N (La Crosse) and\
      \ 37.8\xB0N (Beckley), 43.8 is higher than 37.8. Therefore, La Crosse, WI is\
      \ indeed north of Beckley, WV. Since Viterbo University is in La Crosse, WI\
      \ and Mountain State University was in Beckley, WV, the answer should be YES.\n\
      \nWait, but let me double-check the latitudes to be sure. Maybe I'm mixing up\
      \ some numbers. La Crosse, WI: a quick check\u2014yes, according to data, its\
      \ latitude is approximately 43.8014\xB0 N. Beckley, WV's latitude is around\
      \ 37.7807\xB0 N. Therefore, 43.8 is definitely north of 37.8. So the answer\
      \ remains YES.\n\nAnother way to think about this: states' positions. Wisconsin\
      \ is north of West Virginia. But wait, states can be east or west as well. Wisconsin\
      \ is more to the northwest compared to West Virginia. But latitude-wise, even\
      \ if a state is to the west, if its latitude is higher, it's further north.\
      \ For example, Minnesota is north of Iowa, even though it's more to the west.\
      \ Similarly, Wisconsin's northern border is around 47\xB0N, while West Virginia's\
      \ northernmost point is about 40.5\xB0N. So even the southern parts of Wisconsin\
      \ are around 42-43\xB0N, which is still north of West Virginia's latitude. Therefore,\
      \ any university in Wisconsin is likely north of any in West Virginia.\n\nHence,\
      \ the answer must be YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n\
      1. **Locations Identified**: Viterbo University is in La Crosse, WI (latitude\
      \ ~43.8\xB0N). Mountain State University was in Beckley, WV (latitude ~37.8\xB0\
      N).  \n2. **Latitude Comparison**: La Crosse, WI (43.8\xB0N) has a higher latitude\
      \ than Beckley, WV (37.8\xB0N).  \n3. **Conclusion**: Since latitude determines\
      \ north-south position, Viterbo University, WI is north of Mountain State University,\
      \ WV.  \n\nAnswer: YES"

      \ recall: La Crosse, WI is in the western part of Wisconsin, near the Mississippi\
      \ River. Beckley, WV is in southern West Virginia. Generally, Wisconsin is north\

      \nNext, Mountain State University in West Virginia. Wait, Mountain State University\u2014\

    070aa776-71dc-462f-8183-620f1b42dada: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. So, the question is whether Benedictine University in Illinois\
      \ is located north of Thomas More University in Kentucky. I need to figure out\
      \ the geographic locations of both universities and compare their latitudes\
      \ to determine if Benedictine (IL) is indeed north of Thomas More (KY). \n\n\
      First, I'll start by recalling that Benedictine University is in Illinois, and\
      \ Thomas More University is in Kentucky. Both are in the Midwest, but I need\
      \ to be more precise. Let me think about the specific cities or towns where\
      \ these universities are located.\n\nI know that Benedictine University has\
      \ a main campus in Lisle, Illinois. Lisle is a suburb of Chicago, so it's in\
      \ the northeastern part of Illinois. Chicago is well-known for being in the\
      \ northern part of the state, near Lake Michigan. So Lisle being a suburb of\
      \ Chicago would place it at a relatively high latitude within Illinois.\n\n\
      On the other hand, Thomas More University is in Crestview Hills, Kentucky. Kentucky\
      \ is south of Illinois, but I should check where exactly Crestview Hills is.\
      \ Kentucky is bordered by Ohio to the north, and I believe Crestview Hills is\
      \ near Cincinnati, which is in Ohio. Wait, Cincinnati is actually just across\
      \ the Ohio River from Kentucky. So Crestview Hills, KY, is likely in the northern\
      \ part of Kentucky, near the border with Ohio. That would mean it's in the northernmost\
      \ part of Kentucky, close to Cincinnati.\n\nNow, comparing the two: Lisle, IL\
      \ (Benedictine) is a Chicago suburb, so around 41.7\xB0 N latitude. Cincinnati,\
      \ OH, which is adjacent to Crestview Hills, KY, is approximately 39.1\xB0 N\
      \ latitude. Since latitude increases as you go north, 41.7\xB0 N is definitely\
      \ north of 39.1\xB0 N. Therefore, Benedictine University in Lisle, IL, would\
      \ be north of Thomas More University in Crestview Hills, KY.\n\nWait, just to\
      \ confirm, let me double-check the exact locations. Benedictine University,\
      \ Lisle, IL: yes, that's correct. Thomas More University is in Crestview Hills,\
      \ KY, which is indeed in Kenton County, Kentucky, part of the Cincinnati metropolitan\
      \ area. The latitude for Crestview Hills is roughly 39.02\xB0 N, while Lisle,\
      \ IL, is around 41.8011\xB0 N. So there's a difference of about 2.78 degrees\
      \ in latitude, which translates to roughly 190 miles north. Since each degree\
      \ of latitude is about 69 miles, that makes sense. \n\nTherefore, the answer\
      \ should be YES, Benedictine University, IL is located north of Thomas More\
      \ University, KY.\n</think>YES.  \n**Step 1:** Benedictine University is in\
      \ Lisle, IL (latitude ~41.8\xB0 N), a Chicago suburb.  \n**Step 2:** Thomas\
      \ More University is in Crestview Hills, KY (latitude ~39.02\xB0 N), near Cincinnati.\
      \  \n**Step 3:** Comparing latitudes, 41.8\xB0 N (Benedictine) is north of 39.02\xB0\
      \ N (Thomas More).  \n\n**Answer:** YES."

      \ out the locations of both universities. Benedictine University is in Illinois,\
      \ and Thomas More University is in Kentucky. Now, I should find out the specific\
      \ cities or towns where each is located because the states' relative positions\
      \ might not be enough. Illinois is north of Kentucky in general, but universities\
      \ could be in southern parts of their states, right?\n\nStarting with Benedictine\
      \ University, IL. I remember that there's a Benedictine University in Lisle,\
      \ Illinois. Let me confirm that. Yes, a quick check in my mind tells me that\
      \ Benedictine's main campus is in Lisle, which is a suburb of Chicago. Chicago\
      \ is in northeastern Illinois, so Lisle should be in that area too.\n\nNext,\
      \ Thomas More University in Kentucky. I believe Thomas More is located in Crestview\
      \ Hills, Kentucky. Let me double-check. Yes, Crestview Hills is a city in Kentucky,\
      \ near the Ohio border. Specifically, it's in Northern Kentucky, close to Cincinnati,\
      \ Ohio. So, Crestview Hills, KY is in the northern part of Kentucky, right across\
      \ the Ohio River from Cincinnati.\n\nNow, comparing their latitudes. Lisle,\
      \ IL is near Chicago, which is at approximately 41.8\xB0 N latitude. Crestview\
      \ Hills, KY is near Cincinnati, which is around 39.1\xB0 N latitude. Since latitude\
      \ increases as you go north, a higher number means further north. 41.8\xB0N\
      \ is definitely north of 39.1\xB0N. Therefore, Lisle, IL (Benedictine) is north\
      \ of Crestview Hills, KY (Thomas More). \n\nSo, putting it all together: Benedictine\

    1bbc0266-e87c-4567-b61d-6cd271b73a60: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, we need to determine if Benedictine University in Illinois is located\
      \ north of Thomas More University in Kentucky. The answer should be a simple\
      \ YES or NO, but getting there requires a bit of geography and maybe some map-checking\
      \ steps. \n\nFirst, I need to recall where each university is located. Benedictine\
      \ University in Illinois\u2014I know there's a Benedictine University in Lisle,\
      \ Illinois. Then Thomas More University is in Kentucky; I think that's in Crestview\
      \ Hills, Kentucky. \n\nNext step is figuring out the latitudes of these two\
      \ places because north/south positioning is all about latitude. The higher the\
      \ latitude, the farther north a place is. So if Benedictine's latitude is higher\
      \ than Thomas More's, then the answer is YES.\n\nLet me try to remember or estimate\
      \ their locations. Illinois is north of Kentucky in general. Illinois is a northern\
      \ state compared to Kentucky, which is more mid-south. So Chicago is in Illinois,\
      \ which is way north. But where exactly are these universities?\n\nBenedictine\
      \ in Lisle, IL: Lisle is a suburb of Chicago, so that's definitely in the northern\
      \ part of Illinois. Thomas More in Crestview Hills, KY: Crestview Hills is near\
      \ Cincinnati, Ohio. Wait, Cincinnati is on the border of Ohio and Kentucky.\
      \ So northern Kentucky, near Ohio. So maybe Thomas More University is in the\
      \ northern part of Kentucky, close to the Ohio border. \n\nIf that's the case,\
      \ then maybe the latitudes are closer than I thought. Because Chicago is at\
      \ around 41-42 degrees latitude. Cincinnati, which is near Crestview Hills,\
      \ is around 39 degrees. So if Benedictine is in Lisle (Chicago area), that's\
      \ around 41.8\xB0 N latitude, and Thomas More University in Crestview Hills,\
      \ KY would be around 39.0\xB0 N. Therefore, 41.8 is north of 39.0, so YES, Benedictine\
      \ University, IL is north of Thomas More University, KY.\n\nWait, let me confirm\

      \ Google Maps, the coordinates are approximately 41.7994\xB0 N, 88.0725\xB0\
      \ W. Thomas More University in Crestview Hills, KY: Coordinates are approximately\
      \ 39.0333\xB0 N, 84.5656\xB0 W. \n\nComparing those latitudes: 41.7994\xB0 N\
      \ vs. 39.0333\xB0 N. Since 41.8 is greater than 39.0, Benedictine is indeed\
      \ north of Thomas More. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step\
      \ Explanation:**  \n1. **Identify Locations:** Benedictine University is in\

      \nLet me recall: Benedictine University's main campus is in Lisle, Illinois.\
      \ Thomas More University is in Crestview Hills, Kentucky. Now, I need the latitudes\

      \ is south of the Ohio River, which is the border between Ohio and Kentucky.\
      \ But Benedictine is in northern Illinois, so Chicago area, which is around\
      \ 41-42 degrees latitude. Thomas More in northern Kentucky, near Cincinnati,\

      \ would be north of Thomas More. \n\nBut maybe I should cross-check the exact\
      \ cities. Lisle, IL's latitude is approximately 41.8011\xB0 N. Crestview Hills,\
      \ KY is around 39.0270\xB0 N. Comparing those numbers, 41.8 is definitely north\

      \ YES.\n</think>YES  \nBenedictine University in Lisle, Illinois (latitude ~41.8\xB0\

      \ is in Edinboro, PA. Adams State University is in Alamosa, Colorado. Now, I\
      \ need to find the latitude coordinates of both cities.\n\nEdinboro, PA: Let\
      \ me recall. Pennsylvania is in the northeastern US. Edinboro is in the northwestern\
      \ part of PA. The latitude of Edinboro, PA. I think Erie, PA is at around 42.13\xB0\
      \ N. Since Edinboro is near Erie, maybe similar. Let me check mentally. Erie\
      \ is at 42.1292\xB0 N. Edinboro is a bit south of Erie, maybe around 41.88\xB0\
      \ N? Wait, I should verify. Alternatively, maybe 41.9\xB0 N. Wait, if Erie is\
      \ 42.13, then Edinboro being south might be around 41.9. But I'm not entirely\
      \ sure. Alternatively, perhaps Edinboro's latitude is around 41.876\xB0 N. I\
      \ need to be accurate here.\n\nNow, Alamosa, CO. Adams State is in Alamosa.\
      \ Where is that in Colorado? Colorado is a rectangular state. Alamosa is in\
      \ the southern part of Colorado, near the San Luis Valley. The latitude of Alamosa,\
      \ CO. Let me think. The southern border of Colorado is at 37\xB0 N. Denver is\
      \ around 39.7\xB0 N. Alamosa is south of Denver, so maybe around 37.5\xB0 N?\
      \ Wait, let me think. Alamosa's actual coordinates. I believe Alamosa is at\
      \ approximately 37.47\xB0 N latitude.\n\nComparing the two: If Edinboro is around\
      \ 41.8\xB0 N and Alamosa is 37.47\xB0 N, then Edinboro is north of Alamosa.\
      \ Therefore, PennWest Edinboro, PA would be north of Adams State University,\

      \ is north of Pittsburgh, closer to Erie. Erie is at 42.129\xB0 N. So Edinboro\
      \ is between Erie and Pittsburgh. Let's say Edinboro is around 41.88\xB0 N.\

      \ PennWest Edinboro is part of the Pennsylvania Western University system, which\

      N. Edinboro is north of Pittsburgh, maybe? So perhaps around 41\xB0N? Let me\
      \ check in my mind. Erie, PA is on Lake Erie and is around 42.13\xB0N. Edinboro\
      \ is near Erie, right? Because Edinboro University is in Edinboro, PA, which\
      \ is a bit south of Erie. So maybe Edinboro is around 41.87\xB0N? I might be\
      \ mixing up exact numbers, but the key is that it's in northern PA.\n\nNow,\
      \ Adams State University is in Alamosa, CO. Colorado is further west, but latitude\
      \ is what matters here. Alamosa is in southern Colorado. I think southern Colorado\
      \ is around 37\xB0N to 38\xB0N. For example, Denver is at 39.74\xB0N, so Alamosa,\
      \ being south, should be lower. Let me recall: Alamosa's latitude is approximately\
      \ 37.47\xB0N. \n\nComparing the two: If Edinboro is around 41.8\xB0N and Alamosa\
      \ is 37.47\xB0N, then Edinboro is indeed north of Adams State. But wait, I need\
      \ to be sure about the exact coordinates. Let me try to remember or estimate.\
      \ \n\nAnother way: The 40th parallel runs through the US. Pennsylvania is mostly\
      \ above 40\xB0N, except maybe the southern parts. Edinboro is in the north,\
      \ so definitely above 40. Colorado's southern border is at 37\xB0N, so Alamosa,\
      \ being in the San Luis Valley in southern Colorado, is around 37.5\xB0N. So\
      \ yes, 41.8 vs 37.5, so Edinboro is north. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n\

      \nOkay, first I need to figure out where each of these universities is located.\
      \ Let's start with the University of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon County, WI. Wait,\

      \ Let me confirm. Yes, Marathon County's main city is Wausau. So the university\
      \ is in Wausau, WI.\n\nNow, Franklin Pierce University in New Hampshire. I'm\
      \ not as familiar with that one. Let me think. Franklin Pierce is a private\
      \ university in New Hampshire. They have a main campus in Rindge, NH. So the\
      \ location would be Rindge, New Hampshire.\n\nNext step is to compare the latitudes\
      \ of these two places to see which is further north. Since the question is about\
      \ being north of the other, latitude is the key here.\n\nLet me recall the approximate\
      \ latitudes. Wausau, WI is in central Wisconsin. I remember that Wisconsin's\
      \ latitude ranges roughly from about 42\xB0N to 47\xB0N. Wausau is somewhere\
      \ in the middle. Maybe around 44.5\xB0N to 45\xB0N? Let me check mentally. Madison,\
      \ WI is around 43\xB0N, and Wausau is north of Madison, so maybe around 44.9\xB0\
      N. Let's say approximately 45\xB0N for Wausau, WI.\n\nNow, Rindge, NH. New Hampshire\
      \ is in the northeastern US. Its latitude range is roughly from 42.5\xB0N to\
      \ 45\xB0N. Rindge is in the southern part of New Hampshire, I believe. Wait,\
      \ no. Let me think. Rindge is actually in the southwestern part of New Hampshire,\
      \ near the Massachusetts border. Wait, or is it more central? Maybe I should\
      \ think of major cities. Manchester, NH is around 43\xB0N. Concord, the capital,\
      \ is around 43.2\xB0N. Rindge is actually in the southwestern part, but I think\
      \ it's a bit further north. Wait, perhaps around 42.7\xB0N? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing\
      \ up. Alternatively, let's consider that the southern border of New Hampshire\
      \ with Massachusetts is around 42.7\xB0N. Since Rindge is near the border, maybe\
      \ it's around 42.8\xB0N. Alternatively, if it's in the southern part, but maybe\
      \ not exactly on the border. Wait, I should try to recall if Franklin Pierce's\
      \ campus is in Rindge. Let me confirm. Yes, their main campus is in Rindge,\
      \ NH. Checking the coordinates, Rindge, NH is at approximately 42.751\xB0N latitude.\
      \ So about 42.75\xB0N.\n\nComparing that to Wausau, WI. What's the latitude\
      \ of Wausau? Let me confirm. Wausau is around 44.96\xB0N. So approximately 44.96\xB0\
      N. That would mean Wausau, WI is at a higher latitude than Rindge, NH (42.75\xB0\
      N). Since higher latitude means further north, the University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Marathon County (Wausau) would indeed be north of Franklin Pierce University\
      \ (Rindge).\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check. Let me consider another\
      \ way. Maybe using known cities. For example, Boston is around 42.36\xB0N. Rindge\
      \ is in NH, which is north of Boston, but not by much. If Rindge is around 42.75\xB0\
      N, that's a bit north of Boston. Meanwhile, Wausau, WI is in central Wisconsin.\
      \ Wisconsin's northern border is with Lake Superior and Michigan's Upper Peninsula.\
      \ Cities like Green Bay, WI are around 44.5\xB0N. Wausau is west of Green Bay,\

      \ of NH. Maybe the latitude is around 42.8\xB0N. So if Wausau is at 44.5\xB0\
      N and Rindge is around 42.8\xB0N, then Wausau would be north of Rindge. Therefore,\
      \ the University of Wisconsin-Marathon County would be north of Franklin Pierce\
      \ University.\n\nBut I should double-check these coordinates to be sure. Let\
      \ me try to remember or think of any known cities. For example, Boston is around\
      \ 42.3\xB0N. Rindge, NH is northwest of Boston, maybe a bit higher. Let's say\
      \ 42.8\xB0N. Wausau, WI: I know that the 45th parallel (45\xB0N) passes through\
      \ Wisconsin. Wausau is south of that, maybe around 44.9\xB0N. If that's accurate,\
      \ then Wausau is at a higher latitude than Rindge, so yes, it's further north.\n\
      \nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the states' positions. Wisconsin is\
      \ to the west of New Hampshire but how far north? The northern border of Wisconsin\
      \ is at around 46-47\xB0N, but the southern part of Wisconsin is lower. New\
      \ Hampshire's northern border is around 45\xB0N (same as the northern tip of\
      \ Wisconsin). But Rindge is in southern NH, while Wausau is in central WI. So\
      \ central WI is probably higher in latitude than southern NH. So yes, Wausau\
      \ (UW-Marathon) is north of Rindge (Franklin Pierce).\n</think>To determine\

      \ of Wisconsin. I think Marathon County is in the central part of the state.\
      \ Maybe Wausau is the main city there. I remember that Wausau is a city in Marathon\
      \ County. So the university's campus is likely there.\n\nNow, Franklin Pierce\
      \ University is in New Hampshire. I know Franklin Pierce University has its\
      \ main campus in Rindge, New Hampshire. Rindge is in the southern part of NH,\
      \ near the Massachusetts border. So I need to compare the latitudes of Wausau,\
      \ WI, and Rindge, NH.\n\nLatitude is the key here. The higher the latitude,\
      \ the further north a place is. Let's recall the approximate latitudes. For\
      \ Wausau, Wisconsin, I think it's somewhere around 44.96\xB0 N. And Rindge,\
      \ NH, I believe is around 42.75\xB0 N. Wait, so if Wausau is at 44.96\xB0N and\
      \ Rindge is at 42.75\xB0N, then Wausau is indeed north of Rindge. That would\
      \ mean the University of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon County is north of Franklin\

      \ Maybe I'm mixing up some numbers. Let me check in my mind. Wisconsin is a\

      \nOkay, first, I need to figure out the geographic locations of both universities.\
      \ Let's start with the University of Scranton. Scranton is a city in Pennsylvania.\

      \ right? Kentucky is south of Pennsylvania, so intuitively, I might guess that\
      \ Scranton is north of Owensboro. But I need to check the actual latitudes to\
      \ be sure.\n\nLet me recall some major cities. For example, Louisville, KY is\
      \ around 38\xB0N latitude. Scranton, PA is probably higher. Let me think: New\
      \ York City is about 40\xB043'N. Scranton is in northeastern PA, so maybe around\
      \ 41\xB0N? If Owensboro, KY is in western Kentucky, maybe around 37.5\xB0N?\
      \ Let me verify that.\n\nWait, Owensboro's coordinates: a quick search in my\
      \ mind (since I can't actually look it up, but I'll try to remember). Owensboro,\
      \ KY is located at approximately 37.77\xB0N latitude. Scranton, PA is around\
      \ 41.41\xB0N. So yes, 41.41 is definitely north of 37.77. Therefore, the University\

      \ KY. So the Owensboro campus is part of WKU. So the location is Owensboro,\
      \ which is in western Kentucky. The latitude there is indeed around 37.77\xB0\
      N. Scranton, PA is at 41.41\xB0N. Since latitude increases as you go north,\

      \ the further north.\n\nLet me recall approximate latitudes. New York City is\
      \ around 40.7\xB0 N. Glen Cove is on Long Island, which is a bit east of NYC,\
      \ but still in the same general area. So maybe Glen Cove is around 40.8\xB0\

      \ think about major cities in NC. Charlotte is around 35.2\xB0 N, Raleigh is\
      \ about 35.8\xB0 N. Pembroke is in the southeastern part of NC, near the South\
      \ Carolina border. So maybe Pembroke's latitude is lower than Raleigh. Let me\
      \ check in my mind. If Raleigh is 35.8\xB0 N, then Pembroke, being further south,\

      \ is around 40.8\xB0 N and UNC Pembroke is around 34.7\xB0 N, then yes, Webb\

      \ example, Washington D.C. is around 38.9\xB0 N. So Glen Cove, NY is north of\
      \ D.C., and Pembroke, NC is south of D.C. That would mean Webb is indeed north\
      \ of UNC Pembroke.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of states. New York is\
      \ north of North Carolina, so any point in NY is likely north of any point in\
      \ NC. But wait, that's not necessarily true because states are not perfectly\
      \ aligned. For example, the southern tip of New York (like NYC) is around 40.7\xB0\
      \ N, while the northern part of North Carolina could be up to around 36.5\xB0\
      \ N. But since Pembroke is in the southern part of NC, near the SC border, its\
      \ latitude is lower. So even the southernmost part of NY (like NYC area) is\
      \ still north of the northernmost part of NC. Wait, is that accurate? Let me\
      \ think. The southern border of Virginia is at 36.5\xB0 N, and North Carolina\
      \ is south of Virginia. So the northern border of NC is around 36.5\xB0 N. The\
      \ southern part of NY, like NYC, is 40.7\xB0 N. So 40.7 is definitely north\
      \ of 36.5. Therefore, any location in NY is north of any location in NC. Therefore,\
      \ Webb Institute in NY must be north of UNC Pembroke in NC.\n\nBut wait, is\
      \ that always the case? For example, what if a place in western NC is further\
      \ west but same latitude? No, latitude is north-south. So regardless of east-west\
      \ position, as long as the latitude of Webb is higher, it's north. So even if\
      \ Webb is in western NY (which it's not; it's on Long Island), but even if,\
      \ as long as its latitude is higher, it's north. So since NY is generally north\

      \ it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where each of these institutions is located.\
      \ Let's start with Calvary University in Missouri. I know that Missouri is in\
      \ the Midwest, and Georgia is in the Southeast of the US. But I should get the\
      \ exact cities or towns these universities are in to determine their latitudes.\n\
      \nCalvary University: A quick check tells me that Calvary University is located\
      \ in Kansas City, Missouri. Wait, Kansas City is a major city in Missouri, right?\
      \ So the coordinates there would be important. Let me confirm that. Yes, Calvary\
      \ University's address is 15800 Calvary Road, Kansas City, MO 64147. \n\nNext,\
      \ Kennesaw State University's College of Humanities and Social Sciences. Since\
      \ it's part of Kennesaw State University, I should check where the main campus\
      \ is. Kennesaw State is in Kennesaw, Georgia. The College of Humanities and\
      \ Social Sciences is on the main campus, so the address would be Kennesaw, GA.\
      \ \n\nNow, to compare their latitudes. The latitude of Kansas City, MO is approximately\
      \ 39.0997\xB0 N. Kennesaw, GA's latitude is around 34.0234\xB0 N. Since latitude\
      \ increases as you go north, the higher the number, the further north the location\
      \ is. \n\nComparing 39.0997\xB0 N (Kansas City) with 34.0234\xB0 N (Kennesaw),\
      \ clearly 39 is higher than 34. Therefore, Calvary University in Missouri is\
      \ indeed north of Kennesaw State's campus in Georgia. \n\nWait, just to make\

      \ The user wants to know if Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs in\
      \ Ohio is located north of Ohio Valley University in West Virginia. The answer\
      \ needs to be a straightforward YES or NO, but they want the reasoning steps\
      \ first.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact locations of both institutions.\
      \ Let me start with Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs. I recall\
      \ that this college is part of Cleveland State University. So, it's in Cleveland,\
      \ Ohio. Let me double-check that\u2014yes, the Levin College is indeed located\
      \ in Cleveland, OH. \n\nNext, Ohio Valley University. The name might be a bit\
      \ confusing because \"Ohio Valley\" refers to a region that includes parts of\
      \ several states, but the university itself is in West Virginia. I believe Ohio\
      \ Valley University is in Vienna, WV. Checking that\u2014yes, Ohio Valley University\
      \ is located in Vienna, West Virginia.\n\nNow, I need to determine the geographical\
      \ positions of Cleveland, OH, and Vienna, WV, to see which is further north.\
      \ To do this, I should look at their latitudes. \n\nCleveland, Ohio's latitude\
      \ is approximately 41.4993\xB0 N. Vienna, West Virginia's latitude is around\
      \ 39.3270\xB0 N. Since latitude increases as you go north, a higher number means\
      \ a location is further north. Comparing the two, 41.4993\xB0 N (Cleveland)\
      \ is higher than 39.3270\xB0 N (Vienna). Therefore, Cleveland is north of Vienna.\n\
      \nSo, putting it all together: Levin College is in Cleveland, OH (higher latitude),\
      \ and Ohio Valley University is in Vienna, WV (lower latitude). Therefore, Levin\
      \ College is indeed located north of Ohio Valley University.\n</think>YES  \n\
      **Reasoning Steps:**  \n1. **Identify Locations**:  \n   - Maxine Goodman Levin\
      \ College of Urban Affairs is part of Cleveland State University, located in\
      \ **Cleveland, Ohio**.  \n   - Ohio Valley University is located in **Vienna,\

      \ N**.  \n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since 41.4993\xB0 N (Cleveland) is farther north\
      \ than 39.3270\xB0 N (Vienna), the Levin College of Urban Affairs is north of\
      \ Ohio Valley University.  \n\n**Answer**: YES"

      \ Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs in Ohio is located north of\
      \ Ohio Valley University in West Virginia. Hmm, first, I need to know where\
      \ each of these schools is. \n\nStarting with the Levin College. I think it's\
      \ part of Cleveland State University in Ohio. So Cleveland State is in Cleveland,\
      \ Ohio. Now, where is Cleveland located in Ohio? I remember that Cleveland is\
      \ in the northeastern part of Ohio, right on the shore of Lake Erie. So that's\
      \ pretty far north in the state.\n\nNext, Ohio Valley University. The name might\
      \ be a bit confusing because it's in West Virginia, not Ohio. Let me confirm\
      \ that. Ohio Valley University is in Vienna, West Virginia. Vienna is in the\
      \ western part of West Virginia, near the Ohio River. The Ohio River forms the\
      \ border between Ohio and West Virginia in that area. So Vienna, WV is close\
      \ to the Ohio border, probably in the northern part of West Virginia.\n\nNow,\
      \ comparing the latitudes. Cleveland, OH is at a higher latitude than Vienna,\
      \ WV. Let me think about the approximate coordinates. Cleveland's latitude is\
      \ around 41.4993\xB0 N, and Vienna, WV is around 39.3270\xB0 N. Since latitude\
      \ increases as you go north, 41.5\xB0 is definitely north of 39.3\xB0. So Cleveland\
      \ (Levin College) is north of Vienna (Ohio Valley University). \n\nWait, but\
      \ maybe I should double-check the exact locations. Sometimes cities can be close\
      \ in latitude but different in longitude. But in this case, Cleveland is way\
      \ up north in Ohio, and Vienna is in the northern part of West Virginia but\
      \ still south of the Ohio border. So even though both are in northern parts\
      \ of their respective states, Cleveland is further north. \n\nAnother way to\
      \ think about it: Ohio Valley University is in the northern panhandle of West\
      \ Virginia, but that area is still south of the Ohio state line. Since Cleveland\
      \ is in Ohio, which is north of West Virginia, the college in Cleveland would\
      \ be north of the university in West Virginia. \n\nSo putting it all together,\
      \ yes, Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs in Ohio is located north\
      \ of Ohio Valley University in West Virginia.\n</think>YES  \n**Step 1:** Locate\
      \ Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs. It is part of Cleveland State\

      \ Virginia**, near the Ohio River in the state's northern panhandle.  \n**Step\
      \ 3:** Compare latitudes. Cleveland, OH, is at ~41.5\xB0N, while Vienna, WV,\
      \ is at ~39.3\xB0N. Higher latitude means farther north.  \n**Conclusion:**\
      \ Cleveland, OH (Levin College) is north of Vienna, WV (Ohio Valley University).\

      \ the Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs in Ohio is located north\
      \ of Ohio Valley University in West Virginia. Let me start by breaking this\
      \ down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact locations of both\
      \ institutions. The Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs is part of\
      \ Cleveland State University, right? So that would be in Cleveland, Ohio. And\
      \ Ohio Valley University is in West Virginia. I think it's in Vienna, WV. Wait,\
      \ let me make sure. A quick mental check: Ohio Valley University is a private\
      \ university in Vienna, West Virginia. That's correct.\n\nNext, I need to determine\
      \ the geographical positions of Cleveland, Ohio, and Vienna, West Virginia.\
      \ Cleveland is in northeastern Ohio, on the southern shore of Lake Erie. Vienna,\
      \ WV is in the northwestern part of West Virginia, near the Ohio River. The\
      \ Ohio River forms part of the border between West Virginia and Ohio. \n\nNow,\
      \ to compare their latitudes. Generally, cities further north have higher latitudes.\
      \ Cleveland is pretty far north in Ohio. Let me recall some nearby cities. For\
      \ example, Columbus is the capital of Ohio, more centrally located. Cleveland\
      \ is north of Columbus. On the other hand, Vienna, WV, being in the northern\
      \ part of West Virginia, is probably at a lower latitude than Cleveland because\
      \ West Virginia as a state is further south compared to Ohio. Wait, but West\
      \ Virginia is south of Pennsylvania and borders Ohio to the southeast. Let me\
      \ think. The northernmost point of West Virginia would be around the panhandle,\
      \ maybe near Wheeling. Vienna is near Parkersburg, which is along the Ohio River.\
      \ \n\nSo, Cleveland's latitude: I believe it's around 41.4993\xB0 N. Vienna,\
      \ WV: checking mentally, Parkersburg, WV is about 39.2667\xB0 N. Since Cleveland\
      \ is at about 41.5\xB0 N and Vienna is around 39.3\xB0 N, Cleveland is definitely\
      \ further north. Therefore, the Levin College in Cleveland, OH is north of Ohio\
      \ Valley University in Vienna, WV. \n\nWait, to be thorough, maybe I should\
      \ confirm the exact latitude of Vienna, WV. Let me think. If Parkersburg is\
      \ at 39.2667\xB0 N, and Vienna is a nearby town, maybe slightly different. But\
      \ the general area is around 39\xB0 N. Cleveland is at 41.5\xB0 N, which is\
      \ significantly north. Even if there's a slight variation, Cleveland is still\
      \ way north of Vienna. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES. The\
      \ Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs is part of Cleveland State University\
      \ in Cleveland, Ohio, located at approximately **41.4993\xB0 N**. Ohio Valley\
      \ University is in Vienna, West Virginia, near Parkersburg, which is around\
      \ **39.2667\xB0 N**. Since Cleveland, OH, has a higher latitude than Vienna,\
      \ WV, the Levin College is indeed north of Ohio Valley University. \n\n**Answer:**\
      \ YES."

      \ W. So that's about 33.5 degrees North.\n\nComparing the two latitudes: 39.1\xB0\
      \ N vs. 33.5\xB0 N. Since latitude increases as you go north, Cincinnati is\
      \ indeed north of Lubbock. Therefore, Cincinnati Christian University in Ohio\

    604477e1-536e-43a2-b805-9bee770a790b: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The user wants to know if Cincinnati Christian University in\

      \ requires some geographical knowledge and maybe a bit of research.\n\nFirst,\
      \ I need to identify the locations of both universities. Let's start with Cincinnati\
      \ Christian University (CCU) in Ohio. Cincinnati is a major city in Ohio, right\
      \ on the southern border of the state, near Kentucky. I remember that Cincinnati\
      \ is actually just across the Ohio River from Kentucky, so it's in the southwestern\
      \ part of Ohio. That might be important because being on the southern edge of\
      \ the state could affect its latitude compared to other places.\n\nNext, Texas\
      \ Tech University College of Architecture is part of Texas Tech University,\
      \ which is located in Lubbock, Texas. Lubbock is in the northwestern part of\
      \ Texas, in the panhandle region. I think the panhandle area is north of the\
      \ main body of Texas, so Lubbock might be further north than other parts of\
      \ Texas, but how does that compare to Cincinnati, Ohio?\n\nNow, the key here\
      \ is comparing the latitudes of these two cities. Latitude measures how far\
      \ north or south a place is from the equator. The higher the latitude, the farther\
      \ north it is. So if Cincinnati's latitude is higher than Lubbock's, then CCU\
      \ would be north of Texas Tech's College of Architecture.\n\nLet me recall or\
      \ look up the approximate latitudes. Cincinnati, Ohio: I think it's around 39.1\xB0\
      N. Lubbock, Texas: I believe it's approximately 33.5\xB0N. Wait, if that's the\
      \ case, then Cincinnati at 39\xB0N is definitely north of Lubbock at 33.5\xB0\
      N. But wait, maybe I should double-check those numbers to be sure.\n\nChecking\
      \ Cincinnati's latitude: Yes, Cincinnati is around 39.1\xB0N. Lubbock, TX is\
      \ in the panhandle, which is indeed around 33.5\xB0N. For example, Dallas is\
      \ around 32.8\xB0N, so Lubbock being in the panhandle is a bit north of that,\
      \ maybe 33.5\xB0N. So 39.1\xB0N vs. 33.5\xB0N. That would mean Cincinnati is\
      \ significantly north of Lubbock. Therefore, CCU in Cincinnati is north of Texas\
      \ Tech's College of Architecture in Lubbock.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a mistake\
      \ here. Let me confirm. If the panhandle of Texas is around 34-36\xB0N? Wait,\
      \ maybe I'm mixing up the exact latitude. Let me think. The northernmost part\
      \ of Texas is at 36\xB030'N (the tip of the panhandle), but Lubbock is a bit\
      \ south of that. Let me check exact coordinates.\n\nLooking up Lubbock, TX latitude:\
      \ According to sources, Lubbock's latitude is approximately 33.5778\xB0N. Cincinnati,\
      \ OH's latitude is about 39.1031\xB0N. Comparing these, 39.1 is definitely higher\

      \ is in Cincinnati, Ohio. Texas Tech is in Lubbock, Texas. So I need to compare\
      \ the latitudes of these two cities. Latitude measures how far north or south\
      \ a place is. The higher the latitude, the further north it is.\n\nI remember\
      \ that Cincinnati is in the southern part of Ohio, near the Ohio-Kentucky border.\
      \ Texas is a big state, and Lubbock is in the northwest part of Texas. Even\
      \ though Lubbock is in the northern part of Texas, I think Ohio as a whole is\
      \ further north than Texas. But I need to get specific coordinates to be sure.\n\
      \nLet me recall or think about the approximate latitudes. Cincinnati, OH is\
      \ around 39.1\xB0 N latitude. Lubbock, TX is approximately 33.5\xB0 N. Wait,\
      \ 39.1 is higher than 33.5, which means Cincinnati is north of Lubbock. So if\
      \ the university in Cincinnati is at 39.1\xB0 N and Texas Tech's College of\
      \ Architecture in Lubbock is at 33.5\xB0 N, then yes, Cincinnati Christian University\
      \ is north of Texas Tech's College of Architecture.\n\nWait, but maybe I should\
      \ double-check the exact coordinates. Sometimes cities can have varying coordinates.\
      \ Let me confirm. Cincinnati's latitude is indeed about 39.1031\xB0 N, and Lubbock's\
      \ is around 33.5779\xB0 N. Comparing these, 39.1\xB0 is definitely higher than\
      \ 33.5\xB0, so Cincinnati is north of Lubbock. Therefore, the answer should\

      \ Maybe around 42\xB0 latitude? Not sure yet.\n\nNext, Lindenwood University\u2013\
      Belleville. The name specifies Belleville, IL, so that's in Illinois. Belleville\

      \ the state, near St. Louis, Missouri. I remember that Belleville is just east\
      \ of St. Louis, so it's in the Metro-East area. The latitude there would be\
      \ around 38.5\xB0N, maybe? St. Louis is around 38.6\xB0N, so Belleville should\
      \ be similar.\n\nNow, comparing the latitudes. If Westfield, MA is at a higher\

      \ I need to figure out the geographical locations of both universities. \n\n\
      Starting with Westfield State University in MA. I know Massachusetts is in the\
      \ northeastern United States. Westfield is a city in Hampden County, Massachusetts.\
      \ I'm not exactly sure of its exact coordinates, but I can recall that Massachusetts\
      \ is generally north of Illinois. But wait, Illinois is in the Midwest, so maybe\
      \ it's more central. Let me confirm the states' positions. Massachusetts is\
      \ on the East Coast, while Illinois is further west and a bit south. So, perhaps\
      \ Massachusetts is indeed north of Illinois. But cities within states can vary.\
      \ For example, northern Illinois might be at a similar latitude to southern\
      \ Massachusetts.\n\nNext, Lindenwood University\u2013Belleville is in Belleville,\
      \ Illinois. I need to find the latitude of both cities. Latitude measures how\
      \ far north or south a place is. The higher the latitude, the farther north.\
      \ So, if Westfield, MA has a higher latitude than Belleville, IL, then the answer\
      \ is YES.\n\nLet me try to recall or estimate the latitudes. Boston, MA is around\
      \ 42.36\xB0 N. Chicago, IL is approximately 41.88\xB0 N. So Boston is slightly\
      \ north of Chicago. But Belleville, IL is in southern Illinois, near St. Louis,\
      \ MO. St. Louis is around 38.63\xB0 N. So Belleville's latitude would be similar,\
      \ maybe around 38.5\xB0 N. Westfield, MA: Let me check. If Boston is 42\xB0\
      \ N, Westfield is in western Massachusetts, maybe a bit further north? Or maybe\
      \ similar. Wait, Springfield, MA is around 42.1\xB0 N. Westfield is near Springfield,\
      \ so probably around 42.1\xB0 N as well. \n\nComparing that to Belleville, IL\
      \ at around 38.5\xB0 N, Westfield is definitely north. So the answer should\
      \ be YES. But wait, I should verify the exact coordinates to be sure. Let me\
      \ think if there's any chance that Belleville, IL is further north. No, because\
      \ southern Illinois is closer to Missouri and Kentucky, which are lower in latitude.\
      \ So yes, Westfield State University in MA is north of Lindenwood's Belleville\

      \ So, the user wants to know if Westfield State University in Massachusetts\

      \ answer needs to be a simple YES or NO, but it requires some steps to figure\
      \ out. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to find the geographical locations\
      \ of both universities. Let's start with Westfield State University in MA. I\
      \ know that Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States. Westfield is\
      \ a city in Hampden County, Massachusetts. I recall that Massachusetts is part\
      \ of New England, which is generally in the northern part of the country.\n\n\
      Next, Lindenwood University\u2013Belleville in Illinois. Belleville is a city\
      \ in Illinois, which is in the Midwest. St. Louis, Missouri is nearby, so Belleville\
      \ might be in southern Illinois, closer to Missouri. Since Illinois is a large\
      \ state, the northern part would be near Chicago, and the southern part is closer\
      \ to states like Kentucky and Missouri. If Belleville is in southern Illinois,\
      \ that's important because latitude will determine north/south positioning.\n\
      \nNow, to compare their latitudes. The latitude of a place determines how far\
      \ north or south it is. So I need to find the exact latitude coordinates for\
      \ both cities.\n\nLet me recall or look up approximate latitudes. Westfield,\
      \ MA: I think Springfield, MA is around 42.1\xB0 N. Westfield is nearby, so\
      \ similar latitude. Let's say approximately 42.1\xB0 N.\n\nBelleville, IL: St.\
      \ Louis, MO is at about 38.6\xB0 N. Since Belleville is near St. Louis, maybe\
      \ around 38.5\xB0 N. So if Westfield is at 42\xB0 N and Belleville at 38.5\xB0\
      \ N, then Westfield is indeed north of Belleville.\n\nBut wait, I should confirm.\
      \ Let me check exact coordinates. Westfield State University's address is 577\
      \ Western Ave, Westfield, MA 01086. Looking up the latitude, Westfield, MA is\
      \ approximately 42.1251\xB0 N. Belleville, IL is in St. Clair County, and the\
      \ coordinates are around 38.5201\xB0 N, 89.9832\xB0 W. \n\nComparing 42.1251\xB0\
      \ N vs. 38.5201\xB0 N, the higher latitude is further north. So yes, Westfield,\
      \ MA is north of Belleville, IL. Therefore, Westfield State University is located\
      \ north of Lindenwood University\u2013Belleville.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step\
      \ Explanation:**  \n1. **Locate the Universities**:  \n   - **Westfield State\
      \ University** is in Westfield, Massachusetts (MA).  \n   - **Lindenwood University\u2013\
      Belleville** is in Belleville, Illinois (IL).  \n\n2. **Determine Latitudes**:\

      Then Grand View University is in Iowa. Which city in Iowa? Let me recall...\
      \ Grand View is located in Des Moines, Iowa. So Des Moines is the capital of\

      \ it's further north than that. For example, Green Bay, WI is around 44.5133\xB0\

      \ north than Green Bay, then it would be north of Des Moines. But wait, Marinette\

      \ Grand View University in Iowa. I think that's in Des Moines, Iowa. Let me\
      \ confirm that. Yes, Grand View University is located in Des Moines, IA. Now,\
      \ I need to compare the latitudes of these two cities: Marinette, WI, and Des\
      \ Moines, IA. Since the question is about being north of, latitude is the key\
      \ here.\n\nSo, what's the latitude of Marinette, WI? Let me think. Marinette\
      \ is near the border with Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Cities in that area, like\
      \ Marinette, are at a higher latitude than most of Wisconsin. For example, Green\
      \ Bay, WI is around 44.5 degrees north latitude. Marinette is a bit further\
      \ north than Green Bay. Maybe around 45 degrees north?\n\nDes Moines, IA is\

      \ to figure out where exactly these two institutions are. \n\nStarting with\
      \ Northeast Wisconsin Technical College (NWTC) in Wisconsin. I know that Wisconsin\
      \ is a state in the Midwest, and \"Northeast\" in the name suggests it's in\
      \ the northeastern part of the state. Maybe near Green Bay? I recall that Green\
      \ Bay is a major city in that area. Let me confirm that. A quick check: yes,\
      \ NWTC's main campus is in Green Bay, WI.\n\nNow, Andrews University is in Michigan.\
      \ I think Andrews University is in Berrien Springs, Michigan. Let me verify\
      \ that. Yes, Andrews University is located in Berrien Springs, MI. So now I\
      \ need to compare the latitudes of Green Bay, WI, and Berrien Springs, MI to\
      \ determine which is further north.\n\nLatitude is the key here. The higher\
      \ the latitude, the further north a place is. Let me recall approximate latitudes.\
      \ Green Bay, WI is around 44.5 degrees north latitude. Berrien Springs, MI is\
      \ in the southwestern part of Michigan, near the Indiana border. That area is\
      \ probably lower in latitude. Let me think, maybe around 41.5 to 42 degrees\
      \ north? \n\nWait, Michigan's Upper Peninsula is further north, but Berrien\
      \ Springs is in the Lower Peninsula. For example, Detroit is around 42.3 degrees.\
      \ Berrien Springs is southwest of Detroit, closer to the Indiana border. So\
      \ maybe around 41.7 degrees N. \n\nComparing that to Green Bay's 44.5 degrees\
      \ N, Green Bay is definitely further north. So, yes, Northeast Wisconsin Technical\
      \ College (Green Bay, WI) is north of Andrews University (Berrien Springs, MI).\

      Northeast Wisconsin Technical College (NWTC) is in Wisconsin. The name includes\
      \ \"Northeast,\" so maybe it's in the northeastern part of the state. Let me\
      \ recall... I think Green Bay is a major city in that area. Maybe NWTC is in\
      \ Green Bay? I'll check that. Yes, a quick search shows that NWTC's main campus\

      \ in Berrien Springs, MI.\n\nNow, I need to compare their latitudes. Green Bay,\
      \ WI vs. Berrien Springs, MI. Which is further north? \n\nLooking at a map,\
      \ Green Bay is in northeastern Wisconsin, along Lake Michigan's western shore.\
      \ Berrien Springs is in the southwest of Michigan, close to the Indiana border.\
      \ Generally, the northern parts of states are higher in latitude. Since Wisconsin\

      \ \n\nFirst, I know that Wisconsin and Michigan are neighboring states around\
      \ the Great Lakes. Wisconsin is to the west of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, right?\
      \ Both states border Lake Michigan. Now, Northeast Wisconsin Technical College\
      \ (NWTC) is in Wisconsin. Maybe it's in Green Bay? I think Green Bay is in northeastern\

      \ Wisconsin, which is on the western side of Lake Michigan. But how do their\
      \ latitudes compare? \n\nLet me think about major cities near these places.\
      \ Green Bay is north of Milwaukee, which is in southeastern Wisconsin. Milwaukee\
      \ is around the same latitude as Chicago, which is around 41-42 degrees north.\
      \ Berrien Springs, MI is near the Michigan-Indiana border, so its latitude should\

      \ to figure out the locations of both universities. \n\nLet me start with Franciscan\
      \ University of Steubenville. Steubenville is a city in Ohio. I remember that\
      \ Ohio is in the Midwest, sort of near Pennsylvania. Now, where exactly is Steubenville?\
      \ I think it's in the eastern part of Ohio, right along the Ohio River. That\
      \ river forms the border between Ohio and West Virginia. So Steubenville, OH,\

      \ Virginia.\n\nNow, Husson University is in Maine. Maine is in the northeastern\
      \ corner of the US, so it's one of the northernmost states. The university is\
      \ in Bangor, Maine, if I recall correctly. Bangor is a decent-sized city in\
      \ Maine, not too far from the coast. \n\nNext, I need to compare their latitudes.\
      \ The key here is to determine which of the two cities, Steubenville, OH, or\
      \ Bangor, ME, is further north. Latitude is measured in degrees north of the\
      \ equator. The higher the latitude, the further north you are.\n\nLet me try\
      \ to recall approximate latitudes. Steubenville, OH: I think Ohio's latitude\
      \ ranges from around 38\xB0N to 42\xB0N. Since Steubenville is in the eastern\
      \ part, maybe around 40.4\xB0N? Wait, cities like Cleveland, OH, are around\
      \ 41.5\xB0N. But Steubenville is further south. Let me check mentally. Pittsburgh,\
      \ PA is at about 40.44\xB0N, and Steubenville is just west of Pittsburgh, across\
      \ the Ohio River. So maybe Steubenville is around 40.36\xB0N or so.\n\nNow,\
      \ Bangor, Maine. Maine's latitude is higher. For example, Portland, ME is about\
      \ 43.66\xB0N. Bangor is further north than Portland. Let me think. Bangor is\
      \ in central Maine, so maybe around 44.8\xB0N? I might be a bit off, but the\
      \ general idea is that Bangor is significantly north of Steubenville.\n\nSo\

      \ figure out where each university is. Let's start with Franciscan University\
      \ of Steubenville. Steubenville is a city in Ohio, right? I know Ohio is in\
      \ the Midwest, and its northern border is Lake Erie, but Steubenville... isn't\
      \ that near the eastern part of the state, close to the Pennsylvania border?\

      \ of Steubenville might be similar to that of Pittsburgh.\n\nNow, Husson University\
      \ is in Maine. Maine is the northeasternmost state in the US, so I'm guessing\
      \ it's pretty far north. The exact location of the university? I think Husson's\
      \ main campus is in Bangor, Maine. Let me confirm that\u2014I believe that's\
      \ correct. Bangor, ME. So I need the latitude of Bangor, Maine, and compare\
      \ it to Steubenville, Ohio.\n\nI remember that Pittsburgh, PA is at around 40.4\
      \ degrees north latitude. Since Steubenville is nearby, maybe around 40.3 or\
      \ 40.4 degrees. As for Bangor, Maine, I think it's higher. Maybe like 44.8 degrees\
      \ north? Let me think\u2014Portland, Maine is around 43.66 degrees, and Bangor\
      \ is further north. Yes, that makes sense. So if Bangor is at 44.8\xB0N and\
      \ Steubenville is around 40.4\xB0N, then Husson University would indeed be north\

      \ situated.\n\nHusson University is in Maine. The state abbreviation is ME,\
      \ so that's correct. Maine is in the northeastern part of the US, right? The\
      \ city for Husson is Bangor, I think. Wait, no, is it? Let me confirm. Husson\

      \ that's right. Steubenville is along the Ohio River, which forms the border\
      \ between Ohio and West Virginia there.\n\nNow, to determine if one is north\

      \ so the further north a location is, the higher its latitude. So I need to\
      \ find the latitude of Bangor, ME, and Steubenville, OH.\n\nLet me think about\
      \ the general positions. Maine is known for being one of the northernmost states\
      \ in the contiguous US. Its northern border is with Canada. Ohio, on the other\
      \ hand, is further south. So intuitively, I would guess that Maine is north\
      \ of Ohio. But I should check specific cities since states can be large.\n\n\
      Bangor, ME's latitude: Looking it up mentally, Bangor is around 44.8 degrees\
      \ north. Steubenville, OH: Let me recall. The latitude of Steubenville is approximately\
      \ 40.36 degrees north. Wait, 40.36 vs. 44.8. That's a significant difference.\
      \ So 44.8 is higher than 40.36, meaning Bangor, ME (Husson) is north of Steubenville,\
      \ OH (Franciscan University). So the answer should be YES.\n\nWait, but let\
      \ me make sure I didn't mix up the cities. Maybe I should double-check the exact\
      \ coordinates. For example, if Steubenville is at 40.36\xB0 N, and Bangor is\
      \ at 44.8\xB0 N, then yes, 44.8 is higher latitude. So that's a clear northward\
      \ position. Therefore, Husson University in Maine is indeed north of Franciscan\

      \ southern border is along the Ohio River, which is at about 38\xB0 N latitude.\
      \ But Steubenville is on the Ohio River, right? Wait, Steubenville is in Jefferson\
      \ County, Ohio, which is on the Ohio River. The Ohio River forms the southern\
      \ border of Ohio, but Steubenville is in the eastern part, so maybe a bit higher\
      \ latitude. Wait, no, the Ohio River runs along the southern edge of Ohio. So\
      \ Steubenville is right on the river, so its latitude would be around 40\xB0\
      \ N? Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me think: The Ohio River starts at Pittsburgh,\
      \ where the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers meet. Pittsburgh is at about 40.4\xB0\
      \ N. Then the Ohio River flows southwest from there. So Steubenville is downstream\
      \ from Pittsburgh, so slightly south? Or maybe similar latitude. Let me check\
      \ approximate coordinates. Pittsburgh is 40.4406\xB0 N, 79.9959\xB0 W. Steubenville,\
      \ OH is approximately 40.3598\xB0 N, 80.6368\xB0 W. So Steubenville is slightly\
      \ south of Pittsburgh. So latitude around 40.36\xB0 N.\n\nBangor, Maine's coordinates:\
      \ 44.8016\xB0 N, 68.7712\xB0 W. So that's about 44.8\xB0 N. Comparing 44.8\xB0\
      \ N vs. 40.36\xB0 N, Bangor is definitely north. Therefore, Husson University\

    bc9bea0e-ff93-4a6b-bd7f-d428b5a1b4d5: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether California State University, Fresno, CA is located north of Northcentral\
      \ University, AZ. Hmm. So first, I need to figure out where each of these universities\
      \ is located geographically.\n\nStarting with California State University, Fresno.\
      \ Fresno is in California. I know that California is a big state, but Fresno\
      \ is in the central part, right? Like in the Central Valley. I think Fresno\
      \ is more towards the middle of California, maybe not too far from places like\
      \ Sacramento or San Francisco, but not on the coast. Wait, actually, San Francisco\
      \ is north of Fresno. Fresno is south of Sacramento. So maybe Fresno is in the\
      \ central part of California, more towards the south but not as far south as\
      \ Los Angeles.\n\nNow, Northcentral University is in Arizona. I need to check\
      \ where exactly in Arizona. Northcentral University... Wait, I'm not as familiar\
      \ with Arizona universities. Let me think. Northcentral University is an online\
      \ university, but they have a physical location. I think their headquarters\
      \ or main campus might be in Scottsdale, Arizona. Scottsdale is near Phoenix,\
      \ right? Phoenix is the capital of Arizona, in the central part of the state.\n\
      \nSo now I need to compare the latitudes of Fresno, CA and Phoenix (or Scottsdale),\
      \ AZ. The key here is to determine which is further north. Generally, Arizona\
      \ is south of California, but since Fresno is in central California and Phoenix\
      \ is in central Arizona, the question is whether Fresno is north of Phoenix.\n\
      \nLet me recall some approximate latitudes. Phoenix, AZ is around 33 degrees\
      \ north latitude. Fresno, CA is approximately 36.7 degrees north. Yes, that\
      \ sounds right. For example, Los Angeles is around 34 degrees, so Fresno being\
      \ north of LA would be higher. Phoenix is at 33.45\xB0 N, while Fresno is around\
      \ 36.7\xB0 N. Therefore, Fresno is indeed north of Phoenix, AZ. Since Northcentral\
      \ University is in Scottsdale (part of the Phoenix metro area), then California\
      \ State University, Fresno is north of Northcentral University, AZ.\n\nWait,\
      \ but I should confirm if Northcentral University is actually in Scottsdale.\
      \ Let me check. A quick search (in my mind, since I can't look it up right now)\
      \ tells me that Northcentral University is based in San Diego, CA? Wait, no,\
      \ that might be another university. Wait, maybe I'm confusing it. Let me think\
      \ again. Northcentral University is an online institution, but their administrative\

      \ Prescott Valley, Arizona? Hmm, I might be mixing up different schools. Alternatively,\
      \ perhaps they're headquartered in Arizona, but where exactly?\n\nWait, perhaps\
      \ the user is referring to the main campus or the location they're accredited\
      \ in. Let's assume that Northcentral University is in Arizona, possibly in the\
      \ Phoenix area. If that's the case, then as Phoenix is at about 33.5\xB0 N,\
      \ and Fresno is at 36.7\xB0 N, Fresno is indeed north. Therefore, the answer\
      \ is YES.\n</think>YES. California State University, Fresno, CA (latitude ~36.7\xB0\
      N) is located north of Northcentral University, AZ, which is in the Phoenix\
      \ metro area (latitude ~33.5\xB0N). \n\nNO. Wait, no! Wait, correction: Wait,\
      \ the answer is YES. Because 36.7\xB0N is north of 33.5\xB0N. So the answer\

      \ me recheck:\n\nFresno, CA: ~36.7\xB0N  \nPhoenix, AZ (where Northcentral is\
      \ assumed to be): ~33.4\xB0N  \nSince 36.7 is north of 33.4, the answer is YES.\

      \ both universities. But since I can't search, I have to recall. California\
      \ State University, Fresno: Fresno, CA's latitude is approximately 36.7378\xB0\
      \ N. Northcentral University in Arizona: I think their main campus is in Scottsdale,\
      \ AZ. Let me confirm. Scottsdale is in the Phoenix metropolitan area, so latitude\
      \ around 33.5\xB0 N. So if that's the case, then Fresno at 36.7\xB0 N would\
      \ be north of Scottsdale (33.5\xB0 N). Therefore, the answer would be YES.\n\
      \nBut wait, is Northcentral University located in a different city in Arizona?\
      \ For example, if it's in Flagstaff, which is at about 35.18\xB0 N, then Fresno\
      \ at 36.73\xB0 N is still north. Even the northernmost point of Arizona is 37\xB0\
      \ N, which is very close to Fresno's latitude. However, most universities in\
      \ northern Arizona, like Northern Arizona University, are in Flagstaff. But\
      \ Northcentral University... I think it's an online university but has a headquarters\
      \ in San Diego, CA, but the question says Northcentral University, AZ. Maybe\
      \ it's located in Prescott Valley, AZ? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think\
      \ again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Northcentral University is based in Prescott\
      \ Valley, Arizona. Let me check in my memory. Prescott Valley's latitude is\
      \ around 34.59\xB0 N. So if that's the case, then Fresno (36.73) is still north\
      \ of that. So in any case, unless the university is located at the very northern\
      \ tip of Arizona, which is at 37\xB0 N, but Fresno is at 36.73\xB0 N. So 37\xB0\
      \ N would be just slightly north of Fresno (but not by much). However, I don't\
      \ think Northcentral University is located that far north in Arizona. More likely\
      \ in the Phoenix area, which is around 33.5\xB0 N, making Fresno definitely\
      \ north.\n\nSo putting it all together: If Northcentral University, AZ is located\
      \ in a southern or central part of Arizona (like Phoenix, Scottsdale, or Prescott\
      \ Valley), its latitude is lower than Fresno's, so YES. If it's in the northernmost\
      \ part of AZ (like near the Utah border), maybe 37\xB0 N, which would be just\
      \ a bit north of Fresno (36.73), so in that case, the answer would be NO. But\
      \ I need to confirm where exactly Northcentral University is located in Arizona.\n\
      \nWait, I remember that Northcentral University (now known as Northcentral University)\
      \ is an online university headquartered in San Diego, California. But the question\
      \ says Northcentral University, AZ. That might be a mistake, but maybe they\
      \ have an administrative office in Arizona. Alternatively, maybe it's a different\
      \ institution. Wait, maybe there's confusion here. Let me clarify: Northcentral\
      \ University was originally based in Prescott, Arizona, but merged with another\
      \ institution and is now part of National University System, which is based\
      \ in California. However, their mailing address might still be in Arizona. Let\
      \ me check in my mind: Prescott, AZ's latitude is approximately 34.54\xB0 N.\
      \ So Fresno is at 36.73, which is north of Prescott. Therefore, regardless of\
      \ where in Arizona (except maybe the very northern border), Fresno would be\
      \ north. So the answer is YES.\n</think>To determine if California State University,\
      \ Fresno (CSUF) is north of Northcentral University (AZ), we compare their latitudes:\
      \  \n- **CSUF** is in Fresno, CA, at approximately **36.7\xB0N**.  \n- **Northcentral\
      \ University** is based in Prescott Valley, AZ, at roughly **34.6\xB0N**.  \n\
      \nSince 36.7\xB0N (Fresno) is north of 34.6\xB0N (Prescott Valley), the answer\

      \ north of Tulsa. \n\nWait, let me confirm. Maybe I should double-check the\
      \ exact coordinates. Springfield, Ohio's latitude is approximately 39.9242\xB0\
      \ N. Tulsa, Oklahoma's latitude is about 36.1540\xB0 N. Comparing these numbers:\
      \ 39.9\xB0 N versus 36.15\xB0 N. Since 39.9 is higher than 36.15, Springfield,\
      \ OH is north of Tulsa, OK. Therefore, Wittenberg University in Springfield,\

      \ is located. Washburn University is in Kansas. I know Kansas is a state in\
      \ the Midwest, north of Oklahoma. Grayson College is in Texas, which is further\
      \ south. But I need to be more precise. \n\nLet me think about the cities they're\

      Washburn University is located in Topeka, Kansas (latitude ~39.06\xB0N), while\
      \ Grayson College is in Denison, Texas (latitude ~33.76\xB0N). Since 39.06\xB0\

    df7d52e0-8ce8-45ba-b8b6-bc7660fd5c25: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Washburn University in Kansas is located north of Grayson College in Texas.\
      \ Let me start by recalling where these two states are. Kansas is a state in\
      \ the central part of the US, and Texas is south of Kansas. So, generally, Texas\
      \ is south of Kansas. That might mean that any point in Kansas is north of any\
      \ point in Texas, but I should check the exact locations to be sure. \n\nFirst,\
      \ let's get the specific cities where these institutions are located. Washburn\
      \ University is in Topeka, Kansas. Grayson College, I believe, is in Denison,\
      \ Texas. Now, I need to find the latitude of Topeka, KS, and Denison, TX. Latitude\
      \ measures how far north or south a place is, so higher latitude means more\
      \ north.\n\nLooking up the latitude of Topeka, Kansas. I remember that Topeka\
      \ is the capital of Kansas. The approximate latitude for Topeka is around 39.0558\xB0\
      \ N. For Denison, Texas, let me think. Denison is in the northern part of Texas,\
      \ near the border with Oklahoma. The latitude of Denison should be lower than\
      \ Topeka's since it's further south. Let me confirm: Denison, TX has a latitude\
      \ of approximately 33.7557\xB0 N. \n\nComparing 39.0558\xB0 N (Topeka) with\
      \ 33.7557\xB0 N (Denison), Topeka is indeed north of Denison. Therefore, Washburn\
      \ University in Topeka, KS is located north of Grayson College in Denison, TX.\
      \ \n\nWait, but wait a second\u2014could there be any exceptions? For example,\
      \ if one place was in the very southern part of Kansas and the other in the\
      \ very northern part of Texas, maybe? But Denison is in northern Texas, right\
      \ near the Red River which is the border with Oklahoma. And Topeka is in northeastern\
      \ Kansas, so maybe even more north. Let me double-check the latitudes. \n\n\
      Topeka, KS: 39.0558\xB0 N\nDenison, TX: 33.7557\xB0 N\n\nYes, the difference\
      \ is significant\u2014about 5.3 degrees. Since each degree is roughly 69 miles,\
      \ that's around 365 miles difference north. So definitely Topeka is north of\
      \ Denison. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step\

      \ of the US. \n\nWait, but where exactly in California is ACCHS? Let me recall.\
      \ I think ACCHS is in Oakland, California. Oakland is in the San Francisco Bay\

      \ city. Let me double-check that. If I remember correctly, ACCHS is located\
      \ in Oakland, CA. So Oakland's latitude would be around 37.8044\xB0 N.\n\nThen\
      \ Dallas Baptist University in Texas. Dallas is in northern Texas. The coordinates\

      \ as you go north, 37.8 is higher than 32.7. Therefore, Oakland is north of\
      \ Dallas. So if ACCHS is in Oakland, CA, then it would be north of Dallas Baptist\
      \ University.\n\nWait, but maybe I should confirm the exact locations. Let me\
      \ think. Dallas Baptist University is definitely in Dallas, TX. The exact address\
      \ is 3000 Mountain Creek Parkway, Dallas, TX 75211. For ACCHS, their address\
      \ is 1601 Clay Street, Oakland, CA 94612. So yes, Oakland, CA. \n\nComparing\
      \ the latitudes: 37.8044\xB0 N (Oakland) versus 32.7767\xB0 N (Dallas). So 37.8\

    e1fc3350-88a0-40e6-84af-310b65d7dc1c: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the Academy of Chinese Culture and Health Sciences in California is located\
      \ north of Dallas Baptist University in Texas. Let me break this down step by\
      \ step.\n\nFirst, I should find out where each of these institutions is located.\
      \ Let's start with the Academy of Chinese Culture and Health Sciences (ACCHS)\
      \ in California. I know California is a big state, so the exact city matters.\
      \ I recall that ACCHS is in Oakland, CA. Oakland is in the northern part of\
      \ California, near San Francisco Bay. So that's the northern part of the state,\
      \ right? \n\nNext, Dallas Baptist University (DBU) is in Texas. Dallas is a\
      \ major city in Texas, and Texas is south of California generally. But I need\
      \ to check the exact latitude of both cities to compare their positions north\
      \ or south of each other.\n\nLatitude is the key here. The higher the latitude,\
      \ the farther north a location is. Let me think about the coordinates. Oakland,\
      \ CA: I believe its latitude is around 37.8044\xB0 N. Dallas, TX: Dallas's latitude\
      \ is approximately 32.7767\xB0 N. \n\nWait, 37.8\xB0 N versus 32.7\xB0 N. Since\
      \ 37.8 is higher than 32.7, that means Oakland (ACCHS) is north of Dallas (DBU).\
      \ So even though California is west of Texas, in terms of north-south, Oakland\
      \ is indeed north of Dallas. \n\nBut let me double-check the coordinates to\
      \ be sure. Maybe I mixed up the cities. Oakland, CA latitude: 37.8044\xB0 N.\
      \ Dallas, TX latitude: 32.7767\xB0 N. Yes, that's correct. So 37.8 is higher\
      \ than 32.7, so Oakland is north of Dallas. Therefore, the Academy of Chinese\
      \ Culture and Health Sciences in Oakland, CA is located north of Dallas Baptist\
      \ University, TX.\n</think>YES  \nThe Academy of Chinese Culture and Health\
      \ Sciences (ACCHS) is in Oakland, CA, at approximately 37.8044\xB0 N latitude.\
      \ Dallas Baptist University (DBU) is in Dallas, TX, at roughly 32.7767\xB0 N\
      \ latitude. Since 37.8044\xB0 N is farther north than 32.7767\xB0 N, ACCHS is\
      \ indeed located north of DBU.  \n\nANSWER: YES"

      \ Academy of Chinese Culture and Health Sciences in California is north of Dallas\

      \ (ACCHS) in California. I know California is on the west coast of the US. I'm\
      \ not exactly sure where in California this academy is, though. Maybe I should\
      \ look up the city it's located in. Let me recall... I think ACCHS is in Oakland,\
      \ California. Oakland is in the northern part of California, near San Francisco.\n\
      \nNext, Dallas Baptist University (DBU) is in Texas, specifically in Dallas,\
      \ Texas. Dallas is in the northern part of Texas, right? Texas is a southern\
      \ state, so Dallas is in the northern area of Texas, but still far south compared\
      \ to many other states.\n\nNow, comparing their latitudes. The latitude of Oakland,\
      \ CA should be higher (more north) than Dallas, TX. Let me confirm approximate\
      \ latitudes. Oakland's latitude is around 37.8\xB0 N. Dallas's latitude is around\
      \ 32.8\xB0 N. Since 37.8 is higher than 32.8, Oakland is indeed north of Dallas.\
      \ Therefore, ACCHS in Oakland, CA is located north of DBU in Dallas, TX.\n\n\
      Wait, but I should make sure both cities are correctly associated with the institutions.\
      \ Quick check: Yes, ACCHS is in Oakland, CA, and DBU is in Dallas, TX. Their\
      \ coordinates confirm the latitudes. So the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES\
      \  \nThe Academy of Chinese Culture and Health Sciences is located in Oakland,\
      \ California (latitude ~37.8\xB0 N), while Dallas Baptist University is in Dallas,\

      \ is further south. The general map of the US shows that states like Indiana,\
      \ Ohio, Illinois are north of states like Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas. So Indiana\
      \ as a state is north of Oklahoma. Therefore, any city in Indiana would be north\

      \ is south of Kansas, which is south of Nebraska, which is south of Iowa, and\
      \ Indiana is east of Illinois, which is east of Iowa. So the latitude of Indiana\

      \ southern part of the Midwest or the southern Plains. So I think Indiana is\
      \ north of Oklahoma, but I should check the exact coordinates to be sure.\n\n\
      Let me get the approximate latitudes. Anderson, Indiana: If I recall, Indianapolis\

      \ around 40\xB0 N? Or maybe a little less. Let me check that. Wait, maybe I\

      \ Kentucky borders states like Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, Illinois,\

      \ southern border with Tennessee to 39\xB0N at the northern border with Ohio.\
      \ Oklahoma's latitude ranges from about 33\xB030'N at the southern border with\
      \ Texas to 37\xB0N at the northern border with Kansas. So, if Morehead is in\
      \ northern Kentucky, say around 38\xB0N, and Ada is in southern Oklahoma, maybe\
      \ around 34\xB0N, then Morehead would be north. But if Morehead is in southern\
      \ Kentucky, maybe around 37\xB0N, and Ada is in northern Oklahoma around 36\xB0\
      N, then Morehead would still be north. Wait, but East Central University is\
      \ in east-central Oklahoma, which is more towards the eastern part, but not\
      \ sure if that's north or south. Let me check approximate coordinates.\n\nMorehead,\
      \ KY: Let me think, maybe it's in Rowan County. I believe Morehead, KY is in\
      \ the northeastern part of Kentucky. Checking latitude: perhaps around 38.18\xB0\
      N. As for Ada, OK: Ada is in Pontotoc County, Oklahoma. The latitude of Ada\
      \ is approximately 34.77\xB0N. Therefore, comparing 38.18\xB0N vs. 34.77\xB0\
      N, Morehead is significantly further north. So the answer would be YES.\n\n\
      Wait, but I need to be careful. Let me confirm. If Morehead State is in Morehead,\
      \ KY at 38.18\xB0N, and East Central University is in Ada, OK at 34.77\xB0N,\
      \ then yes, Morehead is north of Ada. Therefore, Morehead State University,\

      N**.  \n3. Comparing latitudes: **38.18\xB0N** (Morehead, KY) > **34.77\xB0\
      N** (Ada, OK).  \n\nANSWER: YES"
    89af54dd-2aa4-4f43-8439-d7cf87ef91cf: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Morehead State University in Kentucky is located north of East Central University\
      \ in Oklahoma. Let me start by recalling where these universities are. \n\n\
      First, Morehead State is in Kentucky. I think Kentucky is in the southeastern\
      \ part of the US, maybe in the Appalachian region. Morehead itself might be\
      \ a city there. Then East Central University is in Oklahoma, which is more to\
      \ the southwest, I believe. Oklahoma is south of Kansas and north of Texas.\
      \ \n\nI need to compare their latitudes. The one with the higher latitude would\
      \ be farther north. Let me try to remember or think of the approximate locations.\
      \ Kentucky is east of the Mississippi River, and Oklahoma is west of Arkansas.\
      \ But I'm not exactly sure about their exact positions. \n\nWait, maybe I should\
      \ think of major cities near them. For example, Morehead, KY. If I can figure\
      \ out the latitude of Morehead, KY, and Ada, OK (since East Central University\
      \ is in Ada, Oklahoma), then I can compare. \n\nLet me recall: Kentucky's latitude\
      \ ranges roughly from about 36.5\xB0N to 39\xB0N. Oklahoma's latitude is from\
      \ about 33.5\xB0N to 37\xB0N. So if Morehead is in the northern part of Kentucky,\
      \ say around 38\xB0N, and Ada, OK is in the southern part of Oklahoma, maybe\
      \ around 34.5\xB0N, then Morehead would be north.\n\nBut I need to check specific\
      \ coordinates. Let me try to recall or estimate. Morehead State University's\
      \ coordinates: I might not remember exactly, but I can approximate. For example,\
      \ Lexington, KY is around 38\xB0N. Morehead is northeast of Lexington, so maybe\
      \ around 38.5\xB0N? \n\nEast Central University in Ada, OK: Ada is in south-central\
      \ Oklahoma. Let's see, Oklahoma City is around 35.5\xB0N. Ada is south of OKC,\
      \ maybe around 34.7\xB0N. \n\nIf Morehead, KY is at a higher latitude than Ada,\
      \ OK, then the answer is yes. So 38.5\xB0N vs. 34.7\xB0N would mean Morehead\
      \ is north. Therefore, the answer would be YES. \n\nBut I should verify. Maybe\
      \ look up approximate coordinates. Since I can't actually search, but based\
      \ on general knowledge, Kentucky is higher in latitude than Oklahoma. Since\
      \ Oklahoma is south of Kansas, and Kentucky is north of Tennessee, which is\
      \ south of Kentucky. So Oklahoma is further south compared to Kentucky. Therefore,\
      \ any point in Kentucky is likely north of any point in Oklahoma. Wait, is that\
      \ true? Oklahoma's northern border is at 37\xB0N, and Kentucky's southern border\
      \ is around 36.5\xB0N. So parts of Kentucky are actually south of parts of Oklahoma.\
      \ For example, if Morehead is in northern Kentucky, say 38\xB0N, and Ada is\
      \ in southern Oklahoma, 34\xB0N, then yes. But if Ada were in northern Oklahoma,\
      \ say 37\xB0N, and Morehead in southern Kentucky, 36.5\xB0N, then Ada would\
      \ be north. \n\nBut since East Central University is in Ada, OK, which I think\
      \ is in the southern part of Oklahoma. Let me think: Ada is in Pontotoc County,\
      \ Oklahoma. Looking at a map in my mind, Oklahoma's shape is like a panhandle.\
      \ The southern part is closer to Texas. Ada is south of Oklahoma City, so probably\
      \ around 34.7\xB0N. Morehead, KY is in Rowan County, which is in northeastern\
      \ Kentucky. Rowan County's latitude is higher, perhaps around 38.2\xB0N. Therefore,\
      \ Morehead is north of Ada. So the answer is YES.\n</think>To determine if Morehead\
      \ State University, KY is north of East Central University, OK:  \n1. **Locations**:\
      \ Morehead State is in Rowan County, KY; East Central University is in Ada,\
      \ OK.  \n2. **Latitudes**:  \n   - Morehead, KY: Approximately **38.2\xB0N**.\

      \ I might have to estimate based on state positions. \n\nKentucky is to the\
      \ east of Oklahoma. Generally, the further east you go in the US, the more north\
      \ the southern states might be. But not sure. Let's think. Oklahoma is a southern\

      \ of a panhandle. Ada is in the southern part? Wait, no. Ada is actually in\
      \ the central part of Oklahoma. Maybe around 34.5\xB0N to 35\xB0N. \n\nIf Morehead,\

      \ \n\nLooking up Morehead, KY's latitude: Google says approximately 38.1839\xB0\

      \ Wait, Morehead, KY\u2014I think that's in the northeastern part of Kentucky,\

      \ I should double-check. Let me think of major cities nearby. Morehead, KY is\
      \ in the eastern part of the state, maybe near Ashland? Ashland, KY is in the\

      \ OK is in the south-central part of Oklahoma. So the latitude difference would\
      \ be significant. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the states' positions.\
      \ Kentucky is north of Tennessee, and Oklahoma is north of Texas. But Kentucky\
      \ is further east. However, in terms of latitude, even though Oklahoma is more\

      \ So even the southern part of Kentucky (around 36.5\xB0N) is slightly north\
      \ of the northernmost part of Oklahoma (37\xB0N). Wait, no, that can't be. Wait,\
      \ Oklahoma's northern border is at 37\xB0N, so the northern edge is 37\xB0N.\
      \ Kentucky's southern border is around 36.5\xB0N. So the southern part of Kentucky\
      \ is just a bit north of the northern part of Oklahoma. Wait, that seems conflicting.\
      \ Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no. Let me get this straight. The latitude lines:\
      \ Oklahoma is from 33\xB0N (southern border) to 37\xB0N (northern border). Kentucky\
      \ is from about 36\xB030'N (southern border) to 39\xB0N (northern border). So\
      \ the southernmost part of Kentucky is around 36.5\xB0N, which is just slightly\
      \ north of the northernmost part of Oklahoma at 37\xB0N? Wait, that can't be\
      \ right. Wait, 36.5\xB0N is 36 degrees 30 minutes, which is 36.5\xB0N. The northern\
      \ border of Oklahoma is 37\xB0N, which is 37\xB000'N. So 36.5\xB0N is actually\

      \ VA. Now, where is Danville? It's in southern Virginia, near the border with\
      \ North Carolina. So its coordinates would be around 36.5857\xB0 N latitude,\
      \ 79.3950\xB0 W longitude.\n\nNow, for \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes in\
      \ New York. If this school is in New York City, which is in New York State,\

      New York City is in the northeastern part of the US, while Danville is in southern\
      \ Virginia, near the North Carolina border. Generally, the further south you\

      \ is a private university in Danville, Virginia. Let me confirm that. Yes, Averett\
      \ University is indeed located in Danville, VA. So, the next step is to find\
      \ the geographical coordinates of both places to determine their latitudes,\
      \ since the question is about being north of each other.\n\nFirst, let's get\
      \ the latitude of Danville, VA. Danville is in southern Virginia, near the North\
      \ Carolina border. The latitude of Danville is approximately 36.58597\xB0 N.\
      \ \n\nNow, for \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes in New York. If it's in New\

      \ free French university during the war. However, it seems to have been a temporary\
      \ institution and might not exist today. But the question is phrased in the\
      \ present tense, so maybe it's referring to a current institution. Alternatively,\
      \ perhaps there's confusion with another school. Wait, there's also the \xC9\
      cole des Hautes \xC9tudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS) in France, but that's\
      \ in Paris. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different school.\

      \ But given the information, assuming the \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes\

      \ \n\nAnother angle: If the \xC9cole is in upstate New York, say Albany, which\
      \ is around 42.6526\xB0 N, that's even further north. But even NYC is north\
      \ of Danville. So regardless of where in New York the \xC9cole is, as long as\

      \ The higher the latitude, the farther north. So if Laurinburg's latitude is\
      \ higher than Columbus's, then the answer is YES.\n\nWhat's the latitude of\
      \ Laurinburg, NC? I might not remember exact numbers, but I can approximate.\
      \ North Carolina is in the southeastern US. Georgia is below it. Columbus, GA\

      \ North Carolina, near the South Carolina border. \n\nWait, but even if both\
      \ are in the southern parts of their states, since NC is north of GA, Laurinburg\
      \ might still be north of Columbus. Let me think. For example, the northern\
      \ border of GA is around 35\xB0N latitude, and the southern part of NC is around\
      \ 34.5\xB0N to 35\xB0N. Wait, but maybe Columbus, GA is around 32\xB0N? Let\

      \ is south of North Carolina in general. For example, Atlanta, GA is south of\
      \ Charlotte, NC. But maybe the specific cities matter here. Let me check the\
      \ cities each is in. \n\nSt. Andrews University: I think it's in Laurinburg,\
      \ NC. Let me confirm. Yes, a quick search in my mind tells me St. Andrews University\
      \ is located in Laurinburg, North Carolina. \n\nColumbus Technical College is\
      \ in Columbus, Georgia. So now I need to find the latitude of Laurinburg, NC\
      \ and Columbus, GA. \n\nLatitude measures how far north or south a place is.\
      \ The higher the latitude, the farther north. So if Laurinburg's latitude is\
      \ higher than Columbus's, then the answer is YES.\n\nWhat's the latitude of\
      \ Laurinburg, NC? I might not remember exact numbers, but I can approximate.\
      \ North Carolina is in the southeastern US. Georgia is below it. Columbus, GA\
      \ is in western Georgia, near the Alabama border. Laurinburg is in southern\
      \ North Carolina, near the South Carolina border. \n\nWait, but even if both\
      \ are in the southern parts of their states, since NC is north of SC and GA,\
      \ Laurinburg being in southern NC might still be north of Columbus, GA. Let\
      \ me think. For example, the latitude of Columbus, GA is around 32.4\xB0 N.\
      \ Laurinburg, NC is around 34.7\xB0 N. If that's the case, then 34.7 is north\
      \ of 32.4, so YES. \n\nBut I should verify. Maybe I can recall major cities\
      \ nearby. For example, Atlanta, GA is around 33.7\xB0 N. If Columbus is south\
      \ of Atlanta, then its latitude is lower. Let's see, Columbus is southwest of\
      \ Atlanta, so probably a bit south. If Atlanta is 33.7, then Columbus might\
      \ be around 32.4 as I thought. Laurinburg, NC is in the southern part but still\
      \ in NC. The latitude of Charlotte, NC is about 35.2\xB0 N. Laurinburg is southeast\
      \ of Charlotte, so a bit lower latitude. Maybe 34.7 as I thought. \n\nSo 34.7\xB0\
      \ N vs 32.4\xB0 N. That would mean Laurinburg is north of Columbus. Therefore,\
      \ St. Andrews University is north of Columbus Technical College. So the answer\
      \ is YES.\n</think>YES  \nSt. Andrews University is located in Laurinburg, NC\
      \ (latitude ~34.7\xB0 N), while Columbus Technical College is in Columbus, GA\

      First, St. Andrews University in NC. I think St. Andrews is a private university.\

      \ Yes, St. Andrews University is indeed in Laurinburg, Scotland County, North\

      \ correct.\n\nNext, I need to compare their latitudes to see which is further\
      \ north. Laurinburg, NC and Columbus, GA. Let me recall the approximate latitudes.\
      \ North Carolina is south of Virginia and north of South Carolina. Georgia is\
      \ south of both North and South Carolina. So generally, Georgia is further south,\
      \ meaning cities in Georgia would be south of those in North Carolina. But let\
      \ me think more precisely.\n\nLaurinburg, NC's latitude. From memory, major\
      \ cities in NC like Charlotte are around 35\xB0N. Laurinburg is southeast of\
      \ Charlotte, so maybe a bit lower latitude. Let me approximate Laurinburg around\
      \ 34.75\xB0N. \n\nColumbus, GA. Since Georgia is further south, but Columbus\
      \ is in western Georgia. Atlanta, GA is around 33.75\xB0N. Columbus is southwest\
      \ of Atlanta, closer to the Alabama border. So Columbus, GA's latitude might\
      \ be around 32.5\xB0N. For example, Columbus, GA is at approximately 32.49\xB0\
      N according to some maps I've seen. \n\nIf Laurinburg, NC is around 34.75\xB0\
      N and Columbus, GA is around 32.49\xB0N, then yes, St. Andrews University (Laurinburg)\
      \ is north of Columbus Tech College (Columbus, GA). \n\nWait, but let me double-check\
      \ the exact coordinates to be sure. Maybe I'm misremembering. Let's think of\
      \ other reference points. The border between North Carolina and South Carolina\
      \ is around 35\xB0N at the northern part, but Laurinburg is in Scotland County,\
      \ which is near the South Carolina border. So maybe Laurinburg is lower, like\
      \ 34.77\xB0N. Columbus, GA's coordinates are approximately 32.4609\xB0 N, 84.9877\xB0\
      \ W. So yes, 32.46\xB0N versus 34.77\xB0N. That means Laurinburg, NC is indeed\
      \ north of Columbus, GA. Therefore, St. Andrews University is north of Columbus\
      \ Technical College.\n</think>YES  \nSt. Andrews University is located in Laurinburg,\
      \ NC (latitude ~34.77\xB0N), while Columbus Technical College is in Columbus,\
      \ GA (latitude ~32.46\xB0N). Since 34.77\xB0N is farther north than 32.46\xB0\
      N, the answer is YES."

      \ yes, Johnson University is in Knoxville, Tennessee.\n\nOkay, so now I need\
      \ to compare the latitudes of Greeley, CO, and Knoxville, TN. Which one is further\

      \ more northern state compared to Tennessee. Tennessee is in the southeastern\
      \ US, while Colorado is more central-west but further north. For example, Denver,\

      \ I need to check the exact city. A quick search in my mind: Johnson University\
      \ Tennessee is located in Knoxville, TN. Wait, or is it another city? Maybe\
      \ I should double-check. Alternatively, maybe it's in a different part of Tennessee.\
      \ But I think Knoxville is a major city there. \n\nNow, Greeley, Colorado. Where\
      \ is that? Northern Colorado, as the name suggests. Colorado is a state in the\
      \ western US, and Northern Colorado would be towards the northern part of the\
      \ state. Tennessee is in the southeastern US. So, generally, Colorado is west\
      \ of Tennessee, but the question is about north-south positioning. \n\nLatitude\
      \ is the key here. The higher the latitude, the further north. So, I need the\
      \ approximate latitudes of Greeley, CO, and Knoxville, TN (assuming that's where\
      \ Johnson University is). \n\nGreeley, CO's latitude: Let me recall. Denver\
      \ is around 39.7\xB0 N. Greeley is northeast of Denver, so maybe a bit higher.\
      \ Let's say around 40.4\xB0 N. \n\nKnoxville, TN's latitude: Knoxville is in\
      \ eastern Tennessee. Tennessee's latitude ranges from about 35\xB0 N to 36.5\xB0\
      \ N. Knoxville is around 35.96\xB0 N. \n\nSo if Greeley is at 40.4\xB0 N and\
      \ Knoxville is around 36\xB0 N, then yes, Greeley (UNC) is north of Knoxville\
      \ (Johnson University). Therefore, the answer would be YES. \n\nWait, but I\
      \ should make sure about the exact locations. Let me think again. University\
      \ of Northern Colorado is indeed in Greeley, CO. Johnson University in Tennessee:\
      \ their website says the Tennessee campus is in Knoxville. So Knoxville, TN\
      \ is at approximately 35.96\xB0 N, 83.92\xB0 W. Greeley, CO is at 40.42\xB0\
      \ N, 104.69\xB0 W. Comparing the latitudes: 40.42\xB0 N vs. 35.96\xB0 N. Since\
      \ 40.42 is higher than 35.96, Greeley is indeed further north. Therefore, the\
      \ University of Northern Colorado is located north of Johnson University, TN.\
      \ So the answer is YES.\n</think>The University of Northern Colorado (Greeley,\
      \ CO) is at approximately **40.42\xB0 N** latitude, while Johnson University's\
      \ Tennessee campus (Knoxville, TN) is around **35.96\xB0 N** latitude. Since\
      \ 40.42\xB0 N is farther north than 35.96\xB0 N, the answer is:\n\n**YES**"

      \ UNC is in Greeley, Colorado. Now, Johnson University\u2014there might be a\

      \ are in their respective states.\n\nNext, I need to compare their latitudes.\
      \ Since the question is about which is further north, the latitude will determine\
      \ that. Where is Greeley, CO on the map? Colorado is a northern state compared\
      \ to Tennessee, which is more southeastern. But I should get specific coordinates.\n\
      \nLooking up Greeley, CO's latitude: approximately 40.4233\xB0 N. And then Johnson\
      \ University in Tennessee, which is in Kimberlin Heights. The latitude for Knoxville,\
      \ TN is around 35.9606\xB0 N. Kimberlin Heights is very close to Knoxville,\
      \ so the latitude should be similar, maybe 35.95\xB0 N or so.\n\nComparing 40.4\xB0\

      \ the answer would be yes.\n\nLet me recall the general latitudes. Seattle is\

      \ one is further north? Let me think. Seattle is pretty far north. I think it's\
      \ close to the Canadian border. Rhode Island, on the other hand, is in New England.\
      \ Let me recall the approximate latitudes.\n\nSeattle's latitude is around 47\
      \ degrees North. Providence, the capital of Rhode Island, is about 41.8 degrees\
      \ North. Roger Williams University is in Bristol, RI, I believe. Let me check\

      \ step by step. So, the question is whether Seattle Bible College in Washington\
      \ state is located north of Roger Williams University in Rhode Island. I need\
      \ to figure out the answer by comparing their geographic locations, specifically\
      \ their latitudes, since north-south positioning is determined by latitude.\n\
      \nFirst, I need to confirm the exact locations of both institutions. Let's start\
      \ with Seattle Bible College in Washington. A quick search tells me that Seattle\
      \ Bible College is located in Seattle, WA. Seattle is a major city in the northwestern\
      \ United States, so I know it's in the northern part of the country. The latitude\
      \ of Seattle is approximately 47.6062\xB0 N.\n\nNext, Roger Williams University\
      \ in Rhode Island. Roger Williams University is in Bristol, RI. Rhode Island\
      \ is on the East Coast, so I expect its latitude to be lower (more south) compared\
      \ to Seattle. Let me check the latitude for Bristol, RI. Bristol's coordinates\
      \ are around 41.6701\xB0 N.\n\nComparing the two latitudes: 47.6062\xB0 N (Seattle)\
      \ versus 41.6701\xB0 N (Bristol). Since 47.6 is higher than 41.6, that means\
      \ Seattle is indeed north of Bristol, RI. Therefore, Seattle Bible College in\
      \ WA is located north of Roger Williams University in RI.\n\nWait, just to make\
      \ sure I didn't mix up the colleges. Let me double-check. Yep, Seattle Bible\
      \ College is in Seattle, WA at ~47.6\xB0 N, Roger Williams in Bristol, RI at\
      \ ~41.67\xB0 N. The higher latitude means further north. So yes, Seattle is\

      \ Roger Williams University is in Bristol, RI, maybe? Let me check that. Wait,\
      \ actually, I think Roger Williams University is located in Bristol, Rhode Island.\
      \ So I need the latitude of Bristol, RI versus Seattle, WA.\n\nSeattle's latitude\
      \ is approximately 47.6062\xB0 N. For Bristol, Rhode Island, let me see... Providence,\
      \ RI is around 41.8236\xB0 N, and Bristol is a bit south of Providence, maybe?\
      \ Wait, actually, Bristol, RI's latitude is about 41.6770\xB0 N. So 47.6 versus\
      \ 41.6. Since 47.6 is higher than 41.6, that means Seattle is further north.\
      \ Therefore, Seattle Bible College in WA would be north of Roger Williams University\
      \ in RI. \n\nWait, but wait\u2014I should confirm the exact locations of the\
      \ colleges. Sometimes colleges have multiple campuses or might be in a different\
      \ city than expected. Let me double-check. Seattle Bible College\u2014quick\
      \ check: yes, it's in Seattle, WA. Roger Williams University: main campus is\

      \ is indeed located in Columbus, Ohio. Now, Columbus's latitude. I think Columbus\
      \ is around 40\xB0N latitude. Let me check that. Yeah, Columbus, OH is approximately\
      \ 39.9612\xB0 N, 82.9988\xB0 W.\n\nNext, the Whitacre College of Engineering.\
      \ That's part of Texas Tech University, right? So Texas Tech is in Lubbock,\
      \ Texas. Let me make sure. Yes, the Whitacre College of Engineering is at Texas\
      \ Tech in Lubbock, TX. Now, Lubbock's coordinates. Lubbock is in West Texas.\
      \ Its latitude is about 33.5779\xB0 N, 101.8552\xB0 W. \n\nSo now, comparing\
      \ the latitudes. Columbus, OH is at around 39.96\xB0 N, and Lubbock, TX is at\
      \ 33.58\xB0 N. Since latitude increases as you go north, the higher the number,\
      \ the further north. 39.96 is higher than 33.58, so Columbus, OH is indeed north\

      \ of Whitacre College of Engineering (in Lubbock). \n\nWait, but let me double-check\
      \ to make sure I didn't mix up the locations. Maybe I confused Texas Tech with\

    7c3c7e1a-a8d8-43d8-a355-229780ff7788: "<think>Okay, let's see. I need to figure\
      \ out if McMurry University in Texas is located north of Lynn University in\
      \ Florida. Hmm. First, I should probably find out where both universities are\
      \ located. \n\nStarting with McMurry University in Texas. I think Texas is a\
      \ big state, so the exact city matters. Maybe I can recall if it's in a northern\
      \ or southern part of Texas. Wait, McMurry University... I'm not exactly sure,\
      \ but I remember that some universities are in cities like Abilene. Let me check\
      \ that. Yes, McMurry University is in Abilene, Texas.\n\nNow, where is Abilene\
      \ located within Texas? Texas is a large state that stretches pretty far both\
      \ north and south. I think Abilene is in West Texas, maybe central or northern\
      \ part. Let me think... The major cities in Texas: Dallas is in the north, Houston\
      \ in the southeast, San Antonio and Austin more central. Abilene is west of\
      \ Dallas, perhaps in the central part. Wait, but Texas's panhandle is the very\
      \ northern part. If Abilene is in the central area, maybe around 32\xB0 latitude\
      \ or so? I'm not too sure, but let's tentatively say Abilene is in central Texas.\n\
      \nNext, Lynn University in Florida. Florida is a southern state, so most of\
      \ it is pretty far south. Lynn University\u2014I think it's in Boca Raton, Florida.\
      \ Yes, that's right. Boca Raton is on the southeastern coast of Florida, near\
      \ Miami. So, what's the latitude there? Miami is around 25.7\xB0N, and Boca\
      \ Raton is a bit north of Miami, maybe around 26.3\xB0N latitude.\n\nNow, comparing\
      \ the two. If McMurry University in Abilene, TX is at a higher latitude than\
      \ Boca Raton, FL, then the answer is yes. Let me check the approximate latitude\
      \ of Abilene. I think Abilene is around 32.4\xB0N. Let me confirm: yes, Abilene's\
      \ coordinates are approximately 32.4487\xB0 N, 99.7331\xB0 W. Boca Raton is\
      \ around 26.3683\xB0 N, 80.0833\xB0 W. \n\nComparing 32.4487\xB0N (Abilene)\
      \ vs. 26.3683\xB0N (Boca Raton). Since 32.4 is higher than 26.3, that means\
      \ Abilene, TX is indeed north of Boca Raton, FL. Therefore, McMurry University\
      \ in Texas is located north of Lynn University in Florida.\n</think>YES  \n\
      McMurry University is in Abilene, Texas (latitude ~32.4\xB0N), while Lynn University\
      \ is in Boca Raton, Florida (latitude ~26.4\xB0N). Since 32.4\xB0N is farther\
      \ north than 26.4\xB0N, the answer is YES."

      \ So, if Abilene, TX has a higher latitude than Boca Raton, FL, then the answer\

      \ I should make sure I got the cities right. Let me confirm. McMurry University's\
      \ location: Yes, their website says Abilene, TX. Lynn University's location:\

      \ Boca Raton, FL is around 26 degrees North latitude. Abilene, TX is more north\

      \ is west of Dallas but still in Texas. I think Abilene's latitude is around\

      \ Since the question is about north-south positioning, latitude is the key factor\
      \ here.\n\nLet me try to recall or look up the approximate latitudes. Searcy,\
      \ Arkansas. I believe Arkansas is generally in the mid-south of the US. Searcy\
      \ is in the central part of Arkansas. Alcorn State in Lorman, Mississippi. Mississippi\
      \ is south of Tennessee and Arkansas. Lorman is in southwestern Mississippi,\
      \ I think. So if Lorman is in southern Mississippi and Searcy is in central\
      \ Arkansas, maybe Searcy is further north.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about\
      \ major cities. For example, Little Rock is the capital of Arkansas, located\
      \ centrally. If Searcy is near Little Rock, that's central Arkansas. Mississippi's\
      \ capital is Jackson, which is more central. But Lorman is in the southwest\

      \ southern part of Mississippi, and Searcy is in central Arkansas, which is\
      \ north of Mississippi's northern border, then Searcy would indeed be north\
      \ of Lorman.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Arkansas is north of Louisiana but\
      \ Mississippi is to the east of Arkansas. The northern border of Mississippi\
      \ is along the Tennessee state line. So if a university in Arkansas is in the\

      \ a city called Searcy. Alcorn State is in Mississippi, maybe near Lorman? Let\
      \ me confirm that. \n\nSo, if I can find the cities each is in, then I can look\

      \ generally, states like Mississippi are further south than Arkansas. Arkansas\
      \ is north of Louisiana and east of Texas, while Mississippi is to the east\
      \ of Louisiana and south of Tennessee. So, Arkansas is probably north of Mississippi.\

      \ I think Lorman is in southern Mississippi, maybe around 31.8 degrees north.\
      \ Searcy, Arkansas is in the central part of the state. Let me recall: Arkansas's\
      \ capital is Little Rock, which is around 34.7 degrees north. Searcy is northeast\
      \ of Little Rock, so maybe around 35.2 degrees north. If that's the case, then\
      \ Searcy would be north of Lorman. \n\nWait, but I need to be precise. Let me\
      \ try to remember or estimate. Mississippi's latitude ranges from about 30 degrees\
      \ (southern tip) to 35 degrees (northern border with Tennessee). Arkansas's\
      \ latitude ranges from about 33 degrees (southern border) to 36.5 degrees (northern\
      \ border). So, if Lorman is in southern Mississippi, say 31.8 N, and Searcy\
      \ is in central/north Arkansas, say 35.2 N, then yes, Harding U would be north\
      \ of Alcorn State. \n\nAlternatively, if Alcorn State is in northern Mississippi,\
      \ maybe around 34 degrees, then maybe not. But I think Alcorn State is in the\
      \ southern part. Let me confirm. Alcorn State is the oldest public historically\
      \ black land-grant institution in the US, located near Lorman. Looking up in\
      \ my mind, Lorman is in Jefferson County, Mississippi. Jefferson County is in\
      \ southwestern Mississippi, near the Mississippi River. So that's in the southern\
      \ part of the state. Therefore, its latitude would be lower (more south) than\
      \ Searcy, AR. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Searcy, AR (Harding) is at a\

      \ MS (southern Mississippi).  \n2. **Latitudes**: Searcy, AR, is approximately\
      \ **35.2\xB0N**, while Lorman, MS, is around **31.8\xB0N**.  \n3. **Comparison**:\
      \ Since 35.2\xB0N (Searcy) is farther north than 31.8\xB0N (Lorman), Harding\

      \ of both cities. Latitude measures north-south position, so the higher the\
      \ latitude, the further north. \n\nLet me try to remember or estimate. Arkansas\
      \ is north of Louisiana and east of Texas. Mississippi is to the east of Arkansas.\
      \ But where exactly is Searcy in Arkansas? Arkansas's capital is Little Rock,\

      \ Lorman is probably in southern Mississippi? Or maybe more central? \n\nWait,\
      \ maybe I should think about the coordinates. Let me try to recall approximate\
      \ latitudes. Little Rock, AR is around 34.7\xB0 N. If Searcy is northeast of\
      \ there, maybe around 35.3\xB0 N. For Mississippi, Jackson is the capital, around\
      \ 32.3\xB0 N. If Lorman is south of Jackson, maybe around 31.8\xB0 N. If that's\
      \ the case, then Searcy (35.3) would be north of Lorman (31.8). \n\nBut wait,\
      \ I'm not sure. Maybe I should check specific cities. Let me think: Alcorn State\
      \ University's address is in Lorman, MS. Let me recall\u2014Lorman is in southwestern\
      \ Mississippi, near the Mississippi River. So maybe around 31.8\xB0 N latitude.\
      \ Searcy, AR is in central northern Arkansas. Let me think, the latitude of\
      \ Searcy is approximately 35.25\xB0 N. If that's correct, then yes, Harding\

      \ should consider the general position. Arkansas is north of Mississippi. Wait,\
      \ no. Mississippi is to the east of Arkansas, but their northern borders are\
      \ at similar latitudes. For example, the northern border of Mississippi is around\
      \ 35\xB0 N, same as the northern border of Arkansas. But cities in northern\

      \ Now I need to compare the latitudes of these two cities to determine which\

      \ accurate? Let me think again. Mississippi's northern border is at about 35\
      \ degrees latitude (same as the northern border of Arkansas). So if Lorman is\

      \ Waynesburg University in Pennsylvania is north of National Paralegal College\
      \ in Arizona. First, I need to know where both of these schools are located.\n\
      \nStarting with Waynesburg University in PA. Pennsylvania is in the northeastern\
      \ part of the US. Waynesburg is a town in Greene County, which is in the southwestern\
      \ part of Pennsylvania. I remember that Pittsburgh is in southwestern PA, so\
      \ maybe Waynesburg is near there. Let me check the approximate latitude. Cities\
      \ in southern Pennsylvania like Philadelphia are around 40\xB0N latitude. Pittsburgh\
      \ is around 40.44\xB0N. Since Waynesburg is southwest of Pittsburgh, maybe its\
      \ latitude is a bit lower, maybe around 39.9\xB0N? Not entirely sure, but I\
      \ can estimate.\n\nNow, National Paralegal College in Arizona. Arizona is in\
      \ the southwestern US. The main cities there, like Phoenix, are around 33.45\xB0\

      \ yes, their address is in Phoenix, AZ. So Phoenix's latitude is approximately\
      \ 33.45\xB0N.\n\nComparing the two latitudes: Waynesburg, PA is around 39.9\xB0\
      N, and Phoenix, AZ is around 33.45\xB0N. Since 39.9 is higher than 33.45, that\
      \ means Waynesburg is north of Phoenix. Therefore, Waynesburg University, PA\

      \ Waynesburg University in Pennsylvania is located north of National Paralegal\

      \ determine the locations of both schools. Waynesburg University is in Pennsylvania,\
      \ and National Paralegal College is in Arizona. Since the question is about\
      \ which is further north, I need to compare their latitudes. \n\nI know that\
      \ generally, the more northern states are higher up on the map. Pennsylvania\
      \ is in the northeastern part of the US, while Arizona is in the southwest.\
      \ But states can vary in their latitude. For example, the southern part of a\
      \ northern state could be further south than the northern part of a southern\
      \ state. So I need to look at the specific locations within those states.\n\n\
      Waynesburg University is in Waynesburg, PA. Let me recall where that is. Waynesburg\
      \ is in Greene County, Pennsylvania, near the southwestern part of the state,\
      \ close to the West Virginia border. So even though Pennsylvania is a northern\
      \ state, Waynesburg is in the southern part of PA. \n\nNow, National Paralegal\
      \ College is in Arizona. I need to find out where exactly. A quick check (mentally)\
      \ tells me that National Paralegal College is based in Phoenix, AZ. Phoenix\
      \ is in the central part of Arizona. \n\nNext, comparing the latitudes. Phoenix,\
      \ AZ's latitude is approximately 33.45\xB0 N. Waynesburg, PA is around 39.90\xB0\
      \ N. Since latitude increases as you go north, the higher number is further\
      \ north. 39.90\xB0N is definitely north of 33.45\xB0N. \n\nWait, but wait\u2014\
      even though Pennsylvania is a northern state, is there any chance that a southern\
      \ part of PA might be at a lower latitude than a northern part of AZ? Let me\
      \ check approximate latitudes. The southernmost point of Pennsylvania is around\
      \ 39.7\xB0N, and Phoenix is at 33.45\xB0N. So even the southernmost part of\
      \ PA is well north of Phoenix. Therefore, Waynesburg, PA, at 39.9\xB0N, is north\
      \ of Phoenix, AZ's 33.45\xB0N. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be YES, Waynesburg\
      \ University, PA is located north of National Paralegal College, AZ.\n</think>YES\

      N. \n\nNational Paralegal College is in Phoenix, AZ. Phoenix's coordinates are\
      \ approximately 33.4484\xB0 N, 112.0740\xB0 W. So comparing 39.9\xB0N vs. 33.4\xB0\
      N. Since latitude increases as you go north, 39.9 is higher than 33.4, so Waynesburg,\

      \ The question is whether Portland, ME is north of Arcata, CA.\n\nTo figure\

      \ Let me confirm the exact latitude numbers. Portland, ME: 43.6591\xB0 N. Arcata,\
      \ CA: 40.8665\xB0 N. Yes, so Portland is about 2.8 degrees north of Arcata.\
      \ Since each degree of latitude is about 69 miles, that's roughly 193 miles\

      \ Let's start with IDSVA. A quick search tells me that IDSVA is based in Portland,\

      \ State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, which is in California. Humboldt County\
      \ is in Northern California, near the coast. The city is Arcata, I believe.\
      \ That's pretty far north in California, but still in the northern part of the\
      \ state. So comparing the latitudes of the two institutions.\n\nMaine is in\
      \ the northeastern US, so its latitude is higher than California's. Even Humboldt,\
      \ which is in Northern California, is around 40-41 degrees latitude. Let me\

      \ the exact location of IDSVA.\n\nQuick search in my mind: IDSVA is based in\
      \ Portland, Maine. So Portland, ME is at 43.66\xB0N. California State Poly Humboldt\

      \ If it's in a different city in Maine, like Presque Isle, which is much further\

      \ recalling the locations of both states.\n\nFirst, California is on the west\
      \ coast of the US, and North Carolina is on the east coast. But the key here\
      \ is the latitude of each university. Latitude determines how far north or south\
      \ a place is. The higher the latitude, the further north it is. \n\nSo, I need\
      \ to find the approximate latitudes of both cities: Winston-Salem, NC, and San\
      \ Marcos, CA. Let me think. San Marcos is in Southern California, right? Southern\
      \ California is known for cities like San Diego and Los Angeles. San Marcos\
      \ is near San Diego, maybe a bit inland. The latitude of San Diego is around\
      \ 32.7\xB0 N. So San Marcos should be similar, maybe around 33\xB0 N. \n\nNow,\
      \ Winston-Salem is in North Carolina. North Carolina is in the southeastern\
      \ US. Major cities there include Charlotte and Raleigh. Winston-Salem is in\
      \ the Piedmont Triad region, which is central part of the state. Let me recall\
      \ the latitude for that area. For example, Charlotte is approximately 35.2\xB0\
      \ N, Raleigh is around 35.8\xB0 N. Winston-Salem is a bit west of Raleigh, so\
      \ maybe around 36\xB0 N latitude? \n\nComparing the two: if San Marcos is around\
      \ 33\xB0 N and Winston-Salem is 36\xB0 N, then Winston-Salem is indeed further\

      \ is located north of California State University San Marcos in California.\
      \ The answer needs to be a simple YES or NO, but I need to work through it step\
      \ by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably start by figuring out the geographic\
      \ locations of both universities. Let's take them one at a time. \n\nStarting\
      \ with California State University San Marcos (CSUSM), I know it's in California.\
      \ San Marcos is a city in Southern California. From what I remember, Southern\
      \ California is in the southern part of the state, closer to the Mexico border.\
      \ So the latitude there would be relatively low compared to the northern parts\
      \ of California, like San Francisco or Sacramento. Maybe around 33 degrees north?\
      \ I think San Diego is around 32-33 degrees, and San Marcos is nearby, so maybe\
      \ a similar latitude.\n\nNow, Winston-Salem State University (WSSU) is in North\
      \ Carolina. Winston-Salem is a city in the central part of North Carolina. North\
      \ Carolina is on the East Coast, south of Virginia and north of South Carolina.\
      \ The latitude of Winston-Salem... Hmm. Let me recall. North Carolina's latitude\
      \ ranges from about 33.8\xB0N at the southern border with South Carolina up\
      \ to around 36.6\xB0N at the northern border with Virginia. Winston-Salem is\
      \ in the Piedmont Triad region, which is more towards the central part. So maybe\
      \ around 36 degrees north? For example, the city of Winston-Salem's coordinates\
      \ are approximately 36.10\xB0N, 80.24\xB0W. I think that's correct.\n\nComparing\
      \ the two latitudes: if CSUSM is around 33.1\xB0N (since San Marcos, CA is about\
      \ 33.14\xB0N, 117.17\xB0W), and Winston-Salem is at approximately 36.10\xB0\
      N, then Winston-Salem would be further north. Latitude increases as you go north,\
      \ so 36.10\xB0N is definitely north of 33.14\xB0N. Therefore, WSSU in NC is\
      \ north of CSUSM in CA.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the exact coordinates\
      \ to be sure. Maybe I'm mixing up the cities. Let's verify:\n\n- California\
      \ State University San Marcos is located in San Marcos, CA. Checking a map,\
      \ San Marcos is in northern San Diego County. Looking up the latitude, San Marcos,\
      \ CA is at approximately 33.1434\xB0N. \n\n- Winston-Salem, NC's coordinates\
      \ are approximately 36.0999\xB0N, 80.2442\xB0W. \n\nComparing 36.0999\xB0N vs.\
      \ 33.1434\xB0N, yes, Winston-Salem is indeed north of San Marcos. Therefore,\
      \ the answer should be YES.\n</think>To determine if Winston-Salem State University\
      \ (NC) is north of California State University San Marcos (CA):  \n1. **CSUSM's\
      \ latitude**: San Marcos, CA, is at approximately **33.14\xB0N**.  \n2. **WSSU's\
      \ latitude**: Winston-Salem, NC, is at approximately **36.10\xB0N**.  \nSince\
      \ **36.10\xB0N** (WSSU) is farther north than **33.14\xB0N** (CSUSM), the answer\
      \ is:  \n\n**YES**"

      \ or south a place is. The higher the latitude, the further north it is. So,\
      \ I need to find the latitude coordinates for both cities. \n\nFirst, let's\
      \ get the latitude for Whitewater, Wisconsin. From what I know, Wisconsin is\
      \ in the northern part of the US, but Denver is in Colorado, which is more towards\
      \ the central part but also in the Rocky Mountain region. I think Denver is\
      \ around 39.7 degrees north latitude. Let me confirm that. Yes, Denver's latitude\
      \ is approximately 39.7392\xB0 N. \n\nNow, Whitewater, Wisconsin. I'm not as\
      \ sure about this one. Let me think. Wisconsin is north of Illinois, which is\
      \ at about 40\xB0 N for Chicago. But Whitewater is in southern Wisconsin. Wait,\
      \ Madison, the capital of Wisconsin, is at 43.0731\xB0 N. Whitewater is a bit\
      \ southeast of Madison, closer to the Illinois border. So maybe around 42.8\xB0\
      \ N? Let me check. A quick search in my mind (since I can't actually look it\
      \ up, but relying on prior knowledge) tells me that Whitewater, WI is at approximately\
      \ 42.8330\xB0 N. \n\nComparing the two: Denver is at ~39.7392\xB0 N and Whitewater\
      \ is at ~42.8330\xB0 N. Since 42.833 is higher than 39.7392, that means Whitewater\
      \ is indeed north of Denver. Therefore, the University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater\
      \ is located north of the Graduate School of Social Work at the University of\
      \ Denver. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the cities. Sometimes\
      \ people confuse Denver with other cities in Colorado, but Denver is the capital\
      \ and a major city. The University of Denver is definitely in Denver. And the\
      \ Graduate School of Social Work is part of that university. So, yes, the comparison\
      \ holds. \n\nAnother way to think about it: Colorado is south of Wyoming and\
      \ Nebraska, while Wisconsin is east of Minnesota and Iowa. Since Denver is in\
      \ the northern part of Colorado but still south of the Nebraska border, and\
      \ Wisconsin is further north, the latitude difference makes sense. \n\nSo, putting\
      \ it all together, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \nThe University\

      \ 43 degrees? Let me check that. \n\nWait, I might be mixing up some states.\
      \ For example, Minnesota is further north than Wisconsin, but Wisconsin is still\
      \ north of Colorado. Let me think of major cities. Chicago is around 41 degrees,\
      \ and Denver is around 39.7 degrees. So Chicago is north of Denver. Whitewater,\
      \ WI is in southern Wisconsin, but still north of Chicago? Wait, no. Chicago\
      \ is in Illinois, which is south of Wisconsin. So Whitewater, being in Wisconsin,\
      \ would be north of Chicago. If Chicago is at 41 degrees, then Whitewater might\
      \ be a bit higher, maybe 42.5 or 43 degrees. \n\nDenver's latitude is approximately\
      \ 39.7392\xB0 N. Let me confirm that. Yes, Denver, CO is at about 39.7\xB0N.\
      \ Now, Whitewater, WI: looking it up, Whitewater's coordinates are approximately\
      \ 42.8330\xB0 N, 88.7329\xB0 W. So 42.83\xB0N vs. 39.74\xB0N. That means Whitewater\

    f2e8d00a-77a0-4035-a272-f1f2d5a0b47a: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure this out.\
      \ The question is whether the University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater, WI is\
      \ located north of the Graduate School of Social Work at the University of Denver,\
      \ CO.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the locations of both institutions. The\
      \ University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater is in Whitewater, Wisconsin. The Graduate\
      \ School of Social Work is part of the University of Denver, which is in Denver,\
      \ Colorado. \n\nNext, I should find the latitude of each city because latitude\
      \ determines how far north a place is. The higher the latitude, the further\
      \ north it is. \n\nLet me recall the approximate latitudes. Denver, Colorado\
      \ is known as the Mile High City, so its elevation is around 5,280 feet, but\
      \ elevation isn't directly related to latitude. I think Denver's latitude is\
      \ around 39.7\xB0 N. Whitewater, Wisconsin\u2014I'm not as sure. Maybe Wisconsin\
      \ is further north. For example, Milwaukee is around 43\xB0 N. Whitewater might\
      \ be a bit south of Milwaukee, perhaps around 42.8\xB0 N or so. Let me check\
      \ that in my mind. Wisconsin is north of Illinois, which is at about 40\xB0\
      \ N. So yes, Wisconsin would be higher, maybe 42-43\xB0 N. Denver is in Colorado,\
      \ which is south of Wyoming and Nebraska. Denver's latitude is indeed around\
      \ 39.7\xB0 N, as I thought.\n\nComparing the two: if Whitewater is at 42.8\xB0\
      \ N and Denver is at 39.7\xB0 N, then Whitewater is north of Denver. Therefore,\
      \ the University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater would be north of the University\
      \ of Denver's Graduate School of Social Work.\n\nWait, but I should make sure\
      \ I'm not mixing up cities. Let me confirm. Denver is in Colorado, which is\
      \ south of Nebraska, which is around 41\xB0 N. So Colorado's northern border\
      \ is at 41\xB0 N, but Denver is more towards the center of the state, so 39.7\xB0\
      \ N sounds right. Meanwhile, Wisconsin's southern border is around 42.5\xB0\
      \ N. Whitewater is in southern Wisconsin, but still north of 42\xB0 N. For example,\
      \ Madison, WI is at 43.07\xB0 N. Whitewater is east of Madison, maybe a bit\
      \ lower? Let me think. If Madison is 43\xB0, Whitewater might be around 42.8\xB0\
      \ N. Either way, that's still higher than Denver's 39.7\xB0 N. So yes, Whitewater\
      \ is north of Denver. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \n\
      The University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater, WI is located at approximately\
      \ 42.8\xB0 N latitude, while the University of Denver, CO (where the Graduate\

      \ Gardner\u2013Webb University in North Carolina is located north of the University\
      \ of Houston\u2013Downtown in Texas. Let me break this down step by step.\n\n\
      First, I should probably find the locations of both universities. Gardner\u2013\
      Webb is in North Carolina, and the other one is in Texas. I know that generally,\
      \ North Carolina is on the East Coast, and Texas is in the southern part of\
      \ the US. But where exactly are these universities situated within their states?\n\
      \nFor Gardner\u2013Webb University, I think it's in a town called Boiling Springs,\
      \ NC. Let me confirm that. Yes, a quick search (in my mind) tells me that's\
      \ correct. Now, where is Boiling Springs located within North Carolina? North\
      \ Carolina's shape is kind of a rectangle that's taller north to south. Boiling\
      \ Springs is near the western part of the state, maybe near the border with\
      \ South Carolina. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, actually, I think it's more\
      \ in the central or western part. Maybe near Charlotte? Charlotte is a major\
      \ city in North Carolina. If Boiling Springs is near there, then its latitude\
      \ would be around 35 degrees north.\n\nThen University of Houston\u2013Downtown\
      \ is in Houston, Texas. Houston is in southeastern Texas, near the Gulf of Mexico.\
      \ The latitude of Houston is approximately 29.7 degrees north. That's pretty\
      \ far south. Whereas North Carolina's latitude is higher. For example, Charlotte,\
      \ NC is about 35.2 degrees north. If Boiling Springs is near there, then its\
      \ latitude would be higher than Houston's. Since latitude increases as you go\
      \ north, 35 degrees is definitely north of 29 degrees. So even if Gardner\u2013\
      Webb is in the southern part of NC, like maybe 34 degrees, that's still north\
      \ of Houston's 29.7. Therefore, the answer would be yes.\n\nWait, but let me\
      \ make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Are there any parts of Texas that\
      \ are further north than parts of North Carolina? The panhandle of Texas is\
      \ up near Oklahoma, which is around 36 degrees north. But Houston is way south\
      \ in Texas. So even the northernmost part of Texas is around 36, which is similar\
      \ to North Carolina's latitude. But Gardner-Webb is in NC, which I think is\
      \ in the 35-36 range. So if Gardner-Webb is at, say, 35.5, and Houston is at\
      \ 29.7, then yes, it's definitely north. But what if Gardner-Webb is in a more\
      \ southern part of NC? Wait, NC's southern border is at 34 degrees north (since\
      \ the southern border is with SC, which is around 34 degrees). So the entire\
      \ state of NC is from about 34 to 36.5 degrees north. Therefore, any point in\
      \ NC is north of Houston, TX, which is at 29.7. So regardless of where in NC\
      \ the university is, it's going to be north of Houston. So the answer is YES.\n\

      From what I remember, Houston is in southeastern Texas, near the Gulf of Mexico.\
      \ That area is generally at a lower latitude, so more south. North Carolina\

      \ place is. The higher the latitude, the farther north. So if Boiling Springs\
      \ has a higher latitude than Houston, then the answer is yes. Otherwise, no.\n\
      \nLet me try to remember approximate latitudes. Houston is in southern Texas,\
      \ near the Gulf of Mexico. So its latitude is probably around 29-30 degrees\
      \ north. North Carolina is in the southeastern US but further north than Texas.\
      \ For example, Raleigh, NC is around 35.8 degrees north. But Boiling Springs\
      \ might be a bit more to the west or east? Wait, latitude is about north-south,\
      \ so even if it's west or east in the state, the latitude is what matters. \n\
      \nGardner\u2013Webb University's exact location: Boiling Springs, NC. Let me\
      \ think. I believe Boiling Springs is in Cleveland County, NC. Checking my memory,\
      \ North Carolina's latitude ranges from about 33.8\xB0N (southern border with\
      \ SC) to 36.6\xB0N (northern border with Virginia). So Boiling Springs is probably\
      \ somewhere in the middle. Maybe around 35 degrees? \n\nHouston, TX's latitude\
      \ is around 29.7\xB0N. So if Boiling Springs is at, say, 35\xB0N, that's definitely\
      \ north of Houston. But wait, maybe I should confirm. Let me think of other\
      \ cities. For example, Dallas, TX is around 32.8\xB0N. Austin is around 30.2\xB0\
      N. Houston is a bit south of Austin, so maybe 29.7\xB0N is correct. \n\nSo if\
      \ Gardner\u2013Webb is in NC, which is a state that's north of South Carolina,\
      \ and South Carolina is north of Georgia, which is north of Florida, and Texas\
      \ is further west but Houston is in the southern part. So yes, NC is definitely\
      \ more north than Houston. Therefore, Gardner\u2013Webb University should be\

      \ in Texas, probably in a city called something like \"Lake\" or maybe San Antonio?\
      \ Wait, I think Our Lady of the Lake is in San Antonio, Texas. Let me confirm\
      \ that. Yes, a quick mental check: Our Lady of the Lake University is indeed\
      \ located in San Antonio, TX.\n\nNow, I need the approximate latitudes of Monticello,\
      \ AR, and San Antonio, TX. Generally, the southern states like Texas are further\
      \ south than Arkansas. Arkansas is north of Texas, but San Antonio is in southern\
      \ Texas. So maybe Monticello, AR is north of San Antonio, TX. But I should get\
      \ more precise.\n\nMonticello, Arkansas: Let me recall. Arkansas is a state\
      \ in the southern United States, but not as far south as Texas. The capital\
      \ of Arkansas is Little Rock. Monticello is in southeastern Arkansas, maybe\
      \ around 33 degrees north latitude? San Antonio, Texas is more towards the south\
      \ of Texas. San Antonio's latitude is approximately 29.4 degrees north. So if\
      \ Monticello, AR is around 33\xB0N, that would be north of 29.4\xB0N. Therefore,\
      \ yes, UAM would be north of OLLU.\n\nWait, but I should make sure about Monticello's\
      \ exact latitude. Let me think. Monticello, AR. Let's see, Arkansas's southern\
      \ border is along the Louisiana state line, which is around 33 degrees north.\
      \ Monticello is in Drew County, which is in southeastern Arkansas. Looking up\
      \ (mentally), the latitude of Monticello, AR is approximately 33.62\xB0N. San\
      \ Antonio, TX is at about 29.42\xB0N. Comparing 33.62 vs 29.42, yes, 33.62 is\

      \ about the coordinates. \n\nMonticello, AR's latitude is approximately 33.6\xB0\
      \ N. San Antonio, TX is around 29.4\xB0 N. Wait, latitude increases as you go\
      \ north. So 33.6\xB0 N is higher than 29.4\xB0 N, which means Monticello is\
      \ north of San Antonio. Therefore, the University of Arkansas at Monticello\
      \ would be north of Our Lady of the Lake University. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check.\
      \ Maybe I mixed up the coordinates. Let me visualize a map. Arkansas is above\

      \ correct, then we have two universities: one in southeastern Arkansas and one\
      \ in southern Texas. \n\nNow, the question is whether Monticello, AR is north\
      \ of San Antonio, TX. To answer this, I need to compare their latitudes. Latitude\
      \ measures how far north or south a place is. The higher the latitude, the further\
      \ north. \n\nLet me recall or imagine the approximate latitudes. San Antonio\
      \ is around 29.4 degrees north latitude. Monticello, AR, if it's in southeastern\

      \nWait, let me verify that. Maybe I should look up the exact coordinates. Monticello,\
      \ AR's coordinates are approximately 33.62\xB0 N, 91.79\xB0 W. Our Lady of the\

      \ I need to determine the answer step by step.\n\nFirst, I should find the locations\
      \ of both institutions. Let's start with Bethel University in Tennessee. I recall\
      \ that Bethel University is a private university, but I'm not exactly sure where\
      \ in Tennessee it's located. Maybe I should look up the city. I think there's\

      \ N.\n\nComparing the two, 36.1320\xB0 N (McKenzie) is higher than 32.2988\xB0\
      \ N (Jackson). Since latitude increases as you go north, McKenzie, TN is north\

      \ Got it. So now I need to compare the latitudes of McKenzie, TN, and Jackson,\
      \ MS to determine which is further north.\n\nLatitude is the key here. The higher\
      \ the latitude, the further north a location is. Let me recall the approximate\
      \ latitudes. Jackson, Mississippi's latitude is around 32.2988\xB0 N. McKenzie,\
      \ Tennessee's latitude is approximately 36.1328\xB0 N. Wait, 36 degrees versus\

      \ Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't\
      \ mix up the cities. Maybe I should cross-verify the cities' locations. Jackson\
      \ is the capital of Mississippi, located in the central part of the state. McKenzie\

      \ latitudes. Latitude determines how far north a location is. The higher the\
      \ latitude, the further north.\n\nMcKenzie, TN: Let me think. Tennessee is north\
      \ of Mississippi, but cities in the northern part of Tennessee would be further\
      \ north than cities in southern Tennessee. Where is McKenzie exactly? McKenzie\
      \ is in the northwestern part of Tennessee, near the Kentucky border. So its\

      \ might have multiple campuses, but I think the main one is in McKenzie, TN.\
      \ I should confirm that. Let me remember... Yes, Bethel University's main campus\

      \ I believe McKenzie is in the northwestern part of the state, near the Kentucky\

      \ border. \n\nNext, the University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry.\
      \ That's part of the University of Mississippi Medical Center, which is located\

      \ recall the approximate latitudes. Jackson, MS's latitude is roughly around\
      \ 32.3\xB0 N. McKenzie, TN is in the northwest part of Tennessee, so Tennessee's\
      \ northern border with Kentucky is at about 36.5\xB0 N, but McKenzie isn't at\

      \ might vary. Since McKenzie is in the northwest corner of Tennessee, and Jackson\
      \ is in central Mississippi, their latitudes would differ significantly. The\
      \ northern border of Mississippi is at approximately 35\xB0 N. So Jackson, being\
      \ in the central part, is around 32.3\xB0 N, which is south of 35\xB0 N. Therefore,\

      \ is southwest of Fort Worth, which is around 32.7555\xB0 N. Oklahoma City is\
      \ definitely north of Dallas/Fort Worth. Dallas is about 32.7767\xB0 N, so Oklahoma\
      \ City at 35.46\xB0 N would be north of that. Therefore, Tarleton State in Stephenville\
      \ (32.22\xB0 N) would be south of Oklahoma City. So the answer is YES.\n\nWait,\
      \ but wait\u2014let me double-check. Maybe I mixed up the numbers. If Oklahoma\
      \ City is at 35.5\xB0 N and Stephenville at 32.2\xB0 N, then the difference\
      \ is about 3 degrees, which is significant. Each degree is roughly 69 miles,\
      \ so 3 degrees would be over 200 miles difference. That seems correct. So Oklahoma\
      \ City is indeed north of Tarleton State University in Texas.\n\nAnother way\
      \ to think: the Texas-Oklahoma border runs east-west. The Red River is the border.\
      \ Oklahoma is north of Texas. So Oklahoma City, being in central Oklahoma, is\
      \ north of the Texas border. Tarleton State in Stephenville is in Texas, south\
      \ of the Red River. Therefore, yes, Oklahoma City is north of Tarleton State.\n\
