      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - North Carolina is on the eastern coast of the United States

      - Missouri is in the central part of the United States, much further inland


      Step 3: More specifically, North Carolina is entirely east of Missouri. North
      Carolina borders the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side, while Missouri is in
      the Midwest region.


      Step 4: Since Hyde County is in North Carolina, and Pemiscot County is in Missouri,

      - Minnehaha County is in South Dakota, so it inherits South Dakota''s western
      position.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Michigan is east of South Dakota on the US map, and these counties are
      within their respective states, Saginaw County, MI is east of Minnehaha County,

      - Maine is one of the easternmost states in the US.

      - Michigan is considerably west of Maine.


      Step 4: Compare the specific counties.

      - Any county in Maine will be east of any county in Michigan because of their
      respective state positions.

      - Maine is on the East Coast of the United States.

      - Michigan is in the Midwest, specifically in the Great Lakes region.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - States on the East Coast (like Maine) are generally east of midwestern states

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both counties.

      - Perquimans County is in North Carolina (NC), which is on the eastern coast
      of the United States.

      - Mississippi County is in Arkansas (AR), which is in the south-central part
      of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on the US map.

      - North Carolina is significantly east of Arkansas on the US map.

      - Arkansas borders the Mississippi River on its eastern side, while North Carolina
      is on the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Arkansas is west of the Appalachian Mountains, while North Carolina is east
      of them.

      - Even the easternmost part of Arkansas would be west of the westernmost part
      of North Carolina.


      Step 4: Specifically for these counties:

      - Perquimans County is in northeastern North Carolina.

      - Mississippi County is in northeastern Arkansas.

      - Even though both are in the northeastern parts of their respective states,
      the entire state of North Carolina is east of Arkansas.


      Therefore, Perquimans County, NC is definitely located east of Mississippi County,
      AR.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States, bordering the Mississippi
      River on its eastern edge

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States, bordering Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Arkansas is significantly east of New Mexico in the United States

      - New Mexico is one of the westernmost states in the continental US (excluding
      the Pacific coast states)

      - Arkansas is much closer to the eastern side of the country


      Step 4: Consider county locations within their states.

      - Crittenden County, AR is in the eastern part of Arkansas (near the Mississippi
      River)

      - Bernalillo County, NM is in central New Mexico


      Since Arkansas as a whole is east of New Mexico, and Crittenden County is in
      the eastern part of Arkansas, while Bernalillo County is in central New Mexico,
      Crittenden County must be east of Bernalillo County.


      YES, Crittenden County, AR is located east of Bernalillo County, NM.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Okaloosa County is located in the Florida Panhandle, in the northwestern part
      of Florida.

      - Val Verde County is located on the western side of Texas, along the border
      with Mexico.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States, west of Florida.


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - All of Florida, including Okaloosa County, lies east of all of Texas, including
      Val Verde County.

      - Val Verde County, being on the western side of Texas, is even further west
      compared to Okaloosa County.

      - Queen Anne''s County is in Maryland (MD), which is on the East Coast of the
      United States.

      - Jackson County is in Missouri (MO), which is in the Midwest region.


      Step 2: Consider the general geographical positions of these states.

      - Maryland is on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      - Missouri is in the central part of the United States, well inland from the
      East Coast.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes.

      - States on the East Coast (like Maryland) have eastern longitudes relative
      to inland states.

      - Missouri is significantly west of Maryland.

      - Therefore, any county in Maryland would be east of any county in Missouri.


      Step 4: Specifically for these counties:

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both counties.

      - Alger County is in Michigan (MI), which is in the eastern part of the United
      States.

      - Treasure County is in Montana (MT), which is in the western part of the United
      States.

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Missouri is located in the Midwest region, significantly inland from the east
      coast


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Virginia is entirely east of Missouri on the map of the United States

      - All counties in Virginia would therefore be east of all counties in Missouri


      Step 4: Verify that there are no unusual geographic arrangements.

      - There are no geographic anomalies that would place any part of Missouri east
      of Virginia

      - The states don''t have non-contiguous parts that would change this relationship


      Since Augusta County, VA is in Virginia, and Cole County, MO is in Missouri,
      and Virginia is east of Missouri, Augusta County must be east of Cole County.
