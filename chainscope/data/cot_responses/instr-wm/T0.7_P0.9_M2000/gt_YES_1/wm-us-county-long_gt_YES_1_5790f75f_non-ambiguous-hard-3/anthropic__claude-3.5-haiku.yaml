      Comparing their positions:

      - Kentucky is east of Texas

      - Barren County is in eastern Kentucky

      - Hansford County is in western Texas


      Therefore, Barren County, KY is definitely east of Hansford County, TX.

      - Alabama is east of Texas

      - Cullman County (in Alabama) would therefore be east of Yoakum County (in Texas)


      4. Therefore, the answer is: YES, Cullman County, AL is located east of Yoakum
      County, TX.


      YES'
    aaa6413d-e0d4-4cf5-bf61-701bf15b8efc: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate Cullman County, Alabama on a map

      - Cullman County is in north-central Alabama

      - It is located in the north-central part of the state


      2. Next, locate Yoakum County, Texas on a map

      - Yoakum County is in northwest Texas

      - It is located in the Texas panhandle region


      3. Compare their relative positions

      - Alabama is east of Texas

      - Cullman County is much further east than Yoakum County


      4. Determine the east/west relationship

      - Since Cullman County is in Alabama (east) and Yoakum County is in Texas (west),
      Cullman County is definitely east of Yoakum County
