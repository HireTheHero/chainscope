      1. **Locate Pemiscot County, MO**: Pemiscot County is in the southeastern corner
      of Missouri. It borders the Mississippi River and is close to the states of
      Arkansas and Tennessee. It lies in the Central Time Zone and is situated in
      the eastern portion of Missouri.

      and is located along the Atlantic coast. It includes areas of the Outer Banks
      and is one of the easternmost counties in North Carolina. It lies in the Eastern
      Time Zone.


      3. **Compare their longitudinal positions**: Missouri is generally west of North
      Carolina. Pemiscot County, being in southeastern Missouri, is still significantly
      west of Hyde County, NC, which is on the Atlantic coast.

      locations of both counties.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Wilbarger County, TX.

      - Wilbarger County is located in northern Texas, near the border with Oklahoma.
      It is part of the western/central United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Sampson County, NC.

      - Sampson County is located in southeastern North Carolina. North Carolina is

      positions of both counties.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Doniphan County, Kansas.

      - Doniphan County is located in the northeastern corner of Kansas.

      - It borders Missouri to the east and Nebraska to the north.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Muskingum County, Ohio.

      - Muskingum County is located in eastern Ohio.

      - It is east of Columbus, Ohio.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions of both counties.

      - Kansas is generally west of Ohio in the United States.

      - Doniphan County, being in northeast Kansas, is still west of the entire state
      of Ohio.

      - Muskingum County, being in eastern Ohio, is even farther east within the state.

      2. Determine their relative positions, particularly in terms of longitude (east-west
      direction).


      Step 1: Locate Steuben County, NY.

      - Steuben County is in the state of New York, which is in the northeastern part
      of the United States.

      - Specifically, it is in the southern tier of New York, bordering Pennsylvania.

      - Winneshiek County is in the state of Iowa, which is in the Midwestern region
      of the United States.

      - It is located in the northeastern part of Iowa.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Since New York is geographically east of Iowa, and both counties are toward
      the eastern sides of their respective states, it follows that Steuben County,
      NY is east of Winneshiek County, IA.

      is located east of Iroquois County, Illinois, we need to consider their geographic
      locations within the United States.


      Step 1: Locate Iroquois County, Illinois.

      - Iroquois County is in the eastern part of Illinois, along the border with
      Indiana.

      - It is relatively central in terms of the U.S. east-west axis, but still in
      the Midwest.


      Step 2: Locate Bucks County, Pennsylvania.

      - Bucks County is in southeastern Pennsylvania.

      - It is part of the greater Philadelphia metropolitan area.

      - Pennsylvania is an eastern U.S. state, and Bucks County is near the eastern
      edge of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Compare longitudinal positions.

      - Illinois is west of Pennsylvania.

      - Since Iroquois County is in eastern Illinois and Bucks County is in eastern
      Pennsylvania, it is clear that Bucks County lies significantly farther east
      than Iroquois County.
