      1. **Locate Dunn County, WI**: Dunn County is situated in the western part of
      Wisconsin. It is bordered by the Chippewa River and is relatively central in
      the state.


      2. **Locate Ravalli County, MT**: Ravalli County is located in the southwestern

      states, Allen County is in the eastern region of Indiana, while Box Butte County
      is in the western region of Nebraska.


      4. **Relative Position**: Since Indiana is east of Nebraska and Allen County

      located east of Iroquois County, IL, we can analyze the geographical locations
      of both counties step by step.


      1. **Locate Iroquois County, IL**: Iroquois County is in the central part of
      Illinois, specifically in the eastern region of the state. It is situated south
      of Chicago.


      2. **Locate Bucks County, PA**: Bucks County is located in southeastern Pennsylvania,
      situated just northeast of Philadelphia.


      3. **Compare their longitudes**: Pennsylvania is on the East Coast, while Illinois
      is more centrally located in the United States. Since Bucks County is significantly
      east of the central U.S., and Iroquois County is more to the west, we can compare
      their longitudes.


      4. **Determine their relative positions**: Bucks County, PA lies at a longitude
      of approximately -74.95 degrees, while Iroquois County, IL is at about -87.73
      degrees. Since the negative sign indicates west of the Prime Meridian, a smaller
      negative number (closer to zero) indicates a location further east.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that -74.95 (Bucks County) is east of -87.73 (Iroquois
      County), we can conclude that Bucks County is indeed located east of Iroquois
