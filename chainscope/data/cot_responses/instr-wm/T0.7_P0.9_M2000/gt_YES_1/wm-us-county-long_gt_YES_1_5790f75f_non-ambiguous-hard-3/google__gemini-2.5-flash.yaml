      **Step 1: Find the approximate longitude of Todd County, MN.**

      Todd County, MN is located in central Minnesota. Its approximate longitude is
      around **94-95 degrees West**.


      **Step 2: Find the approximate longitude of Musselshell County, MT.**

      Musselshell County, MT is located in central Montana. Its approximate longitude
      is around **108-109 degrees West**.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      *   Todd County, MN: ~94-95 degrees West

      *   Musselshell County, MT: ~108-109 degrees West


      On a map, locations with smaller West longitude values are *further east*.


      Since 94-95 is a smaller West longitude value than 108-109, Todd County, MN

      answer.


      **Step 1: Determine the longitude of Tucker County, WV.**

      * Tucker County, WV is located in West Virginia.

      * West Virginia is an eastern state in the US.

      * Its approximate longitude is around 79-80 degrees West.


      **Step 2: Determine the longitude of Gage County, NE.**

      * Gage County, NE is located in Nebraska.

      * Nebraska is a midwestern state, west of the Mississippi River.

      * Its approximate longitude is around 96-97 degrees West.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      * Tucker County, WV: ~79-80 degrees West

      * Gage County, NE: ~96-97 degrees West


      On a longitude scale, lower numbers (closer to 0) are further east.


      Since 79-80 is a lower West longitude than 96-97, Tucker County, WV is indeed
      located east of Gage County, NE.

      **Step 1: Locate Saginaw County, MI**

      Saginaw County is in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. Michigan is in the Eastern

      **Step 2: Locate Minnehaha County, SD**

      Minnehaha County (where Sioux Falls is located) is in eastern South Dakota.

      the state of Mississippi. Mississippi is in the southeastern United States.

      2.  **Identify the location of Yavapai County, AZ:** Yavapai County is in the

      it''s common geographical knowledge that Arizona is west of Mississippi. Therefore,
      Mississippi is east of Arizona.

      Sagadahoc County, ME is located in southern Maine. Maine is one of the easternmost
      states in the US. Its longitude is roughly around **-69 to -70 degrees West**.


      **Step 2: Find the approximate longitude of Roscommon County, MI.**

      Roscommon County, MI is located in the northern part of the Lower Peninsula
      of Michigan. Michigan is in the Midwest. Its longitude is roughly around **-84

      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      *   Sagadahoc County, ME: ~ -69 to -70 degrees West

      *   Roscommon County, MI: ~ -84 to -85 degrees West


      Remember that for West longitudes, a *smaller* negative number (closer to 0)

      in the Midwest, generally considered east of the Rocky Mountains.


      2.  **Locate Uinta County, WY:** This county is in Wyoming. Wyoming is a western

      4.  **Consider the specific counties:** Since Illinois is east of Wyoming, and

      *   Uinta County, WY is roughly around 110.5 degrees West longitude.


      On a longitude scale, smaller numbers (closer to 0) are further east. 88.2 is

    f7d0a0ef-da61-4acb-92ba-903128e25ed9: 'Let''s break this down to determine the
      answer.


      **Step 1: Find the approximate longitude of Missaukee County, MI.**

      Missaukee County, MI is located in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. A quick
      search or look at a map shows its approximate longitude is around **85 degrees
      West**.


      **Step 2: Find the approximate longitude of Edmunds County, SD.**

      Edmunds County, SD is located in the north-central part of South Dakota. A quick
      search or look at a map shows its approximate longitude is around **98 degrees
      West**.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      *   Missaukee County, MI: ~85 degrees West

      *   Edmunds County, SD: ~98 degrees West


      Remember that as you move *east* from the Prime Meridian (0 degrees longitude),
      the *West* longitude value *decreases*. Conversely, as you move *west*, the
      *West* longitude value *increases*.


      Since 85 degrees West is *further east* (closer to 0 degrees West) than 98 degrees
      West, Missaukee County, MI is indeed located east of Edmunds County, SD.


      **Answer:** YES'

      **Step 1: Locate Oliver County, ND.**

      Oliver County is in North Dakota. North Dakota is a state in the Upper Midwest
      region of the United States. It''s generally considered to be in the northern
      part of the Great Plains.


      **Step 2: Locate Asotin County, WA.**

      Asotin County is in Washington state. Washington is a state in the Pacific Northwest
      region of the United States, bordering the Pacific Ocean.


      **Step 3: Compare their general East-West positions.**

      The United States is generally laid out with states on the East Coast (Atlantic
      Ocean), then moving westward through the Midwest, Mountain West, and finally
      the West Coast (Pacific Ocean).


      *   North Dakota is clearly an "eastern" state relative to the vast majority
      of "western" states.

      *   Washington is a "westernmost" state, bordering the Pacific Ocean.


      **Step 4: Conclude.**

      Given North Dakota''s position in the Midwest and Washington''s position on
      the West Coast, Oliver County, ND is definitively located to the east of Asotin

      1.  **Locate Anson County, NC:** Anson County is in the southern part of North
      Carolina, near the border with South Carolina. North Carolina is on the East
      Coast of the United States.


      2.  **Locate Curry County, NM:** Curry County is in eastern New Mexico, bordering
      Texas. New Mexico is in the Southwestern United States.


      3.  **Compare their general positions:** North Carolina is much further east
      than New Mexico.


      4.  **Determine relative longitude:** Because North Carolina is on the East

      Winneshiek County, IA is in the northeastern part of Iowa.


      **Step 3: Compare their longitudes.**

      *   New York State is considerably east of Iowa.

      *   Even the westernmost part of New York (where Steuben County is) is still
      further east in terms of longitude than the easternmost part of Iowa (where
      Winneshiek County is).


      Therefore, Steuben County, NY is located east of Winneshiek County, IA.

      **Step 1: Locate Steuben County, NY**

      Steuben County, NY is in the western part of New York State, bordering Pennsylvania.


      **Step 2: Locate Winneshiek County, IA**

      Winneshiek County, IA is in the northeastern part of Iowa, bordering Minnesota.


      **Step 3: Compare longitudes (east/west position)**

      *   New York State is generally east of Iowa.

      *   More specifically, the western part of New York (where Steuben County is)
      is still significantly east of the eastern part of Iowa (where Winneshiek County
      is).


      While both are in the northern US, New York is geographically positioned to
      the east of Iowa. Therefore, any county in New York will be east of any county
      in Iowa.
