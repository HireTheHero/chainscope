      densities, which is calculated as:


      \[

      \text{Population Density} = \frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Land Area}}

      \]


      ### Step 1: Find Population and Land Area for Munhall, PA

      - According to U.S. Census data, Munhall, PA has a population of approximately
      **10,000+** people.

      - The land area of Munhall is roughly **2.0 square miles**.

      - This gives a population density of around **5,000 people per square mile**.


      ### Step 2: Find Population and Land Area for Woodland Beach, MI

      - Woodland Beach, MI is a small census-designated place (CDP) with a population
      of around **1,000+** people.

      - The land area of Woodland Beach is **0.4 square miles**.

      - This results in a population density of approximately **2,500 people per square
      mile**.


      ### Step 3: Compare Population Densities

      - Munhall, PA has a population density of **about 5,000 people per square mile**.

      - Woodland Beach, MI has a population density of **about 2,500 people per square
      mile**.


      Since **5,000 > 2,500**, Munhall, PA is more densely populated than Woodland
      Beach, MI.

      1. **Tropical Park, FL** is not a city; it is a park located in Miami-Dade County,

      it does not have an official population or population density.


      2. **Bridgeview, IL** is an incorporated village in Cook County, Illinois, with

      IL.


      4. Therefore, the question is not valid for comparison, but if forced to answer

      around **900** people.

      - **Owyhee, NV**: Owyhee has a population of approximately **1,000** people.

      \]


      ### Step 1: Find Population and Land Area for Basehor, KS

      - **Basehor, KS** has an estimated population of around **7,000** people.

      - The land area of Basehor is approximately **6.75 square miles**.

      - **Density** = \( \frac{7000}{6.75} \approx 1037 \) people per square mile.


      ### Step 2: Find Population and Land Area for Petaluma Center, CA

      - **Petaluma**, CA has a total population of around **60,000**, but we need
      to consider the central area.

      - The **Petaluma Center** (downtown and nearby central areas) is a more densely
      populated part of the city.

      - The land area of Petaluma Center is smaller than the entire city, but urban
      centers tend to have much higher densities.

      - The overall density of **Petaluma** is about **4,000 people per square mile**,
      and the central area is likely even denser.


      ### Step 3: Compare Densities

      - **Basehor, KS**: ~1,037 people per square mile.

      - **Petaluma Center, CA**: Likely well over **4,000 people per square mile**.

      ### Step 1: Identify Population and Area for Each Place

      - **Parklawn, CA**: Parklawn is a small census-designated place (CDP) in California.
      Its population is relatively low, and it occupies a small area.

      - **Colonia, NJ**: Colonia is a CDP in New Jersey, which is part of the densely
      populated New York metropolitan area. New Jersey, in general, has some of the
      highest population densities in the U.S.


      ### Step 2: Compare General Population Density Trends

      - New Jersey is one of the most densely populated states in the U.S., particularly
      areas near New York City.

      - California has densely populated areas, but Parklawn is not one of them; it
      is a smaller community with less urban density.


      ### Step 3: Conclusion

      Given that Colonia, NJ is part of a highly populated region and Parklawn, CA
      is a small community with lower density, it is reasonable to conclude that Colonia,
      NJ has a higher population density.

      are calculated as:


      \[

      \text{Population Density} = \frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Land Area}}

      \]


      ### Step 1: Find the population and land area of Bunk Foss, WA

      - Bunk Foss, WA is a small census-designated place (CDP) in Snohomish County.

      - According to available data, its population is approximately **3,570** people.

      - Its land area is about **4.8 square miles**.


      \[

      \text{Density of Bunk Foss} = \frac{3,570}{4.8} \approx 744 \text{ people per
      square mile}

      \]


      ### Step 2: Find the population and land area of Shelby, NC

      - Shelby, NC is a city in Cleveland County.

      - According to recent estimates, its population is around **20,325** people.

      - Its land area is about **21.1 square miles**.


      \[

      ### Step 3: Compare the densities

      - Shelby, NC has a population density of **964 people per square mile**.

      - Bunk Foss, WA has a population density of **744 people per square mile**.

      - Since **964 > 744**, Shelby, NC is more densely populated than Bunk Foss,
      WA.

      ### Step 1: Find Population and Land Area for Bunk Foss, WA

      - **Bunk Foss, WA** is a census-designated place (CDP) in Snohomish County.

      - According to the U.S. Census, it has a small population (around 3,000 people)
      and a land area of approximately **3.5 square miles**.


      #### Estimated Population Density of Bunk Foss:

      \[

      \frac{3,000}{3.5} \approx 857 \text{ people per square mile}

      \]


      ### Step 2: Find Population and Land Area for Shelby, NC

      - **Shelby, NC** is a city in Cleveland County.

      - As of the most recent census, Shelby has a population of around **20,000 people**
      and a land area of approximately **21 square miles**.


      #### Estimated Population Density of Shelby:

      \[

      \frac{20,000}{21} \approx 952 \text{ people per square mile}

      \]


      ### Step 3: Compare the Densities

      - Bunk Foss, WA: **~857 people/sq mi**

      - Shelby, NC: **~952 people/sq mi**


      Since **952 (Shelby) is greater than 857 (Bunk Foss)**, Shelby is more densely
      populated.

      populated than Slaton, TX, we need to compare their population densities.


      ### Step 1: Find Population and Area for Edmond, OK

      - **Edmond, OK** has a population of approximately **94,000** (as of recent
      estimates).

      - The city covers an area of about **87.9 square miles**.


      #### Calculate Density:

      \[

      \frac{94,000}{87.9} \approx 1,069 \text{ people per square mile}

      \]


      ### Step 2: Find Population and Area for Slaton, TX

      - **Slaton, TX** has a population of approximately **6,000**.

      - The city covers an area of about **5.5 square miles**.


      #### Calculate Density:

      \[

      \frac{6,000}{5.5} \approx 1,091 \text{ people per square mile}

      \]


      ### Step 3: Compare the Densities

      - Edmond, OK: **~1,069 people per square mile**

      - Slaton, TX: **~1,091 people per square mile**


      Since **1,091** (Slaton) is slightly greater than **1,069** (Edmond), **Slaton,

      ### Step 1: Find Population and Land Area for Each City


      #### McCordsville, IN:

      - **Population (2020 Census):** ~9,600

      - **Land Area:** ~6.5 square miles


      \[

    4c5a0114-a98b-4754-95b2-4b7cf1d7b27f: 'To answer this question, we need to compare
      the population densities of Stryker, OH, and Lake Dalecarlia, IN.


      ### Step 1: Define Population Density

      Population density is calculated as:


      \[

      \text{Population Density} = \frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Land Area}}

      \]


      where population is typically measured in people and land area in square miles.


      ### Step 2: Find Population and Land Area


      #### Stryker, OH:

      - Population: Approximately **1,200** people

      - Land Area: About **0.8 square miles**


      \[

      \text{Density} = \frac{1200}{0.8} = 1500 \text{ people per square mile}

      \]


      #### Lake Dalecarlia, IN:

      - Population: Approximately **1,500** people

      - Land Area: About **2.0 square miles**


      \[

      \text{Density} = \frac{1500}{2.0} = 750 \text{ people per square mile}

      \]


      ### Step 3: Compare the Densities

      - Stryker, OH: **1,500 people per square mile**

      - Lake Dalecarlia, IN: **750 people per square mile**


      Since **1,500 > 750**, we conclude:


      **YES**, Stryker, OH is more densely populated than Lake Dalecarlia, IN.'
