      **Step 1: Gather Population and Area Data**

      - **Hummels Wharf, PA**: This is a census-designated place in Pennsylvania.
      You would need to look up its population and land area.

      - **Trout Valley, IL**: This is a village in Illinois. Similarly, you would
      need to find its population and land area.


      **Step 2: Calculate Population Densities**

      - For each location, divide the population by the land area to find the population
      density.


      **Step 3: Compare the Population Densities**

      - Compare the calculated population densities to determine which location is
      more densely populated.


      Since I do not have direct access to real-time databases or the ability to look
      up current data, I recommend checking the most recent census data or local government
      resources for both Hummels Wharf, PA and Trout Valley, IL to perform these calculations.


      Based on my last update, here is a general outline of what you might find:

      - **Hummels Wharf, PA**: Typically has a smaller population, given it is a census-designated
      place.

      - **Trout Valley, IL**: As a village, it might have a different population density.


      Without specific data, I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer. However,
      you can perform these steps with the latest data to arrive at the answer.'

      densely populated than Trout Valley, IL, we need to compare their population
      densities. Population density is typically measured as the number of people
      per square mile or square kilometer.


      **Step 1:** Find the population and area of Hummels Wharf, PA.

      - Hummels Wharf is a census-designated place (CDP) in Snyder County, Pennsylvania.

      - As a small CDP, its population and area are relatively small.


      **Step 2:** Find the population and area of Trout Valley, IL.

      - Trout Valley is a village in McHenry County, Illinois.

      - Similar to Hummels Wharf, it is a small residential area, and the population
      is not large.


      **Step 3:** Calculate the population density for each location.

      - Population density = Population / Area.


      **Step 4:** Compare the two population densities.


      Assuming typical values based on small community sizes in the U.S., let''s consider:

      - Hummels Wharf, PA might have a higher population density if it is more compact
      or less spacious than Trout Valley, IL.

      - However, without specific numbers, we need to look at typical data or sources.


      **Conclusion:** Given that both are small communities, the comparison might
      be close. However, based on available information or typical community layouts,
      we can make an educated guess.


      Without specific numbers, the answer is speculative. However, based on typical
      characteristics, Trout Valley, IL tends to have larger residential lots, implying
      a lower density. Conversely, Hummels Wharf, PA may have denser residential areas.


      Therefore, the answer is likely **YES**, Hummels Wharf, PA is more densely populated
      than Trout Valley, IL, based on the typical characteristics of these communities.'

      Fairfax County is part of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and is relatively
      densely populated compared to rural areas. While Fairfax Station itself may
      not have official density statistics readily available, it is generally considered
      to have a suburban character, implying a moderate population density.


      2. **Francesville, IN**: Francesville is a small town in Pulaski County, Indiana.
      Small towns in rural areas like those in Indiana typically have low population
      densities due to their smaller populations and larger land areas compared to
      suburban or urban areas.


      Given these general characteristics:


      - Suburban areas like Fairfax Station, especially those near major metropolitan
      areas, are usually more densely populated than small rural towns.

      - Francesville, being a small town in a rural part of Indiana, is likely to
      have a lower population density compared to Fairfax Station.


      Based on these considerations, Fairfax Station, VA is likely more densely populated
      than Francesville, IN.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'

      of the two cities. Population density is calculated as the number of people
      per unit area (usually per square mile or square kilometer).


      ### Step 1: Gather Population and Area Data

      - **LaMoure, ND**: Find the population and area in square miles.

      - **Zwolle, LA**: Find the population and area in square miles.


      ### Step 2: Calculate Population Density

      For each city, use the formula:

      \[ \text{Population Density} = \frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Area}} \]


      ### Step 3: Compare the Densities

      Determine which city has a higher population density by comparing the results
      from Step 2.


      ### Example Calculation

      Assume hypothetical data (you would replace these with actual data):

      - **LaMoure, ND**: Population = 900, Area = 1.5 square miles

      - **Zwolle, LA**: Population = 1,800, Area = 4 square miles


      Calculate the densities:

      - **LaMoure, ND**: \( \frac{900}{1.5} = 600 \) people per square mile

      - **Zwolle, LA**: \( \frac{1800}{4} = 450 \) people per square mile


      ### Conclusion

      Since 600 people per square mile (LaMoure) is greater than 450 people per square
      mile (Zwolle), LaMoure, ND is more densely populated than Zwolle, LA.

      populated than Topeka, KS, we need to compare their population densities. Population
      density is calculated as the number of people per square mile.


      **Step 1: Gather data on Copperton, UT**

      - Copperton is a small community in Utah. Its population size is relatively
      small, around a few hundred people. The area of Copperton is also small.


      **Step 2: Gather data on Topeka, KS**

      - Topeka is the capital city of Kansas with a significantly larger population,
      typically in the range of over 100,000 people. The area of Topeka is much larger
      than that of Copperton.


      **Step 3: Calculate or estimate population densities**

      - Since Copperton is very small in both population and area, its population
      density could potentially be higher if the geographic area is extremely limited.

      - Topeka, being a larger city, has its population spread over a larger area
      which generally results in a lower population density compared to very small
      communities.


      **Step 4: Compare population densities**

      - Typically, larger cities like Topeka have lower population densities compared
      to small, tightly bound communities like Copperton, unless the small community
      is very sparsely populated.


      Given what is typical for the size and nature of these two places, Copperton,
      UT is likely more densely populated than Topeka, KS, due to its small size and

      1. **Sonoma, CA**: Sonoma is a small city located in Sonoma County, California.
      As of the latest data, its population is relatively small, and it covers a limited
      land area. This typically results in a moderate to low population density.


      2. **Columbus, OH**: Columbus is the capital and largest city in the state of

      1. **Identify the Population and Area**: We need to find the population and
      the area (in square miles or kilometers) for both Lake Wisconsin, WI, and Terre
      du Lac, MO.


      2. **Calculate Population Density**: Population density is calculated by dividing

      3. **Compare the Population Densities**: Once we have the population densities

      **Step-by-step Analysis:**


      1. **Lake Wisconsin, WI**: Lake Wisconsin is not a city but a census-designated
      place (CDP) in Wisconsin. Its population and area data might be limited or somewhat
      challenging to find, but typically such areas are less densely populated than
      urban cities.


      2. **Terre du Lac, MO**: Similar to Lake Wisconsin, Terre du Lac is a private,
      unincorporated community in Missouri. It is primarily a residential and recreational
      area, so its population density might also be lower compared to urban standards.


      3. **General Observation**: Both Lake Wisconsin, WI, and Terre du Lac, MO are
      areas that are not major cities and are primarily residential or recreational
      communities. This usually indicates that their population densities are lower
      compared to more urbanized areas.


      Without specific numerical data for population and area, which is not easily
      available for these non-urbanized and lesser-known locations, we can make an
      educated guess based on the nature of these places being rural or recreational
      communities. Typically, such areas are less densely populated compared to urban
      areas.


      Therefore, assuming that no specific data is readily available, I would conclude
      that both places have low population densities, but without concrete data, it''s
      challenging to definitively say which one is more densely populated.


      Thus, the answer cannot be definitively YES or NO without specific data. However,

      - **Montreal, WI** may have a lower density if it is more spread out typical\
      \ of rural areas in Wisconsin.\n\nGiven the usual trends and without specific\
      \ figures, it's more likely that Charenton, LA has a higher population density.\n\
      \n**Final Answer: NO**, Charenton, LA is not more densely populated than Montreal,\
      \ WI based on typical trends and available assumptions. However, this conclusion\
      \ would ideally be verified with specific census data for accuracy."
