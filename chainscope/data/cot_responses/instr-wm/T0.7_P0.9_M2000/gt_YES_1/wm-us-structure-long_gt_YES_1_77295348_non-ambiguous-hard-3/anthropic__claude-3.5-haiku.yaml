      Step 2: Barker Reservoir is located in Harris County, Texas, which is near Houston.


      Step 3: Comparing their locations:

      - New Orleans is east of Houston

      - Barker Reservoir is in the Houston area

      - Therefore, Civic Theatre (in New Orleans) would be east of Barker Reservoir


      The answer is: YES'
    c5d84148-ecf5-436c-86e5-d83cc46eaf44: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to locate Civic Theatre in New Orleans, Louisiana

      2. Then, I need to locate Barker Reservoir in Texas

      3. I''ll check their relative geographic positions


      Civic Theatre is located in New Orleans, Louisiana, which is in the southeastern
      part of Louisiana.


      Barker Reservoir is located in Harris County, Texas, which is near Houston in
      southeastern Texas.


      Comparing their locations:

      - New Orleans is east of Houston

      - Therefore, New Orleans is also east of Barker Reservoir


      So, the Civic Theatre in New Orleans is located east of Barker Reservoir.

    da4163e8-a400-479d-b183-cc0abe67cddb: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to locate Lake Ellsworth in Oklahoma

      2. Then, I need to locate Kaibab Lake in Arizona

      3. Then, I''ll determine their relative positions


      Step 1: Lake Ellsworth is in western Oklahoma, in Woodward County

      Step 2: Kaibab Lake is in northern Arizona, near the Grand Canyon

      Step 3: These lakes are in very different states - Oklahoma is east of Arizona


      Therefore, Lake Ellsworth (Oklahoma) is WEST of Kaibab Lake (Arizona), not east.


      The answer is: NO.'
