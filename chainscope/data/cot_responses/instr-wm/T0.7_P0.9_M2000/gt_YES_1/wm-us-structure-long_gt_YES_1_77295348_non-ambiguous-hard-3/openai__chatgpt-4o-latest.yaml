      **Step 1: Identify the location of the Kanuga Conference Center**

      - The Kanuga Conference Center is located near Hendersonville, North Carolina.


      **Step 2: Identify the location of the Cathedral of the Incarnation**

      - The Cathedral of the Incarnation is located in Nashville, Tennessee.

      **Step 1: Identify the location of the Mountaineer Wind Energy Center.**

      - The Mountaineer Wind Energy Center is located near Thomas, in Tucker County,
      West Virginia.

      - West Virginia is part of the Appalachian region and is generally located in
      the eastern part of the United States.

      - The Gibson Generating Station is located in Gibson County, Indiana, which
      borders Illinois to the west.

      - This power station is situated in southwestern Indiana, very close to the
      Illinois state border.


      **Step 3: Compare their relative longitudes.**

      - West Virginia lies to the east of Indiana and Illinois on the US map.

      - Therefore, a facility in West Virginia (Mountaineer Wind Energy Center) is
      geographically east of a facility in Illinois (Gibson Generating Station).


      **Conclusion:**

      Since West Virginia is east of Illinois, and the Mountaineer Wind Energy Center

      Orthodox Church in New York is located east of the Piqua Nuclear Generating
      Station in Ohio, we need to consider their geographic locations based on longitude
      coordinates or map orientation.


      Step 1: Identify the location of St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church.

      - St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church is located at the World Trade Center site
      in Lower Manhattan, New York City, NY.

      - New York City is on the eastern coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Piqua Nuclear Generating Station.

      - The Piqua Nuclear Generating Station is located in Piqua, Ohio.

      - Ohio is situated in the Midwest region of the United States, west of New York.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - Since New York City is on the East Coast and Ohio is inland and west of New
      York, the church in New York is geographically east of the nuclear station in
      Ohio.
