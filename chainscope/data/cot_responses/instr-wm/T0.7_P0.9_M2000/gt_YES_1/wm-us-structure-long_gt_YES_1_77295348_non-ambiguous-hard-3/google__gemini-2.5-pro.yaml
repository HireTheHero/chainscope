      \nI'm now zeroing in on the crux of the matter: establishing the geographical\
      \ relationship between Durfee Hall in Connecticut and the Genetti Hotel in Pennsylvania.\
      \ My primary task is to pinpoint their respective longitudes. This will be the\
      \ bedrock of my comparison.\n\n\n**Refining Location Specifics**\n\nNow, I'm\
      \ delving deeper into the specifics. I've pinpointed Durfee Hall in New Haven,\
      \ Connecticut, and confirmed the Genetti Hotel's primary location in Williamsport,\
      \ Pennsylvania. My next task is to pinpoint their precise longitudes. This information\
      \ is vital for the upcoming comparison.\n\n\n**Assessing Longitude Differences**\n\
      \nI've now successfully pinpointed the approximate longitudes. Durfee Hall in\
      \ New Haven, Connecticut sits at roughly -72.92 degrees, while the Genetti Hotel\
      \ in Williamsport, Pennsylvania is approximately at -77.00 degrees.  I have\
      \ also identified the approximate longitude for the Wilkes-Barre location. My\
      \ next step is to make the longitude comparison.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Geographical\
      \ Analysis**\n\nAfter gathering longitude information for both locations, I've\
      \ confirmed that Durfee Hall in Connecticut is indeed situated east of both\
      \ Genetti Hotel locations in Pennsylvania. My step-by-step method and calculations\
      \ solidified this finding. The geographical relationships are now resolved and\
      \ ready for further context if needed.\n\n\n**Assessing Geographical Relationship**\n\
      \nI've completed my analysis. Durfee Hall in Connecticut is indeed situated\
      \ east of both Genetti Hotel locations in Pennsylvania. My method involved pinpointing\
      \ longitudes and subsequently comparing them. I confirmed this geographical\
      \ relationship definitively using longitude comparisons.\n\n\n</think>Here is\
      \ the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the location of Durfee Hall,\
      \ CT:** Durfee Hall is a freshman dormitory at Yale University, which is located\
      \ in New Haven, Connecticut.\n2.  **Identify the location of Genetti Hotel,\
      \ PA:** The most well-known Genetti Hotel in Pennsylvania is in Williamsport,\
      \ PA. (There is another in Wilkes-Barre, PA, but the result is the same).\n\
      3.  **Determine the relative longitude:** To determine if one location is east\
      \ of another, we need to compare their longitudes. Locations with a smaller\
      \ West longitude are further east.\n4.  **Compare the longitudes:**\n    * \
      \  New Haven, Connecticut is at approximately 72.9\xB0 West longitude.\n   \
      \ *   Williamsport, Pennsylvania is at approximately 77.0\xB0 West longitude.\n\
      5.  **Conclusion:** Since 72.9\xB0 W is a smaller number than 77.0\xB0 W, New\
      \ Haven, CT is geographically east of Williamsport, PA.\n\nYES"

      \nI've pinpointed the core inquiry: Determining if Durfee Hall, CT, lies east\
      \ of the Genetti Hotel, PA. This boils down to comparing their longitudinal\
      \ positions. I'm breaking down each location to get the necessary coordinates.\n\
      \n\n**Evaluating Latitude Differences**\n\nI've begun the coordinate retrieval\
      \ process. New Haven's longitude is now known. I'm currently researching Williamsport's\
      \ coordinates. I am also cross-checking the Wilkes-Barre coordinates, as the\
      \ Genetti Hotel has multiple locations. This will ensure comprehensive coverage.\n\
      \n\n**Comparing Longitudes and Locations**\n\nNow, I've moved into pinpointing\
      \ the longitude of each location and comparing them. I've got approximate longitudes:\
      \ New Haven, CT at ~72.9\xB0 W, Williamsport, PA at ~77.0\xB0 W, and Wilkes-Barre,\
      \ PA at ~75.9\xB0 W. The comparison shows Durfee Hall *is* east of both Genetti\
      \ locations, confirming the geographical relationship.\n\n\n**Confirming the\
      \ Geographic Relation**\n\nI've formulated the step-by-step logic to answer\
      \ the geographical query. It clarifies the search strategy used to identify\
      \ locations, extract their coordinates, and compare their longitudes. I can\
      \ now confidently state Durfee Hall is east of the Genetti Hotel locations,\
      \ since Durfee's longitude value is less than the others.\n\n\n</think>Here\
      \ is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify Location 1:** Durfee Hall,\
      \ CT is a freshman dormitory at Yale University, located in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\
      2.  **Identify Location 2:** The most well-known Genetti Hotel in Pennsylvania\
      \ is the Genetti Hotel & Suites in Williamsport, PA. (There is also one in Wilkes-Barre,\
      \ PA, but both are west of Connecticut).\n3.  **Determine Relative Positions:**\
      \ The state of Connecticut is located on the East Coast of the United States.\
      \ The state of Pennsylvania is located to the west of Connecticut (separated\
      \ by New York and New Jersey).\n4.  **Compare Longitudes:** New Haven, CT, has\
      \ a longitude of approximately 72.9\xB0 W. Williamsport, PA, has a longitude\
      \ of approximately 77.0\xB0 W. In the Western Hemisphere, a smaller longitude\
      \ number indicates a location further to the east.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since\
      \ 72.9\xB0 W is east of 77.0\xB0 W, Durfee Hall in Connecticut is east of the\
      \ Genetti Hotel in Pennsylvania.\n\nYES"

      \nI've zeroed in on the core geographical query: is Durfee Hall, CT, situated\
      \ east of the Genetti Hotel, PA? My analysis now involves pinpointing these\
      \ locations and examining their relative positioning on a map. I'm leveraging\
      \ readily available geographical data to determine their east-west relationship.\
      \ I'm focusing on pinpointing both locations and establishing the parameters\
      \ for an east-west comparison.\n\n\n**Confirming Geographical Positions**\n\n\
      I'm now zeroing in on the precise coordinates. Durfee Hall, located within Yale\
      \ University in New Haven, CT, is the first focus. The Genetti Hotel locations\
      \ in Williamsport and Wilkes-Barre, PA are the next considerations. I'm focusing\
      \ on locating these coordinates precisely. I'll need to compare their longitudes\
      \ to determine the east-west relationship, with the goal of answering the user's\
      \ geographical query definitively.\n\n\n**Refining Longitude Comparisons**\n\
      \nMy focus has shifted towards the longitude comparisons. I've calculated the\
      \ approximate coordinates for all locations. The longitudes are: Durfee Hall,\
      \ ~ -72.9\xB0; Genetti Hotel, Williamsport, ~ -77.0\xB0; and Genetti Hotel,\
      \ Wilkes-Barre, ~ -75.8\xB0. I'm currently working to pinpoint which Genetti\
      \ Hotel has a valid claim, given my previous assumptions. Next, I'll definitively\
      \ determine which location is further east, according to longitude, and subsequently\
      \ answer the user's geographical question.\n\n\n**Synthesizing Longitudinal\
      \ Data**\n\nI've assembled the longitudes: Durfee Hall in New Haven, CT at approximately\
      \ -72.9\xB0, Genetti Hotel in Williamsport, PA at ~-77.0\xB0, and Genetti Hotel\
      \ in Wilkes-Barre, PA at ~-75.8\xB0.  Now, my focus is on comparing these figures\
      \ to answer the user's initial geographic question. I'll meticulously compare\
      \ and order these to conclusively establish the east-west relationship.\n\n\n\
      **Synthesizing Location Comparisons**\n\nI've precisely pinpointed the locations\
      \ and their longitudes. I have determined that Durfee Hall in New Haven, CT\
      \ (approx. -72.9\xB0), is east of both the Genetti Hotel in Williamsport, PA\
      \ (approx. -77.0\xB0) and Wilkes-Barre, PA (approx. -75.8\xB0), conclusively\
      \ answering the user's initial query. My findings are now complete.\n\n\n</think>Here\
      \ is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify Location 1:** Durfee Hall,\

      \ of New Haven, Connecticut.\n2.  **Identify Location 2:** The Genetti Hotel,\
      \ PA is a historic hotel located in the city of Williamsport, Pennsylvania.\n\
      3.  **Determine Relative Position:** To determine if one location is east of\
      \ another, we need to compare their longitudes. A location with a longitude\
      \ that is less negative (or a smaller number, if considering West as positive)\
      \ is further to the east.\n4.  **Compare Longitudes:**\n    *   The longitude\
      \ of New Haven, Connecticut is approximately 72.9\xB0 West.\n    *   The longitude\
      \ of Williamsport, Pennsylvania is approximately 77.0\xB0 West.\n5.  **Conclusion:**\
      \ Since 72.9\xB0 W is a smaller value than 77.0\xB0 W, New Haven, CT is geographically\
      \ east of Williamsport, PA. Therefore, Durfee Hall is east of the Genetti Hotel.\n\

      \nI'm zeroing in on the geographical coordinates now. My initial task is to\
      \ pin down the longitudes of Durfee Hall in Connecticut and the Genetti Hotel\
      \ in Pennsylvania. This involves a clear comparison of their positions on the\
      \ globe, specifically their east-west locations. I'm focusing on longitude as\
      \ the key factor here, as the user is specifically interested in their relative\
      \ eastward positions.\n\n\n**Determining Eastward Positions**\n\nI've successfully\
      \ identified the coordinates for Durfee Hall at Yale University, specifically\
      \ pinpointing its longitude at approximately -72.92\xB0 W. My focus now shifts\
      \ to the Genetti Hotel in Pennsylvania, comparing its longitude to determine\
      \ which is more eastward. Initial searches for the hotel show options in Williamsport\
      \ and Hazleton, PA. I'll need to pinpoint the correct location and its corresponding\
      \ longitude to complete the analysis.\n\n\n**Confirming Relative Eastwardness**\n\
      \nI've zeroed in on the Genetti Hotel in Williamsport, PA, now that I have its\
      \ location pinpointed. A quick comparison reveals its longitude, approximately\
      \ -77.00\xB0 W, is more negative than Durfee Hall's longitude (-72.92\xB0 W).\
      \ This confirms my initial assessment: Durfee Hall in Connecticut is indeed\
      \ east of the Genetti Hotel in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, though, the Genetti\
      \ in Hazleton, PA has a more eastern longitude than Williamsport. I am almost\
      \ finished!\n\n\n**Verifying Geographic Relationships**\n\nI'm now fully confident\
      \ about my findings. Using the available data, I've confirmed that Durfee Hall\
      \ in Connecticut is east of both Genetti hotels in Pennsylvania. The longitudes\
      \ clearly support this conclusion. Moreover, I've outlined the step-by-step\
      \ reasoning that led me to this accurate assessment, showing how the longitude\
      \ values determine the east-west positions and conclusively satisfying the query.\n\
      \n\n**Synthesizing Findings Conclusively**\n\nI'm now integrating the geographical\
      \ data. I've successfully compared the longitudes of Durfee Hall and both Genetti\
      \ hotels in Pennsylvania. The analysis confirms Durfee Hall is indeed east of\
      \ both, as its longitude is less negative. I've finalized my step-by-step reasoning,\
      \ illustrating how longitude values determine east-west positions and satisfying\
      \ the user query. The answer is \"YES\".\n\n\n</think>Here is the step-by-step\
      \ reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the location of Durfee Hall, CT:** Durfee Hall\
      \ is a freshman residential dormitory at Yale University, located in New Haven,\
      \ Connecticut. The approximate longitude for New Haven, CT is 72.9\xB0 West.\n\
      \n2.  **Identify the location of Genetti Hotel, PA:** There is a well-known\
      \ Genetti Hotel in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The approximate longitude for\
      \ Williamsport, PA is 77.0\xB0 West.\n\n3.  **Compare the longitudes:** To determine\
      \ which location is further east, we compare their longitudes. In the Western\
      \ Hemisphere, a location with a smaller longitude number is further east. For\
      \ example, 72.9\xB0 W is east of 77.0\xB0 W.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since Connecticut\
      \ (72.9\xB0 W) has a smaller longitude value than Pennsylvania (77.0\xB0 W),\
      \ Durfee Hall in Connecticut is located east of the Genetti Hotel in Pennsylvania.\n\

      \nI'm currently focused on the geographical relationship between Durfee Hall\
      \ in CT and Genetti Hotel in PA. Initial steps involve pinpointing the exact\
      \ coordinates (longitude and latitude) of both locations. Then, I'll compare\
      \ the longitudes to determine the easternmost location. This step-by-step approach\
      \ seems promising.\n\n\n**Locating Key Coordinates**\n\nI've successfully identified\
      \ the coordinates for Durfee Hall (Yale University, New Haven, CT) as roughly\
      \ 41.31\xB0 N, -72.92\xB0 W. My next step is to pinpoint the location of the\

      \ the longitudes, I've confirmed Durfee Hall (Yale, -72.92\xB0 W) is indeed\
      \ east of both Genetti Hotels. Comparing longitudes, -72.92\xB0 is less negative\
      \ than both -77.00\xB0 (Williamsport) and -75.88\xB0 (Wilkes-Barre), thus proving\
      \ the eastern position. This systematic review is now conclusive.\n\n\n</think>Here\

      \ W.\n\n2.  **Identify the location of Genetti Hotel, PA:** There are two prominent\
      \ Genetti Hotels in Pennsylvania. One is the Genetti Hotel in Williamsport,\
      \ PA (approximate longitude -77.0\xB0 W), and the other is the Genetti Hotel\
      \ & Suites in Wilkes-Barre, PA (approximate longitude -75.9\xB0 W).\n\n3.  **Compare\
      \ the longitudes:** For a location to be \"east\" of another in the Western\
      \ Hemisphere, it must have a longitude that is less negative (closer to 0\xB0\
      ).\n    *   The longitude of Durfee Hall in New Haven, CT, is approximately\
      \ -72.9\xB0 W.\n    *   The longitudes of both possible Genetti Hotel locations\
      \ in Pennsylvania are -77.0\xB0 W and -75.9\xB0 W.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since\
      \ -72.9 is less negative than both -77.0 and -75.9, New Haven, CT, is geographically\
      \ east of both Williamsport, PA, and Wilkes-Barre, PA. Therefore, Durfee Hall\

      \ to gather some data on their respective longitudes and latitudes.\n\n\n**Analyzing\
      \ Longitude Comparisons**\n\nI've now obtained the longitude coordinates for\

      \ Reservoir is at approximately 74.1\xB0 W, while the Chicago Pumping Station\

      I''ve pinpointed the two locations: Central Christian Church in Henderson, Nevada,
      and Santa Margarita Lake in California. I''m currently focused on gathering
      geographic coordinates or, at the very least, confirmed city and state data
      for each.



      **Assessing the Coordinates**


      I''ve confirmed that Central Christian Church is in Henderson, Nevada, and Santa
      Margarita Lake is in San Luis Obispo County, California. I''m now comparing
      their longitudes, factoring in Nevada''s eastern position relative to California.
      I''ll proceed to sketch a simplified map to cement the spatial relationship
      between the two.



      **Delineating the Spatial Relationship**


      I''ve decided to draw a simple map to cement the geographical positioning, placing
      California on the west and Nevada to its east. I''ve pinpointed Henderson, NV,
      south of Las Vegas, and Santa Margarita Lake, CA, near San Luis Obispo. Next,
      I''ll sketch a longitude line through the lake, and observe where Henderson
      sits relative to this. I then plan to confirm with explicit longitude data for
      final confirmation.



      **Evaluating the Reasoning**


      Now, I''m dissecting the steps. I''m pleased with the clarity in identifying

      \ of Bridge Canyon Dam, AZ, versus Topaz Solar Farm, CA. My next step is to\
      \ deconstruct the given locations. I've begun by focusing on Bridge Canyon Dam,\
      \ AZ.\n\n\n**Mapping Spatial Relationships**\n\nI've successfully pinpointed\
      \ the approximate coordinates for Bridge Canyon Dam (35.98\xB0 N, 113.31\xB0\
      \ W), finding the proposed dam location within the Grand Canyon, Arizona. I\
      \ am now ready to find the coordinates for the Topaz Solar Farm in California,\
      \ which will allow for a direct comparison of their relative longitudes.\n\n\
      \n**Analyzing Longitudinal Positions**\n\nI've successfully gathered the coordinates\
      \ for both locations. A comparison of their longitudes is now underway. Bridge\
      \ Canyon Dam is at approximately 113.31\xB0 W, while Topaz Solar Farm is at\
      \ 120.06\xB0 W. Applying the longitude rule, I can now definitively state their\
      \ relative positions.\n\n\n**Synthesizing Relative Positions**\n\nThe coordinates\

      \ the proposed Bridge Canyon Dam, AZ, lies east of the Topaz Solar Farm, CA.\
      \ I can now confidently formalize my step-by-step reasoning, ready to formulate\
      \ the final answer based on the geographical principles I have applied.\n\n\n\
      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Locate Bridge Canyon Dam,\
      \ AZ:** Bridge Canyon Dam was a proposed, but never built, dam on the Colorado\
      \ River in Mohave County, Arizona. Its proposed location is deep within the\
      \ Grand Canyon, at a longitude of approximately 113.3\xB0 West.\n2.  **Locate\
      \ Topaz Solar Farm, CA:** The Topaz Solar Farm is an existing facility located\
      \ on the Carrizo Plain in San Luis Obispo County, California. Its longitude\
      \ is approximately 120.1\xB0 West.\n3.  **Compare the longitudes:** To determine\
      \ the east-west relationship, we compare the longitudes. In the Western Hemisphere,\
      \ a location with a smaller numerical longitude is further east.\n4.  **Conclusion:**\
      \ Since 113.3\xB0 W is a smaller number than 120.1\xB0 W, the location of Bridge\
      \ Canyon Dam in Arizona is indeed east of the Topaz Solar Farm in California.\n\

      \ longitude at about 110.58\xB0W. Since 104.02 is less than 110.58, I've concluded\
      \ and can definitively state, that Red Bluff Reservoir, TX, is located east\
      \ of Sahuarita Lake, AZ.\n\n\n**Outlining Reasoning Steps**\n\nI've structured\
      \ my reasoning. I first extracted the longitudes: Red Bluff, TX, at approximately\
      \ 104.02\xB0 W, and Sahuarita Lake, AZ, at around 110.58\xB0 W. Next, I outlined\
      \ the comparison methodology, where a smaller westward longitude designates\
      \ a more eastern location. Finally, I plan to formulate a conclusion based on\
      \ the comparison.\n\n\n</think>Here is a step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Find\
      \ the location of Red Bluff Reservoir, TX:** Red Bluff Reservoir is located\
      \ in West Texas, on the border with New Mexico. Its longitude is approximately\
      \ 104\xB0 W.\n2.  **Find the location of Sahuarita Lake, AZ:** Sahuarita Lake\
      \ is in the town of Sahuarita, Arizona, just south of Tucson. Its longitude\
      \ is approximately 111\xB0 W.\n3.  **Compare the longitudes:** In the Western\
      \ Hemisphere, a smaller longitude number means the location is further east.\
      \ Since 104 is a smaller number than 111, Red Bluff Reservoir is east of Sahuarita\
      \ Lake.\n\nYES"

      I''ve established that Milford Lake is in Kansas and Fitzsimons Army Medical
      Center is in Colorado. I determined that Kansas lies east of Colorado, meaning
      any point in Kansas will be east of any point in Colorado. Therefore, Milford
      Lake is located east of Fitzsimons Army Medical Center. Now, I''m working through
      a step-by-step reasoning process to solidify my understanding.



      **Analyzing the Logic Flow**


      I''ve broken down the reasoning into a clear, step-by-step structure. I''ve
      pinpointed the locations and their states, mapped their geographic relationship,
      and applied that relationship to the specific locations. I''ve formulated a
      concise, logical chain of thought to arrive at a definitive ''yes'' answer,
      confirming Milford Lake is east of Fitzsimons. I feel confident in this conclusion.



      </think>Here is a step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to identify the location of Milford Lake, KS. Milford Lake
      is a large reservoir located in the state of Kansas.

      2.  Next, we need to identify the location of Fitzsimons Army Medical Center,
      CO. This facility is located in Aurora, a city in the state of Colorado.

      3.  Finally, we compare the geographical positions of the states of Kansas and
      Colorado. On a map of the United States, the state of Kansas is located directly
      to the east of the state of Colorado.

      4.  Therefore, any location in Kansas is east of any location in Colorado.

      I''m focusing on the spatial relationship. My current thinking is about the
      specific locations. I need to determine the precise coordinates for both the
      Santa Fe cathedral and the Flagstaff theater. Then, I''ll be able to determine
      the relative east-west positions for a definitive answer.



      **Refining the Spatial Logic**


      I''ve refined my approach. Initially, I sought coordinates, but it seems unnecessary.
      Knowing the general geographical relationship between New Mexico and Arizona
      suffices. I recall the broader US map; since Santa Fe is in New Mexico, and
      New Mexico is east of Arizona, the Cathedral is east of the theater. This simplifies
      the process significantly.



      **Evaluating the Reasoning Process**


      I''ve reviewed the individual steps of the thought process, confirming the logical
      flow from question to answer. The crucial element was the comparison of longitudes,
      and I''ve validated both the initial geographic assumption and the subsequent
      numerical comparison. The final "YES" answer feels robust.



      **Solidifying the Synthesis**


      I''m now focusing on the structure of the final response. I''ve outlined each
      step clearly to demonstrate how I arrived at my conclusion. My goal is to present
      the information logically, starting with location identification and moving
      through geographical comparison to the final YES answer. I will summarize the
      core steps. I need a concise and easily understood presentation.

      2.  **Identify the second location:** The Orpheum Theater is located in Flagstaff,
      Arizona.

      3.  **Compare the geographical locations of the two states/cities:** The state
      of New Mexico is entirely east of the state of Arizona. Therefore, Santa Fe,
      New Mexico is east of Flagstaff, Arizona.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Since the Cathedral is in Santa Fe and the Theater is in
      Flagstaff, the Cathedral is east of the Theater.

      as the two key locations. Now, my focus is zeroing in on their precise geographic
      coordinates. I need to understand their relative positions to build the mental
      map.



      **Establishing Relative Position**


      I''ve determined the Astor Theatre is east of Leesville Lake based on their
      longitudes. Further, I''m noting the distinction between the Western Hemisphere''s
      longitude conventions, wherein smaller values signify positions further east.
      This refined understanding helps me orient the locations within my mental map.



      **Clarifying the East-West Relationship**


      I''ve refined my reasoning concerning the east-west relationship between the
      locations. Focusing on the longitude values, I''ve confirmed that a smaller
      Western Hemisphere longitude signifies a more easterly position. With this,
      I''ve established that the Astor Theatre, with its smaller longitude, indeed
      lies east of Leesville Lake. My understanding is now solid, and the mental map
      is taking shape.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of Astor Theatre:** The Astor Theatre is in New
      York City, New York.

      2.  **Identify the location of Leesville Lake:** Leesville Lake is in the state
      of Ohio.

      3.  **Compare the geographic positions of the two states:** The state of New
      York is located on the East Coast of the United States. The state of Ohio is
      located in the Midwest, which is west of New York.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, any location in New York City is geographically
      east of any location in Ohio.

      on to the more specific location analysis.



      **Synthesizing the Answer**


      I''ve established a clear step-by-step methodology. Firstly, identifying the
      states. Secondly, using my internal knowledge of US geography, I''ve confirmed
      Tennessee is east of Arkansas. Subsequently, I verified the locations within
      their respective states to be absolutely certain. Finally, I''m preparing a
      concise answer, following the specified format.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to locate Tellico Reservoir. It is in the state of Tennessee
      (TN).

      2.  Next, we need to locate Nimrod Lake. It is in the state of Arkansas (AR).

      3.  Finally, we compare the geographical locations of the two states. The state
      of Tennessee is located entirely to the east of the state of Arkansas.

      4.  Therefore, any location within Tennessee will be east of any location within
      Arkansas.

      Schenectady, at around -73.9 degrees longitude, is clearly east of the Allegheny
      Reservoir, which I''ve pinpointed near Kinzua Dam at approximately -78.9 degrees.
      This confirms that my geographical understanding of east versus west is correct.
      I''m now analyzing the implications of this relative positioning for the task
      at hand.

      I''ve got the exact coordinates, and I''m revisiting the relative positioning.  My
      analysis of longitudes confirms that Schenectady is indeed east of the Allegheny
      Reservoir. The calculations, -73.9 degrees versus -78.9 degrees, are accurate.

      their respective longitude values.



      **Analyzing Positional Data**


      I''ve pinpointed the key east/west inquiry and the two central locations: Pathfinder
      Reservoir in Wyoming and C.J. Strike Dam in Idaho. Now, I''m examining their
      respective longitudes for a direct comparison. The map confirms Wyoming is east
      of Idaho, so Pathfinder should be the easternmost point.



      **Pinpointing Eastward Location**


      I''ve clarified the core question: Pathfinder Reservoir''s eastward position
      compared to C.J. Strike Dam. Identified Pathfinder in Wyoming and C.J. Strike
      in Idaho. I''m recalling the relative positions of the states and refining the
      locations within each. Now, I''m ready to directly compare their longitudes,

      I''m currently trying to establish whether the Independent Presbyterian Church
      in Birmingham, AL is situated east of the Blackstone Hotel in Fort Worth. My
      initial approach involves comparing their longitudes. I''ve begun locating these
      landmarks on a map and plan to analyze their precise coordinates to determine
      the relative positions. It seems a direct longitude comparison will be sufficient.



      **Mapping Coordinate Acquisition**


      I''ve successfully identified the necessary geographic information for both
      locations: the Independent Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, AL, and the Blackstone
      Hotel in Fort Worth, TX. The next step involves pinpointing their precise coordinates.
      I''m focusing on obtaining their longitudes to determine the eastward/westward
      relationship. This comparison of longitudinal positions should definitively
      reveal the answer to the user''s core question.



      **Comparing Geographic Positions**


      I''ve completed the initial analysis of the spatial relationship. My reasoning
      is clear: the Independent Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, AL, is indeed located
      east of the Blackstone Hotel in Fort Worth, TX. The city of Birmingham''s longitude
      is less negative than Fort Worth''s, confirming its eastward positioning, which
      answers the core question.



      **Synthesizing the Spatial Analysis**


      After meticulously deconstructing the user''s query, I''ve honed in on the core
      question: is one landmark east of another. My process involves pinpointing both
      locations and comparing longitudes. I''ve broken down the steps, ensuring the
      logic is sound and the final "YES" answer is justified, based on a clear geographical
      analysis of the data. The solution is now complete.

      \ (approximately 102.2\xB0 W) and the Basilica of San Albino (approximately\

      \ east of the basilica.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Geographical Data**\n\nI've gathered\
      \ the longitudes: approximately 102.2\xB0 W for the wind farm and 106.78\xB0\

      \ a clear and concise answer. The comparison of the longitudes of 102.2\xB0\
      \ W (wind farm) and 106.78\xB0 W (basilica) shows that, in the Western Hemisphere,\
      \ a smaller longitude value means a location is east of a location with a larger\

      I''ve homed in on the user''s core inquiry: determining if Sterling Memorial
      Library sits east of Mississinewa Lake Dam. My focus is on deciphering the geographical
      relationship between these two points. I''ve begun to break down the question,
      isolating the locations for further analysis.



      **Mapping Relative Locations**


      I''ve isolated the key locations, Sterling Memorial Library in New Haven, CT,
      and Mississinewa Lake Dam near Peru, IN. State coordinates are the next step.
      Then, the geographical relationship will be determined. Connecticut is much
      further east than Indiana. Thus, Sterling Memorial Library is east of the dam.



      **Reasoning Through Location**


      I''m now satisfied with the logical progression. I''ve dissected the question
      into manageable parts, pinpointing the two locations and their respective geographical
      positions. I''ve mentally mapped the states, solidifying my conclusion that

      definitive: Yes. The user''s question has been answered!



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of Sterling Memorial Library.** Sterling Memorial
      Library is part of Yale University, which is located in New Haven, Connecticut.

      2.  **Identify the location of Mississinewa Lake Dam.** Mississinewa Lake Dam
      is located in the state of Indiana, near the city of Peru.

      3.  **Compare the geographical positions of the two states.** On a map of the
      United States, Connecticut is an East Coast state, and Indiana is a Midwestern
      state.

      4.  **Determine the relative direction.** The entire state of Connecticut is
      located to the east of the entire state of Indiana. Therefore, Sterling Memorial

      of the St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church in New York.



      **Comparing the Locations**


      I''ve moved on to comparing the geographical positions. I''ve determined that
      St. Nicholas Church is in Manhattan and the Piqua station is in Ohio. Next,
      I''ll compare the longitudinal positions to determine which location is further
      east.



      **Mapping the Reasoning**


      I''ve formalized the step-by-step logic. First, I located the two sites geographically.
      Then, I considered their relative east-west positions. New York City is on the
      coast; Piqua is inland. I''ve confirmed that the St. Nicholas Church is indeed
      east of the Ohio generating station, completing the core analysis.

      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of St. Raphael''s Cathedral:** The cathedral is
      in Dubuque, Iowa.

      2.  **Locate Dubuque, Iowa:** Dubuque is a city in the far eastern part of Iowa,
      situated on the Mississippi River.

      3.  **Identify the location of Lake Francis Case:** Lake Francis Case is a large
      reservoir on the Missouri River in south-central South Dakota.

      4.  **Compare the longitude of the two locations:** The entire state of Iowa
      is located to the east of the entire state of South Dakota. Therefore, a location
      in eastern Iowa (Dubuque) is geographically east of a location in central South
      Dakota (Lake Francis Case).

      I''ve started by identifying the core question: Does the Brewster-Douglass Housing
      Projects'' location in Michigan lie east of the Basilica of St. John in Des
      Moines, Iowa? Currently, the task has been broken down into two main components.
      First, I need to identify the location of the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects.



      **Determining Relative Positions**


      I''ve pinpointed Detroit, Michigan, as the location of the Brewster-Douglass
      Housing Projects. Conversely, the Basilica of St. John is in Des Moines, Iowa.
      After that, I''ve mentally visualized a U.S. map. Given that Michigan is east
      of Iowa, the Brewster-Douglass projects are, in fact, east of the Basilica.
      The problem is solved.



      **Outlining the Methodology**


      I''ve now methodically broken down the problem, establishing Detroit, Michigan,
      as the Brewster-Douglass Projects'' location and the Basilica of St. John''s
      in Des Moines, Iowa. Next, I''m verifying the relative east-west positions of
      each locale. I''m structuring the response with clear, sequential steps to ensure
      clarity and precision. The conclusion will be straightforward, confirming the
      projects'' eastern location.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **First, we need to identify the location of the Brewster-Douglass Housing
      Projects.** The projects were located in Detroit, Michigan.

      2.  **Second, we need to identify the location of the Basilica of St. John.**
      The basilica is located in Des Moines, Iowa, as stated in the question.

      3.  **Third, we need to compare the geographical positions of these two locations.**
      Detroit, Michigan is located significantly to the east of Des Moines, Iowa.
      You would travel west from Detroit to reach Des Moines.


      Therefore, the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects in Detroit, MI, are located
      east of the Basilica of St. John in Des Moines, IA.

      **Defining Relative Position**


      I''ve confirmed the cities for each location: Detroit, Michigan, and Des Moines,
      Iowa. Now I''m leaning towards using longitude to confirm their relative positions
      with certainty. I''ve started searching for the longitudes of each city.



      **Finalizing the Synthesis**


      I''ve now got all the key components aligned. Detroit is east of Des Moines.
      I''ve formulated a structured answer, detailing the steps. I''ll start by identifying

      I''ve started by clearly establishing the core inquiry: is the Wellmont Theater
      east of the LaDue Reservoir? This is a straightforward geographic comparison,
      which will demand a specific, definitive "yes" or "no" response. I''ve broken
      it down to the two critical locations I''ll be comparing.



      **Confirming the Geographic Comparison**


      I''ve refined my approach by pinpointing the cities. The Wellmont Theater''s
      in Montclair, New Jersey, while the LaDue Reservoir is situated in Auburn, Ohio,
      in Geauga County. My next step is to compare their longitudes to verify their
      relative east-west positions. This verification will yield the final answer.



      **Formulating a Detailed Plan**


      The process is becoming more structured. I''ve broken down the initial query,
      identifying the Wellmont Theater in Montclair, New Jersey, and the LaDue Reservoir
      in Geauga County, Ohio. I''m gathering the geographical coordinates to provide

      I''ve zeroed in on the crux of the matter: determining if the Wellmont Theater
      in New Jersey lies east of the LaDue Reservoir in Ohio. It''s a straightforward
      geographical comparison, demanding a binary response. I''ve begun by parsing
      the question and pinpointing the theater''s location.



      **Evaluating State Comparisons**


      I''ve refined my analysis. I''ve gathered that New Jersey is positioned east
      of Ohio. Therefore, irrespective of pinpointing exact longitudes, a definitive
      "yes" is the accurate response. This eliminates the need for precise coordinate
      calculations.



      **Dissecting Geographic Data**


      I''ve progressed by breaking down the question into manageable components: locating
      the theater and reservoir, then comparing their longitudinal positions. My research
      yielded specific locations and longitudes. Now I''m focused on synthesizing
      these facts into a clear, concise answer and validating my answer based on the

      and the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project in Wyoming. Currently,
      I''m focusing on pinpointing their exact geographic coordinates, or at least
      solidifying their state locations.



      **Establishing Relative Positions**


      I''ve confirmed the relative east-west positions of the two sites. After pinpointing
      their states, Wyoming and Iowa, a quick map check established Wyoming''s western
      location relative to Iowa. This directly answers the question: St. Ambrose Cathedral
      in Des Moines, Iowa, is indeed east of the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind
      Energy Project in Wyoming. The final answer formulation is nearly complete.



      **Refining the Logic**


      I''m now fully confident about the eastern position of St. Ambrose Cathedral.
      I''ve broken down the reasoning into discrete, confirmable steps, starting with
      identifying the locations, pinpointing states, and then comparing their positions.
      It''s a solid, straightforward approach that leaves no room for ambiguity. I''ve
      concluded that the answer is "YES", confirming the spatial relation.

      numbers is my current focus.



      **Analyzing State Positions**


      I''ve determined the state locations for both St. Ambrose Cathedral (Iowa) and
      the wind project (Wyoming). Iowa''s Midwest position is to the east of Wyoming''s
      Mountain West location.  Therefore, any point in Iowa will inherently be east
      of any point in Wyoming. I''m building out the logical steps to demonstrate
      this definitively.



      **Defining the Logic**


      I''ve outlined the step-by-step reasoning needed to answer the question. I will
      determine if the cathedral is east of the wind project. I started by identifying
      each location. Next, I defined their states and geographical region. Finally,
      I compared the relative positions of the two states, Iowa and Wyoming, to formulate
      the final answer.

      I''m zeroing in on the central query: Is Jocassee Dam east of Lewis Smith Lake?
      I''ve broken it down into two specific locations: Jocassee Dam in South Carolina
      and Lewis Smith Lake in Alabama. Now, I need to analyze the relative geographic
      positions of these two points. This will likely involve using map data and comparing
      their longitudes.



      **Comparing Longitudes Directly**


      I''ve confirmed that Jocassee Dam is in northwestern South Carolina, in Pickens
      County, and Lewis Smith Lake is in northern Alabama, spanning Cullman, Walker,
      and Winston counties. My next step is to directly compare the longitudes of
      the two locations. This will solidify the conclusion, even though a state-level
      comparison already suggests the answer. I anticipate needing a reliable source
      to obtain these specific coordinates.

      now see the path forward. Jocassee Dam, with a smaller longitude, is demonstrably
      *east* of Lewis Smith Lake. The geographical puzzle is solved.



      **Outlining Logical Steps**


      I''m now formalizing the argument with enumerated steps for clarity. It seems
      the most direct proof relies on the state-level geographical relationship: SC
      is east of AL. Checking longitudes is a valuable confirmation, but the state-level
      comparison is quicker and less prone to coordinate data variances. I''ll formalize

      \nI'm currently pinpointing the core query: Is Lake Ellsworth, OK, east of Kaibab\
      \ Lake, AZ? My next step is to gather the geographic coordinates for Lake Ellsworth\
      \ to compare with those of Kaibab Lake.\n\n\n**Analyzing Locational Comparisons**\n\
      \nI've now acquired the longitudes for both lakes. Lake Ellsworth sits at roughly\
      \ 98.4\xB0 W, and Kaibab Lake resides at about 112.1\xB0 W. The crucial comparison\
      \ is now underway. Next, I'll assess the relative positions based on these longitude\
      \ readings to give the answer.\n\n\n**Determining Relative Positioning**\n\n\
      I've finalized the critical comparison phase. Knowing that smaller Western longitudes\
      \ mean locations are more eastward, I compared 98.4\xB0 W (Lake Ellsworth) and\
      \ 112.1\xB0 W (Kaibab Lake). Because 98.4\xB0 is less than 112.1\xB0, the conclusion\
      \ is clear: Lake Ellsworth lies to the east. Next, I'll formulate the response.\n\
      \n\n</think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Locate Lake Ellsworth,\
      \ OK:** Lake Ellsworth is a reservoir located in southwestern Oklahoma, near\
      \ the city of Lawton. Its approximate longitude is 98.4\xB0 West.\n2.  **Locate\
      \ Kaibab Lake, AZ:** Kaibab Lake is located in northern Arizona, near the city\
      \ of Williams and south of the Grand Canyon. Its approximate longitude is 112.1\xB0\
      \ West.\n3.  **Compare the longitudes:** To determine which location is further\
      \ east, we compare their longitudes. In the Western Hemisphere, a smaller longitude\
      \ number indicates a position further to the east. Since 98.4 is a smaller number\
      \ than 112.1, Lake Ellsworth is located to the east of Kaibab Lake.\n\nYES"

      **Comparing Geographic Coordinates**


      I''ve pinpointed the core question and deconstructed the locations. Now, it''s
      clear that Oklahoma is east of Arizona. Therefore, any location in Oklahoma,

      \nI've compared the longitudes now, and the analysis is done. Starting with\
      \ finding the approximate longitudes of each location. DeGray Lake, AR's, longitude\
      \ is roughly -93.1\xB0 W, and Blue Canyon Wind Farm, OK's, is about -98.4\xB0\

      \ the location of DeGray Lake, AR.** DeGray Lake is located in southwestern\
      \ Arkansas. Its approximate longitude is 93.1\xB0 West.\n2.  **Find the location\
      \ of Blue Canyon Wind Farm, OK.** The Blue Canyon Wind Farm is located in southwestern\
      \ Oklahoma, near the towns of Lawton and Elgin. Its approximate longitude is\
      \ 98.4\xB0 West.\n3.  **Compare the longitudes.** To determine if one location\
      \ is east of another, we compare their longitudes. A location with a smaller\
      \ longitude value (a number closer to 0\xB0 on the West side of the Prime Meridian)\
      \ is to the east.\n4.  **Conclusion.** Since 93.1\xB0 W is a smaller longitude\
      \ than 98.4\xB0 W, DeGray Lake, AR is located to the east of Blue Canyon Wind\
      \ Farm, OK.\n\nYES"
