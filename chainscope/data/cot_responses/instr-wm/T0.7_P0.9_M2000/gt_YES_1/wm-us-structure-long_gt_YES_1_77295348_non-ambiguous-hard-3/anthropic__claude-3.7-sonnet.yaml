      the west and Kansas to the east)


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Council Grove Lake is in east-central Kansas

      - Auraria Campus is in Denver, Colorado, which is in the eastern portion of
      Colorado near the Kansas border


      Step 4: Apply directional reasoning.

      2) Sahuarita Lake is located in Arizona (AZ), specifically in southern Arizona

      - Arizona is in the southwestern US

      - Texas is in the south-central US

      - When moving from Arizona to Texas, you travel eastward

      This lake is in Pennsylvania, which is west of New York State.


      3) To determine east/west relationships in the United States, I need to consider
      that the east coast is on the Atlantic Ocean, and as you move inland (westward),
      you reach states like Pennsylvania.


      4) New York City is on the Atlantic coast, while Pennsylvania is an inland state
      that borders New York State to the west.


      5) Since 120 Wall Street is in Manhattan (NYC) on the east coast, and East Branch
      Clarion River Lake is in Pennsylvania which is west of New York, 120 Wall Street
      must be east of the lake.


      YES, 120 Wall Street, NY is located east of East Branch Clarion River Lake,
      PA.'

      Step 1: Determine the location of Astor Theatre in New York City, NY.

      New York City is located on the east coast of the United States, in the state
      of New York.


      Step 2: Determine the location of Leesville Lake in Ohio, OH.

      Ohio is a midwestern state, located west of New York state.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      When we look at a map of the United States, New York is clearly east of Ohio.
      Any location in New York City (including the Astor Theatre) would be east of
      any location in Ohio (including Leesville Lake).


      Step 4: Confirm the directional relationship.

      Moving from Ohio to New York means traveling eastward. Therefore, New York City
      is east of any point in Ohio.

      that Causey Reservoir must be east of Trinity Dam.


      NO WAIT - I should be more precise. While Utah is generally east of California,
      I need to verify the specific locations, as border areas could create exceptions.


      Step 4: Checking more carefully:

      Step 1: Let me identify the general locations of New York and Ohio on the US
      map.

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States

      - Ohio is in the Midwest, west of New York


      Step 2: More specifically, let''s consider the locations:

      - Barrow Street Theatre is in New York City, which is in the southeastern part
      of New York state

      - Rosary Cathedral is in Toledo, Ohio, which is in the northwestern part of
      Ohio

      Step 2: Determine the general geographic relationship between these states.

      - North Carolina is located to the east of Tennessee

      - Tennessee borders North Carolina on North Carolina''s western border


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations of these lakes within their states.

      - While lakes could be positioned anywhere within their respective states, the
      fact that these states border each other with NC to the east of TN means that
      most locations in NC are east of most locations in TN.

      - Without specific coordinates, we can rely on the general state positions.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on geography.

      - Since Badin Lake is in NC and Chickamauga Lake is in TN, and NC is east of

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral is located in Seattle, Washington, which is
      in western Washington state near Puget Sound.

      - Lower Granite Dam is on the Snake River in eastern Washington state.


      Step 2: Consider Washington state''s geography.

      - Washington state extends from the Pacific Ocean in the west to Idaho in the
      east.

      - Seattle is very close to the western edge of the state, near the Pacific Ocean.

      - The Snake River forms part of the border between Washington and Idaho in the
      eastern part of the state.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      - Seattle is in western Washington.

      - Lower Granite Dam is in eastern Washington.

      - In the United States, east is toward the Atlantic Ocean, and west is toward
      the Pacific Ocean.

      - Lake Hudson is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Tennessee and Oklahoma.

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States


      Step 3: More specifically, Tennessee is east of Oklahoma. Tennessee borders
      North Carolina to its east, while Oklahoma borders Arkansas to its east.


      Step 4: Since Memphis is in the western part of Tennessee (on the Mississippi
      River at the western border of the state), and Lake Hudson is somewhere within
      Oklahoma, I need to compare their specific locations.


      Step 5: Even though Memphis is in western Tennessee, the entire state of Tennessee
      is still east of Oklahoma. The easternmost part of Oklahoma is still west of
      the westernmost part of Tennessee.


      Step 6: Therefore, St. Mary''s Episcopal Cathedral in Memphis, Tennessee must
      be east of Lake Hudson in Oklahoma.


      NO


      Wait, I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me correct this:


      YES - St. Mary''s Episcopal Cathedral in Memphis, Tennessee is located east
      of Lake Hudson in Oklahoma, because Tennessee is entirely east of Oklahoma on

      of DeGray Lake in Arkansas and Blue Canyon Wind Farm in Oklahoma.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - DeGray Lake is in Arkansas (AR)

      - Blue Canyon Wind Farm is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of these states.

      - Oklahoma is directly west of Arkansas on the US map


      Step 3: Since the two locations are in adjacent states, and Oklahoma is west
      of Arkansas, any location in Arkansas (including DeGray Lake) would be east
      of any location in Oklahoma (including Blue Canyon Wind Farm).


      NO, DeGray Lake, AR is not located east of Blue Canyon Wind Farm, OK. It''s
      actually located to the east of it.


      Wait, I made a logical error in my conclusion. If Oklahoma is west of Arkansas,
      then Arkansas is east of Oklahoma. So DeGray Lake (in Arkansas) would be east
      of Blue Canyon Wind Farm (in Oklahoma).


      YES, DeGray Lake, AR is located east of Blue Canyon Wind Farm, OK.'
