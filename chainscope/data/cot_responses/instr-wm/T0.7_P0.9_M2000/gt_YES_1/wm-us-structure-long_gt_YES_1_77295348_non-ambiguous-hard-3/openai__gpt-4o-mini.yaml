    05a1d809-5f77-436c-8d70-631eb7ad8028: 'To determine if Durfee Hall, CT is located
      east of Genetti Hotel, PA, we need to identify the locations of both structures.


      1. **Locate Durfee Hall, CT**: Durfee Hall is located in Connecticut. Specifically,
      it is on the campus of the University of Connecticut in Storrs.


      2. **Locate Genetti Hotel, PA**: The Genetti Hotel is located in Williamsport,
      Pennsylvania.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: To compare their positions, we can
      look at a map. Connecticut is situated to the northeast of Pennsylvania. Storrs,
      CT, where Durfee Hall is located, is north of Williamsport, PA.


      4. **Assess the east-west position**: Since Connecticut is generally northeast
      of Pennsylvania, Durfee Hall is not east but actually north of Genetti Hotel.


      Based on this reasoning, we conclude that Durfee Hall is not located east of
      the Genetti Hotel.


      The answer is NO.'

      Church in New York City is located east of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church in Chicago,
      we need to consider the geographical locations of both churches.


      1. **Location of Brick Presbyterian Church**: Brick Presbyterian Church is located
      in Manhattan, New York City, which is situated on the east coast of the United
      States.


      2. **Location of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church**: St. Stanislaus Kostka Church

      more towards the central part of the United States, slightly west of New York
      City.


      3. **Comparing the Longitudes**: New York City (Brick Presbyterian Church) has
      a longitude of approximately -74 degrees, while Chicago (St. Stanislaus Kostka
      Church) has a longitude of approximately -87 degrees. Since longitudes increase
      as you move westward, this means that New York City is east of Chicago.


      Based on this reasoning, Brick Presbyterian Church (New York City) is indeed
      located east of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church (Chicago).

      1. **Basilica of Regina Pacis** is located in Brooklyn, New York.

      2. **Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus** is located in Joliet, Illinois.


      Next, we need to determine their relative positions:


      - Brooklyn, NY is located on the eastern coast of the United States.

      - Joliet, IL is located in the Midwest region of the United States, roughly
      southwest of New York.


      Now, if we visualize or map these locations, we can determine their east-west
      positions:


      - New York (where the Basilica is located) is generally east of Illinois (where
      the Cathedral is located).


      Since we are determining whether the Basilica of Regina Pacis is located east
      of the Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus, we can conclude:
