      2. **Locate Genetti Hotel, PA:** There are several Genetti Hotels in Pennsylvania.  For
      the sake of being thorough, let''s assume the question refers to the most prominent
      one, the Genetti Hotel and Conference Center in Wilkes-Barre, PA.  Even if it
      refers to another Genetti location, it''s highly unlikely to change the overall
      east/west relationship with New Haven, CT.

      Haven, CT is further east than Wilkes-Barre, PA.

      locations of both structures to determine their relative east/west positions.

      2. **Determine longitude:** Longitude is the key factor in determining east/west
      location.  A location further east will have a higher degree of longitude (in
      the Western Hemisphere, where both these locations are).

      3. **Compare longitudes:**  Once we have the longitudes, we can compare them
      to answer the question.


      Basilica of Regina Pacis, NY is in Brooklyn, New York.  New York is generally
      east of Illinois.


      Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus is in Joliet, Illinois.


      Therefore, the Basilica of Regina Pacis is likely east of the Cathedral of St.
      Raymond Nonnatus.

      We need to determine the longitude of each basilica.  Longitude is the east-west
      measurement on a map.


      2. **Basilica of Regina Pacis, NY:** This is in Brooklyn, New York. New York
      is on the East Coast.


      3. **Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus, IL:** This is in Joliet, Illinois. Illinois
      is in the Midwest.


      4. **East vs. West:**  Generally, locations on the East Coast of the US are
      further east in longitude than locations in the Midwest.


      5. **Conclusion:** Since New York is east of Illinois, the Basilica of Regina
      Pacis is east of the Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus.

      Pacis is) and Joliet, IL.

      2. **East/West comparison:**  Brooklyn is on the East Coast, and Joliet, Illinois
      is in the Midwest.  Generally, locations on the East Coast are east of locations
      in the Midwest.

      3. **Specific Longitude:** If we wanted to be absolutely certain, we could look
      up the longitude of both locations.  Longitude increases as you move west. A
      lower longitude for Brooklyn would confirm it''s east of Joliet.
