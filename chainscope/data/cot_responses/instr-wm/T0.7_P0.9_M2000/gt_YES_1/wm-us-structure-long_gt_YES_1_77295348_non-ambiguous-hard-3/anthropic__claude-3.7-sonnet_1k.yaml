      is located east of Genetti Hotel, PA, I need to identify their locations and
      compare them.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Durfee Hall in Connecticut is located.

      Durfee Hall appears to be a building at Yale University, which is in New Haven,
      Connecticut.


      Step 2: Let me identify where the Genetti Hotel in Pennsylvania is located.

      The Genetti Hotel is likely in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, though there may
      be other Genetti Hotels in Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Now I need to determine which is further east.

      Connecticut is a state that is located east of Pennsylvania on the U.S. map.
      Connecticut is on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while Pennsylvania
      is more inland, though still in the eastern part of the country.

      To answer this, I need to understand the relative geographic positions of these
      two places. In the United States, states on the East Coast are arranged roughly
      from north to south, but also from east to west in some cases.


      Connecticut (CT) is one of the New England states, located in the northeastern
      part of the United States. Pennsylvania (PA) is located south and west of Connecticut.


      In general, Connecticut is east of Pennsylvania. So a building in Connecticut
      would typically be east of a building in Pennsylvania.


      Therefore, Durfee Hall in CT would be east of Genetti Hotel in PA.</think>To
      determine if Durfee Hall, CT is located east of Genetti Hotel, PA, I need to
      analyze the relative geographic positions of Connecticut and Pennsylvania.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' locations.

      Connecticut (CT) is located in the northeastern United States, part of the New
      England region.

      Pennsylvania (PA) is located southwest of Connecticut.


      Step 2: Analyze the geographic relationship.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Connecticut is positioned entirely to
      the east of Pennsylvania. The eastern border of Pennsylvania doesn''t extend
      farther east than the western border of Connecticut.


      Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the specific locations.

      Since Durfee Hall is in Connecticut and Genetti Hotel is in Pennsylvania, and
      Connecticut is east of Pennsylvania, it follows that Durfee Hall would be east
      of Genetti Hotel.


      YES, Durfee Hall, CT is located east of Genetti Hotel, PA.'

      (PA).


      To solve this, I need to understand the relative positions of Connecticut and
      Pennsylvania.


      In the United States:

      - Connecticut is located in the New England region on the east coast

      - Pennsylvania is located in the Mid-Atlantic region, also on the east coast
      but west of Connecticut


      The general geographic relationship is that Connecticut is east of Pennsylvania.
      This is true for the states as a whole.


      Now, specific buildings within these states would follow the same general relationship
      unless they were located at unusual border areas. Durfee Hall in CT would typically
      be east of any building in PA, including the Genetti Hotel.


      So based on the geographic locations of these states, Durfee Hall in Connecticut
      would be east of Genetti Hotel in Pennsylvania.</think># Is Durfee Hall, CT

      - Connecticut (CT) is located in New England on the eastern seaboard of the
      US

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is located in the Mid-Atlantic region, west of Connecticut


      ## Step 2: Determine relative positioning

      - All of Connecticut is geographically east of Pennsylvania

      - Therefore, any building in Connecticut (including Durfee Hall) would be east
      of any building in Pennsylvania (including Genetti Hotel)


      ## Conclusion

      YES, Durfee Hall in Connecticut is located east of Genetti Hotel in Pennsylvania.'

      About Geographic Locations


      To determine whether Sparks Shot Tower in Pennsylvania is east of the Cathedral
      of Saint Mary of the Immaculate Conception in Peoria, Illinois, I need to compare
      their geographic positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Sparks Shot Tower is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - The Cathedral is in Peoria, Illinois (IL)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic position of these states

      - Pennsylvania is located on the eastern side of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region

      - On a map of the United States, Pennsylvania is clearly east of Illinois


      ## Step 3: Consider specific locations

      - Even without knowing the exact coordinates, any location in Pennsylvania would
      be east of a location in central Illinois like Peoria

      - Pennsylvania''s western border is still east of Illinois'' eastern border

      Church in Henderson, Nevada is located east of Santa Margarita Lake in California,
      I need to figure out the relative positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Establish the locations.

      - Central Christian Church is in Henderson, Nevada.

      - Santa Margarita Lake is in California.


      Step 2: Think about the general geography of Nevada and California.

      California is on the west coast of the United States, while Nevada is directly
      east of California. In general, locations in Nevada tend to be east of locations
      in California.


      Step 3: Be more specific about these particular locations.

      Henderson is in southern Nevada, near Las Vegas, which is in the eastern part
      of the state.

      Santa Margarita Lake is in California, but I need to determine where exactly.
      Based on my knowledge, Santa Margarita Lake is in San Luis Obispo County, which
      is on the central coast of California.


      Step 4: Compare the east-west positions.

      Since Nevada is east of California, and Henderson is in the eastern part of
      Nevada, while Santa Margarita Lake is on the central coast of California, it
      follows that Central Christian Church in Henderson, Nevada would be east of
      Santa Margarita Lake, California.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Central Christian Church is in Henderson, Nevada.

      - Santa Margarita Lake is in California.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Nevada and California.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States.

      - Nevada is located directly east of California.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - Henderson is in southern Nevada, near Las Vegas, in the eastern part of the
      state.

      - Santa Margarita Lake is in San Luis Obispo County on the central coast of
      California.


      Step 4: Compare longitude (east-west position).

      Since Nevada is east of California, and Henderson is in the eastern part of
      Nevada while Santa Margarita Lake is on the central California coast, Central
      Christian Church in Henderson must be east of Santa Margarita Lake.

      Church in Henderson, Nevada is located east of Santa Margarita Lake in California.


      To solve this, I need to think about the relative locations:


      1. Henderson, Nevada is a city in the Las Vegas metropolitan area, in the southeastern
      part of Nevada.

      2. Santa Margarita Lake is in California.

      3. Generally, Nevada is east of California, since California is on the west
      coast of the US, and Nevada is one state inland.


      But I should check more specifically about these two locations.


      Henderson, Nevada would be in the southeastern part of Nevada, near Las Vegas.

      Santa Margarita Lake would likely be somewhere in California.


      Since California is west of Nevada, and Henderson is in Nevada, Henderson would
      be east of any location in California, including Santa Margarita Lake.


      So Central Christian Church in Henderson, Nevada should be east of Santa Margarita
      Lake, California.</think># Is Central Christian Church (Henderson, Nevada),
      NV located east of Santa Margarita Lake, CA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these two locations.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' positions.

      California is on the west coast of the United States, while Nevada borders California
      to the east.


      Step 2: Locate the specific places.

      Henderson is a city in the southeastern part of Nevada, in the Las Vegas metropolitan
      area.

      Santa Margarita Lake is in San Luis Obispo County, California, which is in the
      central-western part of California.


      Step 3: Compare their positioning.

      Since all of Nevada is east of California, and Henderson is in Nevada while
      Santa Margarita Lake is in California, Henderson must be east of Santa Margarita
      Lake.


      Step 4: Therefore, Central Christian Church in Henderson, Nevada is east of
      Santa Margarita Lake, California.

      Washington, I need to identify the locations of both places and compare their
      positions.


      Step 1: Locate the Cathedral of Our Lady of Lourdes.

      The Cathedral of Our Lady of Lourdes is in Spokane, Washington. Spokane is in
      the eastern part of Washington state, near the Idaho border.


      Step 2: Locate Lake Padden.

      Lake Padden is in Bellingham, Washington. Bellingham is in the northwestern
      part of Washington state, near the Canadian border.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Washington state is wider east-to-west than north-to-south. Spokane is in the
      far eastern part of the state, while Bellingham (where Lake Padden is located)
      is in the western part of the state, much closer to the Pacific Ocean.


      Since Spokane is in eastern Washington and Bellingham/Lake Padden is in western
      Washington, the Cathedral of Our Lady of Lourdes (in Spokane) would be east
      of Lake Padden.</think># Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) First, I need to identify the locations of both sites in Washington state.


      2) The Cathedral of Our Lady of Lourdes is located in Spokane, Washington, which
      is in the eastern part of Washington state, near the Idaho border.


      3) Lake Padden is located in Bellingham, Washington, which is in the northwestern
      part of Washington state, near the Canadian border and Puget Sound.


      4) Looking at Washington state''s geography, Spokane is significantly east of
      Bellingham.


      5) Since the Cathedral is in Spokane (eastern Washington) and Lake Padden is
      in Bellingham (western Washington), the Cathedral must be east of Lake Padden.


      YES'

      1. The Cathedral of Our Lady of Lourdes is in Spokane, Washington. Spokane is
      in eastern Washington state.


      2. Lake Padden is in Bellingham, Washington, which is in the northwestern part
      of Washington state, near the Canadian border.


      3. In Washington state, locations in the eastern part of the state are east
      of locations in the western part of the state.


      4. Since Spokane is in eastern Washington and Bellingham (where Lake Padden
      is located) is in western Washington, the Cathedral of Our Lady of Lourdes in
      Spokane would be east of Lake Padden.


      Let me verify this by thinking about the geography of Washington state. Washington
      state has the Pacific Ocean on its western border, and Idaho on its eastern
      border. Spokane is very close to the Idaho border on the eastern side of the
      state, while Bellingham (and Lake Padden) is in the northwest corner of the
      state, not far from the Pacific Ocean and the Canadian border.


      So yes, the Cathedral of Our Lady of Lourdes in Spokane is east of Lake Padden.</think>#
      Reasoning Step by Step


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative locations of these
      two places in Washington state.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Cathedral of Our Lady of Lourdes.

      - This cathedral is located in Spokane, Washington

      - Spokane is in the eastern part of Washington state, near the Idaho border


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Padden.

      - Lake Padden is located in Bellingham, Washington

      Washington state.


      2. Lake Padden is in Bellingham, Washington, which is in the northwestern part
      of Washington state, near the Canadian border.


      Washington state generally runs west to east, with the Pacific Ocean on the
      west and Idaho on the east. So places in eastern Washington are east of places
      in western Washington.


      Spokane is definitely in eastern Washington, near the Idaho border.

      Bellingham (where Lake Padden is) is in western Washington, near the coast.


      Therefore, Spokane is east of Bellingham, which means the Cathedral of Our Lady
      of Lourdes in Spokane is east of Lake Padden.</think># Is Cathedral of Our Lady
      of Lourdes (Spokane, Washington) located east of Lake Padden, WA?


      I need to determine the relative locations of these two places in Washington
      state.

      - The Cathedral of Our Lady of Lourdes is in Spokane, Washington.

      - Spokane is located in the eastern part of Washington state, near the Idaho
      border.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Padden.

      - Lake Padden is located in Bellingham, Washington.

      - Bellingham is in the northwestern part of Washington state, near the Canadian
      border and Puget Sound.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Washington state extends from the Pacific Ocean (west) to Idaho (east).

      1. The Episcopal Cathedral of Saint Philip is in Atlanta, Georgia, which is
      in the southeastern United States.

      2. The Dal-Tex Building is in Texas, which is in the south-central United States.


      When comparing east-west positions in the US, we need to compare longitudes.

      Georgia is significantly east of Texas on the US map. Georgia borders the Atlantic
      Ocean on the east coast, while Texas is much further west.


      So geographically speaking, Atlanta, Georgia (where the Cathedral is located)
      is east of anywhere in Texas (where the Dal-Tex Building is located).

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States, much further west than
      Georgia.


      Step 3: On a west-to-east directional axis across the United States:

      - Texas is considerably west of Georgia.

      - Georgia is much closer to the east coast than Texas.

      Let me think about the general geography:

      - Washington state is north of Oregon

      - Both states are on the west coast of the US

      - Within these states, "east" would mean farther inland from the Pacific Ocean


      The Trojan Nuclear Power Plant in Oregon was located on the Columbia River,

      The Ice Harbor Dam is on the Snake River in Washington state. The Snake River
      is a major tributary of the Columbia River. The Ice Harbor Dam is located in
      southeastern Washington, near the city of Pasco.


      Generally speaking, the Columbia River flows west toward the Pacific Ocean.
      The Snake River joins the Columbia from the east. This means that Ice Harbor
      Dam on the Snake River would be east of locations on the lower Columbia River
      (closer to the Pacific), which is where the Trojan plant was located.

      Step 1: Locate Trojan Nuclear Power Plant, OR

      The Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was located in northwestern Oregon along the
      Columbia River, near the town of Rainier. This location is very close to the
      Pacific Ocean in the western part of Oregon.


      Step 2: Locate Ice Harbor Dam, WA

      Ice Harbor Dam is located on the Snake River in southeastern Washington state,
      near the city of Pasco. The Snake River is a major tributary of the Columbia
      River.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      Looking at their locations, the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was positioned in
      the far western part of the region, close to the Pacific coast. Ice Harbor Dam
      is positioned much further inland in eastern Washington.


      Step 4: Determine east-west relationship

      In the United States, "east" means farther inland from the Pacific Ocean along

      First, let me identify where these structures are located:


      1. Ice Harbor Dam is located in Washington state (WA)

      2. Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is located in Oregon state (OR)


      Washington is north of Oregon, but that doesn''t tell us about east/west positioning.
      I need to know where in these states these structures are.


      Ice Harbor Dam is likely on the Columbia River or one of its tributaries in
      Washington. The Columbia River forms much of the border between Washington and
      Oregon.


      The Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was in Oregon, along the Columbia River. I believe
      it was in northwestern Oregon, not far from Portland.


      Washington extends quite far to the east, while Oregon has more western coastal
      areas. If Ice Harbor Dam is in eastern Washington, and Trojan was in western
      Oregon near Portland, then Ice Harbor Dam would be east of Trojan.


      From my knowledge:

      - Ice Harbor Dam is on the Snake River (a tributary of the Columbia) in southeastern
      Washington

      - Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was located near Rainier, Oregon, in the northwestern

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both structures.

      - Ice Harbor Dam is located on the Snake River in southeastern Washington state.

      - Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was located near Rainier in northwestern Oregon,
      along the Columbia River.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Northwestern Oregon is close to the Pacific coast, in the western part of
      the state.

      - Southeastern Washington is in the eastern part of Washington state.

      - On a west-to-east axis, northwestern Oregon is significantly west of southeastern
      Washington.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Oregon, in the northwestern part of the state along the Columbia River.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Washington and Oregon.

      - Washington is north of Oregon.

      - Both states extend from the Pacific Ocean (west) toward Idaho (east).


      Step 3: Compare specific locations.

      - Northwestern Oregon is in the western portion of the Pacific Northwest region,

      First, let me consider the states:

      - The Basilica is in New York (NY), specifically in Southampton

      - The Hershey Theatre is in Pennsylvania (PA), presumably in Hershey


      In the United States, New York is generally east of Pennsylvania. These states
      share a border, with New York to the east/northeast of Pennsylvania.


      Now, let''s be more specific about the locations:

      - Southampton is on the eastern end of Long Island, which is the easternmost
      part of New York state

      - Hershey is in central Pennsylvania


      Given that:

      1. New York is east of Pennsylvania

      2. Southampton is on the far eastern end of New York (on Long Island)

      York.

      - The Hershey Theatre is in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

      - Generally, New York state is east of Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - Southampton is located on the eastern end of Long Island, which is on the
      far eastern side of New York state.

      - Hershey is in central Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east axis.

      - Southampton''s position on eastern Long Island places it very far east.

      - Hershey, being in central Pennsylvania, is considerably west of any point
      on Long Island.


      YES, the Basilica of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary in Southampton, New

      It asks if the basilica is located east of the theatre.


      To determine this, I need to think about the geographic positions of these two

      Southampton, NY is located on the eastern end of Long Island, which is on the
      Atlantic coast of New York state. Long Island extends eastward from New York

      Given that Southampton is on the far eastern end of Long Island, and Hershey
      is in central Pennsylvania, the basilica would be east of the theatre. Pennsylvania

      2. KS refers to Kansas state, and CO refers to Colorado state.

      3. I need to determine if Council Grove Lake in Kansas is east of Auraria Campus
      in Colorado.

      4. In terms of US geography, Kansas is entirely east of Colorado. Kansas borders
      Colorado on Colorado''s eastern border.

      5. Council Grove Lake is in Kansas, so it must be east of Colorado''s border.

      6. Auraria Campus is in Colorado (specifically in Denver).

      Grove Lake must be east of Auraria Campus.

      - Council Grove Lake is somewhere in Kansas

      - Auraria Campus is in Denver, Colorado (near the center-east of Colorado)


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on state positions.

      Since any location in Kansas is east of any location in Colorado (because the
      entire state of Kansas is east of Colorado), Council Grove Lake must be east
      of Auraria Campus.

      to determine the relative geographic positions of Kanuga Conference Center in
      North Carolina and Cathedral of the Incarnation in Nashville, Tennessee.


      Step 1: Let me identify the general locations.

      - Kanuga Conference Center is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Cathedral of the Incarnation is in Nashville, Tennessee (TN)


      Step 2: Think about the geographic relationship between North Carolina and Tennessee.

      North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States, while Tennessee is
      inland and west of North Carolina. In general, North Carolina is east of Tennessee.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      Nashville is in the central part of Tennessee, not the eastern edge that borders
      North Carolina. Kanuga Conference Center is likely in the western part of North
      Carolina, but even western North Carolina is generally east of central Tennessee
      where Nashville is located.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      North Carolina is located on the eastern side of Tennessee. On a US map, North
      Carolina sits to the right (east) of Tennessee.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Nashville is located in the central part of Tennessee

      - Even if Kanuga Conference Center is in western North Carolina, western NC
      is still east of central Tennessee where Nashville is located


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on this east-west relationship.

      Since North Carolina is east of Tennessee, and Nashville is not on Tennessee''s
      far eastern border, Kanuga Conference Center in NC would be east of the Cathedral
      of the Incarnation in Nashville, TN.

      The question specifically asks if Kanuga Conference Center is east of the Cathedral
      of the Incarnation.


      To answer this, I need to determine the geographic locations of both places
      and compare their east-west positioning.


      First, I know that North Carolina is a state on the east coast of the United
      States, while Tennessee is an inland state. Generally speaking, North Carolina
      is east of Tennessee.


      More specifically:

      - Nashville is in the central part of Tennessee

      - Kanuga Conference Center is likely in western North Carolina (though I don''t
      know its exact location)


      Since North Carolina borders Tennessee on Tennessee''s eastern side, and Nashville
      is not on the far eastern edge of Tennessee but rather in the central part,
      it''s very likely that any location in North Carolina would be east of Nashville,

      To determine if Kanuga Conference Center (NC) is east of Cathedral of the Incarnation
      (Nashville, TN), I need to consider their relative geographic positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states'' positions

      - North Carolina is located on the eastern seaboard of the US

      - Tennessee is located inland, directly west of North Carolina


      ## Step 2: Locate the specific places

      - Kanuga Conference Center is in Hendersonville, NC (western North Carolina)

      - Cathedral of the Incarnation is in Nashville, which is in the central part
      of Tennessee


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      - Even though Kanuga is in western NC, North Carolina as a whole is east of
      Tennessee

      - Nashville is not in eastern Tennessee but in the central part of the state

      - The entire state of North Carolina lies east of central Tennessee


      Therefore, Kanuga Conference Center is indeed east of the Cathedral of the Incarnation
      in Nashville.

      First, I need to determine the locations of both water bodies:


      1. Red Bluff Reservoir, TX - This is in Texas (TX), which is generally in the
      eastern part of the southwestern United States.


      2. Sahuarita Lake, AZ - This is in Arizona (AZ), which is in the western part
      of the southwestern United States.


      The question is asking if Red Bluff Reservoir is east of Sahuarita Lake.


      Generally speaking, Texas is east of Arizona in the United States. However,
      I need to be careful because these could be specific locations that don''t follow
      the general state positions.


      Texas shares its western border with New Mexico, and New Mexico shares its western
      border with Arizona. So generally, any location in Texas would be east of any
      location in Arizona.


      Red Bluff Reservoir appears to be in western Texas (near the New Mexico border),
      while Sahuarita Lake is likely in southern Arizona. Even the westernmost parts
      of Texas would still be east of Arizona.

      - Texas is located to the east of Arizona

      - New Mexico sits between Arizona and Texas


      Step 3: Determine the specific locations within their states.

      - Even though Red Bluff Reservoir is in western Texas (near the New Mexico border),
      Texas as a whole is east of Arizona

      - Sahuarita Lake is in southern Arizona

      I need to consider that:


      - Red Bluff Reservoir could be in western Texas

      - Sahuarita Lake could be in eastern Arizona

      - Their specific locations might not follow the general east-west relationship

      But in general, the entirety of Texas is east of the entirety of Arizona. Even

      This is because Texas and Arizona are not adjacent states (New Mexico lies between
      them).

      to determine the locations of El Vado Lake in New Mexico (NM) and Lake Yosemite
      in California (CA), and then compare their east-west positions.


      First, let''s think about the general geographic relationship between New Mexico
      and California:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - New Mexico is inland, to the east of California


      Based on this general knowledge, places in New Mexico tend to be east of places
      in California. However, I should be more precise about these specific lakes.


      El Vado Lake is in New Mexico, which borders Arizona to its west, and Arizona
      borders California. So El Vado Lake in NM would be at least one state east of
      California.


      Lake Yosemite is in California, which is on the west coast of the United States.


      Given the relative positions of the states (California is west of New Mexico),
      El Vado Lake in New Mexico would be east of Lake Yosemite in California.</think>#
      Determining if El Vado Lake, NM is east of Lake Yosemite, CA


      I need to think about the geographic positions of these two lakes by considering
      their state locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      - California (CA) is located on the west coast of the United States.

      - New Mexico (NM) is located inland, in the southwestern United States, but
      significantly east of California.


      Step 2: Consider the lakes'' locations within their states.

      - El Vado Lake is in New Mexico

      - Lake Yosemite is in California


      Step 3: Determine east-west positioning.

      Since California is west of New Mexico (with Arizona in between), any lake in
      New Mexico would be east of any lake in California when considering longitudinal
      position.


      Therefore, El Vado Lake, NM is located east of Lake Yosemite, CA.

      First, let''s think about the states:

      - NM (New Mexico) is located in the southwestern United States

      - CA (California) is located on the west coast of the United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, California is the westernmost continental
      state, bordering the Pacific Ocean. New Mexico is located to the east of California,
      with Arizona in between them.


      So generally speaking, any location in New Mexico would be east of any location
      in California. This is because California is west of New Mexico on the map of
      the United States.


      El Vado Lake is in New Mexico, which is east of California.

      - Lake Yosemite is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New Mexico is in the southwestern United States, but importantly, it is located
      east of California (with Arizona between them)


      Step 3: Apply this state-level positioning to the lakes.

      - Since New Mexico is east of California, any lake in New Mexico (including
      El Vado Lake) would be east of any lake in California (including Lake Yosemite)


      YES, El Vado Lake, NM is located east of Lake Yosemite, CA.'

      Since New Mexico is east of California, and El Vado Lake is in New Mexico while
      Lake Yosemite is in California, it follows that El Vado Lake would be east of
      Lake Yosemite.


      To be even more precise:

      - New Orleans is in Louisiana, which is east of Texas on the US map

      - Louisiana borders Texas on Texas''s eastern side


      More specifically:

      - New Orleans is located in southeastern Louisiana, near the Gulf of Mexico

      - Barker Reservoir would be somewhere in Texas

      To determine whether Fontana Lake is east of Herb Parsons Lake, I need to think
      about the geographic locations of these lakes within their respective states,
      and the relative positions of North Carolina and Tennessee.


      First, let''s consider the general geography:

      - North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States

      - Tennessee is west of North Carolina (NC shares its western border with TN)


      Now, for more specific locations:

      - Fontana Lake is in western North Carolina, near the Tennessee border, in the
      Great Smoky Mountains region

      - Herb Parsons Lake is in western Tennessee, near Memphis


      Given that Tennessee is west of North Carolina, and Fontana Lake is in western
      NC while Herb Parsons Lake is in western TN, it''s highly likely that Fontana
      Lake is east of Herb Parsons Lake.


      In fact, western North Carolina (where Fontana Lake is) would still be east
      of even eastern Tennessee, and Herb Parsons Lake is in western Tennessee, making
      the east-west distance even greater.</think>To determine if Fontana Lake, NC
      is located east of Herb Parsons Lake, TN, I need to consider the relative geographic
      positions of these lakes and their states.


      Step 1: Consider the general geographic relationship between North Carolina
      and Tennessee.

      - Tennessee is located west of North Carolina (NC shares its western border
      with TN)


      Step 2: Identify the specific locations of these lakes within their states.

      - Fontana Lake is located in western North Carolina, in the Great Smoky Mountains
      region near the Tennessee border

      - Herb Parsons Lake is located in western Tennessee, not far from Memphis


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Even though Fontana Lake is in western NC, it''s still east of the Tennessee
      state line

      - Herb Parsons Lake being in western TN puts it even further west


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these geographic positions.

      - Since any point in North Carolina (even western NC) is east of western Tennessee,
      Fontana Lake must be east of Herb Parsons Lake


      YES, Fontana Lake, NC is located east of Herb Parsons Lake, TN.'

      the relative positions of two lakes:

      1. Fontana Lake, NC (in North Carolina)

      2. Herb Parsons Lake, TN (in Tennessee)


      Specifically, I need to figure out if Fontana Lake is east of Herb Parsons Lake.


      Let me think about the geography of North Carolina (NC) and Tennessee (TN):


      - Tennessee is west of North Carolina. The two states share a border, with Tennessee
      to the west and North Carolina to the east.

      - However, I need to be careful because just because NC is east of TN doesn''t
      automatically mean that every point in NC is east of every point in TN. The
      states have irregular shapes.


      Fontana Lake is in western North Carolina, near the Tennessee border, in the
      Great Smoky Mountains area.


      Herb Parsons Lake is in western Tennessee, likely near the Memphis area (though
      I''m less certain about this exact location).


      Given that Tennessee is west of North Carolina, and Fontana Lake is in western
      NC while Herb Parsons Lake is in western TN, it''s very likely that Fontana
      Lake is east of Herb Parsons Lake.


      Let me double-check this reasoning: Western NC is still east of western TN,
      since the entire state of NC is east of TN. So even though Fontana Lake is in
      the western part of NC, it would still be east of a lake in western TN.</think>#
      Is Fontana Lake, NC located east of Herb Parsons Lake, TN?


      To determine this, I need to consider the geographic positions of both lakes
      and their states.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' positions.

      - North Carolina (NC) is located east of Tennessee (TN).

      - The two states share a border, with TN to the west and NC to the east.


      Step 2: Locate the specific lakes.

      - Fontana Lake is in western North Carolina, in the Great Smoky Mountains region
      near the TN border.

      - Herb Parsons Lake is in western Tennessee, near Memphis.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      - Even though Fontana Lake is in western NC, it''s still east of the Tennessee
      state line.

      - Herb Parsons Lake being in western TN places it much further west than any
      point in NC.

      - The distance between them is substantial, with Herb Parsons Lake being closer
      to the Mississippi River, while Fontana Lake is in the Appalachian Mountains.


      YES, Fontana Lake, NC is located east of Herb Parsons Lake, TN.'

      Fontana Lake is located in North Carolina (NC), specifically in the western
      part of the state near the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.


      Herb Parsons Lake is located in Tennessee (TN).


      To determine which is more easterly, I need to consider the general geography
      of these states. Tennessee is directly west of North Carolina. The entire state
      of North Carolina is east of Tennessee.

      Let me think about the general geography of North Carolina and Tennessee:

      - Tennessee is west of North Carolina (NC borders TN on TN''s eastern side)

      Fontana Lake is likely east of Herb Parsons Lake.


      However, I need to be careful because Fontana Lake is in western NC, and Herb

      - Fontana Lake is located in western North Carolina, in the Great Smoky Mountains
      region near the Tennessee border.

      - Herb Parsons Lake is located in western Tennessee, near Memphis.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      - Even though Fontana Lake is in western North Carolina, North Carolina as a
      whole is east of Tennessee.

      - Herb Parsons Lake being in western Tennessee puts it even further west than
      eastern Tennessee.

      However, I need to be careful because lakes could be near the border, and their
      specific locations matter. Fontana Lake is actually located in western North
      Carolina, near the Tennessee border. It''s part of the western North Carolina
      mountains.

      First, let''s think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Kansas (KS) is east of Colorado (CO)

      - Colorado is directly west of Kansas


      Since Waconda Lake is in Kansas and Rampart Reservoir is in Colorado, and Kansas
      is east of Colorado, it''s very likely that Waconda Lake is east of Rampart
      Reservoir.


      To be extra certain, I''d need to know if these bodies of water are near the
      borders of their respective states, which could potentially change the answer.
      However, even if Waconda Lake is in western Kansas and Rampart Reservoir is
      in eastern Colorado, Kansas is still east of Colorado.


      So based on the fact that Kansas is east of Colorado, Waconda Lake in Kansas
      would be east of Rampart Reservoir in Colorado.</think># Is Waconda Lake, KS

      4. Any location in Kansas would be east of any location in Colorado.

      5. Waconda Lake is in Kansas, while Rampart Reservoir is in Colorado.

      6. Therefore, Waconda Lake must be east of Rampart Reservoir.

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the US

      - Mississippi is in the southeastern US, east of Texas


      Generally speaking, Mississippi is east of Texas. So lakes in Mississippi would

    d1fcb302-c0ef-41a0-a0a2-dbea9649e292: '<think>To determine if Grenada Lake, MS
      (Mississippi) is located east of Wright Patman Lake, TX (Texas), I need to think
      about the relative positions of these states and lakes.


      First, let''s consider the general geographic positioning of the states:

      - Mississippi (MS) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas (TX) is located in the south-central United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, Mississippi is east of Texas. Mississippi
      borders the Gulf of Mexico on its south, and Texas is to the west of Mississippi.


      Since Grenada Lake is in Mississippi, and Wright Patman Lake is in Texas, and
      Mississippi is east of Texas, it would follow that Grenada Lake is east of Wright
      Patman Lake.


      However, I should be careful here - lakes within states could be positioned
      in ways that don''t follow the general east-west relationship of the states.
      But given that Mississippi is entirely east of Texas, any point in Mississippi
      would be east of any point in Texas.</think>I need to determine the relative
      east-west positioning of these two lakes by examining their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these lakes are located.

      - Grenada Lake is in Mississippi (MS)

      - Wright Patman Lake is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positioning of these states.

      Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States, while Texas is in
      the south-central United States.


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship between these states.

      On a map of the United States, Mississippi is positioned entirely east of Texas.
      The states don''t share a border - Louisiana sits between them.


      Step 4: Apply this relationship to the lakes.

      Since Grenada Lake is in Mississippi and Wright Patman Lake is in Texas, and
      Mississippi is completely east of Texas, it follows that Grenada Lake must be
      east of Wright Patman Lake.


      YES'
    e194ffbe-b5f2-4080-b8ed-b1ede3dc9ee7: '<think>Let me think step by step to determine
      if Grenada Lake, MS is located east of Wright Patman Lake, TX.


      1. Grenada Lake is in Mississippi (MS), while Wright Patman Lake is in Texas
      (TX).


      2. To determine which is eastward of the other, I need to consider the geographic
      positions of these states.


      3. In the United States, states are positioned such that Texas is in the south-central
      part of the country, while Mississippi is in the southeastern part.


      4. Looking at a map of the US, Mississippi is located to the east of Texas.


      5. Since Grenada Lake is in Mississippi and Wright Patman Lake is in Texas,
      it follows that Grenada Lake would be east of Wright Patman Lake.


      Let me double-check this by recalling the general positions:

      - Texas borders the Gulf of Mexico on the southeast, and has New Mexico to its
      west, Oklahoma to its north, Arkansas to its northeast, and Louisiana to its
      east.

      - Mississippi is further east, bordered by Louisiana to its west, Arkansas to
      its northwest, Tennessee to its north, and Alabama to its east.


      So Mississippi is clearly east of Texas, which means Grenada Lake, MS would
      be east of Wright Patman Lake, TX.</think>I need to determine the relative locations
      of these two lakes based on their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each lake is located.

      - Grenada Lake is in Mississippi (MS)

      - Wright Patman Lake is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States

      - On a map of the US, Mississippi is positioned to the east of Texas


      Step 3: Apply this state-level positioning to the lakes.

      - Since Grenada Lake is in Mississippi, and Mississippi is east of Texas, where
      Wright Patman Lake is located, Grenada Lake would be east of Wright Patman Lake.


      YES'

      2. Wright Patman Lake in Texas (TX)


      Specifically, I need to determine if Grenada Lake is located east of Wright
      Patman Lake.


      To answer this, I need to consider the relative positions of Mississippi and
      Texas:

      - Mississippi (MS) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas (TX) is located in the south-central United States


      Generally speaking, Mississippi is east of Texas. The entire state of Mississippi
      lies east of Texas.


      Grenada Lake would be somewhere within Mississippi, and Wright Patman Lake would
      be somewhere within Texas. Since Mississippi is east of Texas, Grenada Lake
      (in MS) would be east of Wright Patman Lake (in TX).


      So the answer should be YES, Grenada Lake, MS is located east of Wright Patman
      Lake, TX.</think>To determine if Grenada Lake, MS is located east of Wright
      Patman Lake, TX, I need to consider the relative geographic positions of these

      - Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Mississippi lies entirely east of Texas


      Step 3: Since Grenada Lake is in Mississippi and Wright Patman Lake is in Texas,
      Grenada Lake must be east of Wright Patman Lake because Mississippi is east
      of Texas.


      YES, Grenada Lake, MS is located east of Wright Patman Lake, TX.'

      part of the state near the Great Lakes.


      Given the continental geography of the United States, any location in Massachusetts

      relative geographic locations of two water structures in the western United
      States:

      1. Arrowrock Dam in Idaho (ID)

      2. Lost Creek Lake in Oregon (OR)


      I need to determine whether Arrowrock Dam is east of Lost Creek Lake.


      Let me think about the geography of the western United States:

      - Oregon is on the west coast of the US

      - Idaho is inland, to the east of Oregon

      - So generally, locations in Idaho would be east of locations in Oregon


      Let''s be more specific about these two locations:

      - Arrowrock Dam is in Idaho, likely in the western part of the state

      - Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon, but I''m not sure exactly where in Oregon


      However, since Idaho is entirely east of Oregon, any location in Idaho (including
      Arrowrock Dam) would be east of any location in Oregon (including Lost Creek
      Lake).


      So Arrowrock Dam, ID should be located east of Lost Creek Lake, OR.</think>I
      need to determine the relative positions of these two water structures.


      Step 1: Consider the states where these structures are located.

      - Arrowrock Dam is in Idaho (ID)

      - Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Think about the geographic relationship between Idaho and Oregon.

      - Oregon is located on the Pacific coast

      - Idaho is an inland state that borders Oregon to the east

      - The entire state of Idaho lies east of Oregon


      Step 3: Based on these states'' positions, any location in Idaho would be east
      of any location in Oregon, regardless of their specific positions within each
      state.


      Therefore, Arrowrock Dam in Idaho must be located east of Lost Creek Lake in
      Oregon.


      YES'

      East Branch Clarion River Lake is in Pennsylvania, which is west of New York.


      Generally speaking, locations in New York City are east of locations in Pennsylvania.
      New York City is right on the Atlantic Ocean, while Pennsylvania is an inland

      To solve this:

      1. I need to know the general geography of the eastern United States

      2. Determine the relative positions of New York City and this lake in Pennsylvania


      Wall Street is in lower Manhattan in New York City, which is on the eastern
      seaboard of the United States.


      East Branch Clarion River Lake appears to be in Pennsylvania, which is west
      of New York state.


      In the United States, when comparing locations on the east coast:

      - States further east include: Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
      Connecticut, parts of New York, New Jersey, etc.

      - States further west include: Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, etc.


      Since New York City is on the eastern edge of New York state, and Pennsylvania
      is west of New York state, New York City (including Wall Street) would be east
      of any location in Pennsylvania.


      Therefore, 120 Wall Street in NY would be east of East Branch Clarion River
      Lake in PA.</think>To determine if 120 Wall Street, NY is located east of East
      Branch Clarion River Lake, PA, I need to consider their geographic positions:


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 120 Wall Street is in Manhattan, New York City, which is located on the eastern
      seaboard of the United States.

      - East Branch Clarion River Lake is in Pennsylvania, specifically in the western
      part of the state.


      Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      - New York state borders Pennsylvania to the east.

      - Pennsylvania is west of New York state.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - New York City is on the eastern edge of New York state.

      - East Branch Clarion River Lake is in western Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Compare the locations.

      - Moving from East Branch Clarion River Lake to 120 Wall Street, you would travel
      eastward.

      - Therefore, 120 Wall Street is east of East Branch Clarion River Lake.

      2. East Branch Clarion River Lake, Pennsylvania


      I need to determine which one is further east. In the United States, locations
      further east have higher longitude values (more towards the East Coast).


      Wall Street is in Lower Manhattan in New York City, which is on the East Coast
      of the United States. New York City is quite far east in the US.


      East Branch Clarion River Lake is in Pennsylvania, which is west of New York.
      Pennsylvania is generally west of New York State, though parts of western NY
      and eastern PA could have some overlap.


      Since Wall Street is in Manhattan (NYC) on the East Coast, and East Branch Clarion
      River Lake is in Pennsylvania which is more inland and westward, 120 Wall Street
      should be east of East Branch Clarion River Lake.


      So 120 Wall Street, NY should be located east of East Branch Clarion River Lake,

      Step 3: Specifically, East Branch Clarion River Lake is in northwestern Pennsylvania,
      in the Allegheny National Forest region.


      Step 4: New York City is significantly further east than even the eastern parts
      of Pennsylvania, and the Clarion River watershed is in the western half of Pennsylvania.

      3. East Branch Clarion River Lake is in Pennsylvania (PA). Pennsylvania is west
      of New York state.


      4. Specifically, Pennsylvania is located to the west and south of New York state.


      5. So in general terms, locations in New York would be east of locations in

      6. However, I should be careful - if the location in NY is in the western part
      of the state, and the PA location is in the eastern part of PA, then their relative
      positions might be different.


      7. But Wall Street is in NYC, which is at the southeastern tip of New York state,

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 120 Wall Street is located in Lower Manhattan, New York City, at the southeastern
      part of New York State.

      - East Branch Clarion River Lake is located in northwestern Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between New York and Pennsylvania.

      - New York State is generally east of Pennsylvania.

      - New York City is at the far eastern edge of New York State.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Wall Street is in the eastern part of New York City, facing the East River.

      - Northwestern Pennsylvania (where East Branch Clarion River Lake is located)
      is significantly west of New York City.


      Step 4: Determine relative positions.

      - Since New York City is east of all of Pennsylvania, and 120 Wall Street is
      in NYC, it must be east of East Branch Clarion River Lake.


      YES, 120 Wall Street, NY is located east of East Branch Clarion River Lake,

      - Lake Springfield is located in or near Springfield, Illinois (IL).


      Step 2: Determine their positions on the US map.

      - Washington, DC is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      - Springfield, Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Washington, DC is positioned much further east in the country than Illinois.

      - The entire state of Illinois, including Springfield and Lake Springfield,
      lies west of Washington, DC.


      Therefore, H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse in DC is located east of Lake Springfield,
      IL.

      First, let''s think about the geographic positions of Ohio and Iowa:

      - Ohio is in the eastern part of the Midwest region of the United States

      - Iowa is in the central part of the Midwest region


      Generally speaking, Ohio is east of Iowa. The entire state of Ohio is east of

      the locations of these two structures.


      1. Copper Mountain Solar Facility is located in Nevada (NV).

      2. Pine Flat Dam is located in California (CA).


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to know their relative positions.
      In the United States, Nevada is generally east of California, as California
      is on the Pacific coast and Nevada is inland to the east.


      Specifically:

      - Copper Mountain Solar Facility is near Boulder City, Nevada, which is in the
      southern part of Nevada.

      - Pine Flat Dam is in Fresno County, California, in the central part of California.


      Given that Nevada is east of California, and these specific locations follow

      Pine Flat Dam is located in Fresno County in central California.

      Copper Mountain Solar Facility is located near Boulder City in southern Nevada.


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship.

      Since Nevada is east of California, and these specific structures maintain this
      general east-west relationship (there''s no unusual geographic arrangement that
      would reverse this), Copper Mountain Solar Facility would be east of Pine Flat
      Dam.

      5. However, I need to be careful about the exact locations within these states.
      California is a large state that extends quite far east, and Nevada extends
      quite far west. It''s possible that Pine Flat Dam is in eastern California while
      Copper Mountain Solar Facility is in western Nevada, which could potentially
      reverse their east-west relationship.


      6. Pine Flat Dam is located in the Sierra Nevada mountains in Central California,

      careful - if the solar facility is in western Nevada and the dam is in eastern
      California, I would need more specific location information.


      Given the general geography of these states, and without specific information
      suggesting an exception to this pattern, the Copper Mountain Solar Facility
      in Nevada would be east of Pine Flat Dam in California.</think>To answer this

      Santa Fe, New Mexico is in the northern part of New Mexico.

      Flagstaff, Arizona is in the northern part of Arizona.


      Arizona is directly west of New Mexico in the United States. So generally, locations

      To determine if the Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi in Santa Fe,

      is in Arizona.


      2) Looking at the map of the United States, Arizona and New Mexico are adjacent
      states, with New Mexico positioned directly east of Arizona.


      3) Since Santa Fe is in New Mexico and Flagstaff is in Arizona, Santa Fe must
      be east of Flagstaff.


      4) Therefore, the Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi (in Santa Fe,
      NM) must be east of the Orpheum Theater (in Flagstaff, AZ).

      1. Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi is in Santa Fe, New Mexico (NM)

      2. Orpheum Theater is in Flagstaff, Arizona (AZ)


      Now I need to determine which one is further east. In the United States, states
      that are more east have higher longitude values (though technically longitude
      increases as you go west, but in the US context with negative longitude values,
      more eastern locations have less negative / higher values).


      Let me think about the relative positions of New Mexico and Arizona:

      - Arizona is directly west of New Mexico

      - New Mexico borders Arizona on Arizona''s eastern side


      Therefore, any location in New Mexico would generally be east of any location
      in Arizona, especially when comparing cities that aren''t right at the border.


      Santa Fe, NM is in the northern part of New Mexico.

      Flagstaff, AZ is in the northern part of Arizona.


      Given their locations within their respective states, and the fact that New

      New Mexico and Arizona are neighboring states, with New Mexico positioned directly
      east of Arizona on the U.S. map.


      ## Step 2: Consider city locations

      - Santa Fe is located in north-central New Mexico

      - Flagstaff is located in northern Arizona


      ## Step 3: Apply geographic knowledge

      Since New Mexico is east of Arizona, and both cities are in the northern portions

      positions of Apache Lake in Arizona and Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral in
      San Bernardino, California.


      First, let me think about the general geographic positions of Arizona and California.
      California is on the west coast of the United States, while Arizona is directly
      east of California. So generally speaking, locations in Arizona tend to be east
      of locations in California.


      Apache Lake is in Arizona, and Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral is in San Bernardino,
      California.


      Since Arizona is east of California, and Apache Lake is in Arizona while Our
      Lady of the Rosary Cathedral is in San Bernardino, California, it follows that
      Apache Lake would be east of Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral.


      So the answer should be YES.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative geographic positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      - Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral is in San Bernardino, California

      - Apache Lake is in Arizona

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona borders California to the east


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - San Bernardino is in southern California, relatively close to the Arizona
      border

      - Apache Lake is in central Arizona


      Step 3: Apply geographical reasoning.

      Since Arizona is entirely east of California, and Apache Lake is within Arizona
      while Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral is within California, Apache Lake must
      be east of the cathedral.


      YES'

      1. Apache Lake in Arizona

      2. Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral in San Bernardino, California


      Then I need to compare their east-west positions.


      Apache Lake is in Arizona, which is generally east of California on a map of
      the United States. Arizona shares its western border with California, so Arizona
      is east of California.


      San Bernardino is a city in southern California, relatively close to the California-Arizona
      border, but still within California.


      Since Apache Lake is in Arizona, and Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral is in
      San Bernardino, California, and Arizona is east of California, Apache Lake should
      be east of the cathedral.


      So the answer would be YES, Apache Lake (Arizona) is located east of Our Lady
      of the Rosary Cathedral (San Bernardino, California).</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these landmarks are located.

      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona is located directly east of California


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - San Bernardino is in southern California

      - Apache Lake is in central Arizona


      Since Arizona is east of California on a map of the United States, and these
      specific locations don''t change this east-west relationship (San Bernardino
      isn''t in far eastern California, and Apache Lake isn''t in far western Arizona),
      Apache Lake must be east of Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral.

      - Arizona is located directly east of California


      Now for the specific locations:

      - Apache Lake is in Arizona

      - Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral is in San Bernardino, California


      Since Arizona is east of California, and Apache Lake is in Arizona, while Our
      Lady of the Rosary Cathedral is in California, Apache Lake must be east of Our
      Lady of the Rosary Cathedral.


      Let me double-check: San Bernardino is in southern California, not far from
      the Arizona border, but it''s still in California. Apache Lake is in Arizona.
      The entire state of Arizona is east of California.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the relative positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these places are located.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona borders California to the east


      Step 3: Since Apache Lake is in Arizona, and Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral
      is in San Bernardino, California, their relative positions follow the relationship
      between their states.


      Step 4: Even though San Bernardino is in eastern California (relatively close
      to the Arizona border), it''s still within California, which is entirely west
      of Arizona.


      Therefore, Apache Lake (Arizona) is located east of Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral

      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      - Since Arizona is directly east of California

      - Any location in Arizona (including Apache Lake) would be east of any location

      locations of Tellico Reservoir in Tennessee (TN) and Nimrod Lake in Arkansas
      (AR).


      First, let me think about the states:

      - Tennessee (TN) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Arkansas (AR) is located in the south-central United States


      Generally speaking, Tennessee is east of Arkansas. Tennessee borders the eastern
      edge of Arkansas, with the Mississippi River forming part of that border.


      Now for the specific locations:

      - Tellico Reservoir is in Tennessee (TN)

      - Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas (AR)


      Since Tennessee is east of Arkansas, and these bodies of water are in their
      respective states, it''s very likely that Tellico Reservoir is east of Nimrod
      Lake.


      To be completely certain, I would need the exact coordinates of both, but based
      on the state locations, I can reasonably conclude that Tellico Reservoir in
      Tennessee is east of Nimrod Lake in Arkansas.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the relative locations of these two bodies of water based
      on their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these reservoirs are located.

      - Tellico Reservoir is in Tennessee (TN)

      - Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship between these states.

      - Arkansas is west of Tennessee

      - Tennessee sits to the east of Arkansas


      Step 4: Apply this state-level relationship to the bodies of water.

      - Since Tellico Reservoir is in Tennessee and Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas, and
      Tennessee is east of Arkansas, Tellico Reservoir must be east of Nimrod Lake.

      to determine the locations of Lake Accotink, VA and Pleasants Power Station,
      WV, and then compare their east-west positions.


      Lake Accotink is in Virginia (VA). Virginia is on the east coast of the United
      States.


      Pleasants Power Station is in West Virginia (WV). West Virginia is located to
      the west of Virginia.


      Looking at the general geography of the US:

      - Virginia (VA) is on the Atlantic coast

      - West Virginia (WV) is inland, to the west of Virginia


      Based on the state locations alone, it''s likely that Lake Accotink in Virginia
      is east of Pleasants Power Station in West Virginia. This is because Virginia
      is generally east of West Virginia.


      However, I should be careful because locations near state borders might not
      follow this general rule. Let me think about the specific locations more precisely.


      Lake Accotink is likely in northern Virginia, in the Fairfax County area.

      Pleasants Power Station would be somewhere in West Virginia, probably along
      the Ohio River.


      Given the geography of these states, with Virginia being east of West Virginia,
      Lake Accotink in VA would be east of Pleasants Power Station in WV.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step to determine the relative positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations by state.

      - Lake Accotink is in Virginia (VA)

      - Pleasants Power Station is in West Virginia (WV)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Virginia is located on the east coast of the United States, while West Virginia
      is an inland state that borders Virginia to the west.


      Step 3: Determine the specific locations within their states.

      - Lake Accotink is in Fairfax County in northern Virginia

      - Pleasants Power Station is likely along the Ohio River in western West Virginia


      Step 4: Compare their east-west positions.

      Since Virginia is east of West Virginia, and these specific locations follow
      the general geographic arrangement of their respective states, Lake Accotink
      would be east of Pleasants Power Station.


      YES, Lake Accotink, VA is located east of Pleasants Power Station, WV.'
    4dc31109-c84f-48ff-92df-0018253dbb19: '<think>I need to determine the relative
      positions of Lake Accotink in Virginia (VA) and Pleasants Power Station in West
      Virginia (WV).


      First, let me recall the general geographic relationship between Virginia and
      West Virginia. West Virginia is generally west of Virginia, as West Virginia
      was formed from the western portion of Virginia during the Civil War.


      Now, Lake Accotink is in Virginia (VA). Given that Virginia is east of West
      Virginia, there''s a good chance that Lake Accotink is east of any location
      in West Virginia, including Pleasants Power Station.


      However, the specific locations matter. Lake Accotink could be in western Virginia,
      while Pleasants Power Station could be in eastern West Virginia, which might
      change the east-west relationship.


      Lake Accotink is in Fairfax County, which is in northern Virginia, in the eastern
      part of the state near Washington, DC.


      Pleasants Power Station, being in West Virginia, is likely west of this location,
      but I should check its specific location in West Virginia. Pleasants Power Station
      is located along the Ohio River in Pleasants County, WV, which is in the northwestern
      part of West Virginia.


      Given these locations, Lake Accotink in eastern Virginia would be east of Pleasants
      Power Station in northwestern West Virginia.</think># Determining if Lake Accotink,
      VA is east of Pleasants Power Station, WV


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions
      of these two locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Lake Accotink is in Fairfax County, Virginia, which is in the northeastern
      part of Virginia near Washington DC.

      - Pleasants Power Station is in Pleasants County, West Virginia, which is located
      in the northwestern part of WV along the Ohio River.


      ## Step 2: Compare their positions

      - Virginia is generally east of West Virginia (WV literally split from western
      Virginia during the Civil War).

      - Fairfax County (where Lake Accotink is) is in the eastern portion of Virginia.

      - Pleasants County (where the power station is) is in the western portion of
      West Virginia.


      ## Step 3: Draw a conclusion

      Moving from west to east, we''d encounter Pleasants Power Station in western
      WV first, then continue eastward to reach Lake Accotink in eastern VA.

      1. Lake Accotink is in Virginia (VA)

      2. Pleasants Power Station is in West Virginia (WV)


      Next, I need to determine their relative positions east/west of each other.


      Virginia is located east of West Virginia on the US map. West Virginia borders
      Virginia on Virginia''s western side.


      So generally speaking, locations in Virginia tend to be east of locations in
      West Virginia. However, I need to be careful about specific locations near the
      border that might not follow this general pattern.


      Lake Accotink appears to be in Fairfax County, which is in the northeastern
      part of Virginia.

      Pleasants Power Station would be in Pleasants County, WV, which is along the
      Ohio River in the northwestern part of West Virginia.


      Given these locations, Lake Accotink would indeed be east of Pleasants Power
      Station.</think>I''ll solve this step by step to determine the relative east-west

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states

      - West Virginia is located west of Virginia

      - Virginia borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east


      Step 3: Consider more specific locations

      - Lake Accotink is in Fairfax County in northern Virginia, which is in the eastern
      part of the state

      - Pleasants Power Station is located along the Ohio River in northwestern West
      Virginia


      Step 4: Compare their positions on an east-west axis

      - Any location in northern Virginia (like Lake Accotink) would be significantly
      east of a location in northwestern West Virginia (like Pleasants Power Station)


      YES, Lake Accotink, VA is located east of Pleasants Power Station, WV.'

      First, let''s identify where these places are:

      - Lake Accotink is in Virginia (VA)

      - Pleasants Power Station is in West Virginia (WV)


      Virginia is east of West Virginia in the United States. The states border each
      other, with West Virginia being to the west of Virginia (as the name suggests).


      Given this general geographic orientation, it''s likely that Lake Accotink in

      to be careful about making assumptions based just on state boundaries, as the
      specific locations within each state could change the answer.


      Since Virginia is generally east of West Virginia, and these locations seem

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Virginia is located directly east of West Virginia. The entire state of West
      Virginia is west of the majority of Virginia.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      To answer this, I need to think about the geographical positions of Virginia
      and West Virginia, and then more specifically about these two locations.


      In general, Virginia is located east of West Virginia. Virginia borders the

      1) The Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building is located in
      Washington, DC, which is on the eastern seaboard of the United States.


      2) Rend Lake is located in Illinois, which is in the Midwest region of the United

      The United States is organized with:

      - West Coast states along the Pacific Ocean (including California)

      - States in the Mountain West region (including Utah)


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - California (CA) is on the west coast, bordering the Pacific Ocean

      - Utah (UT) is inland, in the Mountain West region


      Generally, states in the Mountain West (like Utah) are east of the West Coast
      states (like California). This is because as you move from the Pacific Ocean
      eastward, you first encounter California, then Nevada, and then Utah.


      Since Causey Reservoir is in Utah, and Trinity Dam is in California, it''s very
      likely that Causey Reservoir is east of Trinity Dam.


      Let me double-check this logic:

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Utah is located in the Mountain West region, inland from California

      - When moving east from the Pacific Ocean, you encounter California before Utah


      ## Step 3: Determine relative positions

      - Since Utah is entirely east of California on the US map

      - Any location in Utah (including Causey Reservoir) would be east of any location

      However, I should be careful because specific locations within states could
      potentially change this relationship if, for example, Trinity Dam was on the
      far eastern edge of California and Causey Reservoir was on the far western edge
      of Utah. But generally speaking, even the easternmost part of California is
      west of the westernmost part of Utah.</think>I need to determine the relative
      positions of these two water structures based on their locations in different

      - Utah is an inland state located to the east of California


      Step 2: Based on this state-level positioning:

      - Any location in Utah would be east of any location in California

      - This is because the entire state of Utah lies east of the entire state of
      California


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific locations:

      - Causey Reservoir is in Utah

      - Trinity Dam is in California

      - Therefore, Causey Reservoir must be east of Trinity Dam

      To answer this, I need to think about the relative geographic positions of Virginia
      and Ohio in the United States.


      The eastern United States has states arranged roughly as follows (going from
      east to west):

      - The Atlantic coast states (like Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut,
      New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, etc.)

      etc.


      Virginia is on the Atlantic coast, while Ohio is more inland and to the west
      of Virginia.


      Since Virginia is east of Ohio on the US map, and Fairfax is in Virginia while
      La Comedia Dinner Theatre is in Ohio, Truro Church in Fairfax, Virginia would

      - Ohio is an inland state located west of Virginia

      - All of Virginia is east of Ohio

      - Therefore, any location in Virginia (including Fairfax) would be east of any

      First, let''s think about the general geography of the United States. Kansas
      (KS) is east of Colorado (CO), as Colorado is in the Rocky Mountain region while
      Kansas is in the Great Plains region. The states border each other, with Kansas
      directly east of Colorado.


      Since Kanopolis Lake is in Kansas and John Martin Reservoir is in Colorado,
      it''s very likely that Kanopolis Lake is east of John Martin Reservoir. However,
      I should consider the specific locations within these states, as it''s theoretically
      possible (though unlikely) that Kanopolis Lake could be in western Kansas while
      John Martin Reservoir could be in eastern Colorado.

      - Colorado is located in the western United States

      - Kansas is located directly east of Colorado


      Step 3: Determine the locations within their respective states.

      - Even though the exact locations within each state might vary, the fact that
      the entire state of Kansas lies east of Colorado means that any location in
      Kansas would be east of any location in Colorado.

      First, let me identify the states:

      - Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee (TN)

      - Tulsa Performing Arts Center is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Now I need to think about the relative positions of these states in the US:


      Tennessee (TN) is in the southeastern United States. It borders Kentucky to
      the north, Virginia to the northeast, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama,
      and Mississippi to the south, Arkansas to the southwest, and Missouri to the
      northwest.


      Oklahoma (OK) is in the south-central United States. It borders Kansas to the
      north, Missouri to the northeast, Arkansas to the east, Texas to the south,
      New Mexico to the west, and Colorado to the northwest.


      If we look at a map of the US, Tennessee is positioned east of Oklahoma. Tennessee
      is closer to the Atlantic coast, while Oklahoma is further west toward the center
      of the country.


      So generally speaking, locations in Tennessee would be east of locations in
      Oklahoma.</think>To determine if Arnold Engineering Development Complex, TN
      is located east of Tulsa Performing Arts Center, OK, I need to consider the
      geographic positions of Tennessee and Oklahoma.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each facility is located.

      - Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee (TN)

      - Tulsa Performing Arts Center is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states on the US map.

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Determine their east-west relationship.

      - Looking at a US map, Tennessee is positioned to the east of Oklahoma

      - Tennessee is closer to the Atlantic coast, while Oklahoma is more centrally
      located


      Since Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee, and Tennessee
      is east of Oklahoma (where Tulsa Performing Arts Center is located), the Arnold
      Engineering Development Complex is east of the Tulsa Performing Arts Center.

      - Oklahoma is located in the central United States

      - On a map of the US, Tennessee is positioned entirely east of Oklahoma


      Step 3: Even without knowing the exact coordinates:

      to determine the relative east-west positions of these two water structures:

      1. Pathfinder Reservoir in Wyoming (WY)

      First, let me think about the general geography of these states. Idaho is located
      west of Wyoming - Idaho is in the Pacific Northwest, while Wyoming is in the
      Mountain West region.


      Given that these states border each other with Idaho to the west of Wyoming,
      it''s likely (but not guaranteed) that a reservoir in Wyoming would be east
      of a dam in Idaho.


      To be more precise:

      - Pathfinder Reservoir is in Wyoming

      - C. J. Strike Dam is in Idaho


      Since Wyoming is east of Idaho, and these structures are in their respective

      Determining the Relative Locations of Pathfinder Reservoir and C. J. Strike
      Dam


      To answer this question, I need to determine the east-west relationship between
      these two water structures.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Pathfinder Reservoir is located in Wyoming (WY)

      - C. J. Strike Dam is located in Idaho (ID)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      Idaho is located directly west of Wyoming. The entire Idaho-Wyoming border runs
      north-south, with Idaho always being to the west and Wyoming always being to
      the east.


      ## Step 3: Apply this state relationship to the water structures

      Since Pathfinder Reservoir is in Wyoming, and C. J. Strike Dam is in Idaho,
      the reservoir must be east of the dam, following the same east-west relationship
      as their respective states.


      ## Answer: YES

      in IL.


      So the answer should be YES.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each location is situated.

      - Ashokan Reservoir is in New York (NY)

      - Presidential Towers is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York is clearly east of Illinois on any US map


      Step 3: Since the locations are in their respective states, they follow the
      same directional relationship.

      consider the geographic positions of these two states.


      Step 1: Determine the relative positions of West Virginia and Illinois.

      Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while West Virginia
      is located in the Appalachian region of the eastern United States.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on a west-to-east axis.

      Illinois is significantly west of West Virginia. Illinois borders the Mississippi
      River on its western border, while West Virginia is much closer to the Atlantic
      coast.


      Step 3: Consider the specific facilities.

      Since Gibson Generating Station is in Illinois and Mountaineer Wind Energy Center
      is in West Virginia, and there''s no indication that either facility is in an
      unusual location within their respective states, they would maintain the same
      general east-west relationship as their states.


      YES, Mountaineer Wind Energy Center in West Virginia is located east of Gibson
      Generating Station in Illinois.'

      Let me think about the general geography:

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States

      - Ohio is in the Midwest, and Toledo is in the northwestern part of Ohio

      - In the United States, locations further east have higher longitude values

      means less negative or closer to zero)


      Generally speaking, New York state is east of Ohio. New York City is on the
      eastern coast, while Toledo, Ohio would be significantly further west.


      Barrow Street Theatre would be in New York City, specifically in the Greenwich
      Village neighborhood of Manhattan.


      Rosary Cathedral is in Toledo, Ohio, which is in the northwestern part of Ohio,

      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - New York City is significantly farther east than any part of Ohio

      - The entire state of New York is east of Ohio


      Therefore, Barrow Street Theatre in NY is definitely located east of Rosary
      Cathedral in Toledo, Ohio.

      First, let me recall the general geography:

      - Arizona is a state located east of California in the United States

      - Yorba Linda is a city in Orange County in southern California


      Since Arizona is east of California, and Black Canyon Lake is in Arizona while

      - Arizona borders California to the east

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positioning of these states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      in Chicago is east of Lewis and Clark Lake in Nebraska.


      First, Theatre Building Chicago is in Chicago, Illinois. Chicago is located
      on the western shore of Lake Michigan in the northeastern part of Illinois.


      Lewis and Clark Lake is in Nebraska (NE). Nebraska is west of Illinois. Lewis

      - Nebraska is in the central United States

      - Illinois is further east in the Midwest

      Lewis and Clark Lake is in Nebraska (NE), which is located in the central United

      River.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Birmingham, Alabama is located in the southeastern part of the United States.

      Fort Worth, Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States.


      Generally speaking, Alabama is east of Texas. Alabama is on the Gulf Coast in
      the southeastern U.S., while Texas is in the south-central U.S. along the Gulf
      Coast extending westward.


      So Independent Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Alabama would be east of Blackstone

      Alabama is located in the southeastern United States, while Texas is in the
      south-central United States.


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      On a map of the United States, Alabama is positioned to the east of Texas. The
      entire state of Alabama lies east of Texas.


      Step 3: Since Birmingham is in Alabama and Fort Worth is in Texas, their relative
      positions follow the same pattern as their states.

      Birmingham, Alabama is east of Fort Worth, Texas.


      Step 4: Therefore, Independent Presbyterian Church in Birmingham must be east
      of Blackstone Hotel in Fort Worth.

      and Fort Worth, Texas on a map of the United States.


      Birmingham, Alabama is located in the southeastern United States. Alabama is
      a state that borders the Gulf of Mexico and is east of Mississippi.


      Fort Worth, Texas is located in the south-central United States. Texas is a
      large state that borders the Gulf of Mexico and is west of Louisiana.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Alabama is definitely east of Texas. This
      means that Birmingham, Alabama would be east of Fort Worth, Texas.

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States


      Step 2: Determine the east-west relationship between these states.

      - Alabama is clearly east of Texas on a U.S. map

      - Texas and Alabama are not adjacent; several states lie between them (including
      Mississippi and Louisiana)


      Step 3: Since Birmingham is in Alabama and Fort Worth is in Texas, they inherit
      the same east-west relationship as their states.

      - Birmingham, Alabama is east of Fort Worth, Texas


      Step 4: Therefore, the Independent Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Alabama
      would be east of the Blackstone Hotel in Fort Worth, Texas.

      if the Independent Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Alabama is located east
      of the Blackstone Hotel in Fort Worth, Texas.


      To solve this, I need to understand the relative positions of these two locations.
      In the United States, locations can be compared as "east" or "west" based on
      their longitude.


      Step 1: Determine the relative locations of Alabama and Texas.

      Alabama is in the southeastern United States, while Texas is in the south-central
      United States. Generally, Alabama is east of Texas.


      Step 2: Be more specific about Birmingham, AL vs. Fort Worth, TX.

      Birmingham is a major city in central Alabama.

      Fort Worth is a major city in north-central Texas.


      Since Alabama is east of Texas, and Birmingham and Fort Worth are both major
      cities in their respective states (not on unusual borders), Birmingham, Alabama
      would be east of Fort Worth, Texas.


      Therefore, the Independent Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Alabama would
      be east of the Blackstone Hotel in Fort Worth, Texas.</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Independent Presbyterian Church is in Birmingham, Alabama (AL)

      - Blackstone Hotel is in Fort Worth, Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic locations of these states.

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Alabama is positioned to the east of Texas on the U.S. map

      - Birmingham is in central Alabama

      - Fort Worth is in north-central Texas


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Alabama is east of Texas, and both cities (Birmingham and Fort Worth)
      are not positioned in a way that would reverse this relationship, the Independent
      Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Alabama must be east of the Blackstone Hotel
      in Fort Worth, Texas.

      - Tennessee (TN) is a state in the eastern part of the United States

      - Oklahoma (OK) is a state in the central-southern part of the United States

      - When comparing the geographic positions of states, Tennessee is definitely

      Since Cherokee Lake is in Tennessee and Oologah Lake is in Oklahoma, and Tennessee
      is east of Oklahoma, it follows that Cherokee Lake would be east of Oologah
      Lake.


      To be more precise:

      - Cherokee Lake is in eastern Tennessee

      - Tennessee is located in the eastern United States

      - Oklahoma is located in the central United States

      - On a map of the US, Tennessee is positioned significantly east of Oklahoma


      Step 3: Since the lakes are within their respective states, their relative positions

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Basilica of Regina Pacis is in New York (NY)

      - Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus is in Joliet, Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Determine their geographical positions.

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - States on the east coast (like New York) are east of Midwestern states (like
      Illinois)

      - Moving from Illinois to New York means traveling eastward


      Therefore, the Basilica of Regina Pacis in NY is indeed located east of the

      I need to determine if the NY basilica is east of the Illinois cathedral.


      United States geography: The continental US has the East Coast on the Atlantic

      Knoxville, Tennessee is located in the eastern part of Tennessee, near the border
      with North Carolina.


      Lake Wappapello is in southeastern Missouri.


      In the United States, Missouri is west of Tennessee. Tennessee borders Missouri''s
      eastern neighbor, Kentucky. So generally speaking, locations in Tennessee are
      east of locations in Missouri.


      To be more specific:

      - Knoxville is in eastern Tennessee

      - Lake Wappapello is in southeastern Missouri


      Since Missouri is west of Tennessee, and Knoxville is in the eastern part of
      Tennessee, the Cathedral of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus in Knoxville, Tennessee

      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Tennessee is located east of Missouri in the United States.

      - Knoxville is specifically in eastern Tennessee, near the North Carolina border.

      - Lake Wappapello is in southeastern Missouri.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Since Missouri is entirely west of Tennessee, and Knoxville is in the eastern
      part of Tennessee, the cathedral must be east of Lake Wappapello.


      YES, the Cathedral of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus in Knoxville, Tennessee
      is located east of Lake Wappapello, Missouri.'

      Specifically, I need to determine if the NY location is east of the OH location.


      I should think about the geography of the United States. Generally:

      - States on the East Coast (like New York) are in the eastern part of the United
      States

      - Ohio is in the Midwest, but is relatively eastern compared to many other states

      - However, Ohio is definitely west of New York state


      So in general, locations in New York state would be east of locations in Ohio.


      More specifically:

      - 1 Pace Plaza appears to be in New York City (in Manhattan)

      - Atwood Lake is in Ohio


      New York City is on the East Coast, while Ohio is inland and west of New York.

      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region, west of New York

      - 1 Pace Plaza is in Manhattan, New York City, in the eastern part of New York
      state

      - Atwood Lake is in Ohio, which is entirely west of New York state

      to determine the locations of both structures:


      1. Navajo Generating Station, AZ - This is in Arizona (AZ)

      2. New Exchequer Dam, CA - This is in California (CA)


      Next I need to determine their relative positions (east-west relationship).


      The United States has California on the west coast, while Arizona is inland
      and to the east of California. Generally speaking, locations in Arizona are
      east of locations in California.


      So geographically:

      - California is west of Arizona

      - Therefore Arizona is east of California

      - The Navajo Generating Station in Arizona should be east of New Exchequer Dam
      in California


      Let me double check this reasoning:

      - California borders the Pacific Ocean on the west

      - Arizona is directly east of the southern portion of California

      - So any location in Arizona would be east of any location in California


      Based on the general geography of US states, a structure in Arizona would be
      east of a structure in California.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona is located directly east of California


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      Since Arizona is east of California, structures in Arizona will generally be
      east of structures in California. The specific locations within each state could
      theoretically affect this, but the overall state positions are definitive enough
      in this case.


      YES, Navajo Generating Station in Arizona is located east of New Exchequer Dam

      Texas tend to be east of locations in New Mexico.


      However, I need to be careful because specific locations within these states

      area suitable for wind farming.

      - Basilica of San Albino, NM: This is in New Mexico, and is likely a Catholic
      church.

      4) Even though King Mountain Wind Farm is in western Texas, Texas as a whole
      is east of New Mexico.


      5) The east-west positioning is what matters here. Since New Mexico borders
      Texas on its east side, and these specific locations maintain this relative

      - New Mexico is located west of Texas (Texas is east of New Mexico)

      - Generally, locations in Texas would be east of locations in New Mexico


      King Mountain Wind Farm is in Texas (TX), and the Basilica of San Albino is

      1. King Mountain Wind Farm, TX (in Texas)

      2. Basilica of San Albino, NM (in New Mexico)


      To answer whether one is east of the other, I need to compare their geographical
      coordinates or at least know their relative positions.


      Generally, Texas is east of New Mexico since New Mexico is in the southwestern
      United States, while Texas is to its east. However, I need to be careful because:

      1. Texas is a large state

      2. These specific locations could be near the border

      3. The eastern part of NM could be east of the western part of TX


      Let me think about where these might be located:

      - The Basilica of San Albino is likely in New Mexico

      - King Mountain Wind Farm is in Texas


      Since Texas is generally east of New Mexico, and these locations appear to be
      in their respective states, it''s likely that the King Mountain Wind Farm in
      TX is east of the Basilica of San Albino in NM. But I should be careful about
      making assumptions about exact locations.


      Given the geography of the United States, with New Mexico being west of Texas,
      a location in Texas would typically be east of a location in New Mexico. Without
      specific coordinates, but based on the state locations, I can reasonably conclude
      that King Mountain Wind Farm in TX is east of the Basilica of San Albino in
      NM.</think># Is King Mountain Wind Farm, TX located east of Basilica of San
      Albino, NM?


      Let me work through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the states: King Mountain Wind Farm is in Texas
      (TX) and the Basilica of San Albino is in New Mexico (NM).


      2) Looking at the geographic relationship between these states: New Mexico is
      located in the southwestern United States, while Texas is positioned to the
      east of New Mexico.


      3) The Basilica of San Albino is likely in a populated area of New Mexico, while
      King Mountain Wind Farm would be in a suitable location for wind energy in Texas.


      4) Even accounting for the irregular shapes of state borders, locations in Texas
      (including wind farms) are generally east of locations in New Mexico.


      Based on this geographic analysis, King Mountain Wind Farm in Texas is located
      east of the Basilica of San Albino in New Mexico.

    67aa488f-a82f-46b3-8709-e5642730bfdc: '<think>This question is asking me to determine
      the relative positions of two US buildings/structures: the National Weather
      Center in Oklahoma (OK) and the FirstBank Southwest Tower in Texas (TX).


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to know their locations, particularly
      their longitudes. In the US, places further east have higher longitude values
      (less negative or more positive).


      Let me think about where these structures might be located:


      1. National Weather Center, OK - This would be in Oklahoma, likely in Norman,
      OK (which is where the National Weather Service has a major facility)

      2. FirstBank Southwest Tower, TX - This would be in Texas, and the "Southwest"
      in the name suggests it might be in the western part of Texas


      Oklahoma is generally east of Texas, but the specific locations matter. Oklahoma
      borders Texas on Texas''s northern border, so some parts of Oklahoma are directly
      north of parts of Texas.


      Norman, OK (where I believe the National Weather Center is) is in central Oklahoma.

      The "Southwest" in FirstBank Southwest Tower suggests it might be in southwest
      Texas, but it could also just be the name of the bank. I think it''s possibly
      in Amarillo, which is in the Texas Panhandle (northwest Texas).


      If the National Weather Center is in Norman, OK and the FirstBank Southwest
      Tower is in Amarillo, TX, then the National Weather Center would be east of
      the FirstBank Southwest Tower.


      But I need to be careful here. Let me reconsider what I know for certain.</think>#
      Determining if National Weather Center, OK is east of FirstBank Southwest Tower,
      TX


      To answer this question, I need to find the locations of both buildings and
      compare their longitudes. East-west positioning in the US is determined by longitude,
      with eastern locations having higher (less negative) longitude values.


      ## Step 1: Locate the National Weather Center, OK

      The National Weather Center is located in Norman, Oklahoma, which is in the
      central part of the state.


      ## Step 2: Locate the FirstBank Southwest Tower, TX

      FirstBank Southwest Tower is located in Amarillo, Texas, which is in the Texas
      Panhandle (the northwestern part of Texas).


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      - Norman, Oklahoma is located in central Oklahoma

      - Amarillo, Texas is located in the northwestern part of Texas

      - Oklahoma borders Texas on its northern side

      - The Texas Panhandle extends northward, with Amarillo situated in this western
      portion


      ## Step 4: Determine east-west relationship

      When comparing these locations, Norman, OK is positioned to the east of Amarillo,
      TX. Looking at a map of the United States, Oklahoma''s central region is clearly
      east of the Texas Panhandle.


      Therefore, YES, the National Weather Center in Oklahoma is located east of the
      FirstBank Southwest Tower in Texas.'

      1. National Weather Center in Oklahoma (OK)

      2. FirstBank Southwest Tower in Texas (TX)


      I need to determine if the first is east of the second.


      Let me think about the geography of the US states:

      - Oklahoma (OK) is located in the central part of the US

      - Texas (TX) is located south of Oklahoma


      In terms of east-west positioning, Texas extends further east and west than
      Oklahoma. However, the exact locations of these buildings matter.


      The National Weather Center is likely in Norman, Oklahoma, which is in the central
      part of Oklahoma.


      FirstBank Southwest Tower is likely in Amarillo, Texas, which is in the Texas
      Panhandle in the northwestern part of Texas.


      The Texas Panhandle is to the west of Oklahoma. So a building in the Texas Panhandle
      (like Amarillo) would be west of a building in central Oklahoma (like Norman).


      Therefore, the National Weather Center in Oklahoma would be east of the FirstBank
      Southwest Tower in Texas.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the geographic locations of both buildings and compare their east-west positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both buildings.

      - The National Weather Center is located in Norman, Oklahoma.

      - FirstBank Southwest Tower is located in Amarillo, Texas, in the Texas Panhandle
      region.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these locations.

      - The Texas Panhandle extends northward along the western side of Oklahoma.

      - Amarillo is situated in the northern part of the Texas Panhandle.

      - Norman, Oklahoma is in the central part of Oklahoma.


      Step 3: Compare east-west positioning.

      - Amarillo, Texas is positioned in the western portion of the Texas-Oklahoma
      region.

      - Norman, Oklahoma lies to the east of the Texas Panhandle.


      Therefore, the National Weather Center in Oklahoma is located east of the FirstBank
      Southwest Tower in Texas.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Lemp Mansion is in Missouri (MO)

      - Marion Reservoir is in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Missouri and Kansas.

      - St. Louis, where Lemp Mansion is located, is on the eastern side of Missouri
      (near the Illinois border)

      - Marion Reservoir is in central Kansas


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these facts.

      Since Missouri is entirely east of Kansas, and Lemp Mansion is in Missouri (specifically

      Missouri is located east of Marion Reservoir in Kansas, I need to identify their
      locations and compare them.


      First, let''s establish the locations:

      1. Lemp Mansion is in Missouri (MO)

      2. Marion Reservoir is in Kansas (KS)


      Generally, Missouri is located east of Kansas in the United States. The entire
      state of Missouri is east of Kansas.


      Lemp Mansion is specifically located in St. Louis, Missouri, which is on the
      eastern edge of Missouri, bordering Illinois.


      Marion Reservoir is located in Marion County, Kansas, which is in the central
      part of Kansas.


      Given the geography of the United States, with Kansas being west of Missouri,
      and Lemp Mansion being in St. Louis on the eastern side of Missouri, Lemp Mansion
      would definitely be east of Marion Reservoir.


      So the answer is YES, Lemp Mansion in Missouri is located east of Marion Reservoir
      in Kansas.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative
      positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Lemp Mansion is located in St. Louis, Missouri

      - Marion Reservoir is in Marion County, Kansas


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Kansas and Missouri.

      - Kansas is located directly west of Missouri in the United States


      Step 3: Determine the specific locations within their states.

      - St. Louis is on the eastern side of Missouri (along the Mississippi River)

      - Marion County is in central Kansas


      Step 4: Compare their relative positions.

      - Since all of Missouri is east of Kansas, and Lemp Mansion is in Missouri while
      Marion Reservoir is in Kansas, Lemp Mansion must be east of Marion Reservoir.


      YES, Lemp Mansion, MO is located east of Marion Reservoir, KS.'

      of Missouri.

      2. Marion Reservoir is in Marion County, Kansas, which is in the central part
      of Kansas.

      3. Kansas is west of Missouri - Missouri''s western border connects with Kansas''s
      eastern border.

      4. Since St. Louis is in eastern Missouri, and Marion Reservoir is in central
      Kansas, Lemp Mansion would be east of Marion Reservoir.


      Let me confirm this mental map: Kansas is west of Missouri. Marion Reservoir
      is in Kansas, while Lemp Mansion is in Missouri. Anything in Missouri would
      be east of anything in Kansas. So Lemp Mansion would be east of Marion Reservoir.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Lemp Mansion is located in St. Louis, Missouri.

      - Marion Reservoir is located in Marion County, Kansas.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Kansas is directly west of Missouri (Missouri''s western border meets Kansas''s
      eastern border).

      - St. Louis is in the eastern part of Missouri, near the Illinois border.

      - Marion County is in central Kansas.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Missouri is east of Kansas


      Now, for the specific locations:

      - Lemp Mansion is in Missouri (MO)

      - Marion Reservoir is in Kansas (KS)


      Since Missouri is east of Kansas, and Lemp Mansion is in Missouri while Marion
      Reservoir is in Kansas, generally speaking, Lemp Mansion would be east of Marion
      Reservoir.


      To be more precise:

      - Lemp Mansion is specifically in St. Louis, Missouri, which is on the eastern
      edge of Missouri

      - Marion Reservoir would be somewhere in Kansas, which is entirely west of Missouri


      Therefore, Lemp Mansion (in eastern Missouri) is definitely east of Marion Reservoir

      - Lemp Mansion is in St. Louis, Missouri, which is located in the eastern part
      of Missouri.

      - Marion Reservoir is in central Kansas, specifically in Marion County.


      Step 3: Determine relative positioning.

      Since Missouri is entirely east of Kansas, and Lemp Mansion is in eastern Missouri
      while Marion Reservoir is in Kansas, Lemp Mansion must be east of Marion Reservoir.

      - North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States

      - Tennessee is inland, west of North Carolina


      Now, more specifically about these lakes:

      - Badin Lake is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Chickamauga Lake is in Tennessee (TN)


      Since North Carolina is generally east of Tennessee, it''s likely that Badin

      east-west positioning of two landmarks:

      1. St. Raphael''s Cathedral in Dubuque, Iowa

      2. Lake Francis Case in South Dakota


      Let me think about the general geography:

      - Iowa is east of South Dakota

      - Dubuque is in eastern Iowa, right along the Mississippi River (on Iowa''s
      eastern border)

      - Lake Francis Case is in South Dakota, which is entirely west of Iowa


      Given that:

      - Dubuque is on the far eastern side of Iowa

      - Lake Francis Case is somewhere in South Dakota

      It follows that St. Raphael''s Cathedral in Dubuque, Iowa must be east of Lake
      Francis Case in South Dakota.</think>To answer this question, I need to consider
      the geographic locations of both landmarks.


      Step 1: Identify where St. Raphael''s Cathedral is located.

      St. Raphael''s Cathedral is in Dubuque, Iowa, which is located on the far eastern
      edge of Iowa along the Mississippi River.


      Step 2: Identify where Lake Francis Case is located.

      Lake Francis Case is a reservoir on the Missouri River in South Dakota, located
      in the central/southern part of the state.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions of these locations.

      South Dakota lies entirely west of Iowa. Since Dubuque is on the eastern border
      of Iowa, and Lake Francis Case is in South Dakota, the cathedral must be east
      of the lake.


      YES, St. Raphael''s Cathedral in Dubuque, Iowa is located east of Lake Francis
      Case, South Dakota.'

      locations of Cathedral of Saint Andrew in Grand Rapids, Michigan and Big Bend
      Dam in South Dakota, and then compare their east-west positions.


      First, let''s identify where Grand Rapids, Michigan is located. Michigan is
      in the eastern part of the United States, specifically in the Great Lakes region.
      It''s divided into two peninsulas, with the Lower Peninsula (where Grand Rapids
      is located) bordering Lake Michigan to the west.


      Next, let''s identify where Big Bend Dam is in South Dakota. South Dakota is
      in the Midwest/Great Plains region of the United States, west of Minnesota and
      east of Wyoming.


      In terms of east-west positioning in the US:

      - Michigan is generally east of South Dakota

      - Therefore, Grand Rapids, MI (where the Cathedral is) should be east of any
      location in South Dakota, including Big Bend Dam


      To be more precise about east-west positioning, I can think about longitude.
      Eastern locations have higher longitude values than western locations in the
      US. Michigan is definitely further east (higher longitude) than South Dakota.</think>To

      - South Dakota is located in the Great Plains region in the western portion
      of the Midwest


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Michigan is significantly east of South Dakota on the US map

      - Any location in Michigan (including Grand Rapids) would be east of locations
      in South Dakota

      - Grand Rapids is in western Michigan, but this is still far east of South Dakota

      Specifically, it''s asking if the cathedral is located east of the dam.


      To answer this, I need to determine the relative positions of Michigan and South
      Dakota. In the United States:

      - Michigan is in the Midwest, bordering the Great Lakes

      - South Dakota is also in the Midwest, but further west than Michigan


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Michigan is roughly in the eastern half of the continental US

      - South Dakota is more in the middle/western portion of the continental US


      Michigan is generally east of South Dakota. Grand Rapids is in western Michigan,

      locations of two places: Point Beach Nuclear Plant in Wisconsin and Our Lady
      of Lourdes Catholic Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota.


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to compare their longitudes.
      East-west positioning is determined by longitude - eastern locations have more
      easterly (smaller negative or larger positive) longitudes in North America.


      Let''s think about the general geography:

      - Wisconsin is located east of Minnesota

      - Minneapolis is in eastern Minnesota

      - Point Beach Nuclear Plant would likely be near water (perhaps Lake Michigan,
      which is on the eastern side of Wisconsin)


      Based on these general geographic facts, Point Beach Nuclear Plant in Wisconsin
      is likely east of Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
      This is because Wisconsin is generally east of Minnesota, and especially if
      the nuclear plant is on the eastern side of Wisconsin near Lake Michigan, it
      would definitely be east of Minneapolis.


      So my reasoning suggests that Point Beach Nuclear Plant, WI is east of Our Lady
      of Lourdes Catholic Church in Minneapolis, MN.</think># Is Point Beach Nuclear
      Plant, WI located east of Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church (Minneapolis,
      Minnesota), MN?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Consider the geographic positions of Wisconsin and Minnesota.

      - Minnesota is located west of Wisconsin.

      - Minneapolis is in eastern Minnesota.


      Step 2: Consider the likely location of Point Beach Nuclear Plant in Wisconsin.

      - Nuclear plants are often located near bodies of water for cooling purposes.

      - Given the name "Point Beach," it''s likely located on Lake Michigan, which
      forms Wisconsin''s eastern border.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - Even if Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is in eastern Minneapolis (Minnesota),
      it would still be west of Wisconsin.

      - Point Beach Nuclear Plant, especially if it''s on Lake Michigan, would be
      in eastern Wisconsin.


      Therefore, Point Beach Nuclear Plant in Wisconsin is located east of Our Lady

      The two places are:

      1. Point Beach Nuclear Plant in Wisconsin (WI)

      2. Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota (MN)


      To determine if one place is east of another, I need to compare their longitudes.
      Lower (more negative) longitude values in North America indicate more western
      locations, while higher (less negative) longitude values indicate more eastern
      locations.


      Let me think about the general geography:

      - Wisconsin is generally east of Minnesota

      - Minneapolis is in eastern Minnesota

      - "Point Beach" suggests this nuclear plant is near a body of water, likely
      Lake Michigan which is on the eastern border of Wisconsin


      Based on the general geography of the United States, Wisconsin is east of Minnesota.
      Since Point Beach Nuclear Plant is in Wisconsin and Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic
      Church is in Minneapolis, Minnesota, it''s very likely that the nuclear plant
      is east of the church.


      Point Beach Nuclear Plant is almost certainly on the eastern shore of Wisconsin
      along Lake Michigan, while Minneapolis is in eastern Minnesota but still west
      of Wisconsin. Therefore, Point Beach Nuclear Plant should be east of Our Lady
      of Lourdes Catholic Church.</think>I need to compare the geographic locations
      of these two places to determine if one is east of the other.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Point Beach Nuclear Plant is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is in Minneapolis, Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Wisconsin and Minnesota.

      Minnesota is located west of Wisconsin. Minneapolis is in eastern Minnesota,
      but Wisconsin as a whole lies to the east of Minnesota.


      Step 3: Consider the likely location of Point Beach Nuclear Plant within Wisconsin.

      The name "Point Beach" suggests this nuclear plant is likely located on the
      shore of Lake Michigan, which forms Wisconsin''s eastern border.


      Step 4: Compare the relative positions.

      Even if the nuclear plant were on the western edge of Wisconsin (which is unlikely
      given its name), it would still be east of Minneapolis. Since the plant is likely
      on the eastern shore of Wisconsin, it is definitely east of Minneapolis and

      Plant in Wisconsin is located east of Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in
      Minneapolis, Minnesota, I need to compare the geographical locations of these
      two places.


      Let me think about the general geography of Wisconsin and Minnesota:

      - Minnesota is located west of Wisconsin

      - Wisconsin borders Lake Michigan on its eastern side

      - Minneapolis is in the eastern part of Minnesota


      Point Beach Nuclear Plant is likely on the eastern side of Wisconsin (since
      nuclear plants are often built near water bodies for cooling, and Wisconsin''s
      eastern border is Lake Michigan).


      Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is in Minneapolis, which is in Minnesota,
      west of Wisconsin.


      Since Wisconsin is east of Minnesota, and Point Beach Nuclear Plant is in Wisconsin
      while Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is in Minneapolis, Minnesota, it follows
      that Point Beach Nuclear Plant would be east of the church.</think># Determining
      if Point Beach Nuclear Plant is east of Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church


      I need to consider the geographical relationship between these two locations:


      1) Point Beach Nuclear Plant is located in Wisconsin, specifically on the shore
      of Lake Michigan.


      2) Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is in Minneapolis, Minnesota.


      3) Geographically, Wisconsin is positioned east of Minnesota in the United States.


      4) Minneapolis is in the eastern portion of Minnesota, but still west of Wisconsin''s
      border.


      5) Nuclear plants like Point Beach are typically built on bodies of water (in
      this case Lake Michigan, which forms Wisconsin''s eastern border).


      Since the nuclear plant is in Wisconsin (which is entirely east of Minnesota)
      and specifically on Wisconsin''s eastern shore, while the church is in Minneapolis,
      Minnesota (west of Wisconsin), the nuclear plant must be east of the church.


      YES, Point Beach Nuclear Plant in Wisconsin is located east of Our Lady of Lourdes
      Catholic Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota.'

      locations of Point Beach Nuclear Plant in Wisconsin and Our Lady of Lourdes

      First, I need to know roughly where these two locations are:


      1. Point Beach Nuclear Plant is in Wisconsin (WI). Wisconsin is located east
      of Minnesota.


      2. Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is in Minneapolis, Minnesota (MN). Minneapolis
      is in eastern Minnesota, but still in Minnesota.


      Since Wisconsin is east of Minnesota, and Point Beach Nuclear Plant is in Wisconsin,
      while Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is in Minneapolis, Minnesota, it''s
      likely that Point Beach Nuclear Plant is east of the church.


      To be more precise:

      - Minneapolis is in the eastern part of Minnesota

      - Wisconsin borders Minnesota on Minnesota''s eastern side

      - Point Beach Nuclear Plant, being in Wisconsin, would be east of the Minnesota
      border


      Therefore, Point Beach Nuclear Plant, WI would be east of Our Lady of Lourdes
      Catholic Church in Minneapolis, MN.</think>I''ll solve this step by step to
      determine the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each location is situated.

      - Point Beach Nuclear Plant is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is in Minneapolis, Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Wisconsin and Minnesota.

      - Minnesota is located west of Wisconsin

      - Wisconsin borders Minnesota on Minnesota''s eastern side


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - Minneapolis is located in eastern Minnesota, near the Wisconsin border

      - Point Beach Nuclear Plant is located on the eastern shore of Wisconsin, along
      Lake Michigan


      Step 4: Determine the relative positions.

      Since Wisconsin is east of Minnesota, and Point Beach Nuclear Plant is on the
      eastern side of Wisconsin (on Lake Michigan), while Minneapolis is in eastern
      Minnesota, Point Beach Nuclear Plant is definitely east of Our Lady of Lourdes
      Catholic Church in Minneapolis.

      whether the Wellmont Theater in New Jersey is located east of the LaDue Reservoir
      in Ohio.


      To answer this, I need to think about the relative geographical positions of
      New Jersey and Ohio in the United States.


      The United States is organized such that:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region

      - New Jersey is on the East Coast


      Looking at the map of the United States, New Jersey is clearly east of Ohio.
      The entire state of New Jersey lies to the east of the entire state of Ohio.

      New Jersey is east of Ohio, it follows that Wellmont Theater is east of LaDue
      Reservoir.</think>I need to determine if Wellmont Theater in New Jersey is east
      of LaDue Reservoir in Ohio by considering their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - Wellmont Theater is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - LaDue Reservoir is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states in the US.

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region, west of New Jersey


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - When looking at a US map, all of New Jersey lies east of all of Ohio

      - There is no portion of Ohio that is east of any part of New Jersey


      Step 4: Draw conclusion about the specific locations.

      - Since Wellmont Theater is in NJ, and LaDue Reservoir is in OH, the theater
      must be east of the reservoir, following the relative positions of their states.


      YES'

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region, west of New Jersey


      Step 3: Consider the geographical relationship.

      Since New Jersey is east of Ohio on the U.S. map, and these locations are in
      their respective states, Wellmont Theater (in NJ) must be east of LaDue Reservoir
      (in OH).


      YES, Wellmont Theater, NJ is located east of LaDue Reservoir, OH.'

      1. We need to determine the relative positions of two locations: Wellmont Theater

      2. First, I need to think about the general geography of the United States.
      New Jersey is on the East Coast of the United States, while Ohio is more inland,
      in what''s sometimes called the Midwest or Great Lakes region.


      3. Generally speaking, New Jersey is east of Ohio. The entire state of New Jersey

      4. Since Wellmont Theater is in New Jersey, and LaDue Reservoir is in Ohio,
      it follows that Wellmont Theater is east of LaDue Reservoir.


      So the answer should be YES, but let me double-check my geographic understanding
      to make sure.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is located inland, in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - New Jersey is entirely east of Ohio on the U.S. map

      - All locations in New Jersey are therefore east of all locations in Ohio


      Since Wellmont Theater is in New Jersey and LaDue Reservoir is in Ohio, and
      New Jersey is east of Ohio, the Wellmont Theater must be east of LaDue Reservoir.

      Let me think about the geographic layout of the United States:

      - New Jersey (NJ) is on the East Coast of the United States

      So if Wellmont Theater is in New Jersey and LaDue Reservoir is in Ohio, then
      Wellmont Theater would be east of LaDue Reservoir.


      Let me double-check by thinking about the specific locations:

      - Wellmont Theater is likely in a city in New Jersey

      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Utah is located inland, to the east of California

      - These states don''t share a border - Nevada sits between them


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - Cathedral Basilica of St. James is in Brooklyn, New York (NY)

      - Tappan Lake is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region, west of New York


      Step 3: More specifically, Brooklyn is in the western part of Long Island in

      1. We need to determine if St. Ambrose Cathedral in Des Moines, Iowa (IA) is
      located east of the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project in Wyoming

      2. To answer this, I need to know the relative positions of Iowa and Wyoming
      within the United States.


      The United States is arranged with states generally positioned from west to
      east as you move from the Pacific Ocean toward the Atlantic Ocean.


      Wyoming is in the western part of the United States, in the Mountain region.

      Iowa is in the midwestern United States, in the Midwest region.


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Wyoming is positioned to the west of Iowa.
      Therefore, Iowa is east of Wyoming.

      Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project is in Wyoming, the cathedral would be east
      of the wind energy project.</think>I need to determine the relative geographical

      - St. Ambrose Cathedral is in Des Moines, Iowa (IA)

      - Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project is in Wyoming (WY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic arrangement of these states.

      In the United States, states are arranged with the west coast near the Pacific
      Ocean and the east coast near the Atlantic Ocean. Wyoming is in the western
      mountain region, while Iowa is in the Midwest region.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      Wyoming is positioned west of Iowa on the US map. Iowa is closer to the east
      coast than Wyoming.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since St. Ambrose Cathedral is in Iowa, and Iowa is east of Wyoming (where the
      wind energy project is located), the cathedral must be east of the wind energy
      project.

      The United States is generally oriented with east being toward the Atlantic
      Ocean and west being toward the Pacific Ocean. States that are more to the right
      on a US map are more eastern.


      Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Wyoming is
      located in the Mountain West region.


      Generally speaking:

      - Iowa is east of Wyoming

      - Iowa borders Illinois to its east, Wisconsin to its northeast, Minnesota to
      its north, South Dakota to its northwest, Nebraska to its west, and Missouri
      to its south

      - Wyoming borders Montana to its north, South Dakota and Nebraska to its east,
      Colorado to its south, Utah to its southwest, and Idaho and Montana to its west


      Since Iowa as a state is east of Wyoming as a state, and Des Moines (Iowa''s
      capital where St. Ambrose Cathedral is located) is in central Iowa, while the

      the United States.


      2) The United States is oriented with the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the
      Pacific Ocean to the west.


      3) Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States.


      4) Wyoming is located in the Mountain West region, which is west of the Midwest.

      would be east of coastal California locations. This is because Arizona''s western
      border touches California''s eastern border, and Phoenix is well within Arizona,
      while Santa Barbara is on California''s western coast.


      Therefore, the Hyatt Regency Phoenix, AZ is indeed located east of Our Lady
      of Sorrows Church in Santa Barbara, CA.

      First, I need to identify where these two structures are located:


      1. Lower Granite Dam, WA - This is one of the dams on the Snake River in Washington
      state. The Snake River is in eastern Washington, near the Idaho border.


      2. St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral, Seattle, WA - This is located in Seattle,
      which is in western Washington on Puget Sound.


      In the United States, east and west are determined relative to location on the
      map, with east being to the right on a standard map and west being to the left.


      Washington state extends from the Pacific Ocean in the west to Idaho in the
      east. Seattle is on the western side of the state near the Pacific Ocean, while
      the Snake River (where Lower Granite Dam is located) is in the eastern part

      I need to determine the relative locations of these two structures in Washington

      First, let me identify their locations:

      - St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral is located in Seattle, which is in western
      Washington near Puget Sound and the Pacific Ocean

      - Lower Granite Dam is located on the Snake River in eastern Washington, near
      the Idaho border


      In terms of geographic orientation in Washington state:

      - Western Washington (including Seattle) is close to the Pacific coast

      - Eastern Washington is the inland portion of the state, bordering Idaho


      Since Lower Granite Dam is in eastern Washington while St. Mark''s Cathedral

      Let me think through the geographic locations:


      1) Seattle is located in western Washington state, on Puget Sound which connects
      to the Pacific Ocean. It''s in the western part of the state.


      2) Lower Granite Dam is located on the Snake River in eastern Washington state.
      The Snake River forms part of the border between Washington and Idaho, and the

      In the United States, east and west are defined relative to the Prime Meridian,
      with east being toward the Atlantic Ocean and west being toward the Pacific

      In terms of relative position, Washington state extends from the Pacific Ocean
      (west) toward Idaho (east). Seattle is in the western portion of the state,
      while the Snake River and its dams, including Lower Granite Dam, are in the

      First, let''s establish their locations:

      - Seattle is a city on the western side of Washington state, near the Pacific
      Ocean.

      - St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral is in Seattle, so it''s on the western side
      of Washington.

      - Lower Granite Dam is on the Snake River in eastern Washington. The Snake River
      forms part of the border between Washington and Idaho, and the dam is located
      in the southeastern part of Washington state.


      In the United States, east-west positioning is clear: east means toward the
      Atlantic Ocean, west means toward the Pacific Ocean. Washington state borders
      the Pacific Ocean on its western side.


      Since Lower Granite Dam is in eastern Washington and Seattle is in western Washington,
      the dam must be east of Seattle and therefore east of St. Mark''s Episcopal

      St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral is located in Seattle, Washington, which is
      in the western part of the state near Puget Sound and the Pacific Ocean.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lower Granite Dam.

      Lower Granite Dam is located on the Snake River in eastern Washington state,
      near the Washington-Idaho border.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      In the United States, east is toward the Atlantic Ocean and west is toward the
      Pacific Ocean. Since Seattle is in western Washington and Lower Granite Dam
      is in eastern Washington, the dam is positioned to the east of Seattle.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since St. Mark''s Cathedral is in Seattle (western Washington) and Lower Granite
      Dam is in eastern Washington, the dam is located east of the cathedral.

      which is part of the Pacific coast.


      Lower Granite Dam is likely on a river, and I need to determine where it''s

      Granite Dam is likely on the Snake River or Columbia River system. The Snake
      River runs through the eastern part of Washington state before joining the Columbia
      River.


      In terms of cardinal directions (east/west):

      - Seattle is in western Washington

      - If Lower Granite Dam is on the Snake River in eastern Washington, then it
      would be east of Seattle


      Let me confirm: Lower Granite Dam is indeed on the Snake River in eastern Washington,
      near the town of Pomeroy or Clarkston, close to the Idaho border. This puts
      it firmly in the eastern part of Washington state.

      Step 2: Identify where Lower Granite Dam is located.

      Lower Granite Dam is located on the Snake River in eastern Washington state,
      near the town of Pomeroy, not far from the Idaho border.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Washington state extends from the Pacific Ocean in the west to Idaho in the

    d3b5fee8-7983-4d80-aafa-2d6730eac6d7: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative east-west positions of two structures in Washington
      state:

      1. Lower Granite Dam, WA

      2. St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle, WA


      Let me think about their locations:


      Seattle is located in western Washington, on Puget Sound, which is part of the
      Pacific Ocean coastline. Seattle is one of the westernmost major cities in the
      continental US.


      Lower Granite Dam is located on the Snake River in eastern Washington. The Snake
      River forms part of the border between Washington and Idaho, and the dam is
      in the southeastern part of Washington state.


      In the United States, east is toward the Atlantic Ocean side of the country,
      and west is toward the Pacific Ocean side. Since Seattle is on the western edge
      of Washington near the Pacific, and Lower Granite Dam is in eastern Washington
      near the Idaho border, the dam would be east of Seattle.


      Therefore, Lower Granite Dam would be east of any structure in Seattle, including
      St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral.</think>I''ll think through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify where each structure is located within Washington
      state.


      2) Seattle is located in western Washington, on the Puget Sound near the Pacific
      coast. St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral, being in Seattle, is therefore in western
      Washington.


      3) Lower Granite Dam is located on the Snake River in eastern Washington state,
      near the Idaho border. It''s part of a system of dams on the lower Snake River.


      4) When comparing east-west positions in the United States, locations further
      toward the Atlantic Ocean are considered "east" of locations closer to the Pacific
      Ocean.


      5) Since Lower Granite Dam is in eastern Washington and St. Mark''s Cathedral
      is in western Washington (Seattle), the dam is east of the cathedral.


      YES, Lower Granite Dam is located east of St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral in
      Seattle.'

      of Lower Granite Dam, WA and St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle, WA,
      and determine their east-west relationship.


      First, let me identify where these structures are:


      1. Lower Granite Dam, WA: This dam is located on the Snake River in eastern
      Washington state. The Snake River forms part of the border between Washington
      and Idaho, and flows through eastern Washington.


      2. St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral, Seattle, WA: This cathedral is located in
      Seattle, which is in western Washington state, on the coast of Puget Sound.


      In the United States, going from west to east, we have:

      - Pacific Ocean

      - Western Washington (including Seattle)

      - Eastern Washington (including the Snake River where Lower Granite Dam is located)

      - Idaho


      So geographically, Lower Granite Dam is located in eastern Washington, while
      Seattle (and St. Mark''s Cathedral) is in western Washington. This means that
      Lower Granite Dam is east of St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral.</think>To determine
      if Lower Granite Dam is east of St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral, I need to identify
      the locations of both structures and compare their positions.


      Step 1: Locate St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral

      St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral is in Seattle, Washington, which is in the western
      part of Washington state, situated on Puget Sound near the Pacific coast.


      Step 2: Locate Lower Granite Dam

      Lower Granite Dam is on the Snake River in eastern Washington state, near the
      Washington-Idaho border. The Snake River flows through the eastern portion of
      Washington.


      Step 3: Compare east-west positions

      Washington state extends from the Pacific Ocean in the west to Idaho in the
      east. Seattle is in the western portion of the state, while the Snake River
      and Lower Granite Dam are in the eastern portion.


      Step 4: Make the determination

      Since Lower Granite Dam is in eastern Washington and Seattle is in western Washington,
      the dam is positioned east of the cathedral.


      YES, Lower Granite Dam, WA is located east of St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral,
      Seattle, WA.'

      1. Jocassee Dam, SC (South Carolina)

      2. Lewis Smith Lake, AL (Alabama)


      I need to figure out if Jocassee Dam is east of Lewis Smith Lake.


      Let me consider the geography of the United States:

      - South Carolina (SC) is on the east coast of the United States

      - Alabama (AL) is more inland and is west of South Carolina


      In general, South Carolina is east of Alabama. So based on the states alone,
      Jocassee Dam in SC should be east of Lewis Smith Lake in AL.


      To confirm this reasoning: If you look at a map of the United States, Alabama
      is in the southeastern part of the country, but South Carolina is even further
      east, directly on the Atlantic coast. So any location in South Carolina would
      be east of any location in Alabama.</think>To determine if Jocassee Dam, SC
      is located east of Lewis Smith Lake, AL, I need to consider the geographic positions
      of South Carolina and Alabama.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' locations.

      - South Carolina (SC) is located on the Atlantic coast in the southeastern United
      States.

      - Alabama (AL) is also in the southeastern United States, but is inland and
      west of South Carolina.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions.

      - South Carolina is entirely east of Alabama on a map of the United States.

      - The states don''t border each other - Georgia sits between them.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific locations.

      - Jocassee Dam is in South Carolina, in the western part of the state.

      - Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama.

      - Even the westernmost parts of South Carolina are still east of Alabama.


      Therefore, Jocassee Dam in South Carolina is indeed east of Lewis Smith Lake
      in Alabama.


      YES'

      SC (South Carolina) is located east of Lewis Smith Lake, AL (Alabama). To answer
      this, I need to think about the relative positions of South Carolina and Alabama

      In the United States:

      - South Carolina is on the east coast of the United States

      - Alabama is not on the east coast, but is in the southeastern region


      Looking at their relative positions:

      - South Carolina is east of Alabama

      - South Carolina borders the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side

      - Alabama is west of Georgia, which is west of South Carolina


      Since Jocassee Dam is in South Carolina and Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama,
      and South Carolina is east of Alabama, it follows that Jocassee Dam would be
      east of Lewis Smith Lake.

      - Alabama is also in the southeastern United States, but is west of Georgia,
      which itself is west of South Carolina


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship.

      - South Carolina is definitely east of Alabama in the United States

      - Since Jocassee Dam is in SC and Lewis Smith Lake is in AL, the dam would be
      east of the lake

      the relative positions of two locations in the US:


      1. Navajo Lake, New Mexico (NM)

      2. Saint Joseph Parish in Mountain View, California (CA)


      I need to figure out if Navajo Lake is east of Saint Joseph Parish.


      The United States generally has California on the west coast, and New Mexico
      is inland to the east of California. So generally speaking, locations in New
      Mexico would be east of locations in California.


      To confirm this:

      - California is the westernmost contiguous state in the US

      - New Mexico is several states east of California (typically you''d pass through
      Nevada and Arizona to get from California to New Mexico)


      Given the general geography of the United States, Navajo Lake in New Mexico
      would be east of any location in California, including Saint Joseph Parish in
      Mountain View.


      So my answer should be YES, Navajo Lake, NM is located east of Saint Joseph
      Parish in Mountain View, CA.</think># Is Navajo Lake, NM located east of Saint
      Joseph Parish (Mountain View, California), CA?


      Let me think about the geographic locations of these places:


      1) Mountain View, California is located in the San Francisco Bay Area on the
      west coast of the United States.


      2) Navajo Lake is located in northwestern New Mexico, near the Colorado border.


      3) In the United States, California is the westernmost contiguous state, while
      New Mexico is located several states to the east.


      4) Going from California to New Mexico, you would travel eastward (passing through
      Nevada and Arizona).


      Therefore, Navajo Lake in New Mexico is indeed located east of Saint Joseph
      Parish in Mountain View, California.

      2. Saint Joseph Parish in Mountain View, California (CA)


      Then I need to compare their east-west positions to determine if Navajo Lake
      is east of Saint Joseph Parish.


      First, let''s establish their relative positions:


      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States, east of California.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States, west of New Mexico.


      Mountain View is a city in northern California in the San Francisco Bay Area,
      near the west coast of the US.


      Navajo Lake is in northwestern New Mexico, near the Colorado border.

      Parish.</think>I''ll determine whether Navajo Lake, NM is east of Saint Joseph
      Parish in Mountain View, CA by comparing their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Navajo Lake is located in northwestern New Mexico.

      - Saint Joseph Parish is in Mountain View, California, which is in the San Francisco
      Bay Area of northern California.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions on the US map.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States.

      - New Mexico is in the southwestern United States, but significantly east of
      California.


      Step 3: Apply the geographic relationship between the states.

      - All of New Mexico is east of all of California.

      - Therefore, any location in New Mexico (including Navajo Lake) would be east
      of any location in California (including Saint Joseph Parish in Mountain View).


      YES, Navajo Lake, NM is located east of Saint Joseph Parish in Mountain View,

      Navajo Lake is a reservoir in northwestern New Mexico, near the Colorado border.


      In terms of east-west orientation in the United States, New Mexico is east of
      California. This is because California is on the Pacific coast (the westernmost
      part of the contiguous United States), while New Mexico is an inland state situated
      several states east of California.


      Therefore, Navajo Lake in New Mexico would be east of Saint Joseph Parish in
      Mountain View, California.</think>I''ll think about this step-by-step:

      Step 2: Consider the general east-west orientation of US states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New Mexico is an inland state to the east of California


      Step 3: More specifically, Mountain View is in the San Francisco Bay Area on
      the western side of California, while Navajo Lake is in northwestern New Mexico.


      Step 4: On a map of the United States, any location in New Mexico will be east
      of any location in California because California is the westernmost continental

      1. Navajo Lake, New Mexico (NM)

      2. Saint Joseph Parish in Mountain View, California (CA)


      In the United States, locations are generally considered "east" of each other
      based on their longitude coordinates. A location with a smaller longitude number
      (less negative in the Western Hemisphere) is east of a location with a larger
      longitude number (more negative).


      Let me think about the general geography:

      - New Mexico is a state in the southwestern United States

      - California is on the west coast of the United States


      Generally, states like New Mexico are east of California. However, I should
      be more precise about these specific locations.


      Mountain View is in the San Francisco Bay Area of California, which is on the
      western side of California.

      Navajo Lake is in northwestern New Mexico.


      Given the general geography of the United States, New Mexico is east of California.

      ## Step 1: Consider the geographic positions

      - Mountain View, California is located in the San Francisco Bay Area on the
      west coast of the United States

      - Navajo Lake, New Mexico is located in northwestern New Mexico


      ## Step 2: Compare the states'' positions

      - California is the westernmost contiguous state in the US

      - New Mexico is several states east of California


      ## Step 3: Consider longitude

      - Locations in the continental US with more eastern positions have smaller (less
      negative) longitude values

      - New Mexico''s longitude is less negative than California''s longitude

      California is on the west coast of the United States, bordering the Pacific
      Ocean.

      New Mexico is an interior state, located to the east of California.


      In the United States, states that are further east have a higher longitude (in

      - Mountain View is in Santa Clara County in the San Francisco Bay Area of California,
      near the western edge of the continental United States.

      - Navajo Lake is in northwestern New Mexico (and partially extends into Colorado).


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - All of New Mexico is east of all of California.

      - Therefore, any location in New Mexico (including Navajo Lake) would be east

      1. Betts House is at Yale University, which is in New Haven, Connecticut (CT).

      2. Benedum Center is in Pennsylvania (PA).


      Now I need to think about the relative east-west positions of Connecticut and
      Pennsylvania. In the United States:

      - Connecticut is located on the East Coast

      - Pennsylvania is also on the eastern side of the US, but it''s west of Connecticut

      - Benedum Center is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Compare the geographical positions of these states.

      Connecticut is located on the East Coast, while Pennsylvania is also an eastern
      state but positioned to the west of Connecticut. Connecticut borders New York
      to its west, while Pennsylvania is even further west.


      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      - Generally, Tennessee is east of Oklahoma


      Memphis is in the southwestern corner of Tennessee, bordering Mississippi and
      Arkansas. It''s on the western edge of Tennessee, along the Mississippi River.


      Lake Hudson must be somewhere in Oklahoma. I don''t know its precise location
      within Oklahoma, but Oklahoma as a whole is west of Tennessee.


      So even though Memphis is on the western side of Tennessee, it should still
      be east of any location in Oklahoma, including Lake Hudson.


      Therefore, St. Mary''s Episcopal Cathedral in Memphis, Tennessee is very likely
      located east of Lake Hudson in Oklahoma.</think># Is St. Mary''s Episcopal Cathedral
      (Memphis, Tennessee) located east of Lake Hudson (Oklahoma)?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states

      Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States, while Oklahoma is in
      the south-central United States. In terms of overall geography, Tennessee is
      east of Oklahoma.


      ## Step 2: Consider specific locations

      Memphis is in the southwestern corner of Tennessee, along the Mississippi River.
      Even though it''s on the western edge of Tennessee, Memphis is still significantly
      east of Oklahoma''s eastern border.


      Lake Hudson is in northeastern Oklahoma. Even being on the eastern side of Oklahoma,
      it''s still west of any point in Tennessee.


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positions

      When comparing their longitudinal positions, Memphis, Tennessee (where St. Mary''s
      Episcopal Cathedral is located) is east of Lake Hudson, Oklahoma.


      Therefore, YES, St. Mary''s Episcopal Cathedral in Memphis, Tennessee is located
      east of Lake Hudson in Oklahoma.'

      1. 2 Columbus Circle, NY

      2. The Hideout Inn, IL


      I need to figure out if the first location is east of the second location.


      First, let''s identify which states these are in:

      - NY refers to New York

      - IL refers to Illinois


      Now, I need to think about the geographic positions of these states. In the
      United States:

      - New York is located on the East Coast

      - Illinois is in the Midwest


      Generally speaking, New York is east of Illinois. The entire state of New York
      is east of the entire state of Illinois on a map of the United States.


      Since 2 Columbus Circle is in New York, and The Hideout Inn is in Illinois,
      it follows that 2 Columbus Circle would be east of The Hideout Inn.


      So the answer should be YES, 2 Columbus Circle, NY is located east of The Hideout
      Inn, IL.</think>I need to determine if 2 Columbus Circle in New York is east
      of The Hideout Inn in Illinois.


      Step 1: Identify the states these locations are in.

      - The Hideout Inn is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a map.

      - The entire state of New York lies east of the entire state of Illinois

      - The United States generally follows a west-to-east orientation from the Pacific
      to the Atlantic


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since New York is entirely east of Illinois on the map of the United States,
      any location in New York (including 2 Columbus Circle) would be east of any
      location in Illinois (including The Hideout Inn).

      First, let me think about the general geography:

      - Arizona (AZ) is located east of California (CA)

      - San Carlos Lake is in Arizona

      - Pasadena is in California, specifically in the Los Angeles area in southern
      California

      - All Saints Episcopal Church is in Pasadena, California


      Since Arizona is east of California, and San Carlos Lake is in Arizona while
      All Saints Episcopal Church is in California, it follows that San Carlos Lake
      is east of All Saints Episcopal Church.


      Let me double check this reasoning:

      - Places in Arizona are generally east of places in California due to their
      relative positions in the United States

      - San Carlos Lake is in Arizona

      - All Saints Episcopal Church is in California


      Therefore, San Carlos Lake, AZ is located east of All Saints Episcopal Church
      in Pasadena, California.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each location is situated.

      - San Carlos Lake is in Arizona (AZ)

      - All Saints Episcopal Church is in Pasadena, California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona borders California to the east


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      - Since Arizona is entirely east of California, any location in Arizona (including
      San Carlos Lake) must be east of any location in California (including All Saints
      Episcopal Church in Pasadena)


      YES, San Carlos Lake, AZ is located east of All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena,

      First, let''s consider their states:

      - San Carlos Lake is in Arizona (AZ)

      - All Saints Episcopal Church is in Pasadena, California (CA)


      Generally speaking, Arizona is east of California, as the US states from west
      to east along the Pacific coast are: California, then Arizona, etc.


      To be more specific:

      - Pasadena, California is in the Los Angeles area, in southern California

      - San Carlos Lake is in Arizona

      - All Saints Episcopal Church is in Pasadena, California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      California is located on the west coast of the United States, while Arizona
      borders California to the east.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      Pasadena is in southern California, relatively close to the Arizona border but
      still firmly within California.

      San Carlos Lake is within Arizona, which means it must be east of the California-Arizona
      border.


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion based on state positions.

      Since Arizona is entirely east of California, any location in Arizona (including
      San Carlos Lake) must be east of any location in California (including All Saints

      - San Carlos Lake is in Arizona (AZ), which is east of California.

      - All Saints Episcopal Church is in Pasadena, California (CA), which is in the
      Los Angeles area of Southern California.


      Since Arizona is east of California, and San Carlos Lake is in Arizona, while

      southern California where Pasadena is located), San Carlos Lake must be east
      of All Saints Episcopal Church.


      YES, San Carlos Lake, AZ is located east of All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena,

      1. Oklahoma is located in the central/south-central United States

      2. Arizona is located in the southwestern United States


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Oklahoma is definitely east of Arizona. States

      - All of Oklahoma is east of all of Arizona


      Step 4: Apply this state-level relationship to the lakes.

      - Since Lake Ellsworth is in Oklahoma, and Kaibab Lake is in Arizona

      Given that North Carolina is generally east of Georgia, and assuming these lakes
      are not in unusual locations within their states that would reverse this relationship,
      Lake Crabtree in NC would be east of Lake Nottely in GA.


      However, I should note that if Lake Nottely is in far eastern Georgia and Lake
      Crabtree is in far western North Carolina, this might not be true. But the most

      Step 1: Identify the general locations of these states.

      North Carolina is located on the east coast of the United States, while Georgia
      is south of North Carolina and extends further west.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations of these lakes.

      Lake Crabtree is located near Raleigh in Wake County, in the central-eastern
      part of North Carolina.

      Lake Nottely is located in Union County in the northern part of Georgia, near
      the North Carolina border.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Even though Lake Nottely is in northern Georgia (close to North Carolina), Georgia''s
      northern border is still west of central North Carolina where Lake Crabtree
      is located.

      in Georgia (GA).


      To determine if Lake Crabtree is east of Lake Nottely, I need to consider their
      relative positions on a map.


      First, let me think about the general geography of North Carolina and Georgia:

      - North Carolina is generally east and north of Georgia

      - Georgia is south of North Carolina

      - Both states are on the eastern side of the United States


      Now, for the specific lakes:

      - Lake Crabtree is in NC, likely in the central or eastern part of the state

      - Lake Nottely is in GA, and would be somewhere in that state


      Lake Nottely appears to be in northern Georgia, near the North Carolina border.
      It''s in the mountainous region of Georgia.


      Lake Crabtree is near Raleigh in Wake County, NC, which is in the central part
      of North Carolina.


      Given that North Carolina extends east of Georgia, and Lake Crabtree is in central
      NC while Lake Nottely is in northern GA near the NC border, Lake Crabtree would
      be east of Lake Nottely.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of
      these two lakes.


      Step 1: Consider the geographic locations of North Carolina and Georgia.

      North Carolina is positioned north and east of Georgia on the US map.


      Step 2: Locate the specific lakes within their states.

      Lake Crabtree is located in Wake County, near Raleigh in the central part of
      North Carolina.

      Lake Nottely is located in Union County in the northern mountains of Georgia,
      near the North Carolina border.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Lake Crabtree is in central North Carolina, which is positioned to the east
      of northern Georgia where Lake Nottely is located.

      Let me think about the geography:

      1. Lake Crabtree is in North Carolina (NC)

      2. Lake Nottely is in Georgia (GA)


      North Carolina is generally east of Georgia on the US map. Both states are in

      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1. Lake Crabtree is in North Carolina (NC)

      2. Lake Nottely is in Georgia (GA)

      3. On a US map, North Carolina is positioned to the east of Georgia

      - Lake Nottely is in Georgia (GA)


      North Carolina is generally east of Georgia in the United States. Georgia is
      on the Atlantic coast, but North Carolina is further east on the Atlantic coast.


      Let me consider the specific lakes:

      - Lake Crabtree is likely in central or eastern North Carolina

      - Lake Nottely is likely in northern Georgia


      Since North Carolina is east of Georgia, and these lakes are in their respective

      5) Even though Lake Nottely is in northern Georgia (relatively close to the
      NC border), Lake Crabtree is in central NC, which is still significantly east
      of the Georgia-North Carolina border.


      6) The general east-west positioning of these states means that locations in
      central North Carolina will be east of locations in northern Georgia.

      - Indiana (IN) is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is positioned east of Indiana on the US map


      Step 2: Apply this to the specific locations.

      - Youghiogheny River Lake is in Pennsylvania

      - Brookville Lake Dam is in Indiana

      - Since Pennsylvania is east of Indiana, a body of water in Pennsylvania would
      be east of a dam in Indiana


      Therefore, Youghiogheny River Lake, PA is indeed located east of Brookville
      Lake Dam, IN.

      to determine the relative east-west positions of two locations:

      1. Youghiogheny River Lake, Pennsylvania (PA)

      2. Brookville Lake Dam, Indiana (IN)


      First, let me think about the general geographic positions of the states:

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is located in the northeastern United States

      - Indiana (IN) is located in the midwestern United States

      - Generally, Pennsylvania is east of Indiana


      Now, to be more precise about these specific locations:

      - Youghiogheny River Lake is in southwestern Pennsylvania, near the Maryland
      border

      - Brookville Lake Dam would be in Indiana


      Even though Youghiogheny River Lake is in western PA, Pennsylvania as a whole
      is still east of Indiana. The easternmost point of Indiana would still be west
      of the westernmost point of Pennsylvania.


      So Youghiogheny River Lake in PA should be east of Brookville Lake Dam in IN.</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two water bodies.


      First, let me consider the states they''re located in:

      - Youghiogheny River Lake is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - Brookville Lake Dam is in Indiana (IN)


      Looking at the geographic positions of these states:

      - Pennsylvania is located in the eastern United States

      - Indiana is located in the midwestern United States

      - Pennsylvania is positioned east of Indiana on the map


      Even though Youghiogheny River Lake is in western Pennsylvania (near the Maryland
      border), Pennsylvania as a whole lies east of Indiana. The entire state of Pennsylvania
      is positioned east of Indiana.


      Therefore, Youghiogheny River Lake in PA is indeed located east of Brookville
      Lake Dam in IN.


      YES'

      2. Brookville Lake Dam in Indiana (IN)


      Specifically, I need to determine if Youghiogheny River Lake is located east
      of Brookville Lake Dam.


      To answer this, I need to think about the relative positions of Pennsylvania
      and Indiana on the US map:


      - Pennsylvania (PA) is located in the northeastern part of the United States

      - Indiana (IN) is located in the Midwest, specifically in the east north central
      region


      In terms of east-west positioning, Pennsylvania is east of Indiana on the US
      map. The entire state of Pennsylvania is east of Indiana.


      Since Youghiogheny River Lake is in Pennsylvania and Brookville Lake Dam is

      - Brookville Lake Dam is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States, while Indiana is
      in the Midwest region. On a map of the United States, Pennsylvania is positioned
      east of Indiana.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific locations.

      Since Pennsylvania is entirely east of Indiana, any location in Pennsylvania
      (including Youghiogheny River Lake) would be east of any location in Indiana
      (including Brookville Lake Dam).


      YES, Youghiogheny River Lake, PA is located east of Brookville Lake Dam, IN.'

      1. Edison Theatre in New York

      2. Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon in North Jackson, Ohio


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States. New York is located
      in the northeastern part of the United States, while Ohio is in the Midwest.
      Generally speaking, New York is east of Ohio.


      Looking more specifically:

      - New York state is located on the East Coast of the US

      - Ohio is located inland, west of New York


      Since Edison Theatre is in New York, and the Basilica and National Shrine of
      Our Lady of Lebanon is in Ohio, we can conclude that Edison Theatre is east
      of the Basilica.

      if Edison Theatre, NY is located east of the Basilica and National Shrine of
      Our Lady of Lebanon in North Jackson, Ohio, I need to consider the geographic

      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      New York is located in the northeastern United States, while Ohio is in the
      Midwest region.


      Step 2: Compare the east-west positioning.

      On a map of the United States, New York is positioned to the east of Ohio. The
      entire state of New York lies east of Ohio.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific locations.

      Since Edison Theatre is in New York state and the Basilica and National Shrine
      of Our Lady of Lebanon is in North Jackson, Ohio, the theatre must be east of
      the basilica.

      Let''s identify the locations:

      1. Edison Theatre, NY - This would be in New York state

      2. Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon in North Jackson, Ohio


      I need to determine which one is further east. In the United States, generally:

      - New York is located east of Ohio

      - Ohio is west of New York


      Looking at their relative positions on a map of the US:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region

      - New York is in the Northeast region


      The general geographic layout of these states means that locations in New York
      will typically be east of locations in Ohio. North Jackson, Ohio would be in
      eastern Ohio, but even eastern Ohio is west of most parts of New York state.


      Therefore, Edison Theatre in NY should be east of the Basilica in North Jackson,
      Ohio.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two
      locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these landmarks are located.

      - Edison Theatre is in New York (NY)

      - Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon is in North Jackson, Ohio
      (OH)


      Step 2: Compare the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Ohio is located in the midwestern United States, west of New York


      Step 3: Consider their relative positions on a map.

      - Even the westernmost parts of New York state are generally east of the easternmost
      parts of Ohio

      - North Jackson is in eastern Ohio, but still west of the New York state border


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on state positions.

      Since Edison Theatre is in New York, and New York is entirely east of Ohio (where
      the Basilica is located), Edison Theatre must be east of the Basilica.

      Generally speaking, New York is east of Ohio on the US map. New York is on the
      eastern seaboard, while Ohio is more inland and in the Midwest/Great Lakes region.


      North Jackson, Ohio would be in eastern Ohio, but even the easternmost part

      First, I'll identify which states these locations are in:\n- DeGray Lake is\
      \ in AR (Arkansas)\n- Blue Canyon Wind Farm is in OK (Oklahoma)\n\nNow I need\
      \ to think about the relative positions of these states. Arkansas is east of\
      \ Oklahoma. Arkansas borders the eastern side of Oklahoma.\n\nSo generally speaking,\
      \ locations in Arkansas tend to be east of locations in Oklahoma. However, I\
      \ need to be careful because specific locations near the border could have different\
      \ relative positions.\n\nDeGray Lake is in Arkansas, and based on my knowledge,\
      \ it's not right on the western border of Arkansas - it's more centrally located\
      \ within the state. \n\nBlue Canyon Wind Farm in Oklahoma is likely not on the\
      \ easternmost edge of Oklahoma (right at the Arkansas border).\n\nGiven that\
      \ Arkansas is east of Oklahoma, and DeGray Lake is not on the western edge of\
      \ Arkansas, while Blue Canyon Wind Farm is somewhere in Oklahoma (and not necessarily\
      \ at the eastern edge), DeGray Lake should be east of Blue Canyon Wind Farm.</think>To\
      \ answer this question, I need to determine the relative locations of these\

      - DeGray Lake is in Arkansas (AR)\n- Blue Canyon Wind Farm is in Oklahoma (OK)\n\
      \nStep 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.\nArkansas\
      \ is located directly east of Oklahoma. The entire state of Arkansas is east\
      \ of Oklahoma on the US map.\n\nStep 3: Consider the specific locations within\
      \ these states.\nEven if DeGray Lake is in western Arkansas and Blue Canyon\
      \ Wind Farm is in eastern Oklahoma, the geographic relationship would still\
      \ hold because of the states' positions relative to each other.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ YES, DeGray Lake, AR is located east of Blue Canyon Wind Farm, OK."
