      Lewisham''s population is larger than Zevio''s, the answer would be YES (assuming
      Crofton Park has at least one resident which is a safe assumption). If Lewisham''s
      population is smaller, the answer would be uncertain, as we don''t know Crofton
      Park''s precise population.


      Without specific population numbers for Zevio, and given that Crofton Park is
      a district within a much larger borough, it is highly likely that Lewisham (and

    8b3e6907-9eb0-496b-b684-152bc4b7e251: '1. **Identify Upper Normandy:** Upper Normandy
      is a former administrative region of France.  It merged with Lower Normandy
      in 2016 to form the region of Normandy.  Therefore, population figures for "Upper
      Normandy" alone are no longer officially tracked.


      2. **Identify Samar:** Samar is an island in the Philippines.  It is the third-largest
      island in the country.  It''s likely referencing the population of the entire
      island, encompassing three provinces: Samar (Western Samar), Northern Samar,
      and Eastern Samar.


      3. **Population Comparison (pre-2016):**  Before the merger, Upper Normandy''s
      population was roughly 1.9 million. The combined population of the three provinces
      on the island of Samar is likely higher than that.


      4. **Conclusion:** Since the question asks about Upper Normandy as a separate
      entity, and its pre-merger population was likely less than the current combined
      population of Samar Island''s provinces, the answer is NO.

      3. **Find population data:**  I need to find population figures for both.  This
      would ideally be from around the same time frame, and preferably relatively
      recent since the merger of Upper Normandy might affect data availability.  Pre-merger

      figures for both locations. Population data can be challenging to find for specific
      administrative regions in some countries, and may vary depending on the source
      and date.  I''ll need to look for credible sources like government statistics
      offices or international organizations.


      3. **Compare the populations:** Once I find population figures for both Zurmi
      and Chibombo District, I can compare them to determine which is more populous.


      4. **Answer the question:** Based on the comparison, I can provide a YES or
      NO answer.


      (Researching population data...)


      Unfortunately, finding reliable and up-to-date population figures for both Zurmi
      and Chibombo District is proving difficult.  Many sources provide population
      estimates for larger administrative areas (like states or provinces) but not
      for these specific districts.  Without reliable population data for both locations,
      I cannot definitively answer the question.  Therefore, I cannot give a YES or
      NO answer at this time.

      and doesn''t have its own separate population figures.  Zuidhorn, Netherlands
      appears to have a population of several thousand (varying based on the definition

      covers the entire township.  Galloway Township has a population around 37,000.
      Smithville itself is likely much smaller.

      with other municipalities in 2019 into the new municipality of Westerkwartier)
      used to have a population around 19,000.  The current municipality of Westerkwartier
      has a population around 63,000.  If we consider the old municipality of Zuidhorn,
