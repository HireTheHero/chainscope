      area that is part of the larger city of Ghent.


      2. **Coral Terrace, Florida** is a census-designated place (CDP) in Miami-Dade

      - **Sint-Amandsberg**: As part of Ghent, it benefits from being in a densely
      populated city area, but as a suburb, its population would not be as large as
      the entire city of Ghent. Suburbs in European cities can vary significantly

      - Even considering potential population growth in Mong, it is still improbable
      that its population surpasses that of the entire Namsai district.


      Therefore, based on available information, the answer is:


      NO. Mong, Azad Kashmir is not more populous than Namsai district.'

      \ this total.\n\n2. Identify the location and population of Malanville:\n  \
      \ - Malanville is a town and commune in the Alibori Department of northeastern\
      \ Benin. According to available demographic data, Malanville has a population\
      \ of over 40,000 people.\n\n3. Compare the populations:\n   - While Penamaluru\
      \ is just a neighborhood within a larger city, Malanville is a standalone town.\
      \ The population size of Penamaluru as a neighborhood is likely smaller than\
      \ that of Malanville as a town.\n\nBased on these steps, the answer is NO, Penamaluru\

      India. It is known for its historical significance and temples, particularly
      the Chennakeshava Temple. As a town, its population is relatively moderate compared
      to larger cities. According to the 2011 Census of India, Belur had a population
      of around 20,000 to 25,000 people. This number might have increased slightly

      of Bhutan. It is known for its scenic beauty and historical importance, including
      the Punakha Dzong. The entire district''s population is larger than that of
      a small town. According to Bhutan''s 2017 Population and Housing Census, Punakha

      1. **Belur, Karnataka**: Belur is a town in the Hassan district of Karnataka,
      India. As a town, its population is relatively small compared to larger urban
      areas. Based on recent estimates, the population of Belur is likely to be in
      the tens of thousands.


      2. **Punakha District, Bhutan**: Punakha is one of the districts of Bhutan.
      Bhutan''s districts generally have smaller populations compared to towns in
      India, due to the country''s overall smaller population and lower population
      density. Punakha District''s population is also likely to be in the tens of
      thousands, but generally, Bhutanese districts have smaller populations compared
      to Indian towns.

      than Moseley and Kings Heath, we first need to establish the population figures
      for both places.


      1. **Masudpur**: Masudpur is a village located in the Vasant Kunj area of Delhi,
      India. As part of the urban agglomeration of Delhi, it has a relatively small
      population compared to larger urban centers or wards but specific population
      data might not be readily available. Villages in this area typically have populations
      ranging from a few thousand to tens of thousands of people.


      2. **Moseley and Kings Heath (ward)**: This is an electoral ward in Birmingham,
      England. According to recent data, the population of the Moseley and Kings Heath
      ward is around 25,000 to 30,000 people.


      Given these considerations:


      - Masudpur, being a village, is unlikely to have a population exceeding that
      of Moseley and Kings Heath, which is a well-defined urban ward with a larger
      population typical of such areas.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Masudpur is more populous than Moseley and
      Kings Heath is:


      **NO**.'

      is more populous than Moseley and Kings Heath (ward), we need to consider the
      populations of both areas.


      1. **Identify Masudpur**: Masudpur is a village in the Vasant Kunj area of New
      Delhi, India. It can be considered a suburban area within the larger metropolitan
      context of Delhi.


      2. **Identify Moseley and Kings Heath (ward)**: Moseley and Kings Heath is a
      ward in Birmingham, England. Birmingham is one of the largest cities in the
      UK, and Moseley and Kings Heath is a relatively densely populated urban area.


      3. **Population of Masudpur**: As a village within New Delhi, Masudpur is likely
      to have a population in the thousands, typical for villages in urban areas of
      India. However, it is not a distinct district with a large population count
      available separately from New Delhi.


      4. **Population of Moseley and Kings Heath (ward)**: As an urban ward within
      Birmingham, Moseley and Kings Heath is likely to have a population also in the
      thousands, but possibly larger than an individual village like Masudpur given
      its urban setting.


      5. **Comparison**: Without precise population figures available for both (Masudpur
      being part of a larger city and not typically reported separately), it''s reasonable
      to assume that an urban ward in a major UK city would generally have a higher
      population than a suburban village within a city, unless specific data suggests
      otherwise.


      Based on typical population sizes and settings, it is likely that Moseley and
      Kings Heath (ward) is more populous than Masudpur.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Masudpur is not more populous than Moseley and

      populous than Zevio, we need to consider the population of each place:


      1. **Crofton Park**: This is primarily a residential area located in the London
      Borough of Lewisham, England. It''s not a separate town or city but a part of
      Greater London.


      2. **Zevio**: This is a town and comune in the province of Verona in the Veneto
      region of Italy.


      Next, we should look at population estimates:


      - **Crofton Park**: As a district within London, it does not have a separate
      population count. The population would be part of the larger borough, Lewisham,
      which has an estimated population of over 300,000. However, Crofton Park itself
      is just a small portion of this total.


      - **Zevio**: As of recent estimates, Zevio has a population of around 15,000
      to 20,000 people.


      Now, considering the nature of Crofton Park as a district rather than a separate
      entity, its population is likely less than that of a full town like Zevio. However,
      specific numbers for Crofton Park alone are not typically available, as it''s
      not a standalone administrative unit. But given that it''s a district, its population
      is likely not more than that of a town.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is:

      1. **Identify Crofton Park**: Crofton Park is a district located in the London
      Borough of Lewisham, in London, England. It is not a large city or town but
      rather a neighborhood or district within a larger urban area.


      2. **Identify Zevio**: Zevio is a town and comune in the Province of Verona,
      in the Veneto region of Italy.


      3. **Population of Crofton Park**: Since Crofton Park is a part of London, its
      population is typically measured as part of the larger urban area. However,
      specific data for just Crofton Park may not be readily available, but it is
      generally considered to be a residential district with a relatively small population
      compared to full towns or cities.


      4. **Population of Zevio**: Zevio, being a town and comune, has a specific population
      count. As of recent estimates, Zevio has a population of around 14,000 to 15,000
      people.


      5. **Comparison**: Given that Crofton Park is a district within London and does
      not have a large individual population compared to entire towns or cities, it
      is likely that its population is smaller than that of Zevio, which is an independent
      town with a known population.

      - Ziro: Similarly, Ziro''s population is also relatively small, often in the

      1. **Clifton, Bristol**: Clifton is a suburb of the city of Bristol in the United
      Kingdom. It is known for its affluent residential areas and landmarks like the
      Clifton Suspension Bridge. However, as a suburb, it does not have an independently
      large population separate from Bristol. The population of Bristol as a whole

      from the city of Bristol. The population of Clifton itself is not officially
      recorded as a separate entity, but it is known to have a relatively small population

      following:


      1. **Crescent Beach, St. Johns County, Florida**: Crescent Beach is a small,
      unincorporated community located in St. Johns County, Florida. As an unincorporated
      community, it typically does not have a large population. Unincorporated communities
      generally have smaller populations compared to cities or towns.


      2. **Texas, Queensland**: Texas is a rural town in the Goondiwindi Region, Queensland,

      community. However, it is also not one of the major urban centers in Queensland,
      suggesting a moderate population size for a town.


      Now, comparing the likely population sizes:

      - Crescent Beach, being an unincorporated community, is likely to have a smaller
      population.

      - Texas, as a rural town, likely has a larger population than Crescent Beach.

      steps:


      1. **Population of Gladysdale, Victoria**: Gladysdale is a small rural locality
      in Victoria, Australia. It is not known for having a large population. Most
      rural localities in this region tend to have small populations, often in the
      hundreds or less.


      2. **Population of Muenster, Saskatchewan**: Muenster is a small village in
      Saskatchewan, Canada. According to recent data, small villages in Saskatchewan
      typically have populations ranging from a few hundred to over a thousand residents.


      3. **Comparative Analysis**: Both Gladysdale and Muenster are small communities,
      but villages in Saskatchewan like Muenster generally have more structured populations
      due to their classification as villages, which often have more residents than
      rural localities.


      Based on this analysis, Muenster, Saskatchewan is likely more populous than
      Gladysdale, Victoria.


      **Final Answer**: NO, Gladysdale, Victoria is not more populous than Muenster,
      Saskatchewan.'

      18,000 people.

      - Badi, Raisen, being a smaller town in India, typically has a population of
      around 20,000 to 30,000, though exact figures should be verified with the most
      recent census or estimates.

      1. **Badi, Raisen**: Badi is a town located in the Raisen district in the state
      of Madhya Pradesh, India. As it is a smaller town within the district, its population
      is not very large compared to bigger cities.

      Italy. It is a relatively small town as well, though it is known for its agricultural
      produce.


      Considering typical population sizes for towns in these regions:


      - Indian towns like Badi, Raisen generally have higher populations due to the
      higher population density in India.

      - Italian towns like Ribera, Agrigento usually have smaller populations.
