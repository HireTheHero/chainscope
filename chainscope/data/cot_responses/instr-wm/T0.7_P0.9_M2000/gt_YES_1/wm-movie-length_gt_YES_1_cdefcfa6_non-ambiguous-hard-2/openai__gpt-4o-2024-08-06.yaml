      1. **Runtime of "Kroadh":** "Kroadh," released in 1990, is an Indian film. The
      typical runtime for an Indian film from that era is around 2 to 3 hours. Specifically,
      "Kroadh" has a runtime of approximately 155 minutes.


      2. **Runtime of "Sweden: Heaven and Hell":** "Sweden: Heaven and Hell" is an
      Italian documentary released in 1968. Documentaries generally have shorter runtimes
      compared to feature films, especially those from the 1960s. This particular
      documentary has a runtime of approximately 90 minutes.

      1. **Tweety & Sylvester: Feline Fwenzy** - This is a compilation of animated

      2. **Invasion of the Saucer Men** - This is a 1957 science fiction film directed
      by Edward L. Cahn. The runtime of this film is approximately 69 minutes.


      Given these general runtime estimations:


      - If "Tweety & Sylvester: Feline Fwenzy" is on the longer side of the usual

      the Saucer Men."

      the runtimes of the two films mentioned: "Insaaf Ki Devi" directed by S.A. Chandrasekhar

      1. **Find the runtime of "Insaaf Ki Devi":** "Insaaf Ki Devi" is an Indian film,
      and its runtime can typically be around 120 to 150 minutes, as is common for
      many Indian films. However, the exact runtime for this specific film should
      be verified.


      2. **Find the runtime of "Black Emanuelle 2":** "Black Emanuelle 2" is an Italian
      film and its runtime is approximately 90 minutes. This is a more typical length
      for films in the "Emanuelle" series and many European films from that era.


      3. **Compare the runtimes:** Assuming "Insaaf Ki Devi" has a runtime within
      the typical range for Indian films (120-150 minutes), it is likely longer than
      the 90-minute runtime of "Black Emanuelle 2."

      often ranges from 120 to 180 minutes, but we would need to check for specifics.
      Let''s assume it falls within the common range for such films.


      2. **Black Emanuelle 2**: Directed by Bitto Albertini, this film is part of
      the Black Emanuelle series, which are Italian films known for being around 90
      minutes, a standard length for European exploitation films of the time.


      After researching or verifying the specific runtimes:


      - If "Insaaf Ki Devi" is indeed around the typical Bollywood length (120-180
      minutes), it is likely longer than "Black Emanuelle 2," which is approximately
      90 minutes.

    40987758-bd39-457e-820b-9fcd11fb84d0: 'To determine which film has a longer runtime,
      we need to find the runtime of both "Lakshmi Kataksham" by B. Vittalacharya
      and "The Brigand of Kandahar" by John Gilling.


      1. **Lakshmi Kataksham**: This is a Telugu film directed by B. Vittalacharya.
      However, specific runtime details for this film might not be widely available,
      as it may not be as well-documented as more internationally recognized films.
      Generally, Telugu films from this era tend to have runtimes ranging from 120
      to 180 minutes.


      2. **The Brigand of Kandahar**: This is a British film directed by John Gilling,
      released in 1965. The runtime for "The Brigand of Kandahar" is approximately
      81 minutes.


      If we assume a typical runtime for "Lakshmi Kataksham" falls within the common
      range for Telugu films of the period (120-180 minutes), it is likely longer
      than 81 minutes.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      YES.'

      1. **Lakshmi Kataksham** (1970), directed by B. Vittalacharya: This is an Indian
      Telugu-language film. The runtime for typical Telugu films from this era is
      often around 150-160 minutes, but specific information for this film would need

      2. **The Brigand of Kandahar** (1965), directed by John Gilling: This is a British

      Given these general runtime estimates, Telugu films from the era of "Lakshmi

      directing animated films such as "Chicken Run" and "The Pirates! Band of Misfits."
      If you mean "War Story" as a title, it was directed by Mark Jackson and not
      Peter Lord. The runtime for Mark Jackson''s "War Story" is approximately 90
      minutes.


      Assuming "Juan & Ted: Wanted" has a typical runtime of around 100 minutes, it
      would be longer than "War Story" by Mark Jackson, which is 90 minutes. However,
      without the exact runtime of "Juan & Ted: Wanted," this conclusion is based
      on typical film lengths.


      Based on the assumption that "Juan & Ted: Wanted" follows the average runtime,
      the answer is likely:


      YES.'

      1. **Vidukathai''s Runtime**: "Vidukathai" is a Tamil film released in 1997.
      The typical runtime for Tamil films of that era is around 120 to 150 minutes.
