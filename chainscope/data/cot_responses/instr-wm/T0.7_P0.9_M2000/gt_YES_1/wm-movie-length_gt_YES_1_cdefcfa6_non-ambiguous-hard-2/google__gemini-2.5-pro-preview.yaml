    5a900bbe-0774-4fa8-b66a-08bbcc193663: 'Okay, let''s break this down step-by-step:


      1.  **Identify Movie 1:** *The Spirit of ''76*, directed by Lucas Reiner.

      2.  **Find the runtime of Movie 1:** *The Spirit of ''76* (1990) has a runtime
      of approximately 82 minutes.

      3.  **Identify Movie 2:** *Transylvania 6-5000*, specified as "Maurice Noble''s".

      4.  **Determine the correct "Transylvania 6-5000" associated with Maurice Noble:**
      Maurice Noble did not direct the 1985 feature film *Transylvania 6-5000* (that
      was directed by Rudy De Luca). However, Maurice Noble was a key layout artist
      and background designer for the 1963 Warner Bros. *Merrie Melodies* cartoon
      short titled *Transylvania 6-5000*, directed by Chuck Jones. Given the specific
      attribution to "Maurice Noble", this 1963 cartoon is the most accurate reference.

      5.  **Find the runtime of Movie 2 (the 1963 cartoon):** The 1963 cartoon *Transylvania
      6-5000* has a runtime of approximately 7 minutes.

      6.  **Compare the runtimes:** Compare the runtime of *The Spirit of ''76* (82
      minutes) to the runtime of the 1963 *Transylvania 6-5000* cartoon (7 minutes).

      7.  **Conclusion:** 82 minutes is longer than 7 minutes.

      1.  **Identify the first movie and director:** *The Spirit of ''76*, directed
      by Lucas Reiner.

      2.  **Find the runtime of *The Spirit of ''76*:** According to sources like
      IMDb and Wikipedia, the runtime is 82 minutes.

      3.  **Identify the second movie and director:** *Transylvania 6-5000*, directed
      by Maurice Noble. It''s important to note that Maurice Noble directed (co-directed
      with Chuck Jones) a 1963 *Looney Tunes* short cartoon titled *Transylvania 6-5000*.
      There is also a 1985 feature film with the same title, but that was directed
      by Rudy De Luca. The question specifically asks for Maurice Noble''s version.

      4.  **Find the runtime of Maurice Noble''s *Transylvania 6-5000* (the 1963 short):**
      According to sources like IMDb and Wikipedia, the runtime is approximately 7
      minutes (often listed as 6m 40s).

      5.  **Compare the runtimes:** Compare the runtime of *The Spirit of ''76* (82
      minutes) with the runtime of Maurice Noble''s *Transylvania 6-5000* (7 minutes).

      6.  **Conclusion:** 82 minutes is longer than 7 minutes.


      Therefore, Lucas Reiner''s *The Spirit of ''76* does have a longer total runtime
      than Maurice Noble''s *Transylvania 6-5000*.

    94e54ddf-2bab-4ce1-a795-d3f56b7d4ebf: 'Okay, here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the first movie and its runtime:** The first movie is *The Spirit
      of ''76*, directed by Lucas Reiner (released in 1990). Its standard runtime
      is approximately 82 minutes.

      2.  **Identify the second movie and its runtime:** The second movie is *Transylvania
      6-5000*. The prominent feature film with this title was released in 1985 and
      directed by Rudy De Luca (not Maurice Noble, who was primarily an animator/layout
      artist). This film''s runtime is approximately 93 minutes. (There is a 1963
      animated short *Transylvania 6-5000* directed by Chuck Jones, where Maurice
      Noble worked, but its runtime is only about 7 minutes. Given the comparison
      to a feature film, the 1985 movie is the relevant one).

      3.  **Compare the runtimes:** Compare the runtime of *The Spirit of ''76* (82
      minutes) to the runtime of *Transylvania 6-5000* (93 minutes).

      4.  **Determine the answer:** 82 minutes is shorter than 93 minutes. Therefore,
      *The Spirit of ''76* does not have a longer runtime than *Transylvania 6-5000*.
