      **Step 1:**

      The Last Frontier was released in 2008, while Who''s Singin'' Over There? was
      released in 2012.


      **Step 2:**

      The runtime of The Last Frontier is not explicitly stated in the question, so
      we cannot determine its total runtime.


      **Step 3:**

      The runtime of Who''s Singin'' Over There? is also not explicitly stated in
      the question, so we cannot determine its total runtime.


      **Step 4:**

      Since we do not have the runtime information, we cannot determine whether The
      Last Frontier has a longer total runtime than Who''s Singin'' Over There?.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.'
