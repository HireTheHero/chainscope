      1. First, I need to find the runtime of Allari Bullodu (1978)

      - This is an Indian Telugu film directed by K. Raghavendra Rao

      - However, I cannot find a reliable source for its exact runtime


      2. Next, I need to find the runtime of Seizure (1974)

      3. Comparing the two:

      - Since I cannot find a verified runtime for Allari Bullodu, I cannot make a
      definitive comparison

      - While Indian films from that era typically ran longer than 98 minutes, I cannot
      make an assumption without concrete data


      Since I cannot verify one of the crucial pieces of information needed for comparison,
      I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer to this question.


      I must abstain from giving a YES/NO answer due to insufficient data.'

      I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer to this question.'

      1. I need to find the runtime of "Vidukathai" directed by Agathiyan

      2. I need to find the runtime of "The Man Inside" directed by Bobby Roth

      3. Compare these runtimes to determine which is longer


      However, I''m unable to find reliable runtime information for either of these
      films in my knowledge base. Without being able to verify the actual runtimes
      of both films, I cannot make an accurate comparison.
