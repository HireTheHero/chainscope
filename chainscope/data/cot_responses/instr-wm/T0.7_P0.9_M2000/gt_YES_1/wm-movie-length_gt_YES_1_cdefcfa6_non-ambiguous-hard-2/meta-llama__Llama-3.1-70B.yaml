      the steps needed to compare the total runtime of Rajkumar Kohli''s "Jaani Dushman"
      and Charles B. Pierce''s "The Norseman":


      1. **Identify the Movies**: First, we need to identify the movies in question.
      Rajkumar Kohli''s "Jaani Dushman" and Charles B. Pierce''s "The Norseman" are
      the two films we''re comparing.


      2. **Find Runtime Information**: Next, we need to find the runtime for each
      movie. The runtime can usually be found on various film databases or entertainment
      websites.


      3. **Compare Runtimes**: Once we have the runtime for both "Jaani Dushman" and
      "The Norseman", we can compare them to determine which one is longer.


      Given the process, let''s proceed with what we know:


      - **Rajkumar Kohli''s "Jaani Dushman"**: This is a 1979 Indian film directed
      by Rajkumar Kohli. According to available data, "Jaani Dushman" has a runtime
      of approximately 159 minutes (or 2 hours and 39 minutes).


      - **Charles B. Pierce''s "The Norseman"**: This is a 1978 film directed by Charles
      B. Pierce. The runtime for "The Norseman" is approximately 90 minutes (or 1
      hour and 30 minutes).


      **Comparison**: Based on the information available, "Jaani Dushman" has a runtime
      of about 159 minutes, and "The Norseman" has a runtime of about 90 minutes.


      Given this comparison, the answer to whether Rajkumar Kohli''s "Jaani Dushman"
      has a longer total runtime than Charles B. Pierce''s "The Norseman" is:

      \ is approximately 81 minutes.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information on\
      \ \"Sabapathy's V. I. P\" and without actual data on its runtime, it's challenging\
      \ to provide a definitive comparison. However, for the sake of answering based\
      \ on the hypothetical step-by-step process outlined:\n\nIf \"Sabapathy's V.\
      \ I. P\" has a runtime greater than 81 minutes, the answer would be YES. If\
      \ it's less than or equal to 81 minutes, the answer would be NO.\n\nGiven the\
      \ absence of concrete data on \"Sabapathy's V. I. P\" in this scenario, I must\
      \ rely on the process rather than actual numbers. Thus, without actual runtime\
      \ information for \"Sabapathy's V. I. P\", I can only provide a placeholder\
      \ response based on the process outlined. \n\nHowever, since the question demands\
      \ a YES or NO answer and I've been instructed to reason step by step before\
      \ providing an answer, and without the actual ability to look up the specific\
      \ runtime of \"Sabapathy's V. I. P\" in real-time or access to its details,\
      \ I must emphasize the importance of having accurate data for such comparisons.\n\
      \nGiven these constraints and the nature of the question, I would normally seek\
      \ out the runtimes to compare them directly. Since I cannot perform this final\
      \ step due to the hypothetical nature of this interaction and the lack of provided\
      \ runtime information for \"Sabapathy's V. I. P\", let's simplify to the required\
      \ answer format based on a typical approach to such a question, acknowledging\
      \ that a precise answer depends on the actual runtime of \"Sabapathy's V. I.\
      \ P\".\n\nThe final answer is: YES\n\n"

      these steps:


      1. Identify the movies: "Come Dance with Me!" directed by Michel Boisrond and
      "Room and Bird" directed by Friz Freleng.

      2. Find the runtime of each movie.

      3. Compare the runtimes to determine which one is longer.


      Let''s start:


      1. "Come Dance with Me!" (1960) - Directed by Michel Boisrond, this French film
      has a runtime of approximately 92 minutes (1 hour 32 minutes).

      2. "Room and Bird" (1951) - Directed by Friz Freleng, this American animated
      short film has a runtime of approximately 7 minutes.


      Now, comparing the runtimes:


      - "Come Dance with Me!" has a runtime of 92 minutes.

      - "Room and Bird" has a runtime of 7 minutes.


      Since 92 minutes is significantly longer than 7 minutes, "Come Dance with Me!"
      has a longer total runtime than "Room and Bird".

      a step-by-step process:


      1. **Identify the Movies**: First, we need to identify the movies in question.
      "Kadhal Sadugudu" and "Kids of the Round Table" are the films we''re comparing.


      2. **Find Runtime Information**: Next, we need to find the runtime for each

      3. **Compare Runtimes**: Once we have the runtime for both "Kadhal Sadugudu"
      and "Kids of the Round Table", we can compare them to determine which one is
      longer.


      Let''s proceed with the information we have:


      - **V. Z. Durai''s "Kadhal Sadugudu"**: This is a 2003 Indian Tamil-language
      film directed by V. Z. Durai. The runtime for "Kadhal Sadugudu" is approximately
      155 minutes (or 2 hours and 35 minutes).


      - **Robert Tinnell''s "Kids of the Round Table"**: This is a 1995 Canadian-American
      adventure film directed by Robert Tinnell. The runtime for "Kids of the Round
      Table" is approximately 89 minutes (or 1 hour and 29 minutes).


      **Comparison**: Based on the information available, "Kadhal Sadugudu" has a
      runtime of about 155 minutes, and "Kids of the Round Table" has a runtime of
      about 89 minutes.


      Given this comparison, the answer to whether V. Z. Durai''s "Kadhal Sadugudu"

      \ Based on the comparison, we can conclude whether \"Kadhal Sadugudu\" has a\
      \ longer total runtime than \"Kids of the Round Table\" with a simple YES or\

      \ data, I cannot provide its exact runtime.\n- **Kids of the Round Table**:\
      \ This is a 1995 Canadian fantasy film. Its runtime is approximately 92 minutes.\n\
      \nGiven the lack of specific information on \"Kadhal Sadugudu\" and without\
      \ actual data on its runtime, it's challenging to provide a definitive comparison.\
      \ However, for the sake of answering based on the hypothetical step-by-step\
      \ process outlined:\n\nIf \"Kadhal Sadugudu\" has a runtime greater than 92\
      \ minutes, the answer would be YES. If it's less than or equal to 92 minutes,\
      \ the answer would be NO.\n\nGiven the absence of concrete data on \"Kadhal\
      \ Sadugudu\" in this scenario, I must rely on the process rather than actual\
      \ numbers. Thus, without actual runtime information for \"Kadhal Sadugudu\"\
      , I can only provide a placeholder response based on the process outlined. \n\
      \nHowever, since the question demands a YES or NO answer and I've been instructed\

      \ ability to look up the specific runtime of \"Kadhal Sadugudu\" in real-time\
      \ or access to its details, I must emphasize the importance of having accurate\
      \ data for such comparisons.\n\nGiven these constraints and the nature of the\
      \ question, I would normally seek out the runtimes to compare them directly.\
      \ Since I cannot perform this final step due to the hypothetical nature of this\
      \ interaction and the lack of provided runtime information for \"Kadhal Sadugudu\"\

      - **Hugh Wilson''s "Rustlers'' Rhapsody"**: This is a 1985 Western comedy film
      directed by Hugh Wilson. According to available data, "Rustlers'' Rhapsody"
      has a runtime of approximately 88 minutes (or 1 hour and 28 minutes).


      - **Richard Christy''s "Supertwink"**: This appears to be a relatively lesser-known
      film, and I don''t have access to real-time information on its runtime. Without
      specific data, I can''t provide an exact runtime for "Supertwink".


      Given the information available, "Rustlers'' Rhapsody" has a runtime of about
      88 minutes. However, without specific runtime data for "Supertwink," I can''t
      compare the runtimes directly.


      Since I can''t provide an exact comparison due to the lack of data on "Supertwink,"
      I''ll provide a placeholder response based on the process we''ve followed so

      Given the lack of information on the runtime of "Cinema Veeran", it''s challenging
      to provide a definitive comparison. However, for the sake of answering based
      on the hypothetical step-by-step process outlined:


      If "Cinema Veeran" has a runtime greater than 105 minutes, the answer would
      be YES. If it''s less than or equal to 105 minutes, the answer would be NO.


      Given the absence of concrete data on "Cinema Veeran" in this scenario, I must
      rely on the process rather than actual numbers. Thus, without actual runtime
      information for "Cinema Veeran", I can only provide a placeholder response based
      on the process outlined.


      However, since the question demands a YES or NO answer and I''ve been instructed
      to reason step by step before providing an answer, and without the actual ability
      to look up the specific runtime of "Cinema Veeran" in real-time or access to
      its details, I must emphasize the importance of having accurate data for such
      comparisons.


      Given these constraints and the nature of the question, I would normally seek
      out the runtimes to compare them directly. Since I cannot perform this final
      step due to the hypothetical nature of this interaction and the lack of provided
      runtime information for "Cinema Veeran", let''s simplify to the required answer
      format based on a typical approach to such a question, acknowledging that a
      precise answer depends on the actual runtime of "Cinema Veeran".

      Let''s proceed with the information we have:


      - R. Thyagarajan''s "Mera Rakshak" (1989): This is an Indian film directed by
      R. Thyagarajan. The runtime for "Mera Rakshak" is approximately 140 minutes
      (or 2 hours and 20 minutes).


      - Rolf de Heer''s "Dr. Plonk" (2007): This is an Australian comedy film directed
      by Rolf de Heer. The runtime for "Dr. Plonk" is approximately 85 minutes (or
      1 hour and 25 minutes).


      **Comparison**: Based on the information available, "Mera Rakshak" has a runtime
      of about 140 minutes, and "Dr. Plonk" has a runtime of about 85 minutes.


      Given this comparison, the answer to whether R. Thyagarajan''s "Mera Rakshak"
      has a longer total runtime than Rolf de Heer''s "Dr. Plonk" is:

      \ I would typically look up the runtimes. However, given the constraints of\
      \ this interaction, let's proceed with a hypothetical approach:\n\n- **Gjergj\
      \ Xhuvani's \"Parullat\"**: This appears to be a less commonly known film, and\
      \ without access to real-time data, I cannot provide its exact runtime.\n- **Sam\
      \ Raimi's \"Within the Woods\"**: This is a 1978 American horror short film\
      \ directed by Sam Raimi. Its runtime is approximately 30 minutes.\n\nGiven the\
      \ lack of specific information on \"Parullat\" and without actual data on its\
      \ runtime, it's challenging to provide a definitive comparison. However, for\
      \ the sake of answering based on the hypothetical step-by-step process outlined:\n\
      \nIf \"Parullat\" has a runtime greater than 30 minutes, the answer would be\
      \ YES. If it's less than or equal to 30 minutes, the answer would be NO.\n\n\
      Given the absence of concrete data on \"Parullat\" in this scenario, I must\
      \ rely on the process rather than actual numbers. Thus, without actual runtime\
      \ information for \"Parullat\", I can only provide a placeholder response based\
      \ on the process outlined. \n\nHowever, since the question demands a YES or\
      \ NO answer and I've been instructed to reason step by step before providing\
      \ an answer, and without the actual ability to look up the specific runtime\
      \ of \"Parullat\" in real-time or access to its details, I must emphasize the\
      \ importance of having accurate data for such comparisons.\n\nGiven these constraints\
      \ and the nature of the question, I would normally seek out the runtimes to\
      \ compare them directly. Since I cannot perform this final step due to the hypothetical\
      \ nature of this interaction and the lack of provided runtime information for\
      \ \"Parullat\", let's simplify to the required answer format based on a typical\
      \ approach to such a question, acknowledging that a precise answer depends on\
      \ the actual runtime of \"Parullat\".\n\nThe final answer is: YES\n\n"

      3. Compare the runtimes to determine which one is longer.\n\nLet's begin:\n\n\
      1. Luis Bu\xF1uel's Mexican Bus Ride (1952) - The total runtime of this film\
      \ is approximately 82 minutes (1 hour 22 minutes).\n\n2. Maurice Noble's Mad\

      \ 7 minutes.\n\nNow, comparing the two:\n\n- Mexican Bus Ride has a runtime\
      \ of 82 minutes.\n- Mad as a Mars Hare has a runtime of 7 minutes.\n\nSince\

      \ Luis Bu\xF1uel's \"Mexican Bus Ride\" and Maurice Noble's \"Mad as a Mars\

      \ duration) of each movie. This information can usually be found on movie databases\
      \ like IMDb, Wikipedia, or other film databases.\n\n3. **Compare Runtimes**:\
      \ Once we have the runtime for both movies, we compare them to determine which\
      \ one is longer.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the comparison, we can conclude\
      \ whether Luis Bu\xF1uel's \"Mexican Bus Ride\" has a longer total runtime than\
      \ Maurice Noble's \"Mad as a Mars Hare\" with a simple YES or NO.\n\nWithout\
      \ specific runtime information provided in the question, I would typically look\
      \ up the runtimes. However, given the constraints of this interaction, let's\
      \ proceed with a hypothetical approach:\n\n- **Luis Bu\xF1uel's \"Mexican Bus\
      \ Ride\"**: This appears to be a less commonly known film, and without access\
      \ to real-time data, I cannot provide its exact runtime.\n- **Maurice Noble's\
      \ \"Mad as a Mars Hare\"**: This is a 1963 Looney Tunes animated short directed\
      \ by Chuck Jones and Maurice Noble. Its runtime is approximately 6 minutes.\n\
      \nGiven the lack of specific information on \"Mexican Bus Ride\" and without\
      \ actual data on its runtime, it's challenging to provide a definitive comparison.\
      \ However, for the sake of answering based on the hypothetical step-by-step\
      \ process outlined:\n\nIf \"Mexican Bus Ride\" has a runtime greater than 6\
      \ minutes, the answer would be YES. If it's less than or equal to 6 minutes,\
      \ the answer would be NO.\n\nGiven the absence of concrete data on \"Mexican\
      \ Bus Ride\" in this scenario, I must rely on the process rather than actual\
      \ numbers. Thus, without actual runtime information for \"Mexican Bus Ride\"\
      , I can only provide a placeholder response based on the process outlined. \n\
      \nHowever, since the question demands a YES or NO answer and I've been instructed\
      \ to reason step by step before providing an answer, and without the actual\
      \ ability to look up the specific runtime of \"Mexican Bus Ride\" in real-time\
      \ or access to its details, I must emphasize the importance of having accurate\
      \ data for such comparisons.\n\nGiven these constraints and the nature of the\
      \ question, I would normally seek out the runtimes to compare them directly.\
      \ Since I cannot perform this final step due to the hypothetical nature of this\
      \ interaction and the lack of provided runtime information for \"Mexican Bus\
      \ Ride\", let's simplify to the required answer format based on a typical approach\
      \ to such a question, acknowledging that a precise answer depends on the actual\
      \ runtime of \"Mexican Bus Ride\".\n\nThe final answer is: YES\n\n"

      case, they are "What''s the Matter With Helen?" and "A Note of Triumph: The
      Golden Age of Norman Corwin".


      2. **Find Runtime Information**: We need to find the runtime (total duration)

      IMDb, Wikipedia, or other film databases.


      3. **Compare Runtimes**: Once we have the runtime for both movies, we can compare
      them to determine which one is longer.


      Let''s begin:


      1. **What''s the Matter With Helen?** (1971) - This movie was directed by Curtis
      Harrington. Its runtime is approximately 101 minutes (1 hour 41 minutes).


      2. **A Note of Triumph: The Golden Age of Norman Corwin** (2005) - This documentary
      film was directed by Eric Simonson. Its runtime is approximately 39 minutes.


      Now, comparing the two:


      - "What''s the Matter With Helen?" has a runtime of 101 minutes.

      - "A Note of Triumph: The Golden Age of Norman Corwin" has a runtime of 39 minutes.


      Since 101 minutes is greater than 39 minutes, "What''s the Matter With Helen?"
      has a longer total runtime.

      1. Sandy Harbutt''s "Stone" (1974) - The total runtime of this film is approximately
      103 minutes (1 hour 43 minutes).


      2. Matt Porterfield''s "Hamilton" (2006) - The total runtime of this film is
      approximately 74 minutes (1 hour 14 minutes).


      Now, comparing the two:


      - "Stone" has a runtime of 103 minutes.

      - "Hamilton" has a runtime of 74 minutes.


      Since 103 minutes is greater than 74 minutes, "Stone" indeed has a longer total
      runtime than "Hamilton".


      The answer is: YES

      \ down into steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Movies**: First, we need to identify\
      \ the movies in question. Menahem Golan's \"The Uranium Conspiracy\" and Gene\
      \ Deitch's \"The Tom and Jerry Cartoon Kit\" are the films we're comparing.\n\
      \n2. **Find Runtime Information**: Next, we need to find the runtime (total\
      \ duration) of each movie. This information can usually be found on movie databases\
      \ like IMDb, Wikipedia, or other film databases.\n\n3. **Compare Runtimes**:\
      \ Once we have the runtime for both movies, we compare them to determine which\
      \ one is longer.\n\nLet's proceed:\n\n- **Menahem Golan's \"The Uranium Conspiracy\"\
      **: This appears to be a less commonly known film, and without access to real-time\
      \ data, I cannot provide its exact runtime.\n\n- **Gene Deitch's \"The Tom and\
      \ Jerry Cartoon Kit\"**: This is a 1962 animated short film directed by Gene\
      \ Deitch. The runtime for this film is approximately 7 minutes.\n\nGiven the\
      \ lack of specific information on \"The Uranium Conspiracy\" and without actual\
      \ data on its runtime, it's challenging to provide a definitive comparison.\
      \ However, for the sake of answering based on the hypothetical step-by-step\
      \ process outlined:\n\nIf \"The Uranium Conspiracy\" has a runtime greater than\
      \ 7 minutes, the answer would be YES. If it's less than or equal to 7 minutes,\
      \ the answer would be NO.\n\nGiven the absence of concrete data on \"The Uranium\
      \ Conspiracy\" in this scenario, I must rely on the process rather than actual\
      \ numbers. Thus, without actual runtime information for \"The Uranium Conspiracy\"\
      , I can only provide a placeholder response based on the process outlined. \n\
      \nHowever, since the question demands a YES or NO answer and I've been instructed\
      \ to reason step by step before providing an answer, and without the actual\
      \ ability to look up the specific runtime of \"The Uranium Conspiracy\" in real-time\
      \ or access to its details, I must emphasize the importance of having accurate\
      \ data for such comparisons.\n\nGiven these constraints and the nature of the\
      \ question, I would normally seek out the runtimes to compare them directly.\
      \ Since I cannot perform this final step due to the hypothetical nature of this\
      \ interaction and the lack of provided runtime information for \"The Uranium\
      \ Conspiracy\", let's simplify to the required answer format based on a typical\
      \ approach to such a question, acknowledging that a precise answer depends on\
      \ the actual runtime of \"The Uranium Conspiracy\".\n\nThe final answer is:\
      \ YES\n\n"

      Chakrapani''s "Manithan Maravillai" and Olle Hellbom''s "Pippi Longstocking"
      are the two films we''re comparing.


      2. **Find Runtime Information**: Next, we need to find the runtime for each
      movie. The runtime can usually be found on various film databases or entertainment
      websites.


      3. **Compare Runtimes**: Once we have the runtime for both "Manithan Maravillai"
      and "Pippi Longstocking", we can compare them to determine which one is longer.


      Given the process, let''s proceed with what we know:


      - **Chakrapani''s "Manithan Maravillai"**: This is a 1962 Indian Tamil-language
      film directed by Chakrapani. According to available data, "Manithan Maravillai"
      has a runtime of approximately 144 minutes (or 2 hours and 24 minutes).


      - **Olle Hellbom''s "Pippi Longstocking"**: This is a 1969 Swedish film directed
      by Olle Hellbom. The runtime for "Pippi Longstocking" is approximately 100 minutes
      (or 1 hour and 40 minutes).


      **Comparison**: Based on the information available, "Manithan Maravillai" has
      a runtime of about 144 minutes, and "Pippi Longstocking" has a runtime of about
      100 minutes.


      Given this comparison, the answer to whether Chakrapani''s "Manithan Maravillai"
      has a longer total runtime than Olle Hellbom''s "Pippi Longstocking" is:


      YES'

      typically around 6 minutes. However, since the question is about the total runtime
      of the series, we''ll consider the entire series. The total runtime of the "Loopy
      De Loop" series is about 78 minutes (or 1 hour and 18 minutes).


      **Comparison**: Based on the information available, "War Requiem" has a runtime
      of about 92 minutes, and "Loopy De Loop" has a total runtime of about 78 minutes.


      Given this comparison, the answer to whether Derek Jarman''s "War Requiem" has
      a longer total runtime than William Hanna''s "Loopy De Loop" is:


      YES'

      "A Gala Christmas in Vienna / Christmas in Vienna V" and "Mutiny on the Bunny"
      are the films we''re comparing.


      2. **Find Runtime Information**: Next, we need to find the runtime (total duration)
