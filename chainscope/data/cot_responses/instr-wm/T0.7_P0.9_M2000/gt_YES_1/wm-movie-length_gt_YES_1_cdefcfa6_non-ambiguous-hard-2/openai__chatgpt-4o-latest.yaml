      the runtimes of both films.


      Step 1: Identify the runtime of "Sherman''s March":

      - "Sherman''s March" (1986), directed by Ross McElwee, is a documentary film.

      - It has a runtime of approximately 155 minutes (2 hours and 35 minutes).


      Step 2: Identify the runtime of "Yolki":

      - "Yolki" (also known as "Six Degrees of Celebration") is a Russian film released
      in 2010.

      - Although sometimes attributed to various directors, Ignas Jonynas is not the
      primary director of "Yolki". The main director is Timur Bekmambetov.

      - "Yolki" has a runtime of approximately 90 minutes (1 hour and 30 minutes).


      Step 3: Compare the runtimes:

      - "Sherman''s March": 155 minutes.

      Timur Bekmambetov, not Ignas Jonynas.

      - Ignas Jonynas is a Lithuanian director known for the film "The Gambler" (2013),
      not "Yolki".

      "Mr. Sampati" is a 1965 Indian film directed by S. S. Vasan. The typical runtime

      "Kanto Wanderer" is a 1963 Japanese yakuza film directed by Seijun Suzuki. Japanese
      films from the 1960s, especially genre films, were often shorter. "Kanto Wanderer"
      has a runtime of approximately 91 minutes (1 hour and 31 minutes).


      **Step 3: Compare the runtimes**

      - "Mr. Sampati": ~148 minutes

      - *Part I*: ~97 minutes  \n- *Part II*: ~111 minutes  \n- *Part III*: ~99 minutes\
      \  \n\n**Total runtime** = 97 + 111 + 99 = **307 minutes**\n\n### Step 3: Determine\
      \ the runtime of Costa-Gavras's *Family Business*\n\nFirst, clarify the movie:\
      \ Costa-Gavras is a Greek-French director known for political thrillers like\
      \ *Z*, *Missing*, and *State of Siege*. He did **not** direct *Family Business*.\
      \ The 1989 film *Family Business* was directed by **Sidney Lumet**, and stars\
      \ Sean Connery, Dustin Hoffman, and Matthew Broderick.\n\nSo unless there is\
      \ a lesser-known film titled *Family Business* directed by Costa-Gavras, this\
      \ may be a confusion. For the sake of argument, let's search Costa-Gavras's\
      \ filmography.\n\nCosta-Gavras directed a film called *La Petite Apocalypse*\
      \ (1993), and others like *Z* (1969), *The Axe* (2005), *Capital* (2012), but\
      \ **not a film called *Family Business***.\n\nThere is no record of Costa-Gavras\
      \ directing a film titled *Family Business*. Therefore, there may be an error\
      \ in the question.\n\nAssuming the question meant the 1989 film *Family Business*\
      \ (directed by Sidney Lumet), its runtime is:\n\n**Runtime** = 110 minutes\n\
      \n### Step 4: Compare runtimes\n\n- *Atlas Shrugged trilogy*: 307 minutes  \n\
      - *Family Business* (1989): 110 minutes\n\n### Final Step: Answer the question\n\
      \nYes, the *Atlas Shrugged* trilogy has a longer total runtime than *Family\
      \ Business*.\n\n\u2705 **Answer: YES**."
    b504fe97-3342-4537-b294-47faf0d9c68f: "Sure, let's break it down step by step:\n\
      \n1. **Identify the works in question:**\n   - \"John Putch's Atlas Shrugged\"\
      \ refers to *Atlas Shrugged: Part II* (2012), directed by John Putch. However,\
      \ the *Atlas Shrugged* film adaptation is a trilogy:\n     - Part I (2011)\n\
      \     - Part II (2012) - directed by John Putch\n     - Part III (2014)\n\n\
      \   Since the question refers to John Putch's *Atlas Shrugged*, it is likely\
      \ pointing to Part II specifically, unless it's implying the whole trilogy directed\
      \ in part by John Putch. For completeness, let's consider both scenarios.\n\n\
      2. **Runtimes:**\n   - *Atlas Shrugged: Part II* (2012) runtime: approximately\
      \ 111 minutes\n   - *Atlas Shrugged Trilogy* total runtime:\n     - Part I:\
      \ ~97 minutes\n     - Part II: ~111 minutes\n     - Part III: ~99 minutes\n\
      \     - Total: 97 + 111 + 99 = 307 minutes\n\n   - *Family Business* (1989),\
      \ directed by Costa-Gavras: This is a confusion. *Family Business* (1989) was\
      \ actually directed by Sidney Lumet, not Costa-Gavras. Costa-Gavras did direct\
      \ *Family Business* (*Conseil de famille*) in 1986, a French film.\n     - *Conseil\
      \ de famille* (1986) runtime: approximately 100 minutes\n\n3. **Compare runtimes:**\n\
      \   - If we take only *Atlas Shrugged: Part II* (John Putch\u2019s), it is 111\
      \ minutes.\n   - *Conseil de famille* (Costa-Gavras): 100 minutes\n   - 111\
      \ minutes > 100 minutes\n\n   So even just Part II alone is longer than Costa-Gavras's\
      \ film.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Regardless of whether we consider just Part\
      \ II or the trilogy, John Putch\u2019s *Atlas Shrugged* (Part II) has a longer\
      \ runtime than Costa-Gavras\u2019s *Family Business*.\n\n\u2705 Final Answer:\
      \ YES."
    bf13cb8c-9ab7-4324-b3a8-3125639f828f: "Sure, let's reason through this step by\
      \ step.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the films in question.**\n\n- \"Atlas Shrugged\"\
      \ by John Putch\n- \"Family Business\" by Costa-Gavras\n\nBut actually, there\
      \ seems to be a confusion: \"Family Business\" is a 1989 film directed by Sidney\
      \ Lumet, not Costa-Gavras. Costa-Gavras is known for films like \"Z\" (1969),\
      \ \"Missing\" (1982), and \"Amen.\" (2002). There may be an error in the question's\
      \ attribution.\n\nHowever, proceeding under the assumption that you meant the\
      \ 1989 film \"Family Business\" starring Sean Connery and directed by Sidney\
      \ Lumet.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the runtime of \"Atlas Shrugged\" by John Putch.**\n\
      \nJohn Putch directed \"Atlas Shrugged: Part II\" (2012), which is the second\
      \ part of the \"Atlas Shrugged\" film trilogy. The three parts were directed\
      \ by different people:\n\n- Part I (2011) \u2013 Directed by Paul Johansson\n\
      - Part II (2012) \u2013 Directed by John Putch\n- Part III (2014) \u2013 Directed\
      \ by James Manera\n\nSo if you are referring only to \"Atlas Shrugged: Part\
      \ II\" by John Putch, its standalone runtime is what matters.\n\n- \"Atlas Shrugged:\
      \ Part II\" has a runtime of approximately 112 minutes.\n\nIf you meant the\
      \ entire \"Atlas Shrugged\" trilogy, then the total runtime would be:\n\n- Part\
      \ I \u2013 97 minutes\n- Part II \u2013 112 minutes\n- Part III \u2013 99 minutes\
      \  \n  Total = 97 + 112 + 99 = 308 minutes\n\nBut again, only Part II was directed\
      \ by John Putch, so if we are strictly considering \u201CJohn Putch\u2019s Atlas\
      \ Shrugged,\u201D that would mean only Part II: 112 minutes.\n\n**Step 3: Determine\
      \ the runtime of \u201CFamily Business\u201D (1989) directed by Sidney Lumet.**\n\
      \n- Runtime: Approximately 110 minutes\n\n**Step 4: Compare the runtimes.**\n\
      \n- \"Atlas Shrugged: Part II\" (John Putch) = 112 minutes\n- \"Family Business\"\
      \ (1989) = 110 minutes\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\n112 minutes > 110 minutes\n\
      \nSo, even though the difference is small, John Putch\u2019s \"Atlas Shrugged:\
      \ Part II\" has a slightly longer runtime than Lumet\u2019s \"Family Business\"\
      .\n\n\u2705 Final Answer: YES"
    c87fb014-4bb8-4801-9590-2cd5fc4743c1: 'Sure! Let''s break this down step by step:


      **Step 1: Identify the movies referenced.**


      - "John Putch''s Atlas Shrugged": This refers to the third installment in the
      "Atlas Shrugged" film trilogy, titled *Atlas Shrugged: Part III*, which was
      directed by John Putch.

      - "Costa-Gavras''s Family Business": This is actually a misattribution. *Family
      Business* (1989) was directed by Sidney Lumet, not Costa-Gavras. However, Costa-Gavras
      is a well-known director, but he did not direct a film titled *Family Business*.
      For the sake of the question, we will assume the user meant the 1989 film *Family
      Business* directed by Sidney Lumet.


      **Step 2: Determine the runtimes.**


      - *Atlas Shrugged: Part III* (2014), directed by John Putch, has a runtime of
      approximately 99 minutes.

      - *Family Business* (1989), directed by Sidney Lumet, has a runtime of approximately
      110 minutes.


      **Step 3: Compare the runtimes.**


      - 99 minutes (Atlas Shrugged: Part III) vs. 110 minutes (Family Business)


      **Conclusion:**


      *Atlas Shrugged: Part III* is shorter than *Family Business*.


      **Answer: NO**'
    d0ecccff-e89a-480e-9b80-649ac555f636: "Sure, let's work through this step by step.\n\
      \nStep 1: Identify what \u201CJohn Putch\u2019s Atlas Shrugged\u201D refers\
      \ to.\n\nJohn Putch directed \"Atlas Shrugged: Part II\", which is the second\
      \ film in a trilogy based on Ayn Rand's novel \"Atlas Shrugged\". The full trilogy\
      \ includes:\n\n- Part I (2011) \u2013 directed by Paul Johansson\n- Part II\
      \ (2012) \u2013 directed by John Putch\n- Part III (2014) \u2013 directed by\
      \ J. James Manera\n\nSo, the question is likely referring to the entire \"Atlas\
      \ Shrugged\" trilogy, combining all three parts (even though John Putch only\
      \ directed Part II).\n\nStep 2: Determine the total runtime of the \"Atlas Shrugged\"\
      \ trilogy.\n\nApproximate runtimes:\n\n- Part I: ~97 minutes\n- Part II: ~111\
      \ minutes\n- Part III: ~99 minutes\n\nTotal runtime = 97 + 111 + 99 = 307 minutes\n\
      \nStep 3: Determine the runtime of Costa-Gavras\u2019s \"Family Business\".\n\

      \ Apocalypse\" (1993), which was released in English as \"The Little Apocalypse\"\
      \ or sometimes confused with themes of \"Family Business\".\n\nHowever, to proceed\
      \ with the most plausible interpretation: assuming the question refers to a\
      \ lesser-known Costa-Gavras film often referred to as \"Family Business\" (hypothetically),\
      \ we need to find a film by Costa-Gavras that could be interpreted this way.\n\
      \nLet\u2019s take \"La Petite Apocalypse\" (1993), which is 90 minutes long.\n\
      \nEven if we assume a different Costa-Gavras film, none of his known works have\
      \ runtimes anywhere near 307 minutes.\n\nStep 4: Compare the runtimes.\n\n-\
      \ Atlas Shrugged trilogy: ~307 minutes\n- Any Costa-Gavras film (e.g., \"La\
      \ Petite Apocalypse\"): ~90 minutes\n\nConclusion: The total runtime of the\

      1. Identify the runtime of *Shiva*.

      2. Identify the runtime of *Kanyini*.

      3. Compare the two runtimes.


      **Step 1: Runtime of *Shiva***

      Ram Gopal Varma directed two films titled *Shiva*: one in 1989 (Hindi remake
      of his Telugu film) and one in 2006 (both known as *Shiva*). The 1989 *Shiva*
      has a runtime of approximately 145 minutes.

      *Kanyini* is a 2006 Australian documentary directed by Melanie Hogan. The runtime
      of *Kanyini* is approximately 52 minutes.


      **Step 3: Comparison**

      145 minutes (*Shiva*) vs. 52 minutes (*Kanyini*).
