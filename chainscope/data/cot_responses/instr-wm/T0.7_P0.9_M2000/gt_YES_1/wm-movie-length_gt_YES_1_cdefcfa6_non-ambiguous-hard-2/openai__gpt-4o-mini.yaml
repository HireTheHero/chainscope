      we need to know the runtimes of both movies.


      1. **Jaani Dushman** (2001) has a runtime of approximately 165 minutes.

      2. **The Norseman** (1978) has a runtime of approximately 101 minutes.


      Now, we compare the two runtimes:


      - 165 minutes (Jaani Dushman) is greater than 101 minutes (The Norseman).


      Based on this comparison, we can conclude that Rajkumar Kohli''s "Jaani Dushman"

      2. **Anthony Pelissier''s Meet Mr. Lucifer**: This film was released in 1959
      and has a runtime of approximately 85 minutes.


      Now, let''s compare the two runtimes:


      - Insaf Ki Pukar: 145 minutes

      - Meet Mr. Lucifer: 85 minutes


      Since 145 minutes is longer than 85 minutes, we can conclude that Insaf Ki Pukar
      has a longer total runtime than Meet Mr. Lucifer.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is **YES**.'

      After verifying the runtime of "Ostitto," if it is longer than 17 minutes, then
      the answer is YES. If it is shorter, the answer is NO.


      Since I cannot access real-time data, I will rely on the information available
      until my last update. If "Ostitto" is indeed longer than 17 minutes, the answer
      is YES; otherwise, it is NO.


      Based on what I know, I cannot definitively answer without current data on "Ostitto."
      However, if "Ostitto" is a feature-length film, it is likely to be longer than
      "World of Tomorrow."
