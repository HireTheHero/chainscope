      This requires clarification. Maurice Noble was an animator who worked on Warner
      Bros. cartoons. "Transylvania 6-5000" directed by Maurice Noble is a 1963 animated
      short featuring Bugs Bunny. Its runtime is approximately 7 minutes.


      (Note: There is also a 1985 comedy film called "Transylvania 6-5000" directed
      by Rudy De Luca, not Maurice Noble, which runs about 94 minutes, but the question
      specifically asks about Maurice Noble''s version.)


      Step 3: Compare the runtimes

      Lucas Reiner''s "The Spirit of ''76": 83 minutes

      Maurice Noble''s "Transylvania 6-5000": 7 minutes

      Step 1: Find the runtime of "Il Camorrista" (1986) by Giuseppe Tornatore.

      "Il Camorrista" has a runtime of approximately 170 minutes (2 hours and 50 minutes)
      for the theatrical version. There is also a longer TV version that runs about
      240 minutes.


      Step 2: Find the runtime of "The Scarlet Letter" (1973) by Wim Wenders.

      Wim Wenders'' "The Scarlet Letter" has a runtime of approximately 90 minutes
      (1 hour and 30 minutes).


      Step 3: Compare the runtimes.

      Even using the shorter theatrical version of "Il Camorrista" (170 minutes),
      it is longer than "The Scarlet Letter" (90 minutes).

      170 minutes > 90 minutes

      Step 2: Find the runtime of "Anjaam" directed by Rahul Rawail.

      There''s actually a potential confusion here. There''s a 1994 film "Anjaam"
      directed by Rahul Kapoor (not Rawail) starring Shah Rukh Khan. The runtime of
      this film is approximately 165-175 minutes.


      If referring to a different "Anjaam" by Rahul Rawail, I don''t have specific
      information about this film, as Rahul Rawail is known for other films like "Arjun"
      and "Betaab".

      "Lad: A Dog" (1962) has a runtime of approximately 98 minutes.


      Step 4: Compare the runtimes.

      Even with potential confusion about the first film, if we''re referring to the
      1994 "Anjaam" (though directed by Kapoor, not Rawail), its runtime of 165-175
      minutes is longer than the 98 minutes of "Lad: A Dog".

      - "Atlas Shrugged" directed by John Putch

      - "Family Business" directed by Costa-Gavras


      Step 2: Find the runtime for "Atlas Shrugged" directed by John Putch.

      John Putch directed "Atlas Shrugged: Part II" (2012), which is the second film
      in the Atlas Shrugged trilogy. The full trilogy consists of:

      - Part I (2011): 97 minutes (not directed by Putch)

      - Part II (2012): 112 minutes (directed by Putch)

      - Part III (2014): 99 minutes (not directed by Putch)

      Part II''s runtime: 112 minutes.


      Step 3: Find the runtime for "Family Business" directed by Costa-Gavras.

      Costa-Gavras directed "Family Business" (French title: "Conseil de famille")

      Step 4: Compare the runtimes.

      - John Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged: Part II": 112 minutes

      - Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business": 127 minutes


      Since 112 minutes is less than 127 minutes, Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business"

      Step 2: Find the runtime of "Atlas Shrugged" directed by John Putch.

      John Putch directed "Atlas Shrugged: Part II" (2012), which is the second film
      in the Atlas Shrugged trilogy. The full trilogy consists of three parts directed
      by different directors:

      - Part I (2011): Directed by Paul Johansson, runtime approximately 97 minutes

      - Part II (2012): Directed by John Putch, runtime approximately 112 minutes

      - Part III (2014): Directed by J. James Manera, runtime approximately 99 minutes


      Since the question specifically asks about John Putch''s Atlas Shrugged, I''ll
      use the 112 minutes runtime for Part II only.


      Step 3: Find the runtime of "Family Business" directed by Costa-Gavras.

      Costa-Gavras directed a film called "Family Business" (French title: "Conseil
      de famille") released in 1986. This film has a runtime of approximately 127
      minutes.


      Step 4: Compare the runtimes.

      - John Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged: Part II": 112 minutes

      - Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business": 127 minutes


      Since 112 minutes is less than 127 minutes, Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business"

      First, I need to identify both films and their runtimes:


      1) "Atlas Shrugged" directed by John Putch:

      This appears to be "Atlas Shrugged: Part II" (2012), as John Putch directed
      the second film in the Atlas Shrugged trilogy. The first part was directed by
      Paul Johansson, and the third by J. James Manera.

      Runtime of "Atlas Shrugged: Part II" is approximately 112 minutes.


      2) "Family Business" directed by Costa-Gavras:

      Costa-Gavras directed a film called "Family Business" ("Conseil de famille"
      in French) released in 1986.

      Runtime of this film is approximately 127 minutes.


      Comparing the runtimes:

      - Atlas Shrugged: Part II: 112 minutes

      - Family Business: 127 minutes


      Since 112 minutes is less than 127 minutes, John Putch''s Atlas Shrugged has
      a shorter total runtime than Costa-Gavras''s Family Business.


      NO'
    371d0ce4-1034-41a6-bb1e-e7e88ac9d2eb: 'I''ll solve this step by step to determine
      which film has the longer runtime.


      Step 1: Identify the films in question.

      - "Atlas Shrugged" directed by John Putch

      - "Family Business" directed by Costa-Gavras


      Step 2: Find the runtime for "Atlas Shrugged" directed by John Putch.

      John Putch directed "Atlas Shrugged: Part II" (2012), which is the second film
      in the Atlas Shrugged trilogy. The complete trilogy consists of:

      - Part I (2011): approximately 97 minutes

      - Part II (2012, directed by Putch): approximately 112 minutes

      - Part III (2014): approximately 99 minutes


      Step 3: Find the runtime for "Family Business" directed by Costa-Gavras.

      Costa-Gavras directed a film called "Family Business" (French: "Conseil de famille")
      released in 1986, with a runtime of approximately 127 minutes.


      Step 4: Compare the runtimes.

      If we''re comparing just John Putch''s contribution to Atlas Shrugged (Part
      II only), then:

      - Atlas Shrugged Part II: 112 minutes

      - Family Business: 127 minutes


      NO


      If we''re comparing the entire Atlas Shrugged trilogy (which John Putch partially
      directed):

      - Atlas Shrugged trilogy: 97 + 112 + 99 = 308 minutes

      - Family Business: 127 minutes


      In this case, YES


      Since the question specifically mentions "John Putch''s Atlas Shrugged," I believe
      it''s referring to just the part he directed (Part II), not the entire trilogy.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, John Putch''s Atlas Shrugged does not have a longer
      total runtime than Costa-Gavras''s Family Business.'

      NO'
    f86024b3-a3b3-4bba-ac1f-4e862d5e5471: 'I''ll think through this step by step.


      First, I need to identify the films in question:

      - "Atlas Shrugged" directed by John Putch

      - "Family Business" directed by Costa-Gavras


      For "Atlas Shrugged" directed by John Putch:

      John Putch directed "Atlas Shrugged: Part II" (2012), which is the second film
      in the Atlas Shrugged trilogy. The runtime for this film is approximately 112
      minutes.


      However, I should note that the complete Atlas Shrugged trilogy consists of
      three films with different directors:

      - Part I (2011): directed by Paul Johansson

      - Part II (2012): directed by John Putch

      - Part III (2014): directed by J. James Manera


      For "Family Business" directed by Costa-Gavras:

      Costa-Gavras directed a film called "Family Business" (French title: "Conseil
      de famille") released in 1986. This film has a runtime of approximately 127
      minutes.


      Comparing the runtimes:

      - John Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged: Part II": 112 minutes

      - Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business": 127 minutes


      Since 112 minutes is less than 127 minutes, John Putch''s Atlas Shrugged film
      does not have a longer total runtime than Costa-Gavras''s Family Business.


      NO'
    fe676304-c4f9-4de8-bccf-ea4486cf8d27: 'I''ll solve this step by step to determine
      which film has the longer runtime.


      Step 1: Identify the films in question.

      - "Atlas Shrugged" directed by John Putch

      - "Family Business" directed by Costa-Gavras


      Step 2: Find the runtime for "Atlas Shrugged" directed by John Putch.

      John Putch directed "Atlas Shrugged: Part II" (2012), which is the second film
      in the Atlas Shrugged trilogy. The complete trilogy consists of:

      - Part I (2011): approximately 97 minutes (directed by Paul Johansson)

      - Part II (2012): approximately 112 minutes (directed by John Putch)

      - Part III (2014): approximately 99 minutes (directed by J. James Manera)


      Since the question refers to "John Putch''s Atlas Shrugged," I''ll consider
      only Part II, which runs about 112 minutes.


      Step 3: Find the runtime for "Family Business" directed by Costa-Gavras.

      Costa-Gavras directed a film called "Family Business" (French title: "Conseil
      de famille") released in 1986. This film has a runtime of approximately 127
      minutes.


      Step 4: Compare the runtimes.

      - John Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged: Part II": 112 minutes

      - Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business": 127 minutes


      Since 112 minutes is less than 127 minutes, Costa-Gavras''s film has a longer
      runtime.


      NO'

      determine which film has the longer runtime.


      Step 1: Identify the runtimes of both films.

      - Derek Jarman''s "War Requiem" (1989) is a film adaptation of Benjamin Britten''s
      musical piece of the same name. Its runtime is approximately 92 minutes.

      - "Loopy De Loop" was a series of theatrical cartoon shorts created by William
      Hanna (and Joseph Barbera) at Hanna-Barbera. Each short was typically around
      6-7 minutes long. However, there wasn''t a feature-length "Loopy De Loop" film,
      but rather a series of shorts produced between 1959 and 1965.


      Step 2: Compare the runtimes.

      - "War Requiem" is a feature film with a 92-minute runtime.

      - "Loopy De Loop" consists of individual shorts, each much shorter than 92 minutes.
      Even if we were to consider the entire series collectively, we''re comparing
      a single feature film to a cartoon series format.


      Step 3: Determine the answer based on the comparison.

      Since "War Requiem" is a feature film with a 92-minute runtime, and any individual
      "Loopy De Loop" cartoon short would be significantly shorter (around 6-7 minutes),
      Derek Jarman''s "War Requiem" has a longer total runtime.


      YES, Derek Jarman''s "War Requiem" has a longer total runtime than William Hanna''s
      "Loopy De Loop" (when considering individual shorts).'

      Step 1: Identify the runtimes of both films.

      - Derek Jarman''s "War Requiem" (1989) has a runtime of approximately 92 minutes.

      - "Loopy De Loop" was a series of theatrical cartoon shorts created by William
      Hanna (and Joseph Barbera), not a single film. Each short in this series typically
      ran about 6-7 minutes.


      Step 2: Compare the runtimes.

      - "War Requiem" is a feature-length film at 92 minutes.

      - Even if we consider the entire "Loopy De Loop" series (which ran from 1959
      to 1965 with 48 shorts), we''re comparing a single film to a series. For a fair
      comparison, we should compare individual works, and any single "Loopy De Loop"
      short is significantly shorter than "War Requiem."


      Step 3: Reach a conclusion.

      Since Derek Jarman''s "War Requiem" (92 minutes) is longer than any individual
      "Loopy De Loop" cartoon short (approximately 6-7 minutes each), the answer is
      clear.


      YES, Derek Jarman''s "War Requiem" has a longer total runtime than William Hanna''s

      - "War Requiem" is a 1989 film directed by Derek Jarman.

      - It''s based on Benjamin Britten''s musical piece of the same name.

      - The film has a runtime of approximately 92 minutes.


      Step 2: Identify William Hanna''s "Loopy De Loop."

      - "Loopy De Loop" was a series of theatrical cartoon shorts created by William
      Hanna (of Hanna-Barbera).

      - These were short animated cartoons that typically ran about 6-7 minutes each.

      - If considering a single "Loopy De Loop" cartoon, the runtime would be around
      6-7 minutes.

      - If considering the entire series, it would be much longer as there were 48
      cartoons produced between 1959 and 1965.


      Step 3: Compare the runtimes.

      - If comparing Jarman''s "War Requiem" (92 minutes) to a single "Loopy De Loop"
      cartoon (6-7 minutes), then War Requiem is longer.

      - If comparing to the entire series, then the Loopy De Loop series would be
      longer.


      Since the question is likely referring to individual films rather than an entire
      series, and a single "Loopy De Loop" cartoon is much shorter than "War Requiem":


      YES, Derek Jarman''s "War Requiem" has a longer total runtime than a William

      around 6-7 minutes long.


      Step 2: Clarify what''s being compared.

      - "War Requiem" is a single feature film.

      - "Loopy De Loop" was a series of shorts, not a single film. If considering
      a single Loopy De Loop short, it would be much shorter than War Requiem.

      - If considering the entire series of Loopy De Loop shorts (there were 48 shorts
      in total), the combined runtime would be approximately 290-336 minutes.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - War Requiem: ~92 minutes

      - A single Loopy De Loop short: ~6-7 minutes

      - The entire Loopy De Loop series: ~290-336 minutes


      Step 4: Determine the answer.

      If comparing the feature film to a single short: War Requiem is longer.

      If comparing to the entire series: Loopy De Loop is longer.

      film based on Benjamin Britten''s musical piece of the same name. The film has
      a runtime of approximately 92 minutes.


      Step 2: Identify William Hanna''s "Loopy De Loop"

      "Loopy De Loop" was a series of theatrical cartoon shorts created by William
      Hanna (of Hanna-Barbera) rather than a single film. Each cartoon short in this
      series typically ran for about 6-7 minutes. The series consisted of multiple
      shorts produced between 1959 and 1965.

      Since "War Requiem" is a feature film with a runtime of 92 minutes, and "Loopy

      War Requiem to a single Loopy De Loop short.


      NO


      Wait, I need to reconsider. The question asks about "William Hanna''s Loopy
      De Loop" which could refer to either a single short or the series. Given the
      phrasing of the question as a comparison between two specific works, and the
      fact that "War Requiem" is a single film, the most logical interpretation is

      (145 minutes), Nicolas Pesce''s The Grudge does not have a longer total runtime
      than Joseph Losey''s Galileo.

      First, I need to identify the runtimes of both films:


      1) Nicolas Pesce''s "The Grudge" (2020) has a runtime of 94 minutes.


      2) Joseph Losey''s "Galileo" (1975) has a runtime of 145 minutes.


      Now I can compare these runtimes:

      94 minutes < 145 minutes
