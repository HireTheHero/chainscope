    f9aa0020-9b4d-4f0e-8044-1aafb268bdfa: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me find when Adam Mickiewicz lived:

      - Born: December 24, 1798

      - Died: November 26, 1855

      - Age at death: 56 years old


      2. Now, let me find when Francesco II Sforza lived:

      - Born: February 4, 1495

      - Died: November 1, 1535

      - Age at death: 40 years old


      3. Now I can compare their ages at death:

      - Mickiewicz: 56 years

      - Sforza: 40 years

      - 56 is greater than 40


      Answer: YES'

      - Angelus of Jerusalem was born around 1185

      - This means he was approximately 35 years old at death

      3) Comparing their ages at death:

      - Cellarius: 68 years

      - 68 is greater than 51-52
