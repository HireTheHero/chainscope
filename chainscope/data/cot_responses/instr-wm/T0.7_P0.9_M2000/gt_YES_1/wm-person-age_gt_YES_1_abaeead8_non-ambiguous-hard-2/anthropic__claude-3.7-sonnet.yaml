      determine which historical figure lived to an older age.


      Step 1: Let me identify who these people were and when they lived.

      - Konstantin Rokossovsky was a Soviet military commander who served during World
      War II

      - Nikolai Essen was a Russian admiral who served in the Imperial Russian Navy


      Step 2: Find their birth and death dates to calculate their ages at death.

      - Konstantin Rokossovsky: Born December 21, 1896, died August 3, 1968

      - Nikolai Essen: Born December 23, 1860, died May 7, 1915


      Step 3: Calculate their ages at death.

      - Rokossovsky: 71 years old at death (1968 - 1896 = 72, but accounting for exact
      dates, he was 71)

      - Essen: 54 years old at death (1915 - 1860 = 55, but accounting for exact dates,
      he was 54)


      Step 4: Compare their ages at death.

      - Rokossovsky died at age 71

      - Essen died at age 54

      - 71 > 54

      and Yuan dynasties. He was born in 1232 and died in 1298. This means Zhou Mi
      lived to be 66 years old (1298 - 1232 = 66).


      Step 2: Find Robert III, Count of Dreux''s lifespan.

      Robert III of Dreux was a French nobleman who lived during the medieval period.
      He was born in 1185 and died in 1234. This means Robert III lived to be 49 years
      old (1234 - 1185 = 49).


      Step 3: Compare the ages at death.

      Zhou Mi: 66 years

      Robert III, Count of Dreux: 49 years


      Since 66 is greater than 49, Zhou Mi was older at his time of death than Robert
      III, Count of Dreux.

      (died at ~71), Gerard was older at his time of death.


      NO - Gerard I of Durbuy was older at his time of death than Alexander V at his
      time of death.


      Wait, I made an error in my answer. The question asks if Gerard was older than
      Alexander at death, and my analysis shows Gerard died at ~78 while Alexander
      V died at ~71. So Gerard was indeed older at death.


      The correct answer is: YES'

      who was older at their time of death.


      Step 1: Identify the historical figures and their lifespans.

      - Gerard I of Durbuy was a nobleman from the House of Luxembourg who lived approximately
      from 1040 to 1110 CE.

      - Alexander V (Pietro Philarghi) was an antipope during the Western Schism who
      lived from approximately 1339 to 1410 CE.


      Step 2: Calculate their ages at death.

      - Gerard I of Durbuy: 1110 - 1040 = approximately 70 years old at death

      - Alexander V: 1410 - 1339 = approximately 71 years old at death


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Gerard I of Durbuy: ~70 years

      - Alexander V: ~71 years


      Based on the historical records available, Alexander V appears to have been
      slightly older at his time of death than Gerard I of Durbuy.

      Gerard I of Durbuy and Alexander V, then compare them.


      Step 1: Identify Gerard I of Durbuy.

      Gerard I of Durbuy was a medieval nobleman, Count of Durbuy. Based on historical
      records, he was born around 1025 and died around 1078. This would make him approximately
      53 years old at death.


      Step 2: Identify Alexander V.

      There are two notable Alexander Vs in history:

      - Alexander V (antipope), who was born around 1339 and died in 1410, making
      him about 71 years old at death.

      - Alexander V of Macedon, who lived in the 2nd century BCE and died young, around
      the age of 22.


      Step 3: Compare the ages.

      If referring to Alexander V the antipope: 71 > 53

      If referring to Alexander V of Macedon: 53 > 22


      Step 4: Determine the answer.

      Since Alexander V most commonly refers to the antipope (the more historically
      significant figure), and he was 71 at death while Gerard I was approximately
      53, Alexander V was older at death.


      NO, Gerard I of Durbuy was not older at his time of death than Alexander V at
      his time of death.'

      Gerard I of Durbuy and Alexander V, then compare them.


      Step 1: Find information about Gerard I of Durbuy.

      Gerard I of Durbuy was a Count of Durbuy who lived in the 11th century. Based
      on historical records, he was born around 1040 and died around 1108-1109. This
      would make him approximately 68-69 years old at death.


      Step 2: Find information about Alexander V.

      There are two notable Alexander Vs in history:

      - Alexander V (Pope): Born around 1339 and died in 1410, making him about 71
      years old at death.

      - Alexander V of Macedon: Died very young, around 17-18 years old in 294 BCE.


      Step 3: Compare the ages.

      If referring to Pope Alexander V (the more commonly referenced Alexander V),
      he died at approximately 71 years old, which is older than Gerard I of Durbuy
      who died at approximately 68-69 years old.


      NO, Gerard I of Durbuy was not older at his time of death than Alexander V (assuming
      Pope Alexander V) at his time of death.'

      - Jacques Perret (1901-1992), a French writer


      Step 2: Identify Hugh the Great''s lifespan.

      Hugh the Great (also known as Hugh of Francia) lived from around 898 to 956
      CE.


      Step 3: Calculate their ages at death.

      - Jacques Perret de Chambery: 1658 - 1583 = 75 years

      - Jacques Perret (writer): 1992 - 1901 = 91 years

      - Hugh the Great: 956 - 898 = 58 years


      Step 4: Compare the ages.

      Both Jacques Perrets lived longer than Hugh the Great (75 > 58 and 91 > 58).
