    0ae06932-24cd-4043-a0b6-1f93ed16d49b: 'To determine who was older at the time
      of their death, we need to consider the birth and death years of both Konstantin
      Rokossovsky and Nikolai Essen.


      1. Konstantin Rokossovsky was born on December 21, 1896, and died on August
      3, 1968. This means he was 71 years old at the time of his death.


      2. Nikolai Essen was born on December 11, 1860, and died on May 7, 1915. This
      means he was 54 years old at the time of his death.


      Now, comparing their ages:


      - Konstantin Rokossovsky was 71 years old at his time of death.

      - Nikolai Essen was 54 years old at his time of death.


      Therefore, Konstantin Rokossovsky was older at the time of his death than Nikolai
      Essen was at his.


      The answer is YES.'

      1. **Bernard of Vienne**: Bernard of Vienne, also known as Saint Bernard of
      Vienne, was a French bishop who lived during the early medieval period. He died
      in the year 842. The exact birth year of Bernard of Vienne is not well-documented,
      but it is generally believed that he was born around 778. Therefore, he would

      2. **Karl Josef von Bachmann**: Karl Josef von Bachmann was a Swiss military
      officer. He was born on March 3, 1734, and died on September 3, 1792. This means
      he was 58 years old when he died.

      from Pistoia, Italy. However, there is little historical information about his
      exact birth and death dates. Dante''s work was published in the early 14th century,
      and Vanni Fucci is depicted as a contemporary figure of that time, but specific
      dates of birth and death are not well-documented.


      2. **Uc Brunet**: Uc Brunet was a troubadour from the region of Provence in

      11th to the early 13th centuries. Uc Brunet''s life dates are not precisely

      cannot definitively answer whether Vanni Fucci was older than Uc Brunet at their
      times of death.

      Since both figures have uncertain dates of death and lack precise birth records,
      it is challenging to definitively determine who was older at their time of death.
      However, based on their estimated periods of activity and lifespan, it is generally
      believed that troubadours like Uc Brunet lived relatively long lives for their
      time, often into their 50s or 60s, whereas Vanni Fucci likely died younger,
      possibly in his 40s.

      1. **Vanni Fucci**: He was a character mentioned in Dante Alighieri''s "Inferno,"
      which was written in the early 14th century. Fucci was a historical figure from
      Pistoia, Italy, who lived in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. His exact
      birth and death years are not well-documented, but he was involved in a theft
      that occurred around 1293. It is presumed he died shortly after this period,

      and death years are not precisely known either, but he was active in the late

      until their death or retirement. It''s estimated that he lived until around

      Given these approximations:

      - Vanni Fucci lived in the late 13th to early 14th century.

      lifespans and active periods of their respective eras, it is plausible to estimate:


      Vanni Fucci likely died younger than Uc Brunet, as Fucci''s criminal activity
      occurred when he was presumably an adult in the late 13th century, and he died
      shortly after. In contrast, Uc Brunet, being a troubadour, might have had a
      longer life extending into the 13th century.
