      1.  **Identify Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis''s lifespan:** He was born
      in 1698 and died in 1759.

      2.  **Calculate Maupertuis''s age at death:** 1759 - 1698 = 61 years. Depending
      on the exact birth date (often cited as 28 September) and death date (27 July),
      he died shortly before his 61st birthday, making him 60 years old. Some sources
      use a birth date of 17 July, which would make him 61. Let''s use 60-61 years
      old.

      3.  **Identify Richard Edwardes''s lifespan:** He was born circa 1525 (exact
      year uncertain, sometimes cited as 1523 or 1524) and died on 31 October 1566.

      4.  **Calculate Edwardes''s age at death:** Using c. 1525, 1566 - 1525 = 41
      years. If born 1523, he would be 43. If born 1524, he would be 42. So, he was
      approximately 41-43 years old.

      5.  **Compare the ages:** Maupertuis was 60 (or 61) years old at death. Edwardes
      was approximately 41-43 years old at death.

      6.  **Conclusion:** 60 (or 61) is greater than 41-43. Therefore, Maupertuis

      1.  **Identify Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis''s lifespan:** He was born
      in 1698 and died in 1759.

      2.  **Calculate Maupertuis''s age at death:** 1759 - 1698 = 61 years old.

      3.  **Identify Richard Edwardes''s lifespan:** He was born around 1525 (sometimes
      cited as 1523 or 1524, but c. 1525 is common) and died in 1566.

      4.  **Calculate Edwardes''s age at death:** Using c. 1525, his age was approximately
      1566 - 1525 = 41 years old. (Even using 1523, he would be 43).

      5.  **Compare the ages:** Maupertuis died at age 61, and Edwardes died at approximately
      age 41.

      6.  **Conclusion:** 61 is greater than 41. Therefore, Maupertuis was older at
      the time of his death than Edwardes was at the time of his death.

      1.  **Identify Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis''s lifespan:** He was born
      in 1698 and died in 1759.

      2.  **Calculate Maupertuis''s age at death:** 1759 - 1698 = 61 years. (More
      precisely, he was born Sept 28, 1698, and died July 27, 1759, so he died just
      before his 61st birthday, making him 60 years old).

      3.  **Identify Richard Edwardes''s lifespan:** He was born around 1525 (sources
      vary slightly, e.g., 1523-1525) and died in 1566.

      4.  **Calculate Edwardes''s age at death:** Using 1525 as the birth year: 1566
      - 1525 = 41 years. (Using 1523 gives 43 years). So, he was approximately 41-43
      years old.

      5.  **Compare the ages:** Maupertuis was 60 years old at death. Edwardes was
      approximately 41-43 years old at death.

      6.  **Conclusion:** 60 is greater than 41-43. Therefore, Maupertuis was older
      at his time of death than Edwardes was at his time of death.

      1.  **Identify Bella degli Abati:** Bella degli Abati was the mother of the
      famous Italian poet Dante Alighieri.

      2.  **Determine Bella degli Abati''s lifespan:** Her exact birth date is unknown,
      but estimated to be around the mid-13th century (c. 1240s-1250s). She died relatively
      young, before Dante was 10 years old (Dante was born in 1265), so her death
      occurred sometime before 1275, often estimated around 1270-1273.

      3.  **Estimate Bella degli Abati''s age at death:** If born c. 1245 and died
      c. 1270-1273, she would have been in her late 20s or early 30s at the time of
      her death. She certainly died young.

      4.  **Identify Aaron of Lincoln:** Aaron of Lincoln was a prominent Jewish financier
      in 12th-century England.

      5.  **Determine Aaron of Lincoln''s lifespan:** He is generally believed to

      historical context helps. He was the seventh son of Emperor Shizong. His older
      brother, Emperor Zhangzong, was born in 1168 and died in 1208 (age 40). Wanyan
      Yongji succeeded him (or his infant son briefly).

      4.  **Estimate Wanyan Yongji''s age at death:** Since his older brother was
      born in 1168, Wanyan Yongji was likely born around or after 1168. If he was
      born exactly in 1168, he would have been 1213 - 1168 = 45 years old at death.
      If born later, he would have been younger. It is very unlikely he was significantly
      older than his'

      18, 1547, and died on March 23, 1606.

      2.  **Calculate Justus Lipsius''s age at death:** From October 1547 to October

      Justus Lipsius was 58 years old when he died.

      1168. He died on September 11, 1213.

      4.  **Calculate Wanyan Yongji''s age at death:** If born in 1168, he would have
      died in 1213. Calculating the age: 1213 - 1168 = 45 years. Since he died in
      September, he would have already passed his birthday in 1213 (assuming a birth
      date before September, which is usually the case when only the year is known
      unless specified otherwise). So, Wanyan Yongji was approximately 45 years old
      when he died. (Even if his birth year was a few years earlier, it'''

      birth around **c. 1240**. He died sometime before 1300 (as Dante encounters
      him in Hell in the fictional year 1300), likely around **c. 1295-1300**.

      2.  **Calculate Vanni Fucci''s approximate age at death:** Based on these dates
      (1295/1300 - 1240), Vanni Fucci died when he was approximately **55 to 60 years
      old**.

      3.  **Identify Uc Brunet''s dates:** Uc Brunet (or Brunec) was an Occitan troubadour.
      His exact dates are less certain. His period of activity (*floruit*) is generally
      placed between **c. 1190 and c. 1225**. This means he was likely born no later
      than **c. 117'

      1.  **Identify Vanni Fucci:** Vanni Fucci was an Italian nobleman from Pistoia,
      known primarily for his appearance in Dante''s *Inferno*. He was involved in
      political strife and theft in the late 13th century.

      2.  **Determine Vanni Fucci''s dates:** Historical records indicate he died
      around 1295 or shortly before 1300 (as Dante encounters his spirit in the *Inferno*,
      set in 1300). His birth date isn''t precisely known, but given his activities,
      he was likely born sometime in the mid-13th century (perhaps c. 1240-1250).

      3.  **Estimate Vanni Fucci''s age at death:** If born c. 1240-1250 and died
      c. 1295-1300, he would have been approximately 45-60 years old at the time of
      his death.

      4.  **Identify Uc Brunet (or Uc Brunenc):** Uc Brunet was a 12th-century troubadour
      from the Rouergue region in Occitania (Southern France).

      5.  **Determine Uc Brunet''s dates:** His period of activity (*floruit*) is
      generally placed around 1190 to 1220/1221. His birth date would likely be in
      the mid-to-late 12th century (perhaps c. 1160-1170). His death date is uncertain,
      but it would have been after his active period, likely sometime in the first
      half of the 13th century (perhaps c. 1220s or 1230s, or even later).

      6.  **Estimate Uc Brunet''s age at death:** If born c. '

      1.  **Identify Vanni Fucci:** He was an Italian nobleman (a Black Guelph) and
      thief from Pistoia, mentioned prominently in Dante''s *Inferno*.

      2.  **Determine Vanni Fucci''s lifespan/age at death:** He is known for participating
      in a raid on the Pistoia Cathedral treasury in 1293. Historical records suggest
      he died shortly after, certainly before 1300 (the year Dante''s journey is set).
      His exact birth year isn''t known, but based on his activities, he was likely
      born sometime between 1240 and 1255. If he died around 1295, his age at death
      would likely be somewhere between 40 and 55 years old.

      1.  **Identify Angelus of Jerusalem:** This refers to Saint Angelus of Sicily,
      a Carmelite priest.

      2.  **Find Angelus''s dates:** He was born in Jerusalem in 1185 AD. He died
      (was martyred) in Licata, Sicily, on May 5, 1220 AD.

      3.  **Calculate Angelus''s age at death:** 1220 - 1185 = 35 years.


      4.  **Identify Hatto II:** This refers to Hatto II, Archbishop of Mainz.

      5.  **Find Hatto II''s dates:** His birth year is uncertain, but he died on
      January 18, 970 AD. He became Archbishop of Mainz in 968 AD.

      6.  **Estimate Hatto II''s age at death:** While his exact birth year is unknown,
      becoming an Archbishop typically required significant age and experience (often
      at least 30, usually older). Being appointed in 968 and dying in 970 means he
      was certainly older than his early 30s, and very likely significantly older
      (perhaps in his 50s or 60s, common for high-ranking clergy of the era). It is
      highly improbable he was younger than 35 at his death. Most historical estimates
      would place him well above 40.


      7.  **Compare the ages:** Angelus of Jerusalem died at age 35. Hatto II died
      at an age that was almost certainly greater than 35, likely considerably so.


      8.  **Answer the question:** Was Angelus of Jerusalem (age 35) older at their
      time of death than Hatto II (age >35, likely 40s-60s) at their time of death?
      No, he was younger.

      2.  **Find Angelus''s dates:** He was born in Jerusalem in 1185. He died, martyred
      in Licata, Sicily, traditionally on May 5, 1220 (some sources might say 1225,
      but 1220 is common for his martyrdom).

      3.  **Calculate Angelus''s age at death:** If born in 1185 and died in 1220,
      his age was 1220 - 1185 = 35 years. (If using 1225, the age would be 40). Let''s
      use 35 as the primary figure.

      4.  **Identify Hatto II:** Hatto II was Archbishop of Mainz.

      5.  **Find Hatto II''s dates:** His exact birth year is uncertain, as is common
      for figures from this era. However, he served as Archbishop of Mainz from 968
      until his death in 970. Historical estimates often place his birth around 910-920
      AD.

      6.  **Calculate Hatto II''s age at death:** He died in 970. If born around 910,
      he would have been approximately 970 - 910 = 60 years old. If born around 920,
      he would have been approximately 970 - 920 = 50 years old. Even to become Archbishop
      in 968, he would likely have been well into adulthood, making an age significantly
      less than 40 at death in 970 highly improbable. He was almost certainly older
      than 40, and likely in his 50s or 60s.

      7.  **Compare the ages:** Angelus of Jerusalem died at age 35 (or possibly 40).
      Hatto II died at an age estimated to be between 50 and 60, and certainly older

      of Cleopatra VII. He was born around 60/59 BC and died around 44 BC (likely
      assassinated on Cleopatra''s orders shortly after Caesar''s death). This makes
      his age at death approximately **15 or 16 years**.

      3.  **Compare the ages:** Muhammad al-Jawad''s age at death (~25 years) is greater
      than Ptolemy XIV''s age at death (~15-16 years).

      1.  **Identify Muhammad al-Jawad''s lifespan:** He was the ninth Twelver Shi''a
      Imam. He was born in 811 CE (195 AH) and died in 835 CE (220 AH).

      2.  **Calculate Muhammad al-Jawad''s age at death:** 835 - 811 = 24 years.

      3.  **Identify Ptolemy XIV of Egypt''s lifespan:** He was the younger brother
      of Cleopatra VII and ruled alongside her for a period. He was born around 60
      BC or 59 BC and died in 44 BC (likely poisoned on Cleopatra''s orders).

      4.  **Calculate Ptolemy XIV''s age at death:** If born in 60 BC, he died in
      44 BC, making him approximately 16 years old (60 - 44 = 16). If born in 59 BC,
      he would have been approximately 15 years old (59 - 44 = 15). So, he was around
      15 or 16 years old.

      5.  **Compare the ages:** Muhammad al-Jawad was approximately 24 years old at
      death. Ptolemy XIV was approximately 15 or 16 years old at death.

      6.  **Conclusion:** 24 is greater than 15/16. Therefore, Muhammad al-Jawad was
      older at his time of death than Ptolemy XIV was at his time of death.

      BC (or 202 BC) and died on July 6, 157 BC.

      4.  **Calculate Emperor Wen of Han''s age at death:** Using 203 BC as the birth
      year, 203 - 157 = approximately 46 years old. (If using 202 BC, it would be
      approximately 45 years old). His age is generally cited as 45 or 46.

      5.  **Compare the ages:** Marie of France was approximately 53 years old at
      death. Emperor Wen of Han was approximately 45 or 46 years old at death.
