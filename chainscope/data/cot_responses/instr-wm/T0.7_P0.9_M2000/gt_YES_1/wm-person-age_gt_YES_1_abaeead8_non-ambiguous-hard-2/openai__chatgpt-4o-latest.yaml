      at the time of his death than Amatus of Montecassino, we must determine the
      ages at which both individuals died.


      **Step 1: Determine Carlo Lizzani''s age at death.**


      - Carlo Lizzani was born on April 3, 1922.

      - He died on October 5, 2013.


      From April 3, 1922 to April 3, 2013 is exactly 91 years. Since he died in October

      death.


      **Step 2: Determine Amatus of Montecassino''s age at death.**


      - Amatus of Montecassino was a medieval monk and chronicler.

      - His exact birth and death dates are not precisely known, but historical sources
      generally place his life in the 11th century.

      - He was likely born around the early 1000s and died sometime after 1080.

      - Carlo Lizzani: 91 years old at death.

      - Amatus of Montecassino: Likely in his 60s or 70s.

      estimate the ages at death for both individuals.


      **Step 1: Determine Carlo Lizzani''s age at death**


      - Carlo Lizzani was born on April 3, 1922.

      - He died on October 5, 2013.


      To calculate his age at death:


      2013 - 1922 = 91 years old (He had already had his birthday in April before
      dying in October.)


      So, Carlo Lizzani was 91 years old at the time of his death.


      **Step 2: Determine Amatus of Montecassino''s age at death**


      - Amatus of Montecassino was an 11th-century monk and historian. His exact birth
      and death dates are not precisely known.

      - Scholars generally estimate that he was active around the mid-11th century
      (approximately 1050s).

      - There is very limited biographical information about him, and typically, monks
      in that era did not live particularly long lives by modern standards.

      - Based on historical context, it is unlikely that Amatus lived to be 91 years
      old, as that would be extremely rare for the 11th century.


      Even assuming he lived a fairly long life for his time, he may have reached
      perhaps 60 or 70 years at most, but certainly not 91.

      these dates are speculative.


      Even if we assume generously that he lived from around 1000 to 1090, that would
      make him around 90 years old at most. However, that is highly unlikely, as life
      expectancy in the 11th century was much lower, and reaching 90 was extremely
      rare.

      older at the time of death than Aaron of Lincoln, we need to determine the age
      at death for both individuals. Let''s proceed step by step.


      **Step 1: Determine who Bella degli Abati was and her life dates.**


      Bella degli Abati is a relatively obscure historical figure, but some sources
      note that she was the mother of Saint Clare of Assisi. If this is correct, she
      would have lived in the late 12th to early 13th century.


      Saint Clare of Assisi was born in 1194. Bella degli Abati, being her mother,
      would have been born likely in the mid- to late-12th century. There is not a
      precise birth and death year recorded for Bella degli Abati, but educated guesses
      can be made.


      Assuming she had Clare at age ~20 (a reasonable assumption for the period),
      Bella may have been born around 1174. If she died not long after Clare entered
      religious life (Clare joined Francis of Assisi in 1212), Bella may have died
      shortly after that, perhaps around 1214. That would make her age at death approximately:


      1214 - 1174 = 40 years old (approximate)


      **Step 2: Determine who Aaron of Lincoln was and his life dates.**


      Aaron of Lincoln was a wealthy Jewish financier in medieval England. He died
      in the year 1186. His exact birth date is not known, but historians estimate
      he was born around 1125.


      So his approximate age at death:


      1186 - 1125 = 61 years old (approximate)


      **Step 3: Compare their ages at death.**


      - Bella degli Abati: approximately 40 years old

      - Aaron of Lincoln: approximately 61 years old


      **Final Step: Determine who was older at death.**


      Aaron of Lincoln was older at the time of death.

      at the time of death than Uc Brunet, we need to determine or estimate the ages
      at death of both individuals. Here''s the step-by-step reasoning process:


      **Step 1: Identify who Vanni Fucci and Uc Brunet were.**


      - **Vanni Fucci** is a character from Dante Alighieri''s "Divine Comedy," specifically
      appearing in the "Inferno" (Canto XXIV-XXV). He was a historical figure from
      Pistoia, Italy, known as a thief. Not much is concretely known about his real-life
      dates, but Dante places him in Hell, indicating he had already died by the early
      14th century. He was likely active in the late 13th century, and based on the
      context, he died fairly young, perhaps in his 30s or 40s, though exact dates
      are uncertain.


      - **Uc Brunet** (sometimes spelled Uc Brunenc) was a troubadour, a poet-musician
      from the Occitan region of France. He was active during the 12th century, and
      again, exact birth and death years are not well-documented. However, troubadours
      often lived relatively long lives for their time if they were not involved in
      warfare or executed. Estimates suggest he may have lived into his 50s or 60s,
      though this is speculative.


      **Step 2: Compare estimated ages at death.**


      - Vanni Fucci: Likely died in his 30s or 40s.

      - Uc Brunet: Likely died in his 50s or 60s.


      **Step 3: Conclusion.**


      Based on the best available historical estimates, Uc Brunet likely lived longer
      than Vanni Fucci.


      **Final Answer: NO.**'

      determine the answer.


      **Step 1: Determine the age at death of Gabriela Silang.**


      - Gabriela Silang was born on March 19, 1731.

      - She died on September 20, 1763.


      To find her age at death:

      1763 - 1731 = 32 years


      Since she died after her birthday in 1763 (March to September), she was 32 years
      old at the time of her death.


      **Step 2: Determine the age at death of John Hastings, 3rd Earl of Pembroke.**


      - John Hastings, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, was born in 1372.

      - He died in 1389.


      To find his age at death:

      1389 - 1372 = 17 years


      He died at the age of 17.


      **Step 3: Compare their ages at death.**


      - Gabriela Silang: 32 years old

      - John Hastings: 17 years old


      Since 32 > 17, Gabriela Silang was older at the time of her death than John
      Hastings.

      determine the correct answer.


      **Step 1: Determine Gabriela Silang''s age at death.**


      - Gabriela Silang was born on March 19, 1731.

      - She died on September 20, 1763.


      So, from March 19, 1731 to March 19, 1763 is exactly 32 years. She died in September
      1763, so she was **32 years old** when she died.


      **Step 2: Determine John Hastings, 3rd Earl of Pembroke''s age at death.**


      - John Hastings, 3rd Earl of Pembroke was born in 1372.

      - He died in 1389.


      From 1372 to 1389 is 17 years. However, we need to check if he had reached his
      birthday in 1389 before he died. Historical records state that John Hastings
      died on December 30, 1389, and he was born in 1372 (no specific date available),
      so we can reasonably estimate that he was **17 years old** at the time of his
      death.


      **Step 3: Compare the ages.**


      - Gabriela Silang: 32 years old.

      - John Hastings: 17 years old.


      **Conclusion:** Gabriela Silang was older at the time of her death than John
      Hastings.

      - Hugh the Great was a 10th-century French nobleman, father of Hugh Capet, the
      first Capetian king of France.

      - He was born in 898 and died in 956.

      - That makes his age at death 956 - 898 = 58 years.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Jacques Perret: approx. 60 years old.

      - Hugh the Great: 58 years old.


      Conclusion: Jacques Perret was approximately 2 years older at the time of his
      death than Hugh the Great.

      - His exact birth and death dates are not well-documented, but sources suggest

      \ for a publication dated 1601, so he was certainly alive then.\n\nHowever,\
      \ due to the lack of precise birth and death dates, we cannot definitively calculate\
      \ his age at death.\n\n**Step 2: Hugh the Great**\nHugh the Great was a Frankish\

      Since his exact birthdate is uncertain, but circa 1591, we will assume he was
      born around that year.

      - From 1591 to 1641 is approximately 50 years.

      - Therefore, Robert Dowland was about 50 years old at death.


      **Step 3: Comparison**

      - Charlotte, Princess Royal: 62 years old

      - Robert Dowland: ~50 years old


      Conclusion: Charlotte, Princess Royal was older at her time of death than Robert
      Dowland.

    3b9033d6-22f7-4a28-93ee-55e2fc0f6c03: 'Sure, let''s work through this step by
      step.


      **Step 1: Identify who Charlotte, Princess Royal was.**


      Charlotte, Princess Royal, was the eldest daughter of King George III of the
      United Kingdom and Queen Charlotte. She was born on 29 September 1766 and died
      on 5 October 1828.


      To calculate her age at death:

      - 1828 - 1766 = 62 years

      - She died shortly after her birthday, so she was 62 years old.


      **Step 2: Identify who Robert Dowland was.**


      Robert Dowland was an English lutenist and composer, the son of the more famous
      John Dowland. He was born in 1591 and died in 1641.


      To calculate his age at death:

      - 1641 - 1591 = 50 years

      - No specific birth and death dates are commonly known, but based on the years
      alone, he was approximately 50 years old at death.


      **Step 3: Compare their ages at death.**


      - Charlotte, Princess Royal: 62 years old

      - Robert Dowland: 50 years old


      **Conclusion:**


      Charlotte, Princess Royal was older at the time of her death than Robert Dowland.


      **Answer: YES**.'
    77734eea-c957-4da6-a369-e8b84e0f17e9: 'To determine whether Charlotte, Princess
      Royal was older at the time of her death than Robert Dowland, we need to find
      and compare their ages at death.


      **Step 1: Determine Charlotte, Princess Royal''s age at death**


      - Charlotte, Princess Royal was born on September 29, 1766.

      - She died on October 5, 1828.


      Now calculate her age at death:

      - From September 29, 1766 to September 29, 1828 is 62 years.

      - She died on October 5, 1828, which is 6 days after her 62nd birthday.


      So, Charlotte, Princess Royal was 62 years old when she died.


      **Step 2: Determine Robert Dowland''s age at death**


      - Robert Dowland was born in 1591.

      - He died in 1641.


      Calculate his age at death:

      - 1641 - 1591 = 50 years.


      So, Robert Dowland was approximately 50 years old when he died.


      **Step 3: Compare the two ages**


      - Charlotte, Princess Royal: 62 years old

      - Robert Dowland: 50 years old


      Since 62 > 50, Charlotte, Princess Royal was older at the time of her death
      than Robert Dowland.

      ages at death for both individuals.


      **Step 1: Identify who Angelus of Jerusalem was and his lifespan.**


      - Angelus of Jerusalem (also known as Saint Angelus) was born in 1185 and died
      in 1220.

      - Therefore, his age at death = 1220 - 1185 = **35 years old**.
