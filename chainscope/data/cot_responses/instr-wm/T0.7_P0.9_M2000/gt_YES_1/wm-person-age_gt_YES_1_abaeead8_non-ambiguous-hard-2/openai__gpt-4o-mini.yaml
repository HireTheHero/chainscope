      the ages of Konstantin Rokossovsky and Nikolai Essen at the time of their deaths.


      1. **Konstantin Rokossovsky**: He was born on December 21, 1896, and died on
      August 3, 1968. This means he was 71 years old at the time of his death.


      2. **Nikolai Essen**: He was born on February 8, 1870, and died on December
      1, 1948. This means he was 78 years old at the time of his death.


      Now, we compare their ages at the time of their respective deaths:

      - Rokossovsky was 71 years old.

      - Essen was 78 years old.


      Since 71 is less than 78, Rokossovsky was not older than Essen at the time of
      their deaths.

      referenced in Dante''s works and is believed to have lived in the 13th century.
      His exact birth and death dates are also not definitively known, but he is typically
      placed around the same time as Vanni Fucci.


      Now, based on their historical context, if we assume both lived in the late
      13th century, it''s likely they were contemporaries. The specific ages at their
      times of death are unclear due to the lack of precise birth dates.


      However, since both figures are from similar periods and there is no substantial
      evidence indicating that one was significantly older than the other at their
      time of death, we cannot definitively say that Vanni Fucci was older than Uc
      Brunet.


      Thus, the answer to the question is:


      NO.'
    b3823494-dcc1-43f6-aeb9-d7bd0ca33f0c: 'To answer the question, we need to consider
      the birth and death dates of both historical figures: Vanni Fucci and Uc Brunet.


      1. **Vanni Fucci**: He is a character from Dante''s "Divine Comedy," specifically
      from "Inferno." Vanni Fucci was a real historical figure, born around 1250 and
      died in 1296. Therefore, he was approximately 46 years old at the time of his
      death.


      2. **Uc Brunet**: Uc Brunet (or Ugo Brunetto) was a historical figure from the
      same period, also mentioned in Dante''s works. He was born around 1250 and died
      in 1294. Thus, he was about 44 years old at the time of his death.


      Now comparing their ages at death:

      - Vanni Fucci: 46 years old at death

      - Uc Brunet: 44 years old at death


      Since Vanni Fucci was older than Uc Brunet at their respective times of death,
      the answer to the question is:


      YES.'
    bfdfdec8-dee3-40f5-9f12-db5d3e42132f: 'To determine whether Vanni Fucci was older
      at the time of death than Uc Brunet, we need to establish the birth and death
      dates of both historical figures.


      1. **Vanni Fucci**: He was a character in Dante Alighieri''s "Inferno," and
      he is believed to have lived in the late 13th century. Specific dates can be
      somewhat unclear, but he is generally thought to have died around the year 1300.


      2. **Uc Brunet**: He was a historical figure known to be a troubadour in the
      12th century. He is thought to have lived around the late 11th to early 12th
      centuries, with his death often cited around 1125.


      Now, we compare their ages at death:


      - If Vanni Fucci died around 1300 and Uc Brunet died around 1125, then Vanni
      Fucci was born later than Uc Brunet.

      - This means that Uc Brunet was older than Vanni Fucci at the time of their
      respective deaths.


      Thus, the answer to the question is:


      NO.'
    c3b522a3-fd30-4ac5-8434-484eaca4ffad: 'To answer this question, we need to establish
      the birth and death years of both Vanni Fucci and Uc Brunet.


      1. **Vanni Fucci**: Vanni Fucci is a character from Dante Alighieri''s "Divine
      Comedy." Historically, he was a real person who lived in the late 13th century,
      specifically around 1250-1300. However, his exact birth and death dates are
      not definitively recorded. For the sake of this question, we can assume he died
      around 1300.


      2. **Uc Brunet**: Uc Brunet is a historical figure from the same era, believed
      to have been born around 1250 and died around 1300 as well. However, again,
      exact dates are not typically provided for figures from this period.


      3. **Comparison**: If we assume both figures died around the same time (around
      1300), then we need to consider their approximate ages at death. If we take
      their birth years as similar (around 1250), they would both be approximately
      50 years old at their time of death.


      Given this reasoning:


      - If both were born around 1250 and died around 1300, then they would be of
      similar age at death, with neither being significantly older than the other.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is **NO**; Vanni Fucci was not older at
      their time of death than Uc Brunet at their time of death.'

    d2fe3a98-4ae6-45db-b1d4-e1e88817d2c7: 'To answer the question, let''s first establish
      the relevant information about both historical figures:


      1. **Angelus of Jerusalem**: Angelus of Jerusalem was a Christian saint and
      the Patriarch of Jerusalem. He is believed to have died in 1187.


      2. **Hatto II**: Hatto II was the Archbishop of Mainz and is known to have died
      in 970.


      Now, we need to compare their ages at the time of death. However, we need to
      know the birth years of both figures to calculate their ages:


      - **Angelus of Jerusalem**: His exact birth year is not well-documented, but
      he is thought to have been born around 1140. Therefore, he would have been approximately
      47 years old at the time of his death in 1187.


      - **Hatto II**: He was born around 910 and died in 970. This would make him
      around 60 years old at the time of his death.


      Now we compare their ages at death:


      - Angelus of Jerusalem: Approximately 47 years old.

      - Hatto II: Approximately 60 years old.

      was older at their time of death than Hatto II, we need to establish the birth
      and death dates of both figures.


      1. **Angelus of Jerusalem**: He was a Catholic saint and the Patriarch of Jerusalem.
      He died in 1185. The exact birth year is often debated, but he is generally
      believed to have been born around 1110.


      2. **Hatto II**: He was the Archbishop of Mainz. He died in 970. His birth year
      is also debated, but he is generally thought to have been born around 910.


      Now, we can calculate their ages at the time of death:


      - **Angelus of Jerusalem**: If he was born around 1110 and died in 1185, he
      would have been approximately 75 years old at his time of death (1185 - 1110
      = 75).


      - **Hatto II**: If he was born around 910 and died in 970, he would have been
      approximately 60 years old at his time of death (970 - 910 = 60).


      Now, we can compare their ages:


      - Angelus of Jerusalem: ~75 years old at death

      - Hatto II: ~60 years old at death


      Since 75 is greater than 60, we can conclude that Angelus of Jerusalem was indeed
      older at their time of death than Hatto II.
