    \n* **Who are Justus Lipsius and Wanyan Yongji?**\n    * Justus Lipsius was a\
    \ 16th-century Renaissance humanist scholar. \n    * Wanyan Yongji was a 15th-century\
    \ Ming dynasty Chinese emperor. \n\n* **How do we determine their ages?**\n  \
    \  *  To compare their ages, we need to know their birth years and death years.\
    \ This is important because we need to know how long they lived.\n\n* **What information\
    \ is missing?**\n    * We don't know the exact birth and death years of either\
    \ of these individuals.\n\n**Therefore, we cannot determine if Justus Lipsius\
    \ was older than Wanyan Yongji at their time of death.** \n\n\n**Answer: NO**\
