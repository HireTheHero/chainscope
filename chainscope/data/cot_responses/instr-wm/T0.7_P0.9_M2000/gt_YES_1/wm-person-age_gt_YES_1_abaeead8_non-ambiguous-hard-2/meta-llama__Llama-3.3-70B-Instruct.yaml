      \ to make a precise comparison. However, considering the average lifespan during\

      1. **Identify the individuals**: Bernard of Vienne and Karl Josef von Bachmann

      and Karl Josef von Bachmann was a Swiss politician.

      in 842 AD, but his birthdate is not clearly documented. Karl Josef von Bachmann
      lived from 1734 to 1792.


      3. **Estimate age at death for Bernard of Vienne**: Without a precise birthdate,
      we can''t calculate his exact age at death. However, if we consider that he
      was active in the 9th century and died in 842, and assuming he was at least
      in his mid-40s or older when he died (a reasonable assumption given the typical
      ages of high-ranking clergy at the time), we can speculate that he was likely
      somewhere in his 50s or older.


      4. **Calculate age at death for Karl Josef von Bachmann**: Born in 1734 and
      died in 1792, Karl Josef von Bachmann was 58 years old at the time of his death.


      5. **Compare ages at death**: Without the exact age of Bernard of Vienne, we
      can only make a rough comparison. If Bernard of Vienne was indeed in his 50s
      or older at the time of his death, and considering Karl Josef von Bachmann died
      at 58, it''s possible for Bernard to have been either younger or older than
      Bachmann at their respective times of death.


      Given the uncertainty around Bernard of Vienne''s age due to the lack of precise
      birthdate information, and considering that we are looking for a definitive
      YES or NO answer, the question essentially hinges on whether we can confirm
      Bernard of Vienne was older than 58 at his time of death. Without specific information
      to confirm this, we must approach the answer with caution.


      However, the question asks for a YES or NO answer, implying a need to make a
      decision based on available information. Given that we cannot confirm Bernard
      of Vienne''s age at death with precision and considering the speculative nature
      of estimating his age, the most straightforward approach to answering the question
      directly as requested is to acknowledge that we cannot definitively say yes

      the ages of Yan Zhenqing and Ilya Oleynikov at the time of their deaths.


      1. **Identify Yan Zhenqing**: Yan Zhenqing was a Chinese calligrapher and politician
      of the Tang Dynasty, born in 709 AD and died in 785 AD.


      2. **Calculate Yan Zhenqing''s Age at Death**: To find out how old Yan Zhenqing
      was at the time of his death, we subtract his birth year from his death year:
      785 - 709 = 76 years old.


      3. **Identify Ilya Oleynikov**: Ilya Oleynikov was a Soviet actor, born on July
      21, 1947, and died on November 11, 2012.


      4. **Calculate Ilya Oleynikov''s Age at Death**: To calculate Ilya Oleynikov''s
      age at death, we subtract his birth year from his death year and then consider
      the months for a more precise calculation. Since he was born in July and died
      in November, both in the same year, the age would be 65 years old.


      5. **Comparison**: Now, we compare the ages at death. Yan Zhenqing died at 76
      years old, and Ilya Oleynikov died at 65 years old.


      Based on this comparison, Yan Zhenqing was indeed older at the time of his death

    6ccf1f4e-0c77-4895-b4fc-d9922eee084b: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the ages of Gerard I of Durbuy and Alexander V at the time of their deaths and
      then compare these ages.


      1. **Identify the Lifespan of Gerard I of Durbuy**: First, we need to find out
      when Gerard I of Durbuy was born and when he died. Unfortunately, without specific
      information provided in the question, we must rely on general historical knowledge.
      Gerard I of Durbuy was a Count of Durbuy and lived in the 12th and 13th centuries.
      Specific dates of birth and death for him are not provided here, but typically,
      for historical figures of that era, detailed birth and death dates might be
      known but are not specified in this query.


      2. **Identify the Lifespan of Alexander V**: Alexander V was an antipope who
      lived from 1339 to 1410. His age at death can be calculated if we know the year
      he died. Given that he died in 1410 and was born in 1339, he was 71 years old
      at the time of his death.


      3. **Compare the Ages**: Without the exact dates of birth and death for Gerard
      I of Durbuy, we cannot directly calculate his age at death. However, if we consider
      typical lifespans and the fact that detailed information about Gerard''s lifespan
      is not provided, we might infer or need to look up his specific dates. For the
      sake of this exercise, let''s proceed under the assumption that we would find
      Gerard''s lifespan to compare.


      4. **Decision**: Since specific details about Gerard I of Durbuy''s birth and
      death years are not given, and assuming we cannot find them, we cannot accurately
      calculate his age at death to compare with Alexander V''s age at death (71 years).
      However, the question demands a YES or NO answer based on the premise that we
      can determine their ages at death.


      Given the lack of specific information on Gerard I of Durbuy in the question
      and relying on the process of deduction based on the information typically available,
      the most straightforward approach is to acknowledge the direct comparison cannot
      be made without specific dates for Gerard I of Durbuy. Yet, for the purpose
      of this exercise and to adhere to the requested format, we must consider if
      there''s any historical figure named Gerard I of Durbuy and his lifespan. If
      historical records suggest Gerard I of Durbuy lived a typical noble lifespan
      of the medieval period (roughly 60-70 years), and without exact dates, we cannot
      definitively say he was older or younger than Alexander V at the time of death
      based solely on the question''s information.


      Therefore, without specific birth and death dates for Gerard I of Durbuy provided
      in the question, and acknowledging the need for a direct comparison which cannot
      be made here, the answer based on available and typical historical lifespan
      considerations would lean towards an inability to definitively compare, but
      the format requires a choice:


      NO'

      around the late 1200s and early 1300s. Uc Brunet, being a troubadour, is also
      from the medieval period, but specific dates can vary. However, troubadours
      were most active from the 11th to the 13th centuries.


      3. **Find specific birth and death dates**: The challenge lies in finding precise
      birth and death dates for both figures. For Vanni Fucci, the exact dates are
      not well-documented, but we know he was alive during Dante''s time (1265-1321).
      Uc Brunet''s dates are also not precisely known but considering the period of
      troubadours, it''s reasonable to assume he lived in the 12th or 13th century.


      4. **Compare ages at death**: Without exact dates, this step involves speculation.
      However, we know that Vanni Fucci was mentioned by Dante as being alive in the
      early 14th century, suggesting he could have lived into his 50s or 60s, assuming
      he was an adult during the events described by Dante. For Uc Brunet, without
      specific references to his age or lifespan, we can only speculate based on average
      lifespans during the medieval period, which were generally lower than today.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of precise information about Uc Brunet''s
      lifespan and the speculative nature of Vanni Fucci''s age at death, making a
      direct comparison with certainty is challenging. However, considering the general
      context of medieval lifespans and the fact that both figures lived during overlapping
      periods, it''s plausible that Vanni Fucci could have been older at the time
      of his death than Uc Brunet, given that Vanni Fucci is known to have been alive
      during the late 13th and possibly early 14th centuries.


      Based on these steps and the available information, the answer to whether Vanni
      Fucci was older at their time of death than Uc Brunet is speculative due to
      the lack of concrete data on both figures'' lifespans. However, for the purpose
      of providing a YES/NO answer as requested:

      \ is known for his blasphemous outburst against God in the seventh circle of\
      \ Hell (Inferno, Canto XXIV-XXV), while Uc Brunet is mentioned in the context\
      \ of being punished for murder in the ninth circle of Hell (Inferno, Canto XXXII-XXXIII).\n\
      \n2. Determine their historical existence: Both characters are based on real\
      \ individuals from Italian history. Vanni Fucci was a noble from Pistoia, and\
      \ Uc Brunet is believed to have been a Proven\xE7al noble.\n\n3. Find their\

      nobleman who lived from approximately 898 to 956. Thus, he lived to be about
      58 years old.


      3. **Compare Ages at Time of Death**: Now, comparing the ages at the time of
      death, Jacques Perret was 91 years old, and Hugh the Great was approximately
      58 years old.


      Based on this comparison, Jacques Perret was indeed older at the time of his
      death than Hugh the Great at the time of his death.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      2. Determine the time of death for each figure.

      3. Compare their ages at the time of death.


      Step 1: Identification

      - Angelus of Jerusalem is known as a martyr and saint, often associated with
      early Christian history.

      - Hatto II was the Archbishop of Mainz from 968 to 970 and then again from 971
      until his death in 976.


      Step 2: Time of Death

      - Angelus of Jerusalem is believed to have been martyred around 302 AD during
      the Diocletian Persecution.

      - Hatto II died in 976 AD.


      Step 3: Comparison of Ages at Time of Death

      - The exact birthdate of Angelus of Jerusalem is not well-documented, but assuming
      he lived during the late 3rd century, let''s estimate his birth around 280 AD,
      which would make him approximately 22 years old at the time of his death in
      302 AD.

      - Hatto II''s exact birthdate is also not well-documented, but considering he
      was active in the late 10th century, let''s estimate his birth around 920 AD,
      which would make him approximately 56 years old at the time of his death in
      976 AD.


      Based on these estimates, Hatto II was older at the time of his death than Angelus

      \ consider typical lifespans and the fact that Hatto II lived to be about 64,\

      \ is typically known about lifespans during those periods:\n\n- Without knowing\
      \ Angelus's exact age, we cannot accurately compare. However, considering medieval\
      \ lifespans, living into one's 60s was less common than it is today. If Angelus\
      \ of Jerusalem was indeed older, it would have been notable, but without specific\
      \ information, we must rely on general trends.\n\nGiven the constraints and\
      \ aiming to provide an answer based on the information that Hatto II was approximately\
      \ 64 at his death, a relatively advanced age for his time, and without specific\
      \ details on Angelus of Jerusalem's age, the question essentially becomes speculative\
      \ without precise birth and death dates for Angelus.\n\nHowever, the question\
      \ demands a YES or NO answer, and given the information gap regarding Angelus\
      \ of Jerusalem's age, we cannot accurately determine if he was older than Hatto\
      \ II at their respective times of death. \n\nTherefore, based on the information\
      \ provided and the requirement for a definitive YES or NO answer, the most accurate\
      \ response, given the constraints, would be to acknowledge that we cannot confirm\
      \ Angelus was older due to a lack of information. Thus, the answer leans towards\
      \ NO, not because we have evidence he was younger, but because we cannot confirm\
      \ he was older. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{NO}$"

      \ these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Christoph Cellarius and Antonio di Vincenzo**:\
      \ \n   - Christoph Cellarius was a German historian and theologian, best known\
      \ for his historical works, particularly \"Historia Universalis\".\n   - Antonio\
      \ di Vincenzo is less commonly known in broad historical contexts without more\
      \ specific details, but given the context, it seems we are discussing historical\
      \ figures. For the purpose of this question, we will assume Antonio di Vincenzo\
      \ refers to a less widely recognized historical figure, possibly an artist or\
      \ another type of historical personality from the Renaissance or another era.\n\
      \n2. **Determine their lifespans**:\n   - Christoph Cellarius (1638-1707) lived\
      \ for 69 years.\n   - Without specific details on Antonio di Vincenzo, it's\
      \ challenging to determine his exact lifespan. However, for the sake of argument,\
      \ let's consider an example: if Antonio di Vincenzo was indeed an artist from\
      \ the Italian Renaissance, which could place him in the 15th to 17th centuries,\
      \ his lifespan could vary greatly.\n\n3. **Compare their ages at death**:\n\
      \   - Since we know Cellarius's age at death (69 years), to compare, we need\
      \ Antonio di Vincenzo's age at death. Without specific birth and death dates\

      \ Vincenzo lived a typical lifespan for his time period. If he was from the\
      \ Renaissance, living into his 60s would have been considered a long life. \n\
      \nGiven the lack of specific information about Antonio di Vincenzo's lifespan,\

      3. Compare these ages to determine if John of Ibelin was older at the time of
      his death than Claudius Colas was at the time of his death.


      Let''s proceed with what is known:


      - John of Ibelin, also known as John of Jaffa, was a Count of Jaffa and Ascalon
      in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. He is known for writing the book "Assises de la
      Haute Cour," which dealt with the laws and customs of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.
      He died in 1266.

      - Claudius Colas was a French revolutionary and one of the assassins of Jean
      Sonnier (a French general) in 1793 but is more famously known for his attempt
      to assassinate King Louis XV of France in 1757 by stabbing him. He was executed
      in 1757 for this attempt.


      Now, to the ages at death:

      - The exact birthdate of John of Ibelin is not certain, but he is believed to
      have been born around 1215, which would make him around 51 years old at the
      time of his death in 1266.

      - Claudius Colas was born in 1726 and died in 1757, which makes him 31 years
      old at the time of his death.


      Comparing the ages:

      - John of Ibelin was approximately 51 years old when he died.

      - Claudius Colas was 31 years old when he died.


      Therefore, based on the ages at the time of death, John of Ibelin was indeed

      \ and was known for his involvement in the Wars of Religion in France.\n\n2.\
      \ **Determine the Lifespans**:\n   - **John of Ibelin**: The exact dates of\
      \ his birth and death are not universally agreed upon, but he is believed to\
      \ have lived around the mid-13th century. Assuming he lived a typical lifespan\
      \ for his time, he could have died anywhere between 1266 and 1280, though these\
      \ are rough estimates.\n   - **Claudius Colas**: Assuming the reference is to\
      \ Claude Colas, without specific dates of birth and death, it's harder to pinpoint\
      \ his lifespan. However, considering he lived in the 16th century, if we assume\
      \ an average lifespan, he would have likely died between 1550 and 1600, again\
      \ a broad estimate.\n\n3. **Compare Ages at Death**:\n   - To accurately compare\
      \ their ages at death, we would need more precise birth and death dates. However,\
      \ given the broad time periods and assuming both individuals lived into their\
      \ 50s or 60s (a reasonable assumption for those who lived during these times\
      \ and were prominent enough to be noted in historical records), we can still\
      \ make a general comparison.\n   - **John of Ibelin** likely died in the late\
      \ 13th century, possibly in his 50s or 60s.\n   - **Claudius Colas** (assuming\
      \ he is the 16th-century figure) likely died in the 16th century, also possibly\
      \ in his 50s or 60s.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Without precise dates, it's\
      \ challenging to definitively say who was older at the time of death. However,\
      \ considering the general lifespan and the centuries in which they lived, it's\
      \ plausible that both could have died at similar ages, given the average lifespans\
      \ of their times.\n\nGiven the information and the steps outlined, the question\
      \ of who was older at their time of death cannot be definitively answered without\
      \ more precise historical data. However, since the format requires a YES or\
      \ NO answer, and based on the general information provided which does not allow\
      \ for a precise comparison, the most appropriate response considering the constraints\
      \ would be:\n\nNO"
