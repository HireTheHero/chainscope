    f0d697a9-a957-43f9-9a9b-ab8df733352f: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the ages of Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis and Richard Edwardes at the time
      of their deaths.


      1. **Identify Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis**: Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis
      (1698-1759) was a French mathematician, philosopher, and man of letters. He
      was born in 1698 and died in 1759.


      2. **Calculate Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis'' age at death**: To find his
      age at death, subtract his birth year from his death year: 1759 - 1698 = 61
      years.


      3. **Identify Richard Edwardes**: Richard Edwardes (1523-1566) was an English
      poet, playwright, and composer. He was born in 1523 and died in 1566.


      4. **Calculate Richard Edwardes'' age at death**: To find his age at death,
      subtract his birth year from his death year: 1566 - 1523 = 43 years.


      5. **Comparison**: Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis was 61 years old at the
      time of his death, while Richard Edwardes was 43 years old at the time of his
      death.


      Since 61 is greater than 43, Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis was indeed older
      at the time of his death than Richard Edwardes at the time of his death.


      The final answer is: **YES**'

      the ages of Yolanda of Flanders and Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr at the time of their
      deaths. Here are the steps to follow:


      1. **Identify Yolanda of Flanders**: Yolanda of Flanders, also known as Yolande
      of Flanders, was a medieval noblewoman. She was born in 1175 and died in 1219.


      2. **Calculate Yolanda''s age at death**: To find her age at death, we subtract
      her birth year from her death year: 1219 - 1175 = 44 years old.


      3. **Identify Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr**: Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was a companion
      of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the son of Abu Bakr, the first Caliph. He
      was born in 631 and died in 658.


      4. **Calculate Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr''s age at death**: To find his age at death,
      we subtract his birth year from his death year: 658 - 631 = 27 years old.


      5. **Compare their ages at death**: Yolanda of Flanders was 44 years old when
      she died, while Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was 27 years old when he died.

      death, subtract his birth year from his death year: 1792 - 1734 = 58 years.


      5. **Compare their ages at death**: Bernard of Vienne was 64 years old at the
      time of his death, while Karl Josef von Bachmann was 58 years old.


      The answer is: **NO**'
    8a8f00f9-19b0-4494-885c-5e7c68bbfdc1: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the ages of Bernard of Vienne and Karl Josef von Bachmann at their time of death.


      1. **Identify Bernard of Vienne**: Bernard of Vienne was a French saint and
      archbishop who lived during the 10th century. Unfortunately, his exact birth
      and death dates are not well-documented.


      2. **Determine Bernard of Vienne''s age at death**: Since we don''t have precise
      information about his birth and death dates, we cannot accurately calculate
      his age at the time of death. However, we can estimate his age based on historical
      records and the known lifespan of people during that period.


      3. **Estimate Bernard of Vienne''s age at death**: Considering the 10th century
      and the average lifespan of people during that time, Bernard of Vienne was likely
      between 60 and 80 years old at the time of his death.


      4. **Identify Karl Josef von Bachmann**: Karl Josef von Bachmann was a Swiss
      politician and military officer who lived from 1734 to 1792.


      5. **Calculate Karl Josef von Bachmann''s age at death**: To find his age at
      death, we subtract his birth year (1734) from his death year (1792), resulting
      in an age of 58 years.


      6. **Compare their ages at death**: Based on the estimated age range for Bernard
      of Vienne (60-80 years) and the calculated age for Karl Josef von Bachmann (58
      years), we can conclude that Bernard of Vienne was likely older at the time
      of his death than Karl Josef von Bachmann.

      Here are the steps:


      1. **Identify Petrus Armengol**: Petrus Armengol was a Catalan Dominican friar
      and missionary who lived in the 13th century. He was born in 1238 and died in
      1304.


      2. **Calculate Petrus Armengol''s age at death**: To find his age at death,

      66 years.


      3. **Identify Alonso de Ojeda**: Alonso de Ojeda was a Spanish conquistador
      and explorer who lived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. He was born
      in 1466 and died in 1515.


      4. **Calculate Alonso de Ojeda''s age at death**: To find his age at death,
      we subtract his birth year (1466) from his death year (1515), which gives us
      49 years.


      5. **Compare their ages at death**: Since Petrus Armengol was 66 years old at

      the ages of Vanni Fucci and Uc Brunet at the time of their deaths. Here are
      the steps:


      1. **Identify Vanni Fucci**: Vanni Fucci was an Italian political figure and
      outlaw who lived during the 13th century. He was born around 1243 and died in
      1295.


      2. **Calculate Vanni Fucci''s age at death**: To find his age at death, we subtract
      his birth year (1243) from his death year (1295). This gives us an age of 52
      years at the time of his death.


      3. **Identify Uc Brunet**: Uc Brunet was a troubadour (a poet and composer)
      from Occitania, who lived during the 12th and 13th centuries. He was born around
      1170 and died in 1228.


      4. **Calculate Uc Brunet''s age at death**: We subtract his birth year (1170)
      from his death year (1228). This gives us an age of 58 years at the time of

      4. **Calculate Jacopo Zucchi''s age at death**: To find his age at death, subtract
      his birth year from his death year: 1596 - 1540 = 56 years.


      5. **Compare their ages at death**: James K. Gibson was 67 years old when he
      died, while Jacopo Zucchi was 56 years old when he died.


      Given these calculations, we can conclude that James K. Gibson was older at

      the ages of Angelus of Jerusalem and Hatto II at their time of death. Here are
      the steps:


      1. **Identify Angelus of Jerusalem**: Angelus of Jerusalem was a 13th-century
      friar who was killed by Saracens in 1220. He is also known as Angelus of Jerusalem
      the Younger to distinguish him from another Angelus of Jerusalem who lived in
      the 12th century.


      2. **Determine the age of Angelus of Jerusalem at death**: Since Angelus of
      Jerusalem died in 1220, and he was a friar in the 13th century, we can assume
      that he was born in the late 12th or early 13th century. Let''s estimate his
      age at death to be around 40 years old.


      3. **Identify Hatto II**: Hatto II was a bishop of Mainz in the 9th century.
      He was born around 850 and died in 913.


      4. **Determine the age of Hatto II at death**: Since Hatto II was born around
      850 and died in 913, we can calculate his age at death to be 63 years old.


      5. **Compare their ages at death**: Angelus of Jerusalem was around 40 years
      old when he died, while Hatto II was 63 years old when he died.


      Based on these steps, we can conclude that Hatto II was older at the time of
      death than Angelus of Jerusalem.

      1. **Identify Zhang Zhao**: Zhang Zhao (156-236 AD) was a Chinese politician
      and strategist during the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period.


      2. **Calculate Zhang Zhao''s age at death**: Zhang Zhao was born in 156 AD and

      (1267-1329 AD), also known as Henry the Lion, was a German nobleman and member
      of the House of Mecklenburg.


      4. **Calculate Henry II''s age at death**: Henry II was born in 1267 AD and
      died in 1329 AD. To find his age at death, we subtract his birth year from his

      the ages of John of Ibelin and Claudius Colas at the time of their deaths. Let''s
      break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify John of Ibelin**: John of Ibelin (1179-1236) was a Count of Jaffa
      and Ascalon, and a prominent member of the Kingdom of Jerusalem during the Crusades.


      2. **Calculate John of Ibelin''s age at death**: To find his age at death, subtract
      his birth year from his death year: 1236 - 1179 = 57 years.


      3. **Identify Claudius Colas**: Claudius Colas (c. 1550-1616) was a French mathematician
      and astronomer.


      4. **Calculate Claudius Colas'' age at death**: To find his age at death, subtract
      his birth year from his death year: 1616 - 1550 = 66 years.


      5. **Compare their ages at death**: John of Ibelin was 57 years old at the time
      of his death, while Claudius Colas was 66 years old.


      6. **Conclusion**: Since 57 is less than 66, John of Ibelin was not older at
      the time of his death than Claudius Colas at his time of death.
