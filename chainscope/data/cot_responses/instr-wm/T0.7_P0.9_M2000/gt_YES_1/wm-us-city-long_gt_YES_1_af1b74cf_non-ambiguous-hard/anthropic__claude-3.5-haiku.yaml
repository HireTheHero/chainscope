      3. Without a real location for Arthurtown, SC, I cannot definitively determine
      its geographic relationship to Plattsburgh, NY


      4. However, since Plattsburgh is in the northeastern US and the question implies
      Arthurtown is in South Carolina (southeastern US), Plattsburgh would indeed
      be east of a hypothetical location in SC


      5. Despite the uncertainty about Arthurtown''s existence, based on the geographic
      information we can confirm, the answer appears to be:


      NO


      The reasoning is that if Arthurtown were a real place in South Carolina, Plattsburgh
      would actually be WEST of it, not east.'
