      - Meridian Street serves as the east-west dividing line of Indianapolis


      4) Comparing their locations:

      - Christ Church Cathedral is slightly east of Meridian Street

      - Second Presbyterian Church is on Meridian Street itself

      - Therefore, Christ Church Cathedral is indeed east of Second Presbyterian Church

      is on Madison Avenue, the John Golden Theatre must be west of One Madison, not
      east.

      - St. James Cathedral is located at 215 N Orange Ave, Orlando

      - Orange County Courthouse is located at 425 N Orange Ave, Orlando


      2. Since both buildings are on Orange Avenue:

      - St. James Cathedral is at 215 N (lower number)

      - Courthouse is at 425 N (higher number)


      3. On Orange Avenue in Orlando:

      - Numbers increase going north

      - Both buildings are on the same street

      - Being on the same street means east/west positioning is the same


      4. Therefore, they are aligned on the same north-south street (Orange Ave),
      not positioned east or west of each other.


      NO (they are not east/west of each other, but rather north/south of each other

      - St. James Cathedral is located at 215 N Orange Ave, Orlando

      - Orange County Courthouse is located at 425 N Orange Ave, Orlando


      2) Both buildings are on North Orange Avenue, so we can directly compare their

      - St. James Cathedral: 215 N Orange Ave

      - Orange County Courthouse: 425 N Orange Ave


      3) On North Orange Avenue in Orlando, numbers increase as you go north

      - Therefore, 425 is further north than 215

      - The buildings are essentially on the same street (same longitude)


      4) Since they''re on the same street and not offset east/west from each other
      significantly, we can determine that they are roughly on the same east/west
      plane.

      3) Therefore:

      - Since Detroit (where Triumph Church is) is primarily north and only slightly
      east of Toledo (where Rosary Cathedral is), Triumph Church would be primarily
      north and only slightly east of Rosary Cathedral.


      YES - Triumph Church, MI is located east (though also significantly north) of

    9462e6c3-582f-46ad-a7e7-2ed6dc6e7ddd: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let''s locate Camanche Reservoir, CA

      - Camanche Reservoir is in California

      - It''s located in the Sierra Nevada foothills

      - It''s in Northern California, east of Stockton


      2) Next, let''s locate Charles E. Nelson House, OR

      - This is in Oregon

      - Oregon is entirely north of California


      3) Now, let''s think about east-west positioning

      - Oregon is along the same general longitude range as California

      - Both states are on the west coast of the US

      - Generally, locations in California and Oregon are at similar longitudes


      4) Looking more specifically

      - Camanche Reservoir is in the Sierra foothills, somewhat inland from the coast

      - Most historic houses in Oregon tend to be in the western portion of the state
      near population centers


      Therefore, given that Camanche Reservoir is relatively far inland in California,
      and the Charles E. Nelson House is likely in western Oregon, Camanche Reservoir
      is probably east of the Charles E. Nelson House.

      - Most Holy Trinity Church is in Mamaroneck, NY, which is on the Long Island
      Sound


      2) Looking at a map:

      - Mamaroneck is in eastern Westchester County, near the coast

      - Glenwood is in western Westchester County, on the Hudson River

      - Places on the Hudson River (like Glenwood) are generally west of places on

    a82fce99-f50b-4352-bce7-2d2a64c8502c: "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1) First,\
      \ let's locate both places:\n- Lac qui Parle is in western Minnesota\n- First\
      \ Presbyterian Church is in Tulsa, Oklahoma\n\n2) Looking at a US map:\n- Minnesota\
      \ is north of Oklahoma\n- More importantly for this question, Minnesota is west\
      \ of Oklahoma\n- Specifically, Tulsa, OK is at approximately 96\xB0W longitude\n\
      - Lac qui Parle, MN is at approximately 96.2\xB0W longitude\n\n3) Since a larger\
      \ number of degrees West means further west, and 96.2\xB0W is further west than\
      \ 96\xB0W, Lac qui Parle is located WEST of First Presbyterian Church in Tulsa.\n\
      \n4) The question asks if it's located EAST, which is the opposite of what we\
      \ found.\n\nNO"

      W longitude\n- Tulsa, OK is at approximately 96\xB0W longitude\n\n3) When comparing\
      \ longitudes in the Western Hemisphere (where both locations are):\n- The more\
