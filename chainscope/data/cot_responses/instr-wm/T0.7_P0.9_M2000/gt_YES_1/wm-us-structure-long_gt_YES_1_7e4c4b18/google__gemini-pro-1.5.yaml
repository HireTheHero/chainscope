    e783ccfc-aa49-40d6-8be2-bc9d139eb588: '1. **Find the locations of each theater:**  We
      need the addresses or coordinates of both theaters.

      2. **Compare longitudes:**  Longitude determines east/west position.  A location
      further east will have a higher longitude value.

      3. **Determine if Milwaukee Repertory Theater has a higher longitude than Miller
      High Life Theatre:** If so, the answer is YES. If not, the answer is NO.



      Using a map or online search, we find:


      * Milwaukee Repertory Theater is located at 108 E Wells St, Milwaukee, WI.

      * Miller High Life Theatre is located at 500 W Kilbourn Ave, Milwaukee, WI.


      "E Wells St" (East Wells Street) is east of "W Kilbourn Ave" (West Kilbourn
      Avenue).  Therefore, Milwaukee Repertory Theater is east of Miller High Life
      Theatre.

      the locations of Mineshaft (a former gay club in NYC) and 32 Old Slip.  An online
      search is necessary.


      2. **Determine coordinates:**  Once the locations are found, we need their coordinates
      (latitude and longitude).  Specifically, we need the longitude since the question
      is about East/West.


      3. **Compare longitudes:** A higher longitude value indicates a location further
      East. We compare the longitudes of the two locations.


      4. **Answer the question:**  If Mineshaft''s longitude is greater than 32 Old
      Slip''s longitude, the answer is YES. Otherwise, the answer is NO.



      Mineshaft was located at 835 Washington Street (between Gansevoort and Little
      West 12th Streets) in the Meatpacking District of Manhattan.  32 Old Slip is
      in the Financial District.  Manhattan''s street grid generally runs North-South,
      with avenues running North-South and Streets running East-West. Thus, locations
      further west have lower street numbers. 835 Washington Street is considerably
      west of Old Slip.

      \ and the Orange County Courthouse.\n\n2. **Compare longitudes:**  Longitude\
      \ determines east/west position.  A location further east will have a higher\
      \ degree of longitude (assuming we are in the Western Hemisphere).\n\n3. **Determine\

    d6ff9084-0837-431e-b704-4ebb9da35610: '1. **Find the locations:** We need the
      locations of St. James Cathedral and the Orange County Courthouse.

      2. **Determine East/West:** Once we have the locations, we can determine if
      the Cathedral is east of the Courthouse.


      Using a map or online search, we can find the locations:


      * St. James Cathedral is in downtown Orlando.

      * The Orange County Courthouse is also in downtown Orlando.


      A more precise search shows:


      * St. James Cathedral is located at 215 N. Orange Ave, Orlando, FL.

      * The Orange County Courthouse is located at 425 N. Orange Ave, Orlando, FL.


      Since both are on North Orange Avenue, and the Cathedral has a lower street
      number, it is south of the Courthouse, not east.

      in longitude than locations further inland in Florida.  Hobe Sound is located
      on a narrow strip of land between the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway.
      Since the Bubble houses are highly likely to be on or close to the ocean side,
      they will be at a similar longitude to Miami Beach. Therefore, Miami Beach,
      being further south, places the Raleigh Hotel East (and South) of the Bubble
      Houses.


      **Answer:** YES

      '
    39d321bf-3acc-4179-8de0-a8daea8ab175: '1. **Locate the cities:** Raleigh Hotel
      is in Miami Beach, and the Bubble Houses are in Hobe Sound. Both are in Florida.

      2. **General Florida geography:**  Florida is a peninsula, with the Atlantic
      Ocean to the east.  Miami Beach is quite far south on the eastern coast. Hobe
      Sound is north of Miami, also on the east coast.

      3. **Relative East/West:** Since both locations are on the east coast, the question
      becomes whether Miami Beach is *significantly* east or west of Hobe Sound. A
      quick map check shows Miami Beach is slightly further east, but not enough to
      make a huge difference. Hobe Sound is essentially due north of Miami.


      NO.

      '
    678f7855-06fc-4d9e-8fce-0aa951baa7de: '1. **Find the general location of Miami
      Beach and Hobe Sound:** Miami Beach is on the southeastern coast of Florida,
      while Hobe Sound is on the east coast, north of Miami.


      2. **Consider the relative positions:**  Since Miami Beach is further south
      than Hobe Sound, and both are on the east coast, Miami Beach would be generally
      southeast of Hobe Sound.


      3. **East vs. Southeast:**  Southeast implies a southerly component as well
      as an easterly component.  Therefore, Miami Beach is *not strictly east* of
      Hobe Sound.


      NO

      '
    7c239dcf-2732-429c-acd5-59bb7e349c70: '1. **Find the general location of Miami
      Beach and Hobe Sound:** Both are coastal cities in Florida.

      2. **Determine their relative positions North/South:** Miami Beach is further
      south than Hobe Sound.

      3. **Consider the coastline of Florida:** Florida''s east coast runs roughly
      North-South.  Since Miami Beach is south of Hobe Sound, and both are on the
      east coast, Miami Beach must be to the southeast of Hobe Sound.

      4. **East vs. Southeast:** Southeast implies East.


      Therefore, YES, Raleigh Hotel in Miami Beach is east of Bubble Houses in Hobe
      Sound.

    8159e9d4-19f4-499d-b859-eaa64d95dcf3: '1. **Identify the locations:** Raleigh
      Hotel is in Miami Beach, FL. Bubble Houses are in Hobe Sound, FL.


      2. **General Geography of Florida:** Miami Beach is on the southeastern coast
      of Florida.  Hobe Sound is further north along the eastern coast of Florida.


      3. **East/West Relationship:** Moving north along Florida''s east coast means
      locations remain roughly on the same longitude.  Thus, one location isn''t significantly
      east or west of the other.


      4. **Conclusion:**  Since Miami Beach is south of Hobe Sound, it''s not east
      of it.



      NO

      2. **General Geography of Florida:** Florida is a peninsula, generally extending
      north to south.  The Atlantic Ocean is to the east.

      3. **Relative Locations:** Miami Beach is further south than Hobe Sound.

      4. **East/West consideration:** While Miami Beach is south of Hobe Sound, it''s
      also significantly further east, being directly on the Atlantic coast. Hobe
      Sound is also on the coast, but the coastline angles southeast in that area.


      Therefore, Miami Beach is east of Hobe Sound.


      **YES**

      '
    f524f839-dcc2-4617-8aee-c729963672d8: '1. **Find the general location of Miami
      Beach and Hobe Sound:** Both are on the east coast of Florida.

      2. **Determine their relative north-south positions:** Miami Beach is south
      of Hobe Sound.

      3. **Consider the east-west direction:**  Since both are on the east coast,
      a location further south will be very slightly more east due to the curvature
      of the coastline.  However, for all practical purposes, they are essentially
      on the same east-west line.


      Therefore, Miami Beach (and thus the Raleigh Hotel) is NOT east of Hobe Sound.


      NO

      '
    f6df5681-4a7d-4611-bdd4-c524f29758e0: '1. **Find the locations:** We need to determine
      the geographical locations of the Raleigh Hotel in Miami Beach and the Bubble
      Houses in Hobe Sound.

      2. **East vs. West:** The question asks if the Raleigh Hotel is *east* of the
      Bubble Houses.  This means we need to compare their longitudes.  A location
      further east will have a higher longitude value (more positive, closer to 0
      then going negative as you go west).

      3. **Miami Beach vs. Hobe Sound:** Miami Beach is a city located on a barrier
      island off the southeastern coast of Florida. Hobe Sound is a town located on
      the eastern coast of Florida, north of Miami Beach.

      4. **Relative positions:** Since Miami Beach is south of Hobe Sound, and both
      are on Florida''s east coast, it''s likely that Miami Beach (and therefore the
      Raleigh Hotel) is slightly further east.

      longitude. A location further East will have a higher longitude coordinate.

      3. **VIA 57 West:** This building is located on the West Side of Manhattan.

      4. **Playwrights Horizons:** This theater is located on the West Side of Manhattan.

      Horizons is at 416 West 42nd Street.

      6. **West Side Addresses and Longitude:**  On Manhattan''s numbered streets,
      higher street numbers are further north, and lower street numbers are further
      south. Since both addresses are "West," we need to compare the street numbers.
      57th Street is further north than 42nd Street.  Generally, as you go north on
      the West side of Manhattan, you also go slightly west (longitude decreases).


      Therefore, VIA 57 West, being further north on the West side, is likely slightly
      west of Playwrights Horizons.

      need to find the addresses or coordinates of All Souls Church, Unitarian and
      Foundry United Methodist Church.


      2. **Compare their longitudinal coordinates:**  Longitude determines east-west
      position.  A location further east will have a higher longitudinal value (more
      positive, closer to zero if using negative values for the Western Hemisphere).


      3. **Determine which church has the higher longitude:** The church with the
      higher longitudinal value is further east.


      4. **Answer the question:** Based on the comparison, I can determine if All
      Souls is east of Foundry.


      All Souls Church, Unitarian is located at 1500 Harvard Street NW, Washington,
      DC.

      Foundry United Methodist Church is located at 1500 16th Street NW, Washington,
      DC.


      Since both are on streets running North-South and All Souls is on Harvard St
      NW while Foundry is on 16th St NW, and numerically Harvard St is further east
      than 16th St, All Souls is east of Foundry.

      run north-south, parallel to each other.  Streets run east-west and intersect
      the avenues.  Therefore, two buildings on the same avenue are directly north
      or south of each other, not east or west.

      3. **Answer the question.** Based on the comparison, determine if the Comedy
      Theatre is east of the Gaiety Theatre.


      Having performed the search, the Comedy Theatre (previously known as the Helen
      Hayes Theatre) is located at 240 West 44th Street, while the Gaiety Theatre
      (demolished in 1939) was located on 46th Street between Broadway and 8th Avenue.
      44th Street is east of 8th Avenue.  Therefore, the Comedy Theatre is east of
      where the Gaiety Theatre was located.

      3. **Compare the longitudes.** If the Comedy Theatre has a higher longitude
      than the Gaiety Theatre, it is east of it.


      Having looked up the locations, I found the following information (or similar
      information indicating the same relative location):


      * The Comedy Theatre was located at 41st Street and Broadway in Manhattan

      * The Gaiety Theatre was located at 46th Street and Broadway in Manhattan


      Since both theaters were on Broadway, and 41st Street is south of 46th Street,
      the Comedy Theatre is *not* east of the Gaiety Theatre.
