      east of St. Paul''s Catholic Church in San Francisco, we can follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the location of St. Paul''s Catholic Church in San Francisco**:
      St. Paul''s Catholic Church is located in the Noe Valley neighborhood of San
      Francisco. For reference, San Francisco is on the west coast of the United States.


      2. **Identify the location of San Andreas Lake**: San Andreas Lake is a reservoir
      located in San Mateo County, California. It is part of the San Francisco Peninsula
      and lies to the south of the city of San Francisco.

    7aee7a25-7409-468d-86a9-1512e7c0ff16: 'To answer this question, let''s go through
      the reasoning step by step:


      1. **Location of Terrapin Crossroads, CA**: Terrapin Crossroads was a music
      venue located in San Rafael, California. San Rafael is in Marin County, which
      is in Northern California.


      2. **Location of Lake Steilacoom, WA**: Lake Steilacoom is located in Pierce
      County, Washington, which is in the western part of the state.


      3. **Geographical Orientation**: To determine if Terrapin Crossroads is east
      of Lake Steilacoom, we need to compare their longitudinal positions. Generally,
      California is south of Washington, and the western coast of the United States
      runs north-south.


      4. **Relative Positions**: San Rafael, CA, is located to the south and west
      of Lake Steilacoom, WA. Since San Rafael is further west along the coast compared
      to Lake Steilacoom, it means that Terrapin Crossroads is west of Lake Steilacoom.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is: **NO**. Terrapin Crossroads, CA, is
      not located east of Lake Steilacoom, WA.'

      - St. James Cathedral is located at 65 E. Huron Street, Chicago, IL.

      - Both addresses are in the eastern part of Chicago, and each has an "E" before
      the street name, indicating they are both east of the Chicago River.

      - Wacker Drive runs along the river, while Huron Street is further north.


      **Step 3: Compare East-West Position**

      - The numerical part of the address (55 vs. 65) helps determine which is further
      east. In Chicago''s grid system, higher numbers indicate further east locations.

      - Since 65 is higher than 55, St. James Cathedral at 65 E. Huron Street is further

    423a79e2-ca62-491a-b833-0e408dfb046e: 'To determine whether VIA 57 West is located
      east of Playwrights Horizons, we need to consider their respective locations
      in Manhattan, New York City.


      1. VIA 57 West is located at 625 West 57th Street in the Hell''s Kitchen neighborhood
      of Manhattan. This places it on the west side of Manhattan.


      2. Playwrights Horizons is located at 416 West 42nd Street, also in the Hell''s
      Kitchen neighborhood.


      Now, let''s compare the two addresses based on Manhattan''s street grid:


      - VIA 57 West is on West 57th Street.

      - Playwrights Horizons is on West 42nd Street.


      In Manhattan, the numbered streets increase as you move north. Therefore, West
      57th Street is north of West 42nd Street. However, the question asks about east
      and west orientation:


      - The "West" in their addresses indicates they are both on the west side of
      Manhattan.

      - The street numbers (625 and 416) denote how far west they are from the east
      side. A higher number (625) means VIA 57 West is further west than Playwrights
      Horizons.


      Based on the addresses, VIA 57 West (625 West 57th Street) is located further
      west compared to Playwrights Horizons (416 West 42nd Street).


      Therefore, the answer is: NO, VIA 57 West is not located east of Playwrights

      3. **Comparison**: Both addresses are on the west side of Manhattan, but they
      are on different streets. VIA 57 West is on 57th Street, and Playwrights Horizons
      is on 42nd Street. The street numbers increase as you go north in Manhattan,
      so 57th Street is north of 42nd Street.


      4. **East vs. West**: In Manhattan, avenues run north to south, and streets
      run east to west. Since we''re comparing two locations on different numbered
      streets (east-west direction), we need to consider their positions relative
      to avenues to determine which one is east or west. Given the street numbers
      alone, we can''t directly determine east or west without additional avenue information,
      but generally, higher numbered streets are not used to indicate east or west
      between two locations.


      Since both locations are on the west side and given their positions, we need
      to see if they are on the same avenue or if additional address information indicates
      a specific east-west relation. However, based on the typical layout and the
      addresses provided:


      - VIA 57 West is located on the far west side of Manhattan, near the Hudson
      River.

      - Playwrights Horizons is located further east compared to VIA 57 West, as it
      is closer to the more central areas of Manhattan.

      All Souls Church, Unitarian and Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington,
      D.C., we need to look at their addresses and geographical positions.


      1. **All Souls Church, Unitarian** is located at 1500 Harvard St NW, Washington,
      D.C.

      2. **Foundry United Methodist Church** is located at 1500 16th St NW, Washington,
      D.C.


      Next, we should consider the layout of Washington, D.C. streets:


      - The term "NW" indicates the Northwest quadrant of the city.

      - The numbering of streets in D.C. increases as you move east or west from the
      center of the city.


      Now, let''s analyze the relative positions based on the street numbers:


      - All Souls Church is on Harvard St NW, which runs roughly east-west.

      - Foundry United Methodist Church is on 16th St NW, which runs north-south.


      Since 16th St NW is a numbered street and Harvard St NW is not, we focus on
      the numbering:


      - 16th St NW is a major north-south street, and the numbering of streets generally
      increases as you move east from it.

      - Because All Souls Church is located at a higher number street (Harvard St
      NW) than Foundry United Methodist Church (16th St NW), and Harvard St NW is
      located further west than 16th St NW, All Souls Church, Unitarian is actually
      located west of Foundry United Methodist Church.


      Thus, the answer is NO, All Souls Church, Unitarian is not located east of Foundry
      United Methodist Church.'

      \ located east of the former site of the Drake Hotel in New York City, let's\

      \ Avenue is located between 55th and 56th Streets in Midtown Manhattan, New\
      \ York City. \n\n2. **Location of the Drake Hotel**: \n   - The Drake Hotel\
      \ was located at the corner of Park Avenue and 56th Street. Its address was\
      \ 440 Park Avenue, which is just a block south of 425 Park Avenue.\n\n3. **Orientation\
      \ and Positioning**:\n   - Both addresses are on Park Avenue, which runs north-south.\n\
      \   - In Manhattan, the streets are generally numbered sequentially as you move\
      \ east or west, but Park Avenue is a north-south street, so the concept of \"\
      east\" or \"west\" pertains more to avenues rather than streets.\n\n4. **Comparing\
      \ the Addresses**:\n   - Since both 425 Park Avenue and the former Drake Hotel\
      \ site at 440 Park Avenue are on the same street (Park Avenue), they are aligned\
      \ north-south relative to each other and are not east or west of each other.\n\

      3. **Comparing the locations**: Since both 425 Park Avenue and the site of the

      is less relevant. However, in terms of street numbers and relative position,
      425 Park Avenue is directly adjacent but slightly south of where the Drake Hotel

      the relative geographic locations of the two theaters in Minneapolis, Minnesota.


      1. The Guthrie Theater is located at 818 South 2nd Street, Minneapolis, MN.

      2. In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre is located at 1500 East
      Lake Street, Minneapolis, MN.


      Next, we consider the general layout of Minneapolis:

      - Streets labeled "East" in Minneapolis are typically east of the Mississippi
      River, which runs through the city.

      - South 2nd Street is closer to downtown Minneapolis and generally west of areas
      labeled with "East."


      Now, comparing the two addresses:

      - The Guthrie Theater is located closer to the downtown area, which is on the
      west side of the Mississippi River.

      - In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre is on East Lake Street,
      which is east of the downtown area and east of the Mississippi River.


      Therefore, In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre is located east
      of the Guthrie Theater.
