      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Pine
      Flat Dam in California (CA) and St. Mary''s in the Mountains Catholic Church
      in Nevada (NV).


      2. **Geographical Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographical
      relationship between these two locations, specifically whether Pine Flat Dam
      is east of St. Mary''s in the Mountains Catholic Church.


      3. **State Positions**: California and Nevada are neighboring states. California
      is generally west of Nevada, especially in their southern regions where these
      locations are situated.


      4. **Specific Locations**: Pine Flat Dam is located in the southern part of
      California, in the Sierra Nevada foothills. St. Mary''s in the Mountains Catholic
      Church is in the northeastern part of Nevada, in the town of Virginia City.


      5. **Relative Positions**: Given that California is west of Nevada and considering
      the specific locations of these landmarks, it is highly likely that Pine Flat
      Dam is west of St. Mary''s in the Mountains Catholic Church, rather than east.

    ac24385a-0580-4c59-8cc5-d649aa4d105a: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Rampart
      Reservoir and the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception in Colorado
      (CO). Rampart Reservoir is located in the Rampart Range, near Colorado Springs,
      CO. The Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception is located in Denver,
      CO.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two locations, specifically whether Rampart Reservoir
      is east of the Cathedral Basilica.


      3. **Reference Points**: Knowing that both are in Colorado, we can use the state''s
      geography or known reference points to estimate their relative positions. Colorado
      Springs and Denver are major cities in Colorado. Colorado Springs is generally
      south of Denver, and Rampart Reservoir is near Colorado Springs.


      4. **North-South Alignment**: Given that Rampart Reservoir is near Colorado
      Springs, which is south of Denver, it''s unlikely that the reservoir is east
      of the cathedral in Denver. It''s more likely that the reservoir is west or
      southwest of the cathedral, considering the general north-south alignment of
      the cities in Colorado.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of Colorado and the relative
      positions of Colorado Springs and Denver, it is reasonable to deduce that Rampart
      Reservoir is likely west or southwest of the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate
      Conception in Denver rather than east. This deduction relies on the typical
      layout of the cities and the known positions of these landmarks within Colorado.


      Given these steps and the general understanding of Colorado''s geography, the
      answer to whether Rampart Reservoir is located east of the Cathedral Basilica
      of the Immaculate Conception is: **NO**'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Rampart
      Reservoir and the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception in Colorado
      (CO). Rampart Reservoir is a reservoir located near Woodland Park, CO. The Cathedral
      Basilica of the Immaculate Conception is situated in Denver, CO.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two locations, specifically whether Rampart Reservoir
      is east of the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception.


      3. **Reference Points**: Knowing that both are in Colorado, we can use the state''s
      geography or known reference points to estimate their relative positions. Denver,
      where the Cathedral Basilica is located, is generally in the central part of
      Colorado, while Woodland Park, near Rampart Reservoir, is more to the west.


      4. **East-West Alignment**: Given the general layout of Colorado and the relative
      positions of Denver and Woodland Park, areas to the west of Denver are more
      likely to be west or southwest of locations within Denver.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of Colorado and the relative
      positions of Denver and Woodland Park, it is reasonable to deduce that Rampart
      Reservoir is likely west or southwest of the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate
      Conception rather than east. This deduction relies on the typical layout of
      the state and the known positions of these landmarks within Colorado.


      Given these steps and the general understanding of Colorado''s geography, the
      answer to whether Rampart Reservoir is located east of the Cathedral Basilica
      of the Immaculate Conception is: **NO**'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Rampart
      Reservoir and the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception in Colorado.
      Rampart Reservoir is located in the Rampart Range of the Rocky Mountains, west
      of Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception
      is situated in Denver, Colorado.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two locations, specifically whether Rampart Reservoir
      is east of the Cathedral Basilica.


      3. **Geographic Context**: Colorado is a state in the western United States,
      known for its mountainous terrain, particularly the Rocky Mountains. The Rocky
      Mountains generally run north to south through the state.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Given that Rampart Reservoir is in the Rampart Range,
      which is part of the Rocky Mountains, and the Cathedral Basilica is in Denver,
      we can deduce that Rampart Reservoir is to the west of Denver, considering the
      general east-west orientation of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographic context and the relative positions
      of the Rocky Mountains and Denver, it is reasonable to conclude that Rampart
      Reservoir is west of the Cathedral Basilica, not east. This is because the Rocky
      Mountains are generally to the west of Denver, and Rampart Reservoir is located
      within these mountains.


      Given these steps and the understanding of Colorado''s geography, the answer
      to whether Rampart Reservoir is located east of the Cathedral Basilica of the
      Immaculate Conception is: **NO**'

      \ (where Point Beach is located), but since both are on the western shore of\
      \ Lake Michigan, we must consider their east-west alignment as well as their\
      \ north-south positioning.\n\n4. **East-West Alignment**: Given that both plants\
      \ are on the western shore of Lake Michigan, the question essentially asks if\
      \ Kewaunee is eastward relative to Point Beach. Since we're comparing locations\
      \ on the same side of the lake (the west side), we look at their longitudinal\
      \ positions (east-west positioning). \n\n5. **Longitudinal Comparison**: Point\
      \ Beach Nuclear Plant is at approximately 87.7\xB0 W longitude, and Kewaunee\
      \ Power Station is at about 87.6\xB0 W longitude. This means Kewaunee is slightly\
      \ east of Point Beach in terms of longitude.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis,\
      \ the answer to whether Kewaunee Power Station, WI is located east of Point\
      \ Beach Nuclear Plant, WI is: **YES**"

      Lake and St. Paul''s Catholic Church. San Andreas Lake is a reservoir in San
      Mateo County, California, while St. Paul''s Catholic Church is located in San
      Francisco, California.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two locations, specifically whether San Andreas Lake
      is east of St. Paul''s Catholic Church.


      3. **Reference Points**: Knowing that San Andreas Lake is in San Mateo County
      and St. Paul''s Catholic Church is in San Francisco, we can use these locations
      as reference points. San Francisco is a coastal city on the western edge of
      California, while San Mateo County is located just south of San Francisco.


      4. **General Direction**: Given the relative positions of San Mateo County and
      San Francisco, San Andreas Lake is likely to be south or southeast of St. Paul''s
      Catholic Church rather than east. This is because San Mateo County is south
      of San Francisco, and the direction between them is not purely east-west but
      more diagonally southwest-northeast.

      the Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist, and St. James Cathedral in Chicago,
      Illinois.


      2. **Geographic Positions**: Knowing that both are in Chicago, we can use the
      city''s layout or known reference points to estimate their relative positions.
      Chicago has a grid-like street system that can help in understanding east-west
      directions.


      3. **Reference Points**: St. James Cathedral is located on the eastern side
      of the Loop, which is the central business district of Chicago. The Seventeenth
      Church of Christ, Scientist, is also in the Loop area, but it''s closer to the
      western edge of the district.


      4. **East-West Alignment**: Given that both churches are within the Loop, we
      look at their longitudinal positions (east-west positioning) relative to the
      center of the Loop. St. James Cathedral is east of the center, while the Seventeenth
      Church of Christ, Scientist, is west of the center.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the relative positions of the two churches within
      the Loop, and considering the east-west alignment, the Seventeenth Church of
      Christ, Scientist, is located west of St. James Cathedral.

      3. **Street Layout**: In many cities, including Des Moines, east-west streets
      are often numbered or named in a way that indicates their direction. For example,
      streets with higher numbers or "east" in their names are typically located east
      of streets with lower numbers or "west" in their names.


      4. **Reference Points**: If we look at a map of downtown Des Moines, we can
      see that both the Civic Center and St. Ambrose Cathedral are located near or
      on Locust Street, which runs east-west through downtown. The Civic Center is
      situated on the western side of Locust Street, while St. Ambrose Cathedral is
      on the eastern side.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on their relative positions on Locust Street and the
      typical street layout in Des Moines, we can conclude that the Civic Center is
      not east of St. Ambrose Cathedral. Instead, it is located to the west of the
      cathedral.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Rose
      Valley Lake (Pennsylvania) and the Ukrainian Catholic National Shrine of the
      Holy Family (DC). Rose Valley Lake is located in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania,
      while the Ukrainian Catholic National Shrine is located in Washington, D.C.


      2. **Determine Relative Positions**: Next, we need to determine the relative
      positions of these two locations. Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. are both
      on the East Coast of the United States, but they are not adjacent states. Pennsylvania
      is generally north of Washington, D.C.


      3. **Compare East-West Positions**: To determine if Rose Valley Lake is east
      of the Ukrainian Catholic National Shrine, we need to consider their east-west
      positions. Washington, D.C. is generally east of Pennsylvania, given their positions
      on the East Coast.


      4. **Specific Locations**: While Washington, D.C. is generally east of Pennsylvania,
      it''s important to note that specific locations within these areas can vary
      in their east-west positions. The Ukrainian Catholic National Shrine is located
      in the northwest quadrant of Washington, D.C., while Rose Valley Lake is in
      the central part of Pennsylvania.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the general east-west positions of Pennsylvania and
      Washington, D.C. and the specific locations of Rose Valley Lake and the Ukrainian
      Catholic National Shrine within these areas, it is reasonable to conclude that
      Rose Valley Lake is not east of the Ukrainian Catholic National Shrine. Instead,
      it is west or southwest of the shrine.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Rose Valley Lake (Pennsylvania),
      PA is located east of the Ukrainian Catholic National Shrine of the Holy Family,
      DC is: **NO**'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Longview
      Lake and Smithville Lake in Missouri (MO). Longview Lake is located in Lee''s
      Summit, MO, and Smithville Lake is located in Smithville, MO.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two lakes, specifically whether Longview Lake is
      east of Smithville Lake.


      3. **Reference Points**: Knowing the cities where these lakes are located, we
      can use reference points like the major highways or geographic features to estimate
      their relative positions. Longview Lake is located in the southeastern part
      of the Kansas City metropolitan area, while Smithville Lake is located north
      of Kansas City.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Based on the general geography of Missouri and the
      known locations of these lakes, Longview Lake is to the south or southeast of
      Smithville Lake. This means it is unlikely to be east of Smithville Lake, considering
      the typical east-west alignment of cities and lakes in this region.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the relative positions of Longview Lake and Smithville
      Lake in Missouri, it''s reasonable to conclude that Longview Lake is not located
      east of Smithville Lake. Instead, it is more likely to be south or southeast
      of Smithville Lake.


      Based on these steps and the general understanding of Missouri''s geography,
      the answer to whether Longview Lake is located east of Smithville Lake is: **NO**'

      just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. Lake Accotink is located
      in Fairfax County, Virginia, also near the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two locations, specifically whether the CIA Headquarters
      is east of Lake Accotink.


      3. **Reference Points**: Given that both are in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan
      area, we can use known reference points like the Potomac River and major highways
      to estimate their relative positions. The Potomac River generally runs north-south,
      separating Maryland from Virginia.


      4. **Relative Positions**: The CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia, is located
      west of the Potomac River, while Lake Accotink is also in Virginia, but it''s
      more inland, away from the river. This suggests that the CIA Headquarters is
      likely west of Lake Accotink, considering the general layout of the area.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan
      area and the relative positions of the CIA Headquarters and Lake Accotink, it
      is reasonable to conclude that the George Bush Center for Intelligence is likely
      west of Lake Accotink rather than east. This deduction relies on the typical
      layout of the region and the known positions of these landmarks within the area.


      Given these steps and the general understanding of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan
      area''s geography, the answer to whether the George Bush Center for Intelligence
      is located east of Lake Accotink is: **NO**'

      Bush Center for Intelligence (also known as the CIA Headquarters) and Lake Accotink.
      The George Bush Center for Intelligence is located in Langley, Virginia, which
      is part of Fairfax County. Lake Accotink is also located in Fairfax County,
      Virginia.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two locations, specifically whether the George Bush
      Center for Intelligence is east of Lake Accotink.


      3. **Reference Points**: Knowing that both are in Fairfax County, we can use

      Lake Accotink is situated more towards the southern part of the county, while
      the George Bush Center for Intelligence (CIA Headquarters) is located in the
      northern part, specifically in Langley.


      4. **North-South Alignment**: Given that both locations are within the same
      county, we can consider their north-south alignment. Since the George Bush Center
      for Intelligence is in Langley, which is in the northern part of Fairfax County,
      and Lake Accotink is more towards the southern part, it''s likely that the George
      Bush Center for Intelligence is not east but rather north or northeast of Lake
      Accotink.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of Fairfax County and the
      relative positions of these landmarks within the county, it is reasonable to
      deduce that the George Bush Center for Intelligence is likely north or northeast
      of Lake Accotink rather than east. This deduction relies on the typical layout

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Lake
      Beshear, KY and St. Nicholas Cathedral, Chicago, IL. Lake Beshear is located
      in southwestern Kentucky, while St. Nicholas Cathedral is in the city of Chicago,
      Illinois.


      2. **Determine Relative Positions**: Next, we need to determine the relative
      positions of these two locations. Generally, Kentucky is south of Illinois.
      Since both locations are in different states, we need to consider their positions
      within their respective states as well.


      3. **East/West Comparison**: The question asks if Lake Beshear is east of St.
      Nicholas Cathedral. To answer this, we need to compare their east-west positions.
      While Kentucky is generally south of Illinois, we need to consider the specific
      locations within each state.


      4. **Lake Beshear Position**: Lake Beshear is located in southwestern Kentucky,
      which means it''s closer to the western edge of the state.

      Monroe and Griffy Lake in Indiana (IN). Lake Monroe is located near Bloomington,
      IN, and Griffy Lake is also located in Bloomington, IN.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two locations, specifically whether Lake Monroe is
      east of Griffy Lake.


      3. **Reference Points**: Knowing that both are in Bloomington, we can use the
      city''s layout or known reference points to estimate their relative positions.
      Griffy Lake is situated on the north side of Bloomington, relatively speaking.


      4. **City Layout**: Lake Monroe is located southeast of Bloomington, IN. Given
      the general layout of Bloomington and the known positions of these lakes within
      the city, areas to the southeast are more likely to be east or northeast of
      locations to the north.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of Bloomington and the relative
      positions of Griffy Lake and Lake Monroe within the city, it is reasonable to
      deduce that Lake Monroe is likely east or northeast of Griffy Lake rather than
      west or northwest. This deduction relies on the typical layout of cities and
      the known positions of these landmarks within Bloomington.

      3. **Street Address Analysis**: Both locations have street addresses, which
      can provide a clue to their relative positions. The "West" in their street addresses
      indicates that they are on the west side of the street. Typically, addresses
      increase as you move east, so a higher number would generally be east of a lower
      number.


      4. **Address Comparison**: Ziegfeld Theatre is at 141 West 54th Street, and
      New York City Center is at 131 West 55th Street. Since New York City Center

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of St. James
      Cathedral in Orlando, Florida, and the Orange County Courthouse in Florida.
      St. James Cathedral is located in downtown Orlando, while the Orange County
      Courthouse is also in downtown Orlando.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two locations, specifically whether St. James Cathedral
      is east of the Orange County Courthouse.


      3. **Reference Points**: Knowing that both are in downtown Orlando, we can use
      the city''s layout or known reference points to estimate their relative positions.
      Downtown Orlando is generally laid out in a grid pattern with streets running
      east-west and avenues running north-south.


      4. **Landmark Positions**: St. James Cathedral is located on the corner of Robinson
      Street and Orange Avenue, while the Orange County Courthouse is located on Orange
      Avenue, several blocks to the north.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the grid layout of downtown Orlando and the known positions
      of these landmarks, it is reasonable to deduce that St. James Cathedral is likely
      west of the Orange County Courthouse rather than east. This deduction relies
      on the typical layout of streets and avenues in downtown areas and the known
      positions of these landmarks within downtown Orlando.


      Given these steps and the general understanding of downtown Orlando''s geography,
      the answer to whether St. James Cathedral is located east of the Orange County
      Courthouse is: **NO**'

      The Orange County Courthouse is typically located in the county seat, which
      in this case is Orlando.


      4. **City Layout**: Since both landmarks are in Orlando, we can consider the
      city''s layout or known landmarks to help determine their relative positions.
      St. James Cathedral is located in downtown Orlando, which is generally more
      centrally located within the city.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that the Orange County Courthouse is typically in the

      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two locations, specifically whether Lewis and Clark
      Lake is east of Civic Center Music Hall.


      3. **Reference Points**: Knowing that Lewis and Clark Lake is in Nebraska and
      Civic Center Music Hall is in Oklahoma City, we can use known reference points
      to estimate their relative positions. Nebraska is generally north of Oklahoma,
      and Oklahoma City is located in the central part of the state.


      4. **East-West Alignment**: Given that Nebraska is north of Oklahoma and Lewis
      and Clark Lake is near the border with South Dakota, it is more likely that
      Lewis and Clark Lake is west of Civic Center Music Hall, which is in central
      Oklahoma.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of the United States and the
      known positions of these landmarks, it is reasonable to deduce that Lewis and
      Clark Lake is likely west of Civic Center Music Hall rather than east. This
      deduction relies on the typical layout of states and the known positions of
      these landmarks within their respective states.


      Given these steps and the general understanding of U.S. geography, the answer
      to whether Lewis and Clark Lake is located east of Civic Center Music Hall is:
      **NO**'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles (FAME Church) and
      the Hollywood Sign in California (CA). The FAME Church is located in Los Angeles,
      specifically in the historic West Adams district. The Hollywood Sign is situated
      in the Hollywood Hills, overlooking the city of Los Angeles.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two locations, specifically whether the FAME Church
      is east of the Hollywood Sign.


      3. **Reference Points**: Knowing that both are in Los Angeles, we can use the
      city''s layout or known reference points to estimate their relative positions.
      The Hollywood Sign is located in the Hollywood Hills, which is to the northwest
      of downtown Los Angeles. The West Adams district, where the FAME Church is located,
      is south of downtown Los Angeles.


      4. **Cardinal Directions**: Since the Hollywood Sign is northwest of downtown
      Los Angeles and the FAME Church is south of downtown, we can deduce that the
      FAME Church is not east of the Hollywood Sign. It''s more likely to be south
      or southeast of the sign, considering the general layout of the city.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of Los Angeles and the relative
      positions of the Hollywood Hills and the West Adams district, it is reasonable
      to conclude that the First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles
      is not located east of the Hollywood Sign. Instead, it''s likely to be south
      or southeast of the sign, given their respective locations within the city.

      part of the city.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of Los Angeles and the relative

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of the Basilica
      of Regina Pacis and HERE Arts Center. Both are located in New York, but they
      are in different parts of the city.


      2. **Basilica of Regina Pacis**: This basilica is located in the Bensonhurst
      neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. It''s situated on the western end of Brooklyn,
      close to the waterfront.


      3. **HERE Arts Center**: This arts center is located in the SoHo neighborhood
      of Manhattan, New York. SoHo is a central area of Manhattan, known for its arts
      scene.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Manhattan and Brooklyn are two distinct boroughs
      of New York City. Brooklyn is generally to the east of Manhattan, separated
      by the East River.


      5. **East-West Relationship**: Since Manhattan is generally west of Brooklyn,
      any location in Manhattan, including the HERE Arts Center, would be west of
      a location in Brooklyn, like the Basilica of Regina Pacis.


      Given these steps, the conclusion is that the Basilica of Regina Pacis is not
      located east of the HERE Arts Center. Instead, it is located to the east of
      the arts center, considering the general east-west layout of New York City''s
      boroughs.


      The answer is: **NO**'

      Pacis is east of HERE Arts Center.


      3. **Reference Points**: Since both locations are in different boroughs of New
      York City, we can use well-known reference points to estimate their relative
      positions. Manhattan, where HERE Arts Center is located, is generally east of
      Brooklyn, where Basilica of Regina Pacis is situated.


      4. **Boroughs and Directions**: In New York City, the boroughs are often used
      as reference points for directions. For example, "east of Manhattan" would generally
      refer to areas in Queens or Brooklyn, while "west of Manhattan" would include
      parts of New Jersey across the Hudson River.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of New York City and the known
      positions of Manhattan and Brooklyn, it is reasonable to conclude that Basilica
      of Regina Pacis, located in Brooklyn, is east of HERE Arts Center, which is

    a44535b5-0247-421f-be96-5cfa4f220ad4: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Loch
      Lomond and Saint Joseph Parish in California (CA). Loch Lomond is a small lake
      located in the San Francisco Bay Area, while Saint Joseph Parish is a church
      in Mountain View, CA, also in the San Francisco Bay Area.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two locations, specifically whether Loch Lomond is
      east of Saint Joseph Parish.


      3. **Reference Points**: Given that both are in the San Francisco Bay Area,
      we can use known reference points to estimate their relative positions. Mountain
      View, where Saint Joseph Parish is located, is situated on the western side
      of the Bay Area, closer to the Pacific Ocean. Loch Lomond, being a lake, is
      likely to be more inland and not directly on the coast.


      4. **General Direction**: In the context of the San Francisco Bay Area, locations
      to the east are generally more inland, while those to the west are closer to
      the Pacific Ocean. Since Mountain View is on the western side of the Bay Area,
      it is reasonable to assume that Loch Lomond, as an inland lake, would be east
      of Saint Joseph Parish.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of the San Francisco Bay Area
      and the relative positions of Mountain View and inland lakes like Loch Lomond,
      it is likely that Loch Lomond is located east of Saint Joseph Parish in Mountain
      View.


      Given these steps and the general understanding of the San Francisco Bay Area''s
      geography, the answer to whether Loch Lomond is located east of Saint Joseph
      Parish is: **YES**'

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Loch
      Lomond (California) and Saint Joseph Parish (Mountain View, California). Loch
      Lomond is a reservoir located in the Santa Cruz Mountains, Santa Cruz County,
      California. Saint Joseph Parish is a church located in Mountain View, Santa
      Clara County, California.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two locations, specifically whether Loch Lomond is
      east of Saint Joseph Parish.


      3. **Relative Positions**: To determine the east-west relationship, we look
      at their relative positions on a map. Generally, Mountain View, where Saint
      Joseph Parish is located, is on the western side of the San Francisco Bay Area,
      while Loch Lomond is more towards the southwestern part of the San Francisco
      Bay Area.


      4. **East-West Alignment**: When considering the alignment of these locations
      on a map, we see that Mountain View is more to the east compared to Loch Lomond,
      which is more to the west.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on their relative positions and the east-west alignment
      of the San Francisco Bay Area, it is clear that Loch Lomond is not east of Saint
      Joseph Parish. Instead, it is more to the west.


      Given these steps and the geographic analysis, the answer to whether Loch Lomond
      (California) is located east of Saint Joseph Parish (Mountain View, California)

      Mountain View, where Saint Joseph Parish is located, is in the northern part
      of the state, near the San Francisco Bay Area.


      4. **Regional Geography**: The Santa Cruz Mountains, where Loch Lomond is located,
      are to the south of the San Francisco Bay Area. This means that Loch Lomond
      is generally south of Mountain View.


      5. **East/West Alignment**: Given that both locations are on the western side
      of California, being east or west of each other depends on their longitudinal
      positions (east-west positioning). If we consider the general layout of California,
      locations further south are generally east of locations further north.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of California and the relative
      positions of the Santa Cruz Mountains and the San Francisco Bay Area, it is
      reasonable to deduce that Loch Lomond is likely east of Saint Joseph Parish.

      4. **East-West Comparison**: Given that Hillsborough (where Carolands is located)
      is generally east of the western part of San Mateo County (where Crystal Springs
      Reservoir is located), it is reasonable to deduce that Crystal Springs Reservoir
      is not east of Carolands but is instead west or more specifically, southwest.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the relative positions of Hillsborough and the western
      part of San Mateo County, and the known locations of Carolands and Crystal Springs
      Reservoir, it is concluded that Crystal Springs Reservoir is not located east
      of Carolands but is instead west or southwest.

    94f2a6a9-c43a-4f90-9970-356523d35e53: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Pat Mayse
      Lake in Texas (TX) and Oologah Lake in Oklahoma (OK). Pat Mayse Lake is located
      in Lamar County, Texas, while Oologah Lake is situated in Rogers County, Oklahoma.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two locations, specifically whether Pat Mayse Lake
      is east of Oologah Lake.


      3. **Reference Points**: Knowing that Pat Mayse Lake is in Texas and Oologah
      Lake is in Oklahoma, we can use the states'' relative positions to estimate
      their relative east-west alignment. Oklahoma is generally west of Texas, given
      the overall geography of the United States.


      4. **Specific Locations**: However, since we''re looking at specific lakes within
      these states, we need to consider their positions within their respective states.
      Pat Mayse Lake is in northeastern Texas, while Oologah Lake is in northeastern
      Oklahoma. This means that despite the general west-east relationship between
      the states, these specific lakes may have a more complex alignment.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that both lakes are in the northeastern parts of their
      respective states, which are adjacent to each other, it''s likely that Pat Mayse
      Lake and Oologah Lake have a more north-south alignment rather than a clear
      east-west one. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Pat Mayse Lake is east
      of Oologah Lake.


      Based on these steps and the understanding of the geographic relationship between
      Texas and Oklahoma, the answer to whether Pat Mayse Lake is located east of
      Oologah Lake is: **NO**'

      relationship. Oklahoma is generally west of Texas in the United States.


      4. **East-West Alignment**: Given that Oklahoma is west of Texas, it''s reasonable
      to assume that a lake in Texas, like Pat Mayse Lake, would be east of a lake
      in Oklahoma, like Oologah Lake. This assumption is based on the general east-west
      alignment of the states.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographic positions of Texas and Oklahoma and

      Lake and Milford Lake in Kansas (KS). El Dorado Lake is located near the city
      of El Dorado, while Milford Lake is near the city of Junction City.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two lakes, specifically whether El Dorado Lake is
      east of Milford Lake.


      3. **Reference Points**: To do this, we can use reference points like cities
      or landmarks. El Dorado is generally south of Junction City, and both cities
      are relatively central in the state of Kansas.


      4. **East-West Alignment**: Given that El Dorado is south of Junction City,
      and both are central in the state, it''s unlikely that El Dorado Lake would
      be east of Milford Lake. If we consider the east-west alignment of Kansas, El
      Dorado Lake is more likely to be west or southwest of Milford Lake.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of Kansas and the relative
      positions of El Dorado and Junction City, it''s reasonable to conclude that
      El Dorado Lake is not east of Milford Lake; instead, it''s likely west or southwest.

      locations closer to the eastern edge of the state are considered more "east"
      compared to those closer to the western edge.


      4. **Boston''s Position**: Boston is located on the eastern coast of Massachusetts,
      near the Atlantic Ocean. This means that it''s generally considered one of the
      easternmost cities in the state.


      5. **Watson Pond**: Without specific information about Watson Pond''s location,
      we can only assume that it''s somewhere in Massachusetts. Given that Boston
      is one of the most eastern cities in the state, it''s reasonable to assume that
      Watson Pond is likely located west of Boston, unless it''s specifically mentioned
      to be on the eastern edge of the state.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the general understanding of Massachusetts''s geography
      and the known position of Boston as an eastern city, it''s safe to conclude
      that Boston Playwrights'' Theatre is likely east of Watson Pond, unless there
      is specific information to the contrary.


      Given these steps and the general understanding of Massachusetts''s geography,
      the answer to whether Boston Playwrights'' Theatre is located east of Watson
      Pond is: **YES**'

      but still within Oregon''s borders.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that California is west of Oregon and Fourmile Lake
      is located in the southern part of Oregon near the California border, it''s
      reasonable to deduce that Our Lady of the Wayside Church, being in California,
      is west of Fourmile Lake rather than east. This deduction relies on the typical
      east-west layout of states in the western United States and the known positions
      of these landmarks.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      churches. Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is located in Manhattan, New York.
      All Saints Church is also located in Manhattan, New York.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two churches, specifically whether Church of Our
      Lady of Mount Carmel is east of All Saints Church.


      3. **Reference Points**: Both churches are located in Manhattan, which is a
      relatively compact island. This means that the east-west relationship can be
      determined by understanding the street layout and landmarks.


      4. **Street Layout**: Manhattan''s streets are laid out in a grid pattern, with
      avenues running north-south and streets running east-west. If both churches
      are on the same avenue, then the one with the higher street number would be
      more eastward. If they are on different avenues, then the one on the avenue
      with the higher number would be more eastward.


      5. **Landmarks**: Additionally, we can use well-known landmarks in Manhattan
      to estimate the relative positions of the churches. For example, if one church
      is closer to the East River (which is on the east side of Manhattan) compared
      to the other, it would be considered more eastward.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the street layout and landmarks, we can determine
      if Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is east of All Saints Church. If the evidence
      suggests that it is indeed eastward, then the answer would be YES. If not, the
      answer would be NO.

      Manhattan, we can assume they are on the same side of the island (the west side).


      4. **Specific Locations**: To determine which church is east or west of the
      other, we need more specific locations. Unfortunately, without more precise
      addresses or coordinates, it''s challenging to determine their exact positions.

      more northward in Manhattan, while those with lower street numbers (e.g., East
      60th Street) are more southward.


      4. **North-South Alignment**: Given that both churches are on the east side
      of Manhattan, we look at their north-south positions. Since Church of Our Lady

      1. **Identify Locations**: The Anthem (music venue) is located in Washington,
      D.C., and AFI Silver is located in Silver Spring, Maryland.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Washington, D.C. is situated along the
      Potomac River, which forms part of the border between Maryland and Virginia.
      Silver Spring, Maryland, is a suburb of Washington, D.C., located to the north
      of the city.


      3. **Compare East/West Positions**: Since The Anthem is in Washington, D.C.,

      east-west positions. Washington, D.C. is generally south of Silver Spring, but
      it''s also east of Silver Spring, considering the typical layout of cities along
      the East Coast of the United States.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic layout of the region and
      the relative positions of Washington, D.C. and Silver Spring, The Anthem is
      likely located east of AFI Silver. However, it''s important to note that this

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of VIA 57
      West and Playwrights Horizons in New York (NY). VIA 57 West is a residential
      building located in Manhattan, specifically in the Hell''s Kitchen neighborhood.
      Playwrights Horizons is a theater located in the Midtown West area of Manhattan.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two locations, specifically whether VIA 57 West is
      east of Playwrights Horizons.


      3. **Reference Points**: Knowing that both are in Manhattan, we can use the
      island''s layout or known reference points to estimate their relative positions.
      Hell''s Kitchen, where VIA 57 West is located, is generally on the west side
      of Manhattan, while Midtown West, where Playwrights Horizons is located, is
      more centrally positioned.


      4. **Specific Locations**: VIA 57 West is located at West 57th Street and 12th
      Avenue, which is on the western edge of Manhattan. Playwrights Horizons is located
      at 416 West 42nd Street, which is closer to the center of the island.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of Manhattan and the relative
      positions of these neighborhoods and specific addresses, it is reasonable to
      deduce that VIA 57 West is west of Playwrights Horizons rather than east. This
      deduction relies on the typical layout of Manhattan and the known positions
      of these landmarks within the city.


      Given these steps and the general understanding of Manhattan''s geography, the
      answer to whether VIA 57 West is located east of Playwrights Horizons is: **NO**'

      grid generally runs north-south (avenues) and east-west (streets). The Hudson
      River is to the west of Manhattan, and the East River is to the east.


      4. **VIA 57 West**: Being near the Hudson River, VIA 57 West is on the west
      side of Manhattan. It is specifically located at 625 West 57th Street.


      5. **Playwrights Horizons**: Playwrights Horizons is located on West 42nd Street,
      which is east of VIA 57 West''s location. The "West" in Playwrights Horizons''
      address refers to the west side of the street, but the street itself is still
      east of VIA 57 West.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given the relative positions of these locations within Manhattan''s
      grid, VIA 57 West is west of Playwrights Horizons, not east. This is because
      Playwrights Horizons is on a street that is east of VIA 57 West''s location.

      Egyptian Theater in Utah (UT) and Montana State Capitol in Montana (MT). Peery''s
      Egyptian Theater is located in Ogden, Utah. Montana State Capitol is located
      in Helena, Montana.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two locations, specifically whether Peery''s Egyptian
      Theater is east of Montana State Capitol.


      3. **Reference Points**: To understand their relative positions, we can use
      major landmarks or reference points. Utah is generally west of Montana in the
      United States. Given this general east-west alignment, we can infer that Peery''s
      Egyptian Theater, being in Utah, is likely west of Montana State Capitol.


      4. **State Boundaries**: Both Utah and Montana are states in the western part
      of the United States. The fact that Peery''s Egyptian Theater is in Utah and
      Montana State Capitol is in Montana confirms their relative east-west positioning.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of the western United States
      and the known positions of Utah and Montana, it is reasonable to deduce that
      Peery''s Egyptian Theater is west of Montana State Capitol. This deduction relies
      on the typical east-west alignment of states in the western United States.


      Given these steps and the general understanding of the geography of the western
      United States, the answer to whether Peery''s Egyptian Theater is located east
      of Montana State Capitol is: **NO**'

      Egyptian Theater and the Montana State Capitol. Peery''s Egyptian Theater is
      located in Ogden, Utah, while the Montana State Capitol is in Helena, Montana.


      2. **Determine Relative Positions**: Next, we need to determine the relative
      positions of these two locations. Utah and Montana are neighboring states in
      the western United States. Ogden, Utah, is located in the northern part of Utah,
      while Helena, Montana, is in the western-central part of Montana.


      3. **East-West Alignment**: The question specifically asks if Peery''s Egyptian
      Theater is east of the Montana State Capitol. To answer this, we need to consider
      the east-west alignment of the two states.


      4. **State Boundaries**: Utah is generally east of Montana, given their relative
      positions on the map. This means that most of Utah, including Ogden, is east
      of most of Montana, including Helena.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the relative positions of Utah and Montana, and
      the east-west alignment of these states, it''s reasonable to conclude that Peery''s
      Egyptian Theater in Ogden, Utah, is east of the Montana State Capitol in Helena,
      Montana.


      Therefore, the answer to the question, "Is Peery''s Egyptian Theater, UT located
      east of Montana State Capitol, MT?" is: **YES**'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Arrowrock
      Dam and C. J. Strike Reservoir. Both are located in Idaho, USA.


      2. **Geographic Positioning**: Next, we determine their geographical positions
      relative to each other. Arrowrock Dam is situated on the Boise River, in the
      western part of Idaho. C. J. Strike Reservoir is located on the Snake River,
      also in the western part of Idaho.


      3. **Relative Positions**: To determine if Arrowrock Dam is east of C. J. Strike
      Reservoir, we need to understand their relative positions within Idaho. Both
      dams are in the western part of the state, but we need to consider their specific
      locations along the rivers.


      4. **River Orientation**: The Boise River, where Arrowrock Dam is located, flows
      generally west to east. The Snake River, where C. J. Strike Reservoir is located,
      also flows generally west to east.


      5. **Dam Positions**: Given that both dams are on rivers that flow west to east,
      we can assume that the dams are positioned in a similar west-to-east orientation.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on this step-by-step analysis, it is reasonable to
      conclude that Arrowrock Dam is not located east of C. J. Strike Reservoir. Instead,
      they are likely positioned in a similar west-to-east orientation along their
      respective rivers.

      the Boise River flows from east to west in Idaho, while the Snake River flows
      from northeast to southwest.


      4. **East-West Alignment**: Since both dams are on rivers, we need to consider
      the directions of these rivers. The Boise River, where Arrowrock Dam is located,
      generally flows westward. The Snake River, where C. J. Strike Reservoir is located,
      flows in a more southwesterly direction.

      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two locations, specifically whether Arrowrock Dam
      is east of C. J. Strike Reservoir.


      3. **River Directions**: Rivers generally flow from higher elevations to lower
      elevations, and in this case, both dams are on rivers. The Boise River flows
      into the Snake River, which means the Arrowrock Dam is upstream of the C. J.
      Strike Reservoir.


      4. **East/West Alignment**: In terms of east-west alignment, dams on the same
      river tend to be in a north-south alignment, with the upstream dam being more
      north than the downstream dam. This is because rivers typically flow from north
      to south in the Northern Hemisphere.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the understanding that Arrowrock Dam is upstream
      of C. J. Strike Reservoir and the typical north-south alignment of dams on the

      is east of Foundry United Methodist Church.


      3. **Reference Points**: Knowing that both are in Washington, D.C., we can use

      All Souls Church is located in the northwest quadrant of the city, while Foundry
      United Methodist Church is situated in the southwest quadrant.


      4. **Quadrant Comparison**: The northwest quadrant is generally west of the
      southwest quadrant in Washington, D.C.''s grid layout.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of Washington, D.C. and the
      relative positions of the northwest and southwest quadrants, it is reasonable
      to deduce that All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.) is likely west
      of Foundry United Methodist Church rather than east. This deduction relies on

      relative positions. All Souls Church, being north of the White House, is likely
      west of Foundry United Methodist Church, which is south of the White House.

      in Manhattan.


      2. **Historical Context**: The Comedy Theatre, also known as the Henry Miller''s
      Theatre, was located on West 43rd Street, near Times Square. The Gaiety Theatre
      was located on Broadway, between 46th and 47th Streets.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Given the streets they were located on, the Comedy
      Theatre was on West 43rd Street, which is more to the west of Broadway. The
      Gaiety Theatre was on Broadway, which is a north-south avenue running through
      Manhattan.


      4. **East/West Comparison**: In Manhattan, streets running east-west are numbered,
      with lower numbers generally to the east and higher numbers to the west. Therefore,
      the Comedy Theatre on West 43rd Street would be to the west of the Gaiety Theatre
      on Broadway.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on their relative positions on the Manhattan street
      grid, the Comedy Theatre in New York City was located to the west of the Gaiety
      Theatre. Therefore, it was not located east of the Gaiety Theatre.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of the Comedy
      Theatre and the Gaiety Theatre in New York City (NY). Both are theaters located
      in the heart of New York City, specifically in the Theater District of Manhattan.


      2. **Relative Positions**: To determine if the Comedy Theatre is located east
      of the Gaiety Theatre, we need to understand their relative positions within
      the Theater District. Both theaters are situated in a relatively compact area
      known for its concentration of theaters.


      3. **Orientation**: Manhattan is typically oriented in a north-south direction,
      with avenues running north to south and streets running east to west. This orientation
      helps in understanding the east-west relationship between the theaters.


      4. **Street Numbers**: One method to determine the relative east-west positions
      of buildings in Manhattan is to look at their street numbers. Generally, higher
      street numbers are further east, and lower numbers are further west.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the orientation of Manhattan and the typical layout
      of the Theater District, it is likely that the Comedy Theatre is not located
      east of the Gaiety Theatre. This is because theaters in the Theater District
      are often clustered together, and it''s uncommon for one theater to be significantly
      east of another within the same district.

      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two theaters, specifically whether Comedy Theatre
      is east of Gaiety Theatre.


      3. **Theater District Layout**: The theater district in New York City is known
      for its concentrated collection of theaters along Broadway. Typically, theaters
      are aligned along the avenue, and their positions can be determined by their
      addresses or relative positions to other well-known landmarks.


      4. **Relative Positions**: To determine whether Comedy Theatre is east of Gaiety
      Theatre, we can use the general layout of the theater district and the known
      positions of other theaters. East and west directions are typically determined
      by the street grid of New York City, where streets running east-west are numbered
      with even numbers for east-west streets.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general layout of the theater district and the
      relative positions of theaters along Broadway, it is unlikely that Comedy Theatre
      is located east of Gaiety Theatre. The theaters are more likely to be aligned
      along the same avenue, with some variation in their north-south positions rather
      than east-west.

      records and maps to approximate their positions. The Comedy Theatre was located
      on West 41st Street, and the Gaiety Theatre was on West 42nd Street, both in
      the Theater District.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given their approximate positions, the Comedy Theatre was
      located on West 41st Street, which is south of West 42nd Street, where the Gaiety

      specific about their exact locations within the city.


      2. **Exact Locations**: Comedy Theatre is located on West 42nd Street, which
      is in the Theater District of Manhattan, New York City. Gaiety Theatre is also
      located in the Theater District but on West 46th Street.


      3. **Determine East/West Position**: To determine if Comedy Theatre is east
      of Gaiety Theatre, we need to understand the street layout of New York City.
      In Manhattan, streets are typically numbered in ascending order from south to
      north. This means that a higher-numbered street (like West 46th Street) is generally
      north of a lower-numbered street (like West 42nd Street).


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that West 42nd Street (where Comedy Theatre is located)
      is a lower-numbered street compared to West 46th Street (where Gaiety Theatre
      is located), Comedy Theatre is south of Gaiety Theatre. This means that Comedy
      Theatre is not east of Gaiety Theatre; it is to the south or southwest of it.

      3. **Geographic Positions**: Given that both theaters were in the same general
      area (the Theater District), we need to determine their relative positions to
      each other. The Theater District is generally oriented along the east-west axis
      of Manhattan.


      4. **Specific Locations**: Comedy Theatre was located on 41st Street, while
      Gaiety Theatre was located on 46th Street. Both streets run east-west in Manhattan.


      5. **East/West Comparison**: Given that both theaters were on streets running
      east-west, we need to determine which theater was located more to the east.
      Since 41st Street is south of 46th Street, we can conclude that Comedy Theatre
      was located more to the east.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on their historical locations and the geography of
      Manhattan''s Theater District, Comedy Theatre was located east of Gaiety Theatre.
      This is because Comedy Theatre was on a street (41st Street) that was located

      near Times Square.


      3. **Relative Positions**: To determine if the Comedy Theatre was east of the
      Gaiety Theatre, we need to understand their relative positions on the Broadway

      numbers are more northward. Additionally, in Manhattan, streets running east-west
      are numbered, while avenues running north-south are named.


      4. **Address Comparison**: The Comedy Theatre was on 41st Street, which is lower
      than 46th Street where the Gaiety Theatre was located. This suggests that the
      Comedy Theatre was south of the Gaiety Theatre.

      being on Broadway.


      5. **East/West Comparison**: Since the question asks if the Comedy Theatre is
      located east of the Gaiety Theatre, we need to consider their relative east-west

      the river and Heart of the Beast in the Powderhorn neighborhood, we can infer
      that the Guthrie Theater is likely to the north or northeast of Heart of the
      Beast. This is because the Mississippi River generally runs north-south through
      Minneapolis, and the Powderhorn neighborhood is to the south.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the known locations and the general geography of
      Minneapolis, it is reasonable to deduce that Heart of the Beast is likely west
      or southwest of the Guthrie Theater rather than east. This deduction relies
      on the typical layout of cities and the known positions of these landmarks within
      Minneapolis.


      Given these steps and the general understanding of Minneapolis''s geography,
      the answer to whether In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre is located
      east of the Guthrie Theater is: **NO**'

      of these locations.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic positions of Georgia and
      Kentucky, it''s unlikely that a location in Georgia would be east of a location
      in Kentucky. However, we need to consider the specific longitudes of these locations
      to give a definitive answer.


      Given these steps and the general understanding of the geographic positions
      of Georgia and Kentucky, the answer to whether Victory World Church is located
      east of Laurel River Lake is: **NO**'
    3b5d26df-a469-4c23-b075-add4b222194c: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Victory
      World Church and Laurel River Lake. Victory World Church is located in Norcross,
      Georgia, which is a city in the Atlanta metropolitan area. Laurel River Lake
      is located in Kentucky, specifically in the counties of Laurel and Whitley.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between Georgia and Kentucky, specifically whether Georgia is east
      of Kentucky. This is crucial to answering the question.


      3. **State Positions**: Georgia is located in the southeastern part of the United
      States, while Kentucky is situated in the east-central part of the country.
      This means that Georgia is generally south of Kentucky.


      4. **East/West Considerations**: Since the question asks if Victory World Church
      is east of Laurel River Lake, we need to consider the east-west relationship
      between the two states. Even though Georgia is south of Kentucky, it is also
      generally east of Kentucky when considering their east-west positions relative
      to each other.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographic positions of Georgia and Kentucky,
      and the east-west relationship between them, we can conclude that Georgia is
      indeed east of Kentucky. Therefore, Victory World Church in Georgia is also
      east of Laurel River Lake in Kentucky.

    388ec079-1426-42f7-a3d9-a5c57db78a8b: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Morris
      A. Mechanic Theatre and the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption
      of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Both are located in Maryland (MD), but we need to
      be more specific about their exact locations.


      2. **Exact Locations**: Morris A. Mechanic Theatre is located in Baltimore,
      MD, specifically in the downtown area. The Basilica of the National Shrine of
      the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary is also located in Baltimore, MD,
      but it''s in the Mount Vernon neighborhood, which is north of the downtown area.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Given that both locations are in Baltimore, we need
      to determine their relative positions within the city. The Mount Vernon neighborhood,
      where the Basilica is located, is generally north of the downtown area, where
      the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre is situated.


      4. **East-West Relationship**: The question specifically asks if the Morris
      A. Mechanic Theatre is east of the Basilica. Since the Basilica is in the north,
      and the Mechanic Theatre is in the south (downtown), it''s unlikely that the
      Mechanic Theatre is east of the Basilica.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided and the relative positions
      of these landmarks within Baltimore, it''s reasonable to conclude that the Morris
      A. Mechanic Theatre is not located east of the Basilica of the National Shrine
      of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Instead, it''s more likely located
      to the south or southwest.

      The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin
      Mary is also located in Baltimore, MD.


      3. **Relative Positions**: To determine if the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre is
      east of the Basilica, we need to understand their relative positions within
      Baltimore. Baltimore is located on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay,
      with its downtown area generally situated to the east of the Inner Harbor.


      4. **Downtown Baltimore**: Both the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre and the Basilica

      of downtown, near the Inner Harbor, while the Basilica is located slightly further
      east.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that both locations are in downtown Baltimore and considering
      their relative positions, it is reasonable to conclude that the Morris A. Mechanic
      Theatre is not east of the Basilica. Instead, it is more likely to be west or

      2. **Morris A. Mechanic Theatre**: The Morris A. Mechanic Theatre is located
      in downtown Baltimore, Maryland. Baltimore is a major city in the state and
      is situated near the Chesapeake Bay.


      3. **Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin
      Mary**: This basilica is also located in Baltimore, Maryland. It''s often referred
      to simply as the Baltimore Basilica and is one of the city''s historic landmarks.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Since both landmarks are in Baltimore, we need to
      determine their relative positions within the city. Downtown Baltimore, where
      the Mechanic Theatre is located, is generally more to the west or southwest
      of the city center compared to the Baltimore Basilica, which is located more
      centrally.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that the Mechanic Theatre is in downtown Baltimore,

      Street and Mulberry Street intersection. The Morris A. Mechanic Theatre is located
      near the intersection of Charles Street and Baltimore Street.


      4. **Orientation**: Charles Street runs north-south through downtown Baltimore.
      Cathedral Street and Mulberry Street are also north-south streets, but they
      are further west compared to Charles Street. This means that landmarks on Charles

      streets running east-west and avenues running north-south.


      3. **Relative Positions**: To determine if the Flatiron Building is east of
      the Blackstone Hotel, we need to understand their relative positions within
      the city. Buildings and landmarks in Fort Worth are typically identified by
      their street addresses.


      4. **Street Addresses**: The Flatiron Building''s address is 1000 Houston Street,
      and the Blackstone Hotel''s address is 601 Main Street. Houston Street runs
      east-west, and Main Street runs north-south.


      5. **Directional Analysis**: Given that Houston Street runs east-west and Main
      Street runs north-south, we can infer that the Flatiron Building is likely located
      to the east of the Blackstone Hotel. This is because the Flatiron Building''s
      address (1000 Houston Street) places it on the east-west axis, and the Blackstone
      Hotel''s address (601 Main Street) places it on the north-south axis.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the street addresses and the directional analysis,

      Methodist Medical Center (in Alabama) and Cagles Mill Lake (in Indiana). This
      step involves knowing where these places are located within their respective
      states.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between Alabama and Indiana, specifically whether Alabama is east
      of Indiana. This involves understanding the relative positions of these states
      within the United States.


      3. **Geographic Positions**: Alabama is a southern state, and Indiana is a midwestern
      state. On a map, Alabama is generally south of Indiana. The term "east" in the
      question is important because it asks about the east-west relationship between
      these states.


      4. **East-West Relationship**: Since Alabama is south of Indiana, it means that

      of the Immaculate Conception and the Forrest Theatre. Both are located in Philadelphia,
      Pennsylvania.


      2. **Determine Relative Positions**: Next, we need to determine the relative
      positions of these two landmarks within Philadelphia. The Cathedral of the Immaculate
      Conception is located in the Logan Square neighborhood, while the Forrest Theatre
      is situated in the Center City area.


      3. **Geographical Relationship**: To answer whether the Cathedral of the Immaculate
      Conception is east of the Forrest Theatre, we need to consider the geographic
      relationship between these two locations. Generally, in a north-south orientation,
      the Center City area (where the Forrest Theatre is) is south of Logan Square
      (where the cathedral is). However, since the question asks about the east-west
      relationship, we need to consider their positions along that axis.


      4. **East-West Alignment**: Both the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception
      and the Forrest Theatre are situated in the central part of Philadelphia, but
      the cathedral is slightly to the west of the Forrest Theatre. This means that
      the cathedral is not east of the theater; rather, it''s more to the west.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Lake
      Onalaska and Mammy''s Cupboard. Lake Onalaska is in Minnesota (MN), while Mammy''s
      Cupboard is in Mississippi (MS).


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two locations, specifically whether Lake Onalaska
      is east of Mammy''s Cupboard.


      3. **States'' Positions**: Since the locations are in different states, we first
      need to consider the overall positions of Minnesota and Mississippi. Minnesota
      is in the northern central part of the United States, while Mississippi is in
      the southern central part.


      4. **East-West Relationship**: Generally, in the United States, states further
      west are to the left (west) of states further east. This means that Minnesota,
      being in the north-central part, is likely west of Mississippi, which is in
      the south-central part.


      5. **Specific Locations**: Now, considering the specific locations, Lake Onalaska
      is in the southeastern part of Minnesota, closer to the border with Wisconsin.
      Mammy''s Cupboard is in the western part of Mississippi, near the border with
      Louisiana.

      Diego Civic Theatre is located downtown, near the San Diego Convention Center,
      which is close to the waterfront.


      4. **Theater Locations**: Balboa Theatre is also downtown but is a bit further
      inland compared to the San Diego Civic Theatre. Given the typical layout of
      coastal cities, areas further inland are often west or northwest of locations
      directly on or near the waterfront.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of San Diego and the relative
      positions of downtown landmarks like the San Diego Civic Theatre and Balboa
      Theatre, it is reasonable to deduce that Balboa Theatre is likely west or northwest
