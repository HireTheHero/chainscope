      determine the relative locations of Lake Surprise, NJ and Schoharie Reservoir,
      NY.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both bodies of water.

      - Lake Surprise is in New Jersey (NJ), specifically in Union County in the northeastern
      part of the state.

      - Schoharie Reservoir is in New York (NY), located in the Catskill Mountains
      region.


      Step 2: Consider their general geographic positions.

      - New Jersey is generally east and south of New York State.

      - However, since New York wraps around New Jersey to the east (with Long Island
      and NYC), I need to be more specific about these particular locations.


      Step 3: Determine their specific positions.

      - Lake Surprise is in northeastern New Jersey, near the border with New York.

      - Schoharie Reservoir is in the Catskill Mountains, which are in southeastern
      New York State, but still well inland and west of the Hudson River.


      Step 4: Compare their east-west positions.

      - The Catskill Mountains and Schoharie Reservoir are in the interior of New
      York State, west of the Hudson River.

      - Lake Surprise in northeastern NJ is closer to the Atlantic coast and east
      of the Catskills region.


      Therefore, Lake Surprise, NJ is located east of Schoharie Reservoir, NY.


      Answer: YES'

      - Utah''s western border connects with Nevada, not Arizona

      - Utah''s southern border connects with Arizona


      Step 3: More specifically:

      - Navajo Lake in Utah would be in the southern part of Utah

      - Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station is likely in central or southern Arizona


      Step 4: Consider east-west positioning.

      - Utah is generally east of Arizona

      - Locations in southern Utah would be east of most locations in Arizona

      - Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, being in Arizona, would be west of
      most Utah locations


      Based on the general geography of these states, with Utah being east of Arizona,
      and Navajo Lake being in Utah while Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station is
      in Arizona, I can conclude:

      of Navajo Lake in Utah and the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station in Arizona.


      Step 1: Identify the approximate location of Navajo Lake, Utah.

      Navajo Lake is located in southwestern Utah, near the border with Arizona.


      Step 2: Identify the approximate location of Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station,
      Arizona.

      The Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station is located in western Arizona, near
      the California border.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      Utah is generally east of Arizona. Navajo Lake is in southwestern Utah, while
      Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station is in western Arizona.


      Step 4: Make the east-west determination.

      Since Utah is east of Arizona, and Navajo Lake is in Utah while Palo Verde Nuclear
      Generating Station is in Arizona, Navajo Lake would be east of the Palo Verde
      Nuclear Generating Station.


      NO


      Wait, I need to be more careful with my analysis. Let me verify:


      Navajo Lake in Utah is in the southwestern part of Utah, which is indeed east
      of western Arizona where Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station is located. The
      general geography of the United States places Utah east of Arizona, so a location
      in Utah would be east of a location in western Arizona.


      YES'

      - Utah is generally north and east of Arizona


      Step 2: Consider more specific locations within these states.

      - Utah shares its southern border with Arizona

      - Navajo Lake in Utah would be in the southern part of Utah

      - Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station would be somewhere in Arizona


      Step 3: Determine more precise locations.

      - Navajo Lake (Utah) is located in southwestern Utah, near the Utah-Arizona
      border

      - Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station is located in western Arizona, west
      of Phoenix


      Step 4: Compare the east-west positions.

      - Western Utah (where Navajo Lake is) is still east of western Arizona (where
      Palo Verde is)

      - Even though both are in the western portions of their respective states, Utah''s
      western edge is still east of Arizona''s western portion


      Based on this geographic analysis, Navajo Lake in Utah is located east of the

      Step 5: Make the final determination.

      - Navajo Lake in Utah is in the southwest part of Utah

      - Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station is in the western part of Arizona

      - This means Navajo Lake would be northeast of the Palo Verde facility

      - Since "northeast" includes an eastern component, Navajo Lake is east of Palo
      Verde


      NO. Navajo Lake (Utah) is not east of Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station.
      It is northeast, which means it has both northern and eastern components relative
      to Palo Verde, but it is not directly east.


      Wait, I need to reconsider. If Navajo Lake is northeast of Palo Verde, then
      it does have an eastern component. The question asks if it''s located east (not

      2) Williams Fork Reservoir is in Colorado (CO), which is a state in the central-western
      United States.


      3) Fort Peck Dam is in Montana (MT), which is a state in the northwestern United
      States, bordering Canada.


      4) Geographically, Montana is north of Colorado.


      5) More importantly for this east-west comparison, Montana is generally to the
      northwest of Colorado.


      6) In the United States, locations in Montana are typically west of locations
      in Colorado when comparing longitude.


      7) However, since both states are large, I need to consider the specific locations
      within each state.


      8) Williams Fork Reservoir is in central Colorado, in the Rocky Mountains.


      9) Fort Peck Dam is in northeastern Montana.


      10) When comparing these specific locations, Fort Peck Dam is still to the northeast
      of Williams Fork Reservoir, meaning Williams Fork Reservoir is southwest of
      Fort Peck Dam.


      11) On an east-west axis specifically, Williams Fork Reservoir is to the west
      of Fort Peck Dam.


      NO, Williams Fork Reservoir, CO is not located east of Fort Peck Dam, MT. It

      Step 4: Even though Claytor Dam is in southwestern Virginia (not the easternmost

      Claytor Dam is indeed in southwestern Virginia, and Youngstown, Ohio is in the
      northeastern corner of Ohio. While Virginia is generally east of Ohio, the specific
      locations matter. Youngstown is so far east in Ohio that it''s actually east
      of parts of western Virginia, including where Claytor Dam is located.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both churches.

      - Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist is located at 55 E. Wacker Drive in
      Chicago, IL.

      - St. James Cathedral is located at 65 E. Huron Street in Chicago, IL.


      Step 2: In Chicago, the street grid system is oriented so that east-west streets
      have increasing numbers as you go north, and north-south streets have increasing
      numbers as you go east or west from State Street.


      Step 3: Both churches are on "E" (East) streets, meaning they''re both east
      of State Street, which is the north-south dividing line in Chicago.


      Step 4: To determine which is further east, I need to compare their positions
      relative to north-south streets.

      - Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist on Wacker Drive is near the intersection
      with Wabash Avenue.

      - St. James Cathedral on Huron Street is near the intersection with Rush Street.


      Step 5: In downtown Chicago, from west to east, the major north-south streets
      are: State, Wabash, Michigan, Rush, and then other streets. Wabash is west of
      Rush Street.


      Therefore, Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist (near Wabash) is located
      WEST of St. James Cathedral (near Rush).


      NO, Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist is NOT located east of St. James
      Cathedral.'

      The Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist is located at 55 E. Wacker Drive
      in downtown Chicago, along the Chicago River.


      Step 2: Let me identify the location of St. James Cathedral in Chicago.

      St. James Cathedral is located at 65 E. Huron Street in Chicago''s River North
      neighborhood.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Both buildings are on streets with "E" (East) designations, but this alone doesn''t
      tell us their relative positions to each other. In Chicago''s grid system, the
      east-west position is determined by how far east or west a location is from

      Since both have "E" designations, they''re both east of State Street. However,
      they''re on different streets (Wacker Drive vs. Huron Street), so I need to
      consider their specific locations.


      Wacker Drive runs along the Chicago River, and at 55 E. Wacker, the Seventeenth
      Church is right along the river. St. James Cathedral at 65 E. Huron is a few
      blocks north of the river.


      In terms of east-west positioning, they are very close, but the Seventeenth
      Church of Christ, Scientist is slightly more eastward in the downtown area compared
      to St. James Cathedral.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both structures.

      - Bel Air Church is located in Los Angeles, California (CA)

      - Lower Monumental Dam is located on the Snake River in Washington state (WA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Washington state is also on the west coast, but north of California


      Step 3: Compare east-west positions.

      - In the United States, locations in California are generally west of locations
      in Washington state

      - Los Angeles is on the Pacific coast, while the Snake River (where Lower Monumental
      Dam is located) is somewhat inland in Washington


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Bel Air Church is in Los Angeles, CA, which is west of Lower Monumental
      Dam in Washington, it cannot be east of the dam


      NO, Bel Air Church in California is not located east of Lower Monumental Dam

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative locations of these
      two structures in Des Moines, Iowa.


      Step 1: The Civic Center of Greater Des Moines (now known as the Des Moines
      Civic Center) is located at 221 Walnut Street in downtown Des Moines.


      Step 2: St. Ambrose Cathedral is located at 607 High Street in downtown Des

      (at 607 High).


      NO, the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines is NOT located east of St. Ambrose
      Cathedral. It is located WEST of the cathedral.


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me correct myself:


      In Des Moines, street numbers typically increase as you move away from the Des
      Moines River, which runs north-south through downtown. The Civic Center''s address
      (221) has a lower number than St. Ambrose Cathedral''s address (607), which
      indicates the Civic Center is closer to the river, meaning it is EAST of the
      cathedral.


      YES, the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines is located east of St. Ambrose Cathedral.'

      Looking at their locations on a map, the Colonial Theatre is situated in the
      Theater District near Boston Common, while the Charles Playhouse is also in
      the Theater District but slightly southwest of the Colonial.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      The Colonial Theatre is positioned slightly northeast of the Charles Playhouse.
      This means the Colonial Theatre is east of the Charles Playhouse.


      NO.


      Wait, I made an error in my analysis. Let me verify again:


      The Colonial Theatre is actually positioned slightly to the east of the Charles
      Playhouse in Boston''s Theater District. When looking at a map of Boston, the
      Colonial Theatre is indeed east of the Charles Playhouse.

      - Cranberry Lake is in New York (NY)

      - St. Padre Pio Shrine is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of NY and NJ.

      - New York is generally north and west of New Jersey

      - New Jersey is east of parts of New York, but mainly south of New York


      Step 3: Find more specific information about these locations.

      - Cranberry Lake, NY is in the Adirondack region in northern New York

      - St. Padre Pio Shrine is in Buena, NJ, in southern New Jersey


      Step 4: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Cranberry Lake is in northern NY, well into the state

      - St. Padre Pio Shrine is in southern NJ, which extends further east than northern
      NY

      - New Jersey''s eastern portions generally lie east of New York''s Adirondack
      region


      Therefore: NO, Cranberry Lake, NY is not located east of St. Padre Pio Shrine,
      NJ. It is located west of the shrine.'

      Step 2: Recall the general geographic relationship between New York and New
      Jersey.

      - New Jersey is generally south and west of New York state

      - However, the specific locations within each state matter, as parts of NY can
      be west of parts of NJ


      Step 3: Consider more specific geography.

      - Cranberry Lake, NY is in the northern part of New York state, in the Adirondack
      region

      - St. Padre Pio Shrine is in New Jersey, which lies entirely west and south
      of the main part of New York


      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison.

      - Cranberry Lake in the Adirondacks would be significantly to the east compared
      to any location in New Jersey

      - New Jersey''s eastern border is generally west of most of New York state''s
      territory


      Based on this geographic analysis, Cranberry Lake, NY is located east of St.

      - George Bush Center for Intelligence is in Langley, Maryland (MD)

      - Lake Accotink is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Maryland is generally east of Virginia in the United States

      - The George Bush Center for Intelligence (CIA Headquarters) is actually in
      Langley, Virginia, not Maryland

      - Lake Accotink is in Springfield, Virginia


      Step 3: Determine the specific east-west relationship.

      - The CIA Headquarters in Langley is in northern Virginia, near the Potomac
      River

      - Lake Accotink is in Springfield, Virginia, which is south of Langley

      - When comparing their east-west positions, CIA Headquarters is northeast of
      Lake Accotink


      Therefore, the George Bush Center for Intelligence is east (specifically northeast)
      of Lake Accotink.


      NO.

      Long Wharf Theatre is also located in New Haven, Connecticut, specifically in
      the Long Wharf district near the harbor.


      Step 3: Let me determine their relative positions.

      In New Haven, the harbor and Long Wharf area are to the south and slightly east
      of downtown. Yale University''s campus, where Horchow Hall is located, is primarily
      in the downtown and northern part of New Haven.


      Step 4: Considering their specific positions within New Haven, Horchow Hall
      at Yale would be north and slightly west of Long Wharf Theatre.


      Therefore, Horchow Hall is NOT east of Long Wharf Theatre, but rather northwest
      of it.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both lakes.

      - Lake Monroe is a reservoir located in Monroe County, Indiana, near Bloomington.

      - Griffy Lake is a smaller lake also located near Bloomington, Indiana.


      Step 2: Determine their specific positions.

      - Lake Monroe is located primarily southeast of Bloomington.

      - Griffy Lake is located just north/northeast of Bloomington.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Since Lake Monroe is southeast of Bloomington while Griffy Lake is north/northeast
      of Bloomington, Lake Monroe would be east of Griffy Lake.


      NO.


      Wait, I need to verify this. Looking more carefully at their positions:

      - Lake Monroe is actually south-southeast of Bloomington

      - Griffy Lake is directly north of Bloomington

      - New York City Center is located at 131 West 55th Street between 6th and 7th
      Avenues in Manhattan.


      Step 2: Analyze their positions on the Manhattan grid.

      - In Manhattan, streets run east-west, with street numbers increasing as you
      go north.

      - Avenues run north-south, with avenue numbers increasing as you go west.

      - "East" would mean closer to the East River, or having a lower avenue number.


      Step 3: Compare their avenue positions.

      - Ziegfeld Theatre was on 6th Avenue (Avenue of the Americas)

      - City Center is between 6th and 7th Avenues on 55th Street


      Step 4: Determine east-west relationship.

      - Since City Center is between 6th and 7th Avenues, it is west of 6th Avenue

      - Ziegfeld Theatre was on 6th Avenue, which is east of City Center''s position


      NO, Ziegfeld Theatre (1927) is not located east of New York City Center. It
      is actually located east of City Center.


      Wait, I made an error in my conclusion. Let me correct: Since Ziegfeld Theatre
      was on 6th Avenue and City Center is between 6th and 7th Avenues (west of 6th),
      the Ziegfeld Theatre is EAST of City Center.


      So the answer is: YES'

      the relative positions of these two New York theaters.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both theaters.

      - The Ziegfeld Theatre (1927) was located at 1341 Sixth Avenue (Avenue of the
      Americas) between 54th and 55th Streets in Manhattan.

      - New York City Center is located at 131 West 55th Street between 6th and 7th
      Avenues in Manhattan.


      Step 2: Understand Manhattan''s grid system.

      - In Manhattan, avenues run north-south, with lower numbers in the east and
      higher numbers in the west.

      - Streets run east-west, with numbers increasing as you go north.

      - "East" and "West" designations on streets are determined by their position
      relative to 5th Avenue.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      - Both theaters are near 55th Street.

      - The Ziegfeld Theatre was on 6th Avenue (Avenue of the Americas).

      - New York City Center is on West 55th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues.


      Step 4: Determine east-west positioning.

      - In Manhattan, east is toward 1st Avenue, west is toward 12th Avenue.

      - The Ziegfeld Theatre on 6th Avenue would be east of a location between 6th
      and 7th Avenues.


      NO, the Ziegfeld Theatre (1927) is not located east of New York City Center.
      It would be slightly to the east or approximately at the same longitude as the
      eastern edge of City Center.'

      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of both the Ziegfeld Theatre (1927)
      and the New York City Center.


      Step 2: The original Ziegfeld Theatre (1927) was located at 1341 Sixth Avenue
      (between 54th and 55th Streets) in Manhattan. This theater was demolished in
      1966.


      Step 3: The New York City Center is located at 131 West 55th Street (between
      6th and 7th Avenues) in Manhattan.


      Step 4: In Manhattan, the avenues run north-south, with lower-numbered avenues
      to the east. Sixth Avenue is east of 7th Avenue.


      Step 5: Since the Ziegfeld Theatre was on Sixth Avenue and the City Center is
      between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, the Ziegfeld Theatre would be slightly east
      of the City Center.


      NO.


      Wait, I need to correct myself. Looking more carefully at the addresses:

      - Ziegfeld Theatre (1927): 1341 Sixth Avenue (between 54th and 55th Streets)

      - New York City Center: 131 West 55th Street (between 6th and 7th Avenues)


      The Ziegfeld Theatre was on Sixth Avenue, while the City Center is on 55th Street
      between 6th and 7th Avenues, which means the City Center is west of 6th Avenue.
      Therefore, the Ziegfeld Theatre would be east of the City Center.


      YES.'

      Point Dam on the Missouri River.

      - Civic Center Music Hall is in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Nebraska is north of Oklahoma.

      - Nebraska is generally in the same longitude range as Oklahoma, with both states
      being in the central part of the US.


      Step 3: Compare specific longitudes.

      - Lewis and Clark Lake is in the northeastern part of Nebraska, near the South
      Dakota border.

      - Oklahoma City (where the Civic Center Music Hall is located) is in the central
      part of Oklahoma.

      - On a US map, Nebraska is slightly shifted to the west compared to Oklahoma.

      - Lewis and Clark Lake, being on the northeastern edge of Nebraska, would be
      roughly aligned with western Oklahoma.

      - Oklahoma City is in the central part of Oklahoma, which would place it east
      of Lewis and Clark Lake.


      Since Lewis and Clark Lake is west of the Civic Center Music Hall (not east),
      the answer is:

      First, I need to identify the locations of both places:

      - Lewis and Clark Lake is in Nebraska (NE)

      - Civic Center Music Hall is in Oklahoma (OK)


      To determine their relative positions, I need to know where Nebraska and Oklahoma
      are located relative to each other.


      Nebraska is a state in the central United States, bordering South Dakota to
      the north, Iowa and Missouri to the east, Kansas to the south, and Colorado
      and Wyoming to the west.


      Oklahoma is located south of Kansas, which is south of Nebraska.


      Looking at their positions on a map:

      - Nebraska is north of Oklahoma

      - Lewis and Clark Lake is likely in eastern Nebraska (since it borders the Missouri
      River)

      - Civic Center Music Hall is in Oklahoma City, which is in central Oklahoma


      When comparing east-west positioning (longitude):

      - Nebraska and Oklahoma largely overlap on the east-west axis

      - However, Lewis and Clark Lake is specifically on Nebraska''s eastern border

      - Oklahoma City (where the Civic Center Music Hall is located) is in central
      Oklahoma


      Since Lewis and Clark Lake is on Nebraska''s eastern border, and Oklahoma City
      is in central Oklahoma, Lewis and Clark Lake is likely east of the Civic Center
      Music Hall.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Nebraska and Oklahoma.

      - Nebraska is located in the central United States

      - Oklahoma is located south of Nebraska


      Step 3: More specifically, let''s think about east-west positioning.

      - Nebraska is generally positioned north of Oklahoma

      - Oklahoma is directly south of Nebraska and Kansas

      - In terms of east-west positioning, these states largely share the same longitude
      range


      Step 4: Lewis and Clark Lake is on the Nebraska-South Dakota border, on the
      Missouri River in the northeastern part of Nebraska.


      Step 5: Civic Center Music Hall is in Oklahoma City, which is in the central
      part of Oklahoma.


      Step 6: When comparing these specific locations, Lewis and Clark Lake is in
      the northeastern part of Nebraska, while Oklahoma City is in central Oklahoma.
      Looking at their positions on a map, Lewis and Clark Lake would be slightly
      to the west of Oklahoma City''s longitude.

      - First African Methodist Episcopal Church (FAME) is located in Los Angeles,
      CA

      - The Hollywood Sign is located in Los Angeles, CA, specifically in the Hollywood
      Hills


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - FAME Church is located near downtown Los Angeles, in the West Adams district

      - The Hollywood Sign is located in the Hollywood Hills in the northwestern part
      of Los Angeles


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Downtown Los Angeles and the West Adams district are generally east and south
      of Hollywood

      - The Hollywood Sign is in the western portion of Los Angeles, northwest of
      downtown


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since FAME Church is closer to downtown LA (which is east of Hollywood), and
      the Hollywood Sign is in the western part of the city, FAME Church would be
      east of the Hollywood Sign.


      NO

      - The Hollywood Sign is in the Hollywood Hills in the northwestern part of Los
      Angeles

      - FAME Church is in West Adams, which is south of Hollywood and southwest of
      downtown

      - Looking at their relative positions, FAME Church is actually southeast of
      the Hollywood Sign, which means it is indeed east of the Hollywood Sign.

      West Adams district of Los Angeles.

      - West Adams is generally south and slightly east of Hollywood.

      - The Hollywood Sign is on the western side of the Hollywood Hills.

      - In Los Angeles, locations further inland (away from the Pacific Ocean) are
      generally more eastern.

      - West Adams is more inland/eastern compared to the Hollywood Sign.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Based on their geographic positions in Los Angeles, the First African Methodist
      Episcopal Church in West Adams is indeed east of the Hollywood Sign.


      NO

      area, which is southeast of Hollywood. The Hollywood Sign is in the Hollywood
      Hills, northwest of downtown LA. When comparing these two locations on an east-west

      the relative positions of these two reservoirs in California.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Twitchell Reservoir, CA.

      Twitchell Reservoir is located in San Luis Obispo County in central California,
      near Santa Maria. It''s in the western part of California, relatively close
      to the Pacific coast.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Don Pedro Reservoir, CA.

      Don Pedro Reservoir is located in Tuolumne County in the Sierra Nevada foothills
      of central California, east of Modesto and west of Yosemite National Park.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      When looking at California''s geography, the Sierra Nevada foothills (where
      Don Pedro is located) are east of the coastal regions (where Twitchell is located).
      Don Pedro Reservoir is closer to the eastern side of California, while Twitchell
      Reservoir is closer to the western coast.


      Step 4: Determine the answer based on their relative positions.

      Since Don Pedro Reservoir is located in the Sierra Nevada foothills to the east,
      and Twitchell Reservoir is located closer to the coast to the west, Twitchell
      Reservoir is NOT east of Don Pedro Reservoir. In fact, it''s the opposite -
      Twitchell is west of Don Pedro.

      Atlantic Ocean.

      - Hobe Sound is located north of Miami Beach, also on Florida''s east coast
      along the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 2: Consider Florida''s coastal geography.

      - Florida''s east coast has a general north-south orientation, with some slight
      angles.

      - Coastal locations in Florida that are on the Atlantic Ocean are generally
      aligned along a similar longitude (east-west position).


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Both properties are located on Florida''s Atlantic coast.

      - Miami Beach is slightly further east than most points north of it on Florida''s
      east coast because of the coastline''s slight angle.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Step 4: Compare east-west positions.

      Both locations are on Florida''s Atlantic (eastern) coast. However, Florida''s

      - Hobe Sound is also coastal, but I need to consider the specific location of
      the Bubble Houses.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - In Florida, the coastline angles slightly from northeast to southwest.

      - This means locations further south on Florida''s east coast tend to be slightly
      further east in longitude.

      - Miami Beach, being further south, is likely slightly further east than Hobe

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both buildings.

      - Park Performing Arts Center is in Union City, New Jersey.

      - "Big Pink" is the nickname for the house in West Saugerties, New York where
      Bob Dylan and The Band recorded "The Basement Tapes" in 1967.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a map.

      - New Jersey is located east of New York State.

      - However, I need to be more specific about these particular locations.

      - Union City, NJ is in northeastern New Jersey, near the Hudson River.

      - West Saugerties, NY is in the eastern part of New York State, in the Catskill
      Mountains region.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Union City, NJ is very close to New York City, on the western bank of the
      Hudson River.

      - West Saugerties, NY is northwest of New York City, in the Catskill Mountains.

      - Locations in northeastern New Jersey (like Union City) are generally east
      of locations in the Catskills region of New York.


      NO. Park Performing Arts Center in New Jersey is not east of Big Pink in New
      York. It is actually west of Big Pink.


      Wait, I need to double-check my geography. Union City, NJ is east of the Hudson
      River from Manhattan, and West Saugerties is northwest of New York City. When
      comparing these two specific locations, Union City (and thus Park Performing
      Arts Center) would be southeast of West Saugerties (where Big Pink is located).


      Correcting my answer: YES. Park Performing Arts Center in New Jersey is located
      east of Big Pink in New York.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations mentioned.

      - Our Lady of the Wayside Church is in California (CA)

      - Fourmile Lake is in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - California is a state on the west coast of the United States

      - Oregon is a state on the west coast, directly north of California

      - When comparing east-west positions, I need to consider that Oregon is north
      of California


      Step 3: Analyze the east-west relationship.

      - Since Oregon is north of California, a location in California would generally
      be south of a location in Oregon

      - The east-west relationship depends on their specific locations within their
      respective states

      - Generally, locations in California would not be east of locations in Oregon,
      as Oregon is positioned above California, not to the west of it


      Step 4: Consider the specific locations.

      - Fourmile Lake is in Oregon, likely in the Cascade Range

      - Our Lady of the Wayside Church in California would be west of most Oregon
      locations due to California''s position

      - Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is located in East Harlem at 448 East 116th
      Street (between Pleasant Avenue and 1st Avenue).

      - All Saints Church in Manhattan is located at 230 East 60th Street (between
      2nd and 3rd Avenues).


      Step 2: Analyze their east-west positioning.

      - In Manhattan''s grid system, "East" streets are east of Fifth Avenue.

      - Both churches are on "East" streets, so both are east of Fifth Avenue.

      - Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is between Pleasant Avenue and 1st Avenue.

      - All Saints Church is between 2nd and 3rd Avenues.


      Step 3: Compare their avenue locations.

      - In Manhattan, avenue numbers increase as you go west (1st Avenue is east of
      2nd Avenue).

      - Pleasant Avenue is east of 1st Avenue.

      - So Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel (near Pleasant/1st Ave) is further east
      than All Saints Church (near 2nd/3rd Ave).


      YES, Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is located east of All Saints Church

      - Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is located in East Harlem at 448 East 116th
      Street, Manhattan.

      - All Saints Church is located in Harlem at 129 East 129th Street, Manhattan.


      Step 2: In Manhattan, the street grid system is oriented such that:

      - "East" addresses are east of Fifth Avenue

      - The higher the street number, the further north you are

      - The higher the avenue number or "East" number, the further east you are


      Step 3: Comparing the addresses:

      - Both churches are on the East side of Manhattan (east of Fifth Avenue)

      - Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is at 448 East 116th Street

      - All Saints Church is at 129 East 129th Street


      Step 4: Determine relative east-west positioning:

      - The "448 East" indicates Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is further east
      than "129 East" for All Saints Church

      - 448 East means it''s further east from Fifth Avenue than 129 East


      NO. Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is not located east of All Saints Church.
      While Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel has a higher "East" number (448 East
      vs 129 East), it''s located on 116th Street, which is south of All Saints Church
      on 129th Street. The "East" numbers indicate distance from Fifth Avenue, not

      - In Manhattan''s grid system, "East" addresses are east of Fifth Avenue, while
      "West" addresses are west of Fifth Avenue.

      - Our Lady of Mount Carmel has an "East" address (East 116th Street).

      - All Saints Church has a "West" address (West 130th Street).


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on Manhattan''s street grid.

      - Since Our Lady of Mount Carmel is on an "East" street and All Saints is on
      a "West" street, Our Lady of Mount Carmel is located east of Fifth Avenue while
      All Saints Church is located west of Fifth Avenue.


      NO, Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is not located east of All Saints Church.
      It is actually located east of Fifth Avenue, while All Saints Church is located
      west of Fifth Avenue, making Our Lady of Mount Carmel located to the east.

      - In Manhattan''s grid system, "East" street addresses are east of Fifth Avenue.

      - Both churches have "East" addresses, so both are east of Fifth Avenue.

      - Since they''re both on the east side, I need to compare their specific locations.


      Step 3: Both are on the east side, so I need to check if one is further east
      than the other.

      - The "East" in their addresses doesn''t provide enough information to determine
      which is further east.

      - Without specific avenue information (like if one is on 2nd Avenue and one

      Step 4: Since Beech Fork Lake is in West Virginia, and Boone Lake is in Tennessee,
      and West Virginia is generally east of Tennessee, it''s likely that Beech Fork
      Lake is east of Boone Lake.


      Step 5: However, I need to be careful because Boone Lake is in eastern Tennessee,
      near the border with North Carolina and Virginia, while Beech Fork Lake is in
      western West Virginia.


      Step 6: Considering the specific locations, Beech Fork Lake is in the western
      part of West Virginia (near the Kentucky border), while Boone Lake is in the
      far eastern part of Tennessee (in the Appalachian region).

      - Playwrights Horizons is located at 416 West 42nd Street in Manhattan, New
      York City, also on the west side.


      Step 2: Understand Manhattan''s grid system.

      - In Manhattan, streets run east-west, with street numbers increasing as you
      go north.

      - Avenues run north-south, with "West" addresses being west of 5th Avenue.

      - For "West" addresses, the building numbers generally increase as you move
      westward from 5th Avenue.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      - VIA 57 West is on West 57th Street, which is 15 streets north of West 42nd
      Street where Playwrights Horizons is located.

      - However, the question asks about east-west positioning, not north-south.

      - Both are on the west side of Manhattan, but VIA 57 West is at 625 West 57th,
      while Playwrights Horizons is at 416 West 42nd.

      - The higher number in VIA''s address (625) compared to Playwrights'' address
      (416) suggests VIA is further west.


      Step 4: Conclusion based on Manhattan''s grid system.

      - Since VIA 57 West has a higher "West" address number, it is located further
      west than Playwrights Horizons.

      - Therefore, VIA 57 West is NOT east of Playwrights Horizons; it is west of
      it.


      NO, VIA 57 West is not located east of Playwrights Horizons.'
    ab4ed900-0dba-4d50-8232-cdd744b74dbf: 'I need to determine the relative locations
      of VIA 57 West and Playwrights Horizons in New York.


      Step 1: Let me identify the location of VIA 57 West.

      VIA 57 West is a residential building located at 625 West 57th Street in Manhattan,
      New York City. As the name suggests, it''s on the west side of Manhattan near
      the Hudson River.


      Step 2: Let me identify the location of Playwrights Horizons.

      Playwrights Horizons is a theater located at 416 West 42nd Street in Manhattan,
      New York City, in the Theater District/Hell''s Kitchen area.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Both are on the west side of Manhattan, but VIA 57 West is on West 57th Street,
      while Playwrights Horizons is on West 42nd Street.


      Step 4: Determine east-west positioning.

      In Manhattan''s grid system, the street numbers (42nd, 57th) indicate north-south
      position, with higher numbers being further north. The avenues and "East/West"
      designations indicate east-west positioning.


      Both addresses have "West" in them, meaning they''re both west of 5th Avenue.
      Their specific addresses (625 West 57th vs. 416 West 42nd) indicate they''re
      both quite far west in Manhattan. The number 625 for VIA 57 West suggests it''s
      further west than Playwrights Horizons at 416.


      NO, VIA 57 West is not located east of Playwrights Horizons. It is actually
      located west and north of Playwrights Horizons.'
    ba953877-3496-4dc9-80f4-9fa2c7bd217d: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      First, I need to identify the locations of both buildings:


      1. VIA 57 West is a residential building in New York City. As its name suggests,
      it''s located on the west side of Manhattan, specifically at 625 West 57th Street.


      2. Playwrights Horizons is a theater located at 416 West 42nd Street in New
      York City, also on the west side of Manhattan.


      Now I need to determine their relative positions:

      - VIA 57 West is at West 57th Street

      - Playwrights Horizons is at West 42nd Street


      In Manhattan''s grid system:

      - Streets run east-west, with street numbers increasing as you go north

      - Avenues run north-south, with "West" addresses being on the west side of Manhattan


      Since VIA 57 West is on West 57th Street and Playwrights Horizons is on West
      42nd Street, they are on different streets. VIA 57 West is farther north (higher
      street number).


      However, the question asks about east-west positioning, not north-south. Looking
      at their addresses:

      - VIA 57 West: 625 West 57th Street

      - Playwrights Horizons: 416 West 42nd Street


      The "West" designation and the higher number for VIA 57 West (625 vs 416) indicates
      it''s farther west than Playwrights Horizons.


      Therefore, VIA 57 West is NOT east of Playwrights Horizons; it''s actually west
      of it.


      NO'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both buildings.

      - VIA 57 West is located at 625 West 57th Street in Manhattan, New York City.

      - Playwrights Horizons is located at 416 West 42nd Street in Manhattan, New
      York City.


      Step 2: Understand Manhattan''s grid system.

      - In Manhattan, streets run east-west, with street numbers increasing as you
      go north.

      - Avenues run north-south, with "West" addresses being west of 5th Avenue.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      - Both addresses are on the west side of Manhattan (both have "West" in their
      addresses).

      - VIA 57 West is on West 57th Street, which is farther north than West 42nd
      Street.

      - The "West" designation tells us about their east-west positioning relative
      to 5th Avenue, not relative to each other.

      - The building name "VIA 57 West" includes "West" because it''s on the west
      side of Manhattan and on 57th Street, not indicating its position relative to
      Playwrights Horizons.


      Step 4: Determine relative east-west positioning.

      - Without specific avenue information, I cannot determine if one is east of
      the other based solely on their street addresses.

      - However, VIA 57 West is specifically at West 57th Street between 11th and
      12th Avenues.

      - Playwrights Horizons is on West 42nd Street between 9th and 10th Avenues.

      - Higher avenue numbers in Manhattan are farther west.


      Therefore, VIA 57 West is located farther west than Playwrights Horizons, not
      east of it.

      Allen Theatre is located in Cleveland, Ohio, in the northeastern part of the
      state.


      Step 2: I need to identify where the Muskingum River Power Plant in Ohio is
      located.

      The Muskingum River Power Plant was located in Beverly, Ohio, in the southeastern

      Step 3: I need to determine their relative positions.

      Cleveland is in northeastern Ohio, while Beverly is in southeastern Ohio. When

      River area is closer to the Ohio-West Virginia border in the eastern part of
      the state, while Cleveland is more centrally positioned along Lake Erie.


      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison.

      Since Beverly (where the power plant is located) is further east than Cleveland
      (where Allen Theatre is located), the Allen Theatre is NOT east of the Muskingum

      the relative positions of these two lakes.


      Step 1: Let me identify the states involved.

      - Anderson Lake is in California (CA)

      - Baker Lake is in Washington (WA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Washington state is located in the northwest corner of the contiguous United
      States.

      - California is located on the west coast, south of Washington.


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning.

      - Washington is generally west of most states, bordering the Pacific Ocean.

      - California is also a western coastal state, also bordering the Pacific Ocean.

      - When comparing two states that are both on the west coast but at different
      latitudes, their east-west relationship depends on the specific locations within
      each state.


      Step 4: Looking at the specific lakes.

      - Baker Lake in Washington would be in the northwestern US.

      - Anderson Lake in California could be anywhere in California.

      - Generally, locations in California tend to be east of locations in Washington
      when comparing points at similar distances from the coast, due to the coastline''s
      orientation.


      Step 5: Considering the coastline angle.

      - The Pacific coastline angles southeast from Washington to California, meaning
      that inland points in California are often east of points in Washington.


      Based on the general geography of the United States and the orientation of the
      Pacific coastline, Anderson Lake in California is likely to be east of Baker
      Lake in Washington.


      NO


      Wait, I need to reconsider. The coastline does angle, but without the specific
      coordinates of these lakes, I can''t definitively determine their east-west
      relationship. Some parts of eastern Washington could be east of western California
      locations.

      - Anderson Lake (California) is likely in the western portion of California
      near the coast

      - Baker Lake (Washington) is in the Cascade Mountains in the western part of
      Washington


      Step 5: Analyzing east-west positioning of the specific lakes:

      - Washington state is entirely north of California

      - The western edge of Washington is slightly west of the western edge of California

      - Baker Lake is in western Washington in the Cascades

      - Washington state is in the northwest of the United States

      - California is southwest of Washington state


      Step 3: Think about east-west positioning.

      - Washington is generally east-west aligned with California

      - However, Washington is positioned more to the east than most of California


      Step 4: More specifically, Washington state is located entirely north of California,
      but their east-west positions overlap. Washington''s eastern portions extend
      further east than California''s western portions, and California''s eastern
      portions extend further east than Washington''s western portions.


      Step 5: Since we''re comparing specific lakes rather than the entire states,
      I need to consider where within their respective states these lakes are located:

      - Baker Lake in Washington is in the northwest part of the state, in the Cascade
      Mountains

      - Anderson Lake in California could be one of several lakes, but they are generally
      in the western or central parts of California

      Washington state is indeed north of California, but Washington doesn''t necessarily
      extend further west than all of California. The correct answer depends on the
      specific longitudes of these two lakes.


      Anderson Lake in California is located in the Sierra Nevada mountains in eastern

      - Washington state is in the Pacific Northwest, bordering Canada

      - California is south of Washington, along the Pacific coast


      Step 3: Think about east-west positioning.

      - Both Washington and California are on the west coast

      - Washington is entirely west of most of California

      - However, the eastern parts of California extend further east than Washington


      Step 4: For these specific lakes:

      - All Souls Church, Unitarian is located at 1500 Harvard Street NW, Washington,
      DC.

      - Foundry United Methodist Church is located at 1500 16th Street NW, Washington,
      DC.


      Step 2: Analyze the Washington, DC street grid system.

      - In DC''s grid system, numbered streets run north-south, with numbers increasing
      as you move west.

      - Letter and named streets run east-west.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      - All Souls Church is on Harvard Street NW near 16th Street

      - Foundry United Methodist is on 16th Street NW

      - 16th Street is a major north-south avenue

      - Since All Souls is near 16th Street and Foundry is directly on 16th Street,
      they are very close in east-west positioning


      Step 4: Determine precise east-west positioning.

      - All Souls Church is located slightly east of 16th Street

      - Foundry United Methodist Church is located on 16th Street

      - Therefore, All Souls would be slightly east of Foundry


      NO


      All Souls Church, Unitarian is not located east of Foundry United Methodist
      Church. It''s actually located slightly west of Foundry, as Harvard Street where
      All Souls is located is west of 16th Street where Foundry is located.'

      DC.

      - Foundry United Methodist Church is located at 1500 16th Street NW, Washington,
      DC.


      Step 2: Analyze the Washington, DC street grid system.

      - In DC''s grid system, numbered streets (like 16th Street) run north-south.

      - Lower numbers are in the east, and higher numbers are in the west.

      - 16th Street is west of 14th Street, which would be west of streets with even
      lower numbers.


      Step 3: Determine Harvard Street''s location relative to 16th Street.

      - Harvard Street NW is in the Columbia Heights/Adams Morgan area.

      - Harvard Street NW crosses 16th Street and continues on both sides of it.

      - All Souls Church is at Harvard and 16th Street (specifically at Harvard and
      15th/16th Streets).


      Step 4: Compare the specific addresses.

      - All Souls Church is near the intersection of Harvard Street and 16th Street
      NW.

      - Foundry United Methodist is on 16th Street NW between P and Q Streets.

      - 16th Street is the same north-south street for both, but Foundry is further
      south.


      Step 5: Determine east-west positioning.

      - Since both churches are essentially on or very near 16th Street NW, they are
      roughly aligned on the same north-south axis.

      - All Souls Church is actually slightly west of 16th Street (between 15th and
      16th).

      - Foundry United Methodist is directly on 16th Street.


      NO - All Souls Church is not east of Foundry United Methodist Church. They are

      All Souls Church is at Harvard Street NW, which intersects with 16th Street
      and continues eastward and westward.

      Foundry United Methodist is on 16th Street NW.


      Since All Souls Church is located further west (around Columbia Heights area)

      Step 2: Understand DC''s street grid system.

      - In Washington DC, streets running north-south are numbered (like 16th Street).

      - Streets running east-west are typically named (like Harvard Street).

      - NW indicates the northwest quadrant of the city.

      - On the numbered streets, lower numbers are further east (1st Street is east
      of 16th Street).


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      - All Souls Church is on Harvard Street NW near 16th Street.

      - Foundry United Methodist is on 16th Street NW.

      - Since both are on or near 16th Street NW, I need to be precise about their

      being between Madison Avenue and Lexington Avenue).

      - On Park Avenue specifically, even-numbered addresses (like 440) are on the
      east side of the avenue, while odd-numbered addresses (like 425) are on the
      west side.


      Step 3: Analyze their east-west positioning.

      - Since 425 Park Avenue has an odd number, it''s on the west side of Park Avenue.

      - The Drake Hotel (440 Park Avenue) had an even number, so it was on the east

      Step 1: Let me consider what I know about these theaters in New York City.

      - The Comedy Theatre was located in Manhattan at 110 W 41st Street (between
      Broadway and 6th Avenue).

      - The Gaiety Theatre was located in Manhattan at 1547 Broadway (at West 46th
      Street).


      Step 2: In Manhattan, streets run east-west, and avenues run north-south. Broadway
      runs diagonally through this grid.


      Step 3: The Comedy Theatre was between Broadway and 6th Avenue on 41st Street.
      6th Avenue is east of Broadway in this area.


      Step 4: The Gaiety Theatre was on Broadway at 46th Street.


      Step 5: Since the Comedy Theatre was between Broadway and 6th Avenue, and 6th
      Avenue is east of Broadway, the Comedy Theatre was east of Broadway.


      Step 6: Since the Gaiety Theatre was on Broadway itself, and the Comedy Theatre
      was east of Broadway, the Comedy Theatre was east of the Gaiety Theatre.


      NO


      Wait, I need to reconsider. The Comedy Theatre was on West 41st between Broadway
      and 6th Avenue. This means it was west of 6th Avenue but east of Broadway. The
      Gaiety Theatre was on Broadway at 46th Street. Since Broadway runs diagonally
      and both theaters were in relation to Broadway, I need to be more precise about
      their exact positions.


      Looking more carefully at the locations, the Comedy Theatre at 110 W 41st Street
      would be east of Broadway, while the Gaiety Theatre at 1547 Broadway would be
      on Broadway itself. Since a location east of Broadway would be east of a location
      on Broadway, the Comedy Theatre would be east of the Gaiety Theatre.

      The Comedy Theatre in New York City was located in Manhattan and was later renamed
      the Mercury Theatre.


      The Gaiety Theatre in New York City was a burlesque house located on Broadway.


      Step 2: Since both theaters were in Manhattan, I need to determine their specific
      locations.

      The Comedy/Mercury Theatre was located at 110 West 41st Street.

      The Gaiety Theatre was located at 1547 Broadway (at 46th Street).


      Step 3: In Manhattan''s grid system, "West" street addresses are west of 5th
      Avenue, and Broadway runs diagonally through the grid.

      - The Comedy Theatre at 110 West 41st Street is west of 5th Avenue

      - The Gaiety Theatre at Broadway and 46th Street would be near the intersection
      of those streets


      Step 4: Broadway runs diagonally northwest-southeast through Manhattan, so Broadway
      and 46th Street would be west of 5th Avenue but east of locations further west
      on the numbered streets.


      Step 5: 110 West 41st Street would be further west than Broadway at 46th Street.


      Since the Comedy Theatre is further west than the Gaiety Theatre, the Comedy
      Theatre is NOT east of the Gaiety Theatre.

      - Comedy Theatre was between Broadway and 6th Avenue on West 41st Street.

      - Gaiety Theatre was on Broadway at West 46th Street.

      - Broadway is east of 6th Avenue.

      - Since the Comedy Theatre was between Broadway and 6th Avenue, it was west

      Step 1: Let me check if these specific theaters exist in New York City.

      The Comedy Theatre was a Broadway theater that opened in 1909 and was later
      renamed the Mercury Theatre in 1937. It was located at 110 West 41st Street.


      The Gaiety Theatre was a Broadway theater that operated from 1909 until 1982.
      It was located at 1547 Broadway (at West 46th Street).


      Step 2: Compare the addresses to determine their east-west positions.

      In Manhattan''s grid system, "West" street addresses run east-west, with lower
      numbers being further east. Broadway runs at an angle through Manhattan.


      The Comedy Theatre was at 110 West 41st Street, which means it was relatively
      far east on 41st Street.

      The Gaiety Theatre was at 1547 Broadway near West 46th Street, which would place
      it in Times Square.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      uptown. At 41st Street, Broadway is between 6th and 7th Avenues, and at 46th
      Street, Broadway is between 7th and 8th Avenues.


      Step 5: Since the Comedy Theatre was between Broadway and 6th Avenue, it was

      It was later renamed the Mercury Theatre.

      - The Gaiety Theatre was located at 1547 Broadway (at West 46th Street) in Manhattan.


      Step 2: Let me analyze their positions relative to Broadway.

      - The Comedy Theatre was east of Broadway on 41st Street.

      - The Gaiety Theatre was on Broadway itself at 46th Street.


      Step 3: Consider the Manhattan grid system.

      - In Manhattan, locations east of Broadway are generally considered more easterly
      than locations on Broadway at the same or different street numbers.

      - Since the Comedy Theatre was explicitly east of Broadway, while the Gaiety
      Theatre was on Broadway itself, the Comedy Theatre would be further east.


      Based on this reasoning, the Comedy Theatre was located east of the Gaiety Theatre

      Step 1: Let me identify where Solar Star is located in California.

      Solar Star is a large solar farm located in Kern County, California, in the
      Antelope Valley region. This places it in Southern California, north of Los
      Angeles.

      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      In California, locations are generally considered "east" of others if they are
      further inland (away from the Pacific Ocean). Beverly Hills is closer to the
      coast, while the Antelope Valley/Kern County area is further inland.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Solar Star is located in the Antelope Valley, which is northeast of Los Angeles.
      Beverly Hills is west of downtown Los Angeles. Therefore, Solar Star is east
      of 9454 Wilshire Boulevard.


      NO.


      Wait, I need to verify this. Looking at California geography more carefully:

      - Solar Star is in the western Mojave Desert

      - Beverly Hills is closer to the Pacific coast

      - Camanche Reservoir is in the Sierra Nevada foothills of California, in Amador,
      Calaveras, and San Joaquin counties, in the central part of California.

      - The Charles E. Nelson House is likely in western Oregon, as most of Oregon''s
      historical settlements are in the western part of the state.

      houses in Oregon versus the known location of Camanche Reservoir.

      - Camanche Reservoir is in the central-eastern part of California, while most
      historical sites in Oregon tend to be in the western part of the state.


      Based on this analysis, Camanche Reservoir in California is likely east of the

      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Oregon is located north of California on the west coast of the United States.

      - In terms of east-west positioning, Oregon and California share roughly the
      same longitude range, with both states spanning from the Pacific coast eastward.

      - Without specific information about the exact location of the Charles E. Nelson
      House in Oregon, I need to consider the general geography.


      Step 4: Apply geographical reasoning.

      - Since Oregon is directly north of California, and both states span similar
      longitude ranges, the east-west relationship depends on their specific locations
      within each state.

      - Camanche Reservoir is in the central-eastern part of California.

      - Most historical houses and structures in Oregon would be in the western part
      of the state where population centers are located.


      Based on the typical distribution of historical structures in Oregon (usually

      Step 2: Let me identify the location of Charles E. Nelson House, OR.

      The Charles E. Nelson House is located in Oregon. Oregon is entirely north of
      California, and extends from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Snake River
      in the east.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning.

      California and Oregon share the same general north-south alignment along the
      Pacific coast. Oregon is directly north of California.


      Since Oregon is north of California, and both states span from the Pacific Ocean
      eastward, I need to compare the specific east-west coordinates of these locations.


      Camanche Reservoir is in the Sierra foothills of California, which is somewhat
      inland from the coast but not in the far eastern portion of California.


      The Charles E. Nelson House in Oregon is likely in the western portion of Oregon

      Step 5: Wilson Lake is located in central Kansas, in the north-central part
      of the state.


      Step 6: Lake Francis Case is a reservoir on the Missouri River, which forms
      the eastern border of South Dakota. This places Lake Francis Case in the eastern

      Wilson Lake is in central Kansas, while Lake Francis Case is in eastern South
      Dakota. The Missouri River runs north-south along eastern South Dakota, meaning
      Lake Francis Case is likely further east than Wilson Lake, which is in central

      coordinates. The Basilica is located in the Mount Vernon neighborhood of Baltimore,
      while the Mechanic Theatre was on Charles Street in the central downtown area.


      Step 4: Checking their relative east-west positioning.

      In Baltimore, the Basilica is located on Cathedral Street between Mulberry Street
      and Franklin Street. The Mechanic Theatre was located on Charles Street at the

      downtown Fort Worth.

      - The Blackstone Hotel in Fort Worth is located at 601 Main Street, also in
      downtown Fort Worth.


      Step 2: Determine the directional relationship between these streets.

      - Main Street also runs east-west in downtown Fort Worth.

      - Houston Street is west of Main Street in the downtown grid.


      Step 3: Based on their street addresses, I can determine their relative positions.

      - Since Houston Street is west of Main Street, and the Flatiron Building is
      on Houston Street while the Blackstone Hotel is on Main Street, the Flatiron
      Building is west of the Blackstone Hotel.

      - This means the Blackstone Hotel is east of the Flatiron Building (not the

      - Keller Auditorium is in the SW (southwest) quadrant of Portland.

      - Mission Theater and Pub is in the NW (northwest) quadrant of Portland.


      Step 3: Determine east-west relationship.

      - In Portland''s addressing system, NW is west of SW.

      - Therefore, a location in SW Portland would be east of a location in NW Portland.

      - Since Keller Auditorium is in SW Portland and Mission Theater is in NW Portland,
      Keller Auditorium is east of Mission Theater and Pub.


      NO.

      of Long Island, in Nassau County, NY.


      Step 2: Let me identify the location of Most Holy Trinity Church in Mamaroneck,
      NY.

      Mamaroneck is a town in Westchester County, NY, which is located north of New
      York City along the Long Island Sound.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Westchester County (where Mamaroneck is located) is on the mainland north of
      New York City, while Glenwood Landing is on Long Island''s North Shore. On a
      west-to-east axis, Long Island extends eastward from New York City, while Westchester
      is more directly north of the city.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Glenwood Generating Station on Long Island would be east of Most Holy Trinity
      Church in Mamaroneck, as Long Island is east of the mainland where Mamaroneck
      is located.


      NO


      Wait, I need to double-check this. Looking more carefully at the geography:

      - Mamaroneck is in southern Westchester County, on the Long Island Sound

      - Glenwood Landing is on the North Shore of Long Island

      - When comparing their positions on a map, Glenwood Landing is indeed east of
      Mamaroneck

      are generally east of locations in Westchester County (like Mamaroneck).


      Step 5: Specifically, Glenwood Landing is on the western portion of Long Island,
      but still east of Westchester County where Mamaroneck is located.


      NO, Glenwood Generating Station is not east of Most Holy Trinity Church in Mamaroneck.
      It is actually west of it.


      Wait, I need to verify this. Let me reconsider the geography more carefully...


      Upon further consideration, Mamaroneck is in southern Westchester County along
      the Long Island Sound, while Glenwood Landing is on the North Shore of Long
      Island. When looking at a map of the New York metropolitan area, Westchester
      County (including Mamaroneck) is indeed west of Long Island (including Glenwood
      Landing).


      Therefore, my final answer is:


      YES, Glenwood Generating Station, NY is located east of Most Holy Trinity Church,
      Mamaroneck, NY.'
    c13bef8c-93bc-415d-bba5-83d1bba009d8: 'I''ll solve this step by step to determine
      the relative positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Glenwood Generating Station is located in Glenwood, NY, which is part of Yonkers
      in Westchester County, on the Hudson River.

      - Most Holy Trinity Church in Mamaroneck, NY is located in Mamaroneck, which
      is also in Westchester County, but on the Long Island Sound.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a map.

      - Yonkers/Glenwood is in western Westchester County, directly along the Hudson
      River.

      - Mamaroneck is in southern Westchester County, along the Long Island Sound.

      - In New York, the Hudson River runs roughly north-south on the western edge
      of Westchester, while the Long Island Sound is on the southern/southeastern
      edge.


      Step 3: Compare east-west positioning.

      - Locations along the Hudson River (like Glenwood) are generally the westernmost
      parts of Westchester County.

      - Locations along the Long Island Sound (like Mamaroneck) are generally east
      of the Hudson River locations.

      - Mamaroneck is east of Yonkers/Glenwood.


      Therefore, Glenwood Generating Station is NOT east of Most Holy Trinity Church.
      The generating station is west of the church.

      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Long Island (where Glenwood is) extends eastward from New York City, while Westchester
      County (where Mamaroneck is) is north and slightly west of New York City. When
      comparing locations in the New York metro area, Long Island locations are generally
      east of Westchester County locations.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Glenwood Generating Station is on Long Island and Mamaroneck is in Westchester
      County, Glenwood Generating Station would be east of Most Holy Trinity Church

      Theatre.


      NO.


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me correct this:


      If the Balboa Theatre is on Fourth Avenue and the San Diego Civic Theatre is
      on Third Avenue, then the Balboa Theatre would be east of the San Diego Civic
      Theatre (since Fourth Avenue is east of Third Avenue in a typical grid system).
