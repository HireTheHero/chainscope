      by the Roosevelt Dam on the Salt River.


      3. Blue Ridge Reservoir is also located in Gila County, in the Mogollon Rim
      area.


      4. Looking at their precise locations, Blue Ridge Reservoir is located northwest
      of Theodore Roosevelt Lake.


      5. Since Blue Ridge Reservoir is northwest of Theodore Roosevelt Lake, Theodore
      Roosevelt Lake is located southeast of Blue Ridge Reservoir.


      6. This means Theodore Roosevelt Lake is NOT east of Blue Ridge Reservoir.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      2. Then, I''ll locate the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines

      3. Then I''ll determine their relative east-west positioning


      Step 1: St. Ambrose Cathedral is located at 607 High Street in Des Moines, which
      is in the central part of the city.


      Step 2: The Civic Center of Greater Des Moines is located at 221 Walnut Street

      Step 3: Comparing their locations:

      - St. Ambrose Cathedral is at High Street

      - The Civic Center is at Walnut Street

      - Checking a map of Des Moines, Walnut Street is west of High Street


      Therefore, the Civic Center is WEST of St. Ambrose Cathedral, not east.

      4. Downtown Milwaukee (where the Repertory Theater is) is located south and
      east of the northern area where Miller High Life Theatre is.


      5. Therefore, the Milwaukee Repertory Theater is indeed located east of Miller
      High Life Theatre.

      3. To determine east/west positioning, I''ll consider their precise downtown
      locations:

      - Milwaukee Repertory Theater is located slightly west of Miller High Life Theatre

      - This means the Rep Theater is WEST of Miller High Life Theatre


      4. The question asks: "Is Milwaukee Repertory Theater east of Miller High Life
      Theatre?"

      - Since the Rep Theater is west of Miller High Life Theatre, the answer is NO


      NO'

      - In Manhattan, south is considered "lower" on the street grid

      - However, the question specifically asks about east/west location


      4. In Manhattan''s grid system:

      2. Next, I''ll locate the Drake Hotel

      - The Drake Hotel is located at 440 Park Avenue, between 56th and 57th Streets

      - This is also in Midtown Manhattan


      3. Compare their locations

      - Both addresses are on Park Avenue

      - 425 Park Avenue is at a lower (southern) street number than the Drake Hotel

      - In Manhattan, lower street numbers are generally south/east of higher street
      numbers

      - Therefore, 425 Park Avenue is south/east of the Drake Hotel


      4. Conclusion: YES, 425 Park Avenue is located east of Drake Hotel.

    4543cf32-172d-4986-ba26-adc4947a2cde: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate 425 Park Avenue:

      - This is in Midtown Manhattan

      - Park Avenue runs north-south

      - Its location is between 55th and 56th Streets


      2. Next, I''ll locate Drake Hotel:

      - The Drake Hotel is located at 440 Park Avenue

      - It is between 56th and 57th Streets


      3. Comparing their locations:

      - Both are on Park Avenue

      - Drake Hotel is located at a higher street number (440) compared to 425 Park
      Avenue

      - This means Drake Hotel is further north


      4. In Manhattan''s grid system:

      - North is considered "up"

      - East would be to the right when facing north

      - West would be to the left when facing north


      5. Since Drake Hotel is further north, and 425 Park Avenue is south of it, they
      are on the same street (Park Avenue)


      6. Therefore, 425 Park Avenue is NOT east of Drake Hotel.

      House is in Oregon (further west), Camanche Reservoir would be east of the Charles
      E. Nelson House

      4. Comparing their east-west positions

      - Since Florida is entirely east of Kentucky, any point in Florida will be east
      of any point in Kentucky


      5. Therefore, Cathedral of Saint Jude the Apostle in St. Petersburg, FL is east
      of Alice Lloyd College, KY
