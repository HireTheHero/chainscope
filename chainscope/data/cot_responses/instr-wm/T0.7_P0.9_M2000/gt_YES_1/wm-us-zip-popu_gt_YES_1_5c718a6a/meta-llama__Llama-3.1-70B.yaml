      1. **Identify the locations**: Both zip codes are located in California (CA).
      This means we''re comparing areas within the same state.


      2. **Find population data**: To determine the population of each area, we would
      typically consult sources like the United States Census Bureau or other demographic
      data sources. However, since this interaction is text-based and doesn''t provide
      real-time access to databases, I''ll rely on general knowledge and available

      - **95833, CA**: This zip code is associated with Sacramento, California. Sacramento
      is the capital of California and a major city, suggesting a potentially larger
      population.

      - **95826, CA**: This zip code is also associated with Sacramento, California.
      However, without specific population data, it''s challenging to determine if
      it''s more or less populous than 95833, CA.


      Based on general knowledge and the fact that both zip codes are associated with
      Sacramento, it''s reasonable to assume that 95833, CA and 95826, CA have similar
      populations. However, without specific population figures for each zip code,
      a definitive comparison can''t be made.

      major city known for its diverse population and urban development.

      - **84116, UT**: This zip code is associated with Salt Lake City, Utah. Salt
      Lake City is the capital and most populous city in Utah.

      populous than 72903, AR, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the zip codes**: The zip codes in question are 02215 for Massachusetts
      (MA) and 72903 for Arkansas (AR).

      2. **Understand the comparison**: The question is asking whether the area covered
      by the zip code 02215 in Massachusetts has a larger population than the area
      covered by the zip code 72903 in Arkansas.

      3. **Find population data**: To answer this question accurately, we would ideally
      look up the latest population data for each zip code. This information can typically
      be found through the United States Census Bureau or other reliable sources.
      However, without access to real-time data or specific census information in
      this format, we''ll rely on general knowledge and available data up to my last
      update.


      Given the constraints of this interaction and the need to provide a YES or NO
      answer, I''ll provide a general approach based on available information and
      understanding:


      - **02215, MA**: This zip code is associated with Boston, Massachusetts. Boston
      is a significant city, suggesting a potentially larger population.

      - **72903, AR**: This zip code is associated with Fort Smith, Arkansas. Fort
      Smith is a smaller city, suggesting a potentially smaller population.


      Based on these general understandings, it''s reasonable to assume that 02215,
      MA (Boston) might have a larger population than 72903, AR (Fort Smith). However,
      without access to specific, up-to-date population figures, this conclusion is
      based on general knowledge and typical population trends rather than precise
      census data.

      \ is located in Maine (ME).\n\n2. **Understand what needs to be compared**:\n\
      \   - The question is asking whether the population of the area covered by the\

      \ to a zip code in Indiana (IN).\n\n2. **Understand the question**: \n   - The\
      \ question is asking whether the population of the area covered by the zip code\
      \ 74554 in Oklahoma is greater than the population of the area covered by the\
      \ zip code 47405 in Indiana.\n\n3. **Find population data for each zip code**:\n\
      \   - Without access to real-time data or specific databases as of my last update,\
      \ I'll rely on general knowledge and the understanding that precise population\
      \ figures for specific zip codes can vary over time and might require current\
      \ data sources like the United States Census Bureau for accurate comparison.\n\
      \n4. **Compare the populations**:\n   - Given the lack of specific, up-to-date\
      \ population figures in this format, a precise comparison can't be made directly.\

      \ Census Bureau's website or other demographic data sources that provide population\
      \ figures by zip code.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since I don't have access\
      \ to real-time or the most current data as of my last update, and without specific\
      \ population figures for these zip codes, a definitive answer based on the most\
      \ recent data cannot be provided in this format. However, for the purpose of\
      \ this exercise and acknowledging the requirement for a YES or NO answer, I\
      \ must proceed based on the understanding that such a comparison would typically\
      \ require consulting the latest census data or demographic reports.\n\nGiven\
      \ these steps and the nature of the question, the answer would depend on the\
      \ most current population data available for each zip code. Without access to\
      \ this specific data in this format, I must provide an answer based on the assumption\
      \ that the question seeks a comparison that would typically be informed by census\

      \ Illinois.\n\n2. **Understand what is being compared**:\n   - We are comparing\
