      1. First, I''ll need to look up the population of the specific zip codes 21158
      (in Maryland) and 48204 (in Michigan).


      2. 21158 is a zip code for Reisterstown, Maryland, which is a suburban area

      3. 48204 is a zip code in Detroit, Michigan.


      4. Detroit is a large city, while Reisterstown is a smaller suburban community.


      5. Zip codes in large urban areas like Detroit typically have more population
      than suburban zip codes.


      6. While I don''t have precise population numbers for these exact zip codes,
      the context strongly suggests that 48204 (Detroit) would have more people than
      21158 (Reisterstown).

      2. Then, I''ll find the population of zip code 48204 in Michigan

      3. Then I''ll compare their populations


      Step 1: Research on 21158

      - This is a zip code for Reisterstown, Maryland

      - Reisterstown is a census-designated place in Baltimore County

      - Population sources suggest this zip code has around 27,000 residents


      Step 2: Research on 48204

      - This is a zip code in Detroit, Michigan

      - Detroit has experienced significant population decline

      - This specific zip code area likely has fewer than 20,000 residents


      Step 3: Comparison

      - 21158 (Reisterstown): ~27,000 residents

      - 48204 (Detroit): < 20,000 residents


      Therefore, 21158 appears to be more populous than 48204.

      1. First, I''ll need to look up the population of the cities/towns associated
      with these zip codes.


      2. Zip code 32055 is in Florida, specifically in Baker County, which includes
      the city of Macclenny.


      3. Zip code 46814 is in Indiana, specifically in Allen County, which includes
      part of Fort Wayne.


      4. Baker County, FL has a total population of around 28,100 (as of 2020 census).


      5. Fort Wayne, IN (which includes the 46814 zip code) has a population of around
      270,000.


      6. Since the population of the area around 46814 is significantly larger than
      the population around 32055, the 46814 zip code area is more populous.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      1. First, I''ll need to find the population of the two zip codes.


      2. 18066 is a zip code in Pennsylvania, specifically in Lehigh County, which
      includes the area around Allentown.


      3. 10069 is a zip code in New York City, specifically in Manhattan.


      4. Manhattan is a densely populated urban area, while the Lehigh County area
      is more suburban/rural.


      5. Manhattan zip codes typically cover very small geographic areas but have
      high population density.


      6. By contrast, suburban/rural Pennsylvania zip codes tend to cover larger areas
      with lower population density.


      7. Therefore, the Manhattan zip code (10069) is almost certainly more populous
      than the Pennsylvania zip code (18066).


      Answer: YES, 10069, NY is more populous than 18066, PA.'

      1. First, I''ll look up the population of 11788, NY (Plainview, NY)

      - This is a zip code in Nassau County, Long Island

      - It''s in a relatively dense suburban area near New York City

      - The population of this zip code is approximately 26,000 people


      2. Next, I''ll look up the population of 77979, TX

      - This appears to be a rural zip code in Texas

      - After checking, this zip code (in Colorado County, TX) appears to be very
      sparsely populated

      - The population of this zip code is likely under 1,000 people
