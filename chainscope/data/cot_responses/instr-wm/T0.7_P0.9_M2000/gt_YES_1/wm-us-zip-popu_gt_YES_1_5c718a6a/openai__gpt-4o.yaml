      99224 covers areas around Spokane International Airport as well as parts of
      the city and its suburbs.


      2. **ZIP Code 60108, IL**: This ZIP code is associated with Bloomingdale, Illinois.
      Bloomingdale is a suburban area located in DuPage County, part of the Chicago
      metropolitan area.


      Next, we need to compare the populations of these two areas:


      - Spokane, including its suburban areas, generally has a larger population than
      smaller suburban areas like Bloomingdale because it is a major city.

      - Bloomingdale, being a suburb of Chicago, might have a moderate population,
      but it is unlikely to surpass that of a larger city like Spokane.


      Based on the typical population sizes of these areas:


      - Spokane (99224) is likely more populous than Bloomingdale (60108).

      population data for each area.


      Step 1: Identify the areas associated with the zip codes.

      - Zip code 19066 corresponds to Merion Station, Pennsylvania.

      - Zip code 24482 corresponds to Verona, Virginia.


      Step 2: Research and compare the population data for each area.

      - Merion Station (19066) is a suburban area located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania,
      which is part of the Philadelphia metropolitan area. This area is generally
      known to be more densely populated.

      - Verona (24482) is a smaller community located in Augusta County, Virginia,
      which is more rural and less densely populated compared to suburban Philadelphia
      areas.


      Step 3: Analyze typical population characteristics of these areas.

      - Suburban areas near large cities, like Merion Station, typically have higher
      populations than rural areas.

      - Although specific numbers are needed for a definitive comparison, the general
      knowledge of these regions suggests that Merion Station is likely more populous.

      Step 1: Identify the areas these zip codes cover.

      - 89081 is a zip code in North Las Vegas, Nevada. North Las Vegas is part of
      the Las Vegas metropolitan area, which is known for its relatively high population
      density.

      - 54313 is a zip code in Green Bay, Wisconsin, specifically covering areas like
      Howard and Suamico. Green Bay is smaller in population compared to Las Vegas.


      Step 2: Consider the general population trends for these regions.

      - The Las Vegas metropolitan area, including North Las Vegas, has experienced
      significant population growth over the past few decades.

      - While Green Bay and its surrounding areas have also grown, they generally
      have a smaller population compared to the Las Vegas area.


      Step 3: Use available data or estimates.

      - Based on available data, North Las Vegas, including zip code 89081, is likely

      due to students, faculty, and staff.


      2. **13116, NY:** This zip code covers Minoa, a village in New York. Minoa is
      part of the Syracuse metropolitan area but is considerably smaller and more
      residential.


      Given that Corvallis, with its university presence, is likely to have a higher
      population than Minoa, the zip code 97331 in Oregon is expected to be more populous.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'

      Step 1: Gather population data for each zip code.

      - 75206 is a zip code in Dallas, Texas, which is a part of a major metropolitan
      area. Zip codes in such areas typically have higher populations.

      - 47630 is a zip code in Newburgh, Indiana, which is a smaller town outside
      of Evansville, Indiana.


      Step 2: Consider the general characteristics of the regions.

      - Dallas, TX, being a large urban area, tends to have zip codes with higher
      populations due to higher density and larger population in general.

      - Newburgh, IN, being a smaller town, likely has a lower population density
      and overall population.

      75230 in Texas.


      ### Step 1: Identify the Areas

      - **ZIP code 60487** is located in Tinley Park, Illinois.

      - **ZIP code 75230** is located in Dallas, Texas.


      ### Step 2: Consider Population Data

      - **Tinley Park (60487)**: Tinley Park is a suburb of Chicago and is known for
      being a populous area within Illinois. While it is not the most populous suburb,
      it has a significant population.

      - **Dallas (75230)**: Dallas is a large city in Texas, and ZIP code 75230 covers
      a portion of North Dallas. This area is known for being affluent and residential,
      but not necessarily the most densely populated in the city.


      ### Step 3: Analyze General Trends

      - Generally, suburban areas like Tinley Park have fewer people than urban areas
      like Dallas.

      - However, specific ZIP code populations can vary significantly depending on
      housing density, land area, and other factors.


      ### Step 4: Conclusion

      Without specific and current population data for each ZIP code, it is challenging
      to determine which is definitively more populous. However, given that 75230
      is part of a large urban area, it is reasonable to infer that it likely has
      a higher population density than the suburban area of 60487.


      ### Final Answer

      Based on general trends and typical urban versus suburban population densities,
      the answer is likely:

      **NO**, 60487, IL is not more populous than 75230, TX.'
