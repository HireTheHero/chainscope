      \ like 18066 typically have fewer residents.  \n- Manhattan ZIP codes generally\
      \ have higher populations, but 10069 is a small area near the Hudson River with\
      \ a limited number of residential buildings.  \n\nStep 4: Verify existing data\
      \  \n- Estimates suggest that 10069 has a relatively small population (a few\
      \ thousand residents), as it primarily consists of a few residential high-rises.\
      \  \n- 18066, while rural, has a population in the range of a few thousand as\
      \ well.  \n\nConclusion: While 10069 is in a dense urban area, its specific\
      \ population is small compared to other Manhattan ZIP codes. However, 18066,\
      \ covering a larger rural area, still likely has more residents.  \n\n**Final\
      \ Answer: YES** (18066, PA is more populous than 10069, NY)."
