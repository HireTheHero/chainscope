      1.  **Identify Book 1:** *The Mousetrap and Other Plays* by Agatha Christie.
      This is a collection of plays.

      2.  **Find Page Count for Book 1:** Page counts can vary significantly between
      editions (paperback, hardcover, publisher, included plays). However, a commonly
      available paperback edition (e.g., HarperCollins, ISBN 978-0007136513) which
      includes 8 plays has **896 pages**.

      3.  **Identify Book 2:** *Azincourt* by Bernard Cornwell. This is a standalone
      novel.

      4.  **Find Page Count for Book 2:** Again, page counts vary by edition. A common
      paperback edition (e.g., HarperCollins, ISBN 978-0007271177) has **512 pages**.
      A common hardcover edition might have around 464 pages.

      5.  **Compare Page Counts:** Compare the page count of the Christie collection
      (~896 pages) to the page count of Cornwell''s novel (~464-512 pages).

      1.  **Identify the first book and author:** The question specifies *Aurora Rising*
      by Alastair Reynolds.

      2.  **Verify the first book''s details:** There seems to be a common confusion
      here. The popular Young Adult science fiction novel *Aurora Rising* was written
      by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff, **not** Alastair Reynolds. Alastair Reynolds
      is a different science fiction author known for works like *Revelation Space*.
      Assuming the question *intends* to ask about the well-known book titled *Aurora
      Rising* (despite the incorrect author attribution), we''ll look up its page
      count.

      3.  **Find the page count for *Aurora Rising* (by Kaufman and Kristoff):** Common
      editions (like the US Hardcover) have **473 pages**.

      4.  **Identify the second book and author:** *Atheist Delusions: The Christian
      Revolution and Its Fashionable Enemies* by David Bentley Hart.

      5.  **Find the page count for *Atheist Delusions*:** Common editions (like the
      Yale University Press paperback) have **272 pages**.

      6.  **Compare the page counts:** Compare 473 pages (*Aurora Rising*) with 272
      pages (*Atheist Delusions*).

      7.  **Conclusion:** 473 is greater than 272. Therefore, *Aurora Rising* (by
      Kaufman and Kristoff, the likely intended book) has more pages than *Atheist
      Delusions*.

      1.  **Identify the first book:** *The Cabinet of Curiosities* by Douglas Preston
      (and Lincoln Child).

      2.  **Find its page count:** The page count varies slightly by edition (e.g.,
      hardcover vs. paperback). A common hardcover edition has 608 pages, while a
      common mass market paperback has 672 pages.

      3.  **Identify the second book:** *The Codex* by Douglas Preston.

      4.  **Find its page count:** Again, the page count varies by edition. A common
      hardcover edition has 432 pages, while a common mass market paperback has 480
      pages.

      5.  **Compare the page counts:** Compare the page counts of representative editions.
      608 (or 672) pages for *The Cabinet of Curiosities* is greater than 432 (or
      480) pages for *The Codex*.

      6.  **Conclusion:** *The Cabinet of Curiosities* has more pages than *The Codex*.

      1.  **Identify the first book:** *The Cabinet of Curiosities* by Douglas Preston
      (co-authored with Lincoln Child).

      2.  **Find its page count:** We need to look up the page count for a standard
      edition. Common editions (like the Warner Books paperback) list around 672 pages,
      while the hardcover is often listed around 560-580 pages.

      3.  **Identify the second book:** *The Codex* by Douglas Preston.

      4.  **Find its page count:** We need to look up the page count for a standard
      edition. Common editions (like the Forge hardcover) list around 384-400 pages,
      while paperbacks are often around 460-480 pages.

      5.  **Compare the page counts:** Compare the typical page counts found in steps
      2 and 4. Even comparing the shortest common edition of *Cabinet* (~560 pages)
      to the longest common edition of *Codex* (~480 pages), *The Cabinet of Curiosities*
      has more pages. Comparing similar formats (e.g., paperback vs. paperback) shows
      an even larger difference (e.g., ~672 vs ~480).

      6.  **Conclusion:** *The Cabinet of Curiosities* consistently has a higher page
      count than *The Codex*.
