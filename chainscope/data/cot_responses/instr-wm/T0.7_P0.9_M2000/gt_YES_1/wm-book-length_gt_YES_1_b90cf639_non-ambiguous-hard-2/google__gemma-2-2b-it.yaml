      \ the publication date of each book:** \n   - William R. Forstchen's *1945*\
      \ was published in 2019.\n   - Arnaldur Indri\xF0ason's *Grafar\xFE\xF6gn* was\
      \ published in 2007.\n\n2. **Determine the years between the publication dates:**\n\
      \   -  2019 - 2007 = 12 years\n\n3. **Consider the difference in book publication\
      \ years:** \n   - Since the publication years are in the 21st century, and one\
      \ book is from 2019 and the other is from 2007, the years are not relevant to\
      \ the number of pages.\n\n\n**Therefore, based on the information given, we\
