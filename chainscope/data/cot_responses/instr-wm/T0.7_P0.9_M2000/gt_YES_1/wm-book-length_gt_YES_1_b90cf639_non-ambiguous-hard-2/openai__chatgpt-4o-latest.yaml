      2. Identify the page count of *Orbiting Jupiter*.

      3. Compare the two values.


      Step 1: *In the Hand of Dante* by Nick Tosches typically has around 384 pages,

    ff5679bf-788b-43b1-bffa-a54855873d07: 'Sure, let''s reason through this step by
      step to determine which book has more pages.


      Step 1: Identify the books in question.

      - Book 1: *In the Hand of Dante* by Nick Tosches.

      - Book 2: *Orbiting Jupiter* by Gary D. Schmidt.


      Step 2: Consider the typical length of each book.


      - *In the Hand of Dante* is a literary novel for adults, known for its dense,
      complex prose and philosophical themes. Literary novels for adults, especially
      those dealing with historical and metafictional themes, tend to be relatively
      long.

      - *Orbiting Jupiter* is a young adult novel. YA novels are generally shorter
      and more concise, often targeted at middle and high school readers.


      Step 3: Look up the approximate page counts.


      - *In the Hand of Dante* typically has around 384 pages, depending on the edition.

      - *Orbiting Jupiter* typically has around 192 pages, again depending on the
      edition.


      Step 4: Compare the page counts.


      - 384 pages (Tosches) vs. 192 pages (Schmidt).


      Conclusion: *In the Hand of Dante* has more pages than *Orbiting Jupiter*.

      - "Lunar Park" by Bret Easton Ellis

      - "Foe" by Iain Reid


      Step 2: Determine the approximate page count of each book.


      - "Lunar Park" is a novel by Bret Easton Ellis published in 2005. It is a full-length
      novel and generally has around 480 pages, depending on the edition.

      - "Foe" by Iain Reid, published in 2018, is a shorter novel and typically has
      around 270-300 pages, again depending on the edition.


      Step 3: Compare the page counts.


      - "Lunar Park": ~480 pages

      - "Foe": ~275-300 pages


      Conclusion: "Lunar Park" has more pages than "Foe".

      - 1634: The Bavarian Crisis is an alternate history novel co-written by Eric
      Flint and Virginia DeMarce, part of the 1632 series.

      - Thud Ridge is a memoir by Jacksel M. Broughton about his experiences flying
      combat missions during the Vietnam War.


      Step 2: Find the typical page count for each book.

      - 1634: The Bavarian Crisis typically has around 688 pages (this can vary slightly
      by edition, but this is a common number).

      - Thud Ridge typically has around 384 pages (again, may vary slightly depending
      on the edition).


      Step 3: Compare the page counts.

      - 688 (1634: The Bavarian Crisis) is greater than 384 (Thud Ridge).

      Step 1: Identify the books in question.

      - "League of Dragons" by Naomi Novik is the final book in the Temeraire series,
      which is a historical fantasy series involving dragons and the Napoleonic Wars.

      - "The Initiation" by L. J. Smith is the first book in The Secret Circle series,
      which is a young adult supernatural novel involving witches.


      Step 2: Determine the page count of each book.

      - "League of Dragons" typically has around 368 pages (this may vary slightly
      by edition, but this is a common count).

      - "The Initiation" typically has around 272 pages (again, this may vary slightly
      by edition, but this is a common count for the standalone book, not combined
      editions).


      Step 3: Compare the page counts.

      - 368 pages (League of Dragons) vs. 272 pages (The Initiation)
