      - Jon Meacham''s book about Andrew Jackson is actually titled "American Lion:
      Andrew Jackson in the White House"

      - Jodi Picoult''s "Second Glance" is a novel published in 2003

      - Story of a Girl was published in 2007

      - It has approximately 192-224 pages (depending on edition)


      3. Comparing the numbers:

      - Popcorn: ~320-336 pages

      - Story of a Girl: ~192-224 pages

      - Even taking the lowest estimate for Popcorn (320) and highest for Story of
