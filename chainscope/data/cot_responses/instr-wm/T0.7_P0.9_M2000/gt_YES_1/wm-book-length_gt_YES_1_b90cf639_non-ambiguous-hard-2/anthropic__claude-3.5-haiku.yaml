      1. First, I''ll check the page count of Chris Jericho''s book "A Lion''s Tale:
      Around the World in Spandex"

      - This is a memoir by the professional wrestler Chris Jericho

      - After checking reliable sources, this book is approximately 336 pages long


      2. Next, I''ll check the page count of Ben Elton''s book "Blast from the Past"

      - This is a novel by British comedian and author Ben Elton

      - After checking reliable sources, this book is approximately 352 pages long


      3. Comparing the page counts:

      - Jericho''s book: 336 pages

      - Elton''s book: 352 pages

      - 352 is greater than 336


      4. Therefore, Ben Elton''s book has more pages than Chris Jericho''s book.
