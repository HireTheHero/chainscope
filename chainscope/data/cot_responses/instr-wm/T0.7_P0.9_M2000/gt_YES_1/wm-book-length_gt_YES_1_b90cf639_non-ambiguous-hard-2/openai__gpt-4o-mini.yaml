    040d286b-6b1d-47c3-ad11-08fbb77c5643: 'To determine whether Agatha Christie''s
      "The Mousetrap and Other Plays" has more pages than Bernard Cornwell''s "Azincourt,"
      we need to consider the typical page counts for both books.


      1. **Agatha Christie''s "The Mousetrap and Other Plays"**: This collection includes
      "The Mousetrap" and several other plays. The page count can vary by edition,
      but it generally ranges from around 200 to 250 pages.


      2. **Bernard Cornwell''s "Azincourt"**: This historical novel typically has
      a page count of around 300 to 400 pages, depending on the edition.


      Now, comparing the two:

      - "The Mousetrap and Other Plays" is likely around 200-250 pages.

      - "Azincourt" is likely around 300-400 pages.


      Since 200-250 pages (The Mousetrap) is less than 300-400 pages (Azincourt),
      we conclude that "The Mousetrap and Other Plays" does not have more pages than
      "Azincourt."

      1. **Research the page count of "The Ice Limit":** Typically, "The Ice Limit"
      has around 400 pages, depending on the edition.


      2. **Research the page count of "Bagombo Snuff Box":** "Bagombo Snuff Box" usually
      has about 300 pages, also depending on the edition.


      3. **Compare the two page counts:** Since 400 pages (The Ice Limit) is greater

      is part of the 1632 series and typically has around 400 pages.


      2. **Identify the page count for "Thud Ridge."** - This book is a memoir about

      2. **Check the page count for "Waylander":** This is a fantasy novel by David
      Gemmell, and it generally has about 400 pages as well, again depending on the
      edition.


      3. **Compare the page counts:** If both books have around 400 pages, they are
      likely to be very similar in length. However, exact page counts can vary slightly
      based on the edition and format.


      Given that both books are often cited to have around the same number of pages,
      I would conclude that one does not significantly exceed the other.

      2. Look up the page count for "Hey Nostradamus!" by Douglas Coupland.

      3. Compare the two page counts.


      After researching, I find that "Tales of the Bounty Hunters" typically has around
      360 pages, while "Hey Nostradamus!" has around 320 pages.


      Now, comparing the two:

      - "Tales of the Bounty Hunters" (360 pages) is greater than "Hey Nostradamus!"
      (320 pages).


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      YES.'
