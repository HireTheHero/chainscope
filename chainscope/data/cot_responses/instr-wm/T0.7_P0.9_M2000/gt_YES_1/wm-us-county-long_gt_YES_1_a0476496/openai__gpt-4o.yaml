      1. Identify the location of Yates County, NY: Yates County is located in the
      Finger Lakes region of New York State. It is in the western part of New York
      State.


      2. Identify the location of Southampton County, VA: Southampton County is located
      in the southeastern part of Virginia, near the border with North Carolina.


      3. Determine the relative longitudinal positions: Since Yates County is in the
      western part of New York and Southampton County is in the southeastern part
      of Virginia, we can compare their general longitudinal positions. New York is
      generally to the north and a bit to the west of Virginia.

      2. **Locate Hill County, TX**: Hill County is located to the south of Dallas
      and Fort Worth, and it is part of the Waco metropolitan area. It is south of
      Johnson County and west of Navarro County.


      3. **Compare their relative positions**: Denton County is located to the north
      and slightly to the east of Hill County when looking at the map of Texas. However,
      when considering directly east or west, Denton County is primarily north of
      Hill County.


      Therefore, Denton County, TX is not located east of Hill County, TX in the direct
      sense.

      1. **Identify the location of Pleasants County, WV**: Pleasants County is located
      in the state of West Virginia. West Virginia is situated in the eastern part
      of the United States and is generally considered to be west of the Appalachian
      Mountains.


      2. **Identify the location of Wilkes County, NC**: Wilkes County is located
      in the state of North Carolina. North Carolina is located to the south of Virginia
      and is considered part of the southeastern United States.


      3. **Comparative location assessment**: West Virginia is situated to the north
      and slightly to the west of North Carolina. Within West Virginia, Pleasants
      County is located in the northwestern part of the state. North Carolina''s Wilkes
      County is situated in the northwestern part of the state of North Carolina.


      4. **Determine east-west positioning**: Given that West Virginia is generally
      to the west of North Carolina, and considering the specific locations of Pleasants
      County (in northwestern WV) and Wilkes County (in northwestern NC), Pleasants
      County is located to the west of Wilkes County.
