      - When comparing two points on the same eastern border, the more northern point
      is slightly more western due to the curvature of state boundaries

      3. Now I''ll compare their relative positions:

      - Kentucky is north of Tennessee

      - Breckinridge County is in western Kentucky

      - Rutherford County is in central Tennessee

      3. To determine if Rutherford is east of Breckinridge:

      - Draw an imaginary north-south line from Breckinridge down

      - If Rutherford is to the right (east) of this line, answer is YES

      - If Rutherford is to the left (west) or roughly aligned, answer is NO

      - Clallam County is in the far northwest of Washington

      - Coos County is directly on the Pacific coast in Oregon

      - Since Oregon is south of Washington, and both counties are on or near the

      3. When two locations are aligned roughly north-south along the Pacific coast,
      neither is significantly east of the other

      1. I need to determine the relative positions of Andrews County and Pecos County
      in Texas.


      2. Andrews County is in west Texas, in the Permian Basin region, near the New
      Mexico border.


      3. Pecos County is also in west Texas, but it''s further south and west than
      Andrews County.


      4. Specifically:

      - Andrews County is north and east of Pecos County

      - Several counties (like Midland, Upton, and Crane) lie between them


      5. Since Andrews County is positioned to the east of Pecos County, this is a
      straightforward answer.

      1) First, let me consider the states:

      - Conway County is in Arkansas (AR)

      - Goodhue County is in Minnesota (MN)


      2) In terms of states:

      - Arkansas is south of Minnesota

      - Minnesota is along the northern border of the US

      - Arkansas is in the south-central US


      3) Most importantly for east/west positioning:

      - Arkansas is generally west of the Mississippi River

      - Minnesota is also west of the Mississippi River

      - Both states are roughly aligned in terms of longitude

      - If anything, Minnesota is slightly east of Arkansas


      4) Looking at the specific counties:

      - Conway County is in central Arkansas

      - Goodhue County is in southeastern Minnesota

      - Goodhue County is right along the Mississippi River

      - Conway County is more toward the center of Arkansas


      Therefore, since Goodhue County is along the Mississippi River and Conway County
      is more central in Arkansas, Conway County must be WEST of Goodhue County, not
      east.

      - Hardeman County, TN is in southwest Tennessee

      - Ballard County, KY is in far western Kentucky, along the Mississippi River


      3. Since Tennessee is south of Kentucky:

      - Hardeman County is indeed south of Ballard County

      - Ballard County is at the western edge of Kentucky

      2. To determine if one is east of the other, I need to compare their relative
      positions:

      - Denton County is in the northern part of the DFW area

      - Hill County is southwest of Denton County


      3. Looking at their relative positions:

      - Denton County is positioned more to the northeast

      - Hill County is positioned more to the southwest


      4. Therefore, since Denton County lies to the northeast of Hill County, it is
      indeed east of Hill County.

      of it.

      1) First, let me recall the general locations:

      - San Juan County, NM is in northwestern New Mexico

      - Musselshell County, MT is in central Montana


      2) Since we''re comparing east-west positions, let''s think about longitude:

      - Montana is directly north of New Mexico

      - For two points on a north-south line, they would have the same longitude

      - If San Juan County, NM is in the northwest corner of New Mexico, and Musselshell
      County is in central Montana, San Juan County must be west of Musselshell County


      3) Therefore, San Juan County, NM is NOT east of Musselshell County, MT. It
      is actually west of it.

      1) First, I''ll recall the general locations:

      - San Juan County, NM is in northwestern New Mexico

      - Musselshell County, MT is in central Montana


      2) Since we''re comparing east/west positions, let''s think about longitudes:

      - Montana is north of New Mexico

      - Both states are in the western United States

      - Montana and New Mexico are roughly aligned in terms of longitude


      3) Looking more specifically:

      - San Juan County is right at the western edge of New Mexico, bordering Arizona

      - Musselshell County is in central Montana, neither at the eastern nor western
      edge


      4) Given that San Juan County is at the western edge of New Mexico, and Musselshell
      County is more centrally located in Montana, San Juan County must be further
      west.


      Therefore, San Juan County, NM is NOT east of Musselshell County, MT.

      - San Juan County, NM is in the northwestern corner of New Mexico

      - Musselshell County, MT is in central Montana


      2) Let me consider their relative positions:

      - Montana is significantly north of New Mexico

      - But we need to compare their east-west positioning


      3) To determine east vs west:

      - San Juan County, NM is right at the New Mexico-Arizona border on the west

      - Musselshell County, MT is in central Montana, roughly in the middle of the
      state

      - The western edge of New Mexico is further east than the middle of Montana
