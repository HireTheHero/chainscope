      MD, is located east of Schuyler County, NY, let''s break this down step by step:


      1. **Locate Schuyler County, NY**: Schuyler County is in the Finger Lakes region
      of New York State. It is in the western part of New York, near the Pennsylvania
      border.


      2. **Locate Prince George''s County, MD**: Prince George''s County is in the
      state of Maryland, bordering Washington, D.C., to the east. It is in the Mid-Atlantic
      region of the United States.


      3. **Compare their positions**: Maryland is generally south and east of New
      York State. Prince George''s County, MD, is located significantly further east
      than Schuyler County, NY, which is in the western part of New York.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Prince George''s County, MD, is in the eastern part
      of the Mid-Atlantic region and Schuyler County, NY, is in the western part of
      New York State, Prince George''s County is indeed east of Schuyler County.

      step by step:


      1. **Locate Wallowa County, OR**: Wallowa County is in the northeastern part
      of Oregon, near the border with Idaho. It is one of the easternmost counties
      in Oregon.


      2. **Locate Lander County, NV**: Lander County is in north-central Nevada, east
      of the Sierra Nevada mountain range and west of the Utah border. It is relatively
      central within Nevada.


      3. **Compare their longitudes**: Since Wallowa County is in northeastern Oregon
      and Lander County is in central Nevada, we can infer that Lander County is farther
      east than Wallowa County. Nevada as a whole is east of Oregon, and Lander County
      is not near the western edge of Nevada.

      of California, northeast of Sacramento. It is inland and farther east compared
      to San Luis Obispo County.


      3. **Compare their positions**: Since San Luis Obispo County is on the coast
      and El Dorado County is inland and farther east, San Luis Obispo County is **west**
      of El Dorado County, not east.


      **Final Answer**: NO.'

      2. **Locate Sheboygan County, WI**: Sheboygan County is also in southeastern
      Wisconsin, but it is located north of Ozaukee County. It borders Lake Michigan
      to the east.


      3. **Compare their positions**: Since both counties are along Lake Michigan,
      we can determine their relative east-west positions by looking at their locations
      along the lake''s shoreline. Ozaukee County is south of Sheboygan County, and
      Sheboygan County extends further north along the lake. However, both counties
      are roughly aligned along the same longitudinal line (east-west position).


      4. **Conclusion**: Sheboygan County is not east of Ozaukee County; it is north
      of Ozaukee County. Their east-west positions are roughly the same.
