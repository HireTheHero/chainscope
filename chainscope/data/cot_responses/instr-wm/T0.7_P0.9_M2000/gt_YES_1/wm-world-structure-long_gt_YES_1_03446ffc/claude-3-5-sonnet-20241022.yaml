      1) First, let me locate Haldia Energy Power Station

      - It is located in Haldia, West Bengal, India

      - Haldia is on the western bank of the Hooghly River (a distributary of Ganges)


      2) Now, let me locate Raichak

      - Raichak is also located on the western bank of the Hooghly River

      - It is north of Haldia


      3) Comparing their positions:

      - Both are on the western bank of the river

      - Haldia is south of Raichak

      - When facing the river from either location, east is across the river

      - Since Haldia is south of Raichak, it is actually southeast of Raichak


      Therefore: NO - Haldia Energy Power Station is not east of Raichak. It is southeast
      of Raichak.'

      2) To determine if one is east of the other, I need to compare their relative
      positions:

      - Palmers Green station is in the N7 postal area

      - St Dunstan-in-the-West is in the EC4 area

      - Palmers Green is situated in the western part of north London

      - St Dunstan-in-the-West is in the City of London


      3) Looking at their positions:

      - Palmers Green is slightly to the west of a north-south line

      - St Dunstan-in-the-West is further east in central London


      4) Conclusion:

      Palmers Green station is actually WEST of St Dunstan-in-the-West, not east.

      3. Looking at the map, St Anne''s Cathedral is positioned on the eastern side
      of Donegall Street


      4. Tribeca Belfast development is on the western side of Donegall Street


      5. Therefore, St Anne''s Cathedral is located to the east of the Tribeca Belfast
      development

      - Sutton Coldfield Town Hall is in Sutton Coldfield, near Birmingham in the
      West Midlands of England

      - Rockbourne Roman Villa is in Hampshire, southern England


      2) Let me consider their relative positions:

      - Sutton Coldfield is in the West Midlands region, roughly in the center of
      England

      - Rockbourne is in Hampshire, which is in southern England and relatively central
      on an east-west axis


      3) Comparing their positions:

      - Sutton Coldfield is significantly north of Rockbourne

      - On an east-west axis, Sutton Coldfield is slightly west of Rockbourne


      4) Since Sutton Coldfield is WEST of Rockbourne, its Town Hall cannot be east
      of the Roman Villa.
