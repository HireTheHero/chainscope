      3. **Determine relative positions:** Haldia is further south along the Hooghly
      River than Raichak.  Therefore, Haldia is downstream from Raichak.


      4. **Consider East/West vs. Downstream/Upstream:** The Hooghly River flows generally
      south in this region. While Haldia might be slightly southeast of Raichak, the
      question specifically asks about East.  Since Haldia is primarily *south* and
      only slightly east, it is not predominantly east.

      southwards, and Haldia is downstream (closer to the sea) from Raichak, Haldia
      would be located south of Raichak, not east.

      of Bath Abbey. Since it''s northeast, it *is* east (as well as north).

      a reference point. Bath Abbey is a prominent landmark in the city of Bath, England.


      2. **Locate St. John''s Church:**  There are several St. John''s Churches in

      3. **Determine relative position:**  Consulting a map is the best way to do
      this.  A quick search shows St. John''s Church is slightly northeast of Bath
      Abbey.

      a prominent landmark in the center of Bath, England.


      2. **Locate St John''s Church:** There are a few St. John''s Churches in Bath.  Assuming
      the question refers to St. John the Baptist Church, it is generally considered
      the main St. John''s Church and is located near the city center.


      3. **Relative positions:** Consulting a map reveals St. John the Baptist Church
      is slightly northeast of Bath Abbey.  Northeast implies it is both north *and*
      east.


      4. **Eastward component:** Since St. John''s is northeast of the Abbey, it is
      definitely located east of it (as well as north).

      to do this. Looking at a map of Bath, St. John the Baptist Church, South Parade
      is located slightly south-east of Bath Abbey.

      east.

      finding its location (likely through online search or knowledge).  Let''s assume

      York City.

      2. Broadway runs roughly north-south, and street numbers increase as you go
      north.

      3. Vestry Street runs roughly east-west, and street numbers increase as you
      go west.

      4. A higher Broadway address means further north.

      5. A higher Vestry Street address means further west.

      6.  We need to determine if going further north along Broadway also puts you
      further east compared to a lower numbered location on Vestry.


      7.  Manhattan''s street grid is mostly regular, but Broadway cuts diagonally
      across the grid.  Lower Manhattan, where these addresses are, generally has
      streets running east-west becoming more northwesterly as you go north.


      8. Therefore, a higher numbered address on Broadway *is* likely further east
      than a lower numbered address on Vestry Street, especially in lower Manhattan.

      is part of Rockefeller Center, located between 5th and 6th Avenues.  Since avenues

      Holy Trinity Church is located at the intersection of Broadway and Wall Street.

      quick search shows Holy Trinity Church is on Wall Street and Broadway, while
      75 Rockefeller Plaza is, well, on Rockefeller Plaza.


      2. **Establish general east/west relationship:** Rockefeller Plaza is in midtown
      Manhattan, while Wall Street is in lower Manhattan.  Lower Manhattan is generally
      south of Midtown.  However, the question is about East/West.


      3. **Consider the specific streets:**  Broadway runs diagonally, but in lower
      Manhattan, it runs roughly north-south.  Rockefeller Plaza is considerably west
      of Broadway.


      4. **Determine East/West relative positions:** Since Holy Trinity is on Broadway
      and 75 Rockefeller Plaza is west of Broadway, Holy Trinity must be east of 75
      Rockefeller Plaza.

      Trinity is, it''s oriented more North-South.


      3. **Relative Positions:** Rockefeller Center is in Midtown Manhattan. Wall
      Street is in Lower Manhattan, significantly south of Midtown.  Lower Manhattan
      is also generally east of the avenues where Rockefeller Center is located.


      4. **East-West Relationship:** Since Holy Trinity is south *and* east of Rockefeller
      Center, it is definitely east of 75 Rockefeller Plaza.

      2. **Compare their East/West positions:** Once I have their locations, specifically

      Holy Trinity Church (Manhattan) is located at approximately 74th Street and
      Central Park West.  75 Rockefeller Plaza is part of Rockefeller Center, located
      between 48th and 51st Street and between Fifth and Sixth Avenues.  Avenues run
      North-South, and streets run East-West, with street numbers increasing as you
      go north.  Central Park West is further west than Fifth or Sixth Avenue. Since
      Holy Trinity is located further west than Rockefeller Center *and* further uptown
      (north), it must be north-west of Rockefeller Center. Therefore, Holy Trinity
      Church is *not* east of 75 Rockefeller Plaza.

      * 75 Rockefeller Plaza is located between 6th and 7th Avenues, closer to 6th.

      2. **Compare longitude:**  Once I have the locations, I need to compare their

      value (more positive degrees West).

      3. **Determine East/West:** If Holy Trinity Church has a higher longitude value
      than 75 Rockefeller Plaza, it is east of it.


      Holy Trinity Church is at Wall Street & Broadway.  75 Rockefeller Plaza is further
      north, and closer to the Avenue of the Americas (6th Avenue).  Wall Street and
      Broadway is further east than 6th Avenue.
