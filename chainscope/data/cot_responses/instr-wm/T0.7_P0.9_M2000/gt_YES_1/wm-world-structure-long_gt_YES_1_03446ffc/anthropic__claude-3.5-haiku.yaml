      1. First, I need to identify the locations of REK Bitola and Kozienice Power
      Station.


      2. REK Bitola is a power plant located in North Macedonia, near the city of
      Bitola.


      3. Kozienice Power Station is located in Poland, specifically in the Mazovian
      Voivodeship.


      4. Looking at a map of Europe, I can see that North Macedonia is located in
      southeastern Europe, while Poland is in central Europe.


      5. More specifically, North Macedonia is southeast of Poland.


      6. If North Macedonia is southeast of Poland, then REK Bitola (being in North
      Macedonia) would be located southeast of Kozienice Power Station.


      7. "East" typically means to the east, which in this case would be the same
      direction as southeast.

      1. First, I''ll locate Sarang Community Church of Southern California

      - This appears to be a church located in Southern California


      2. Next, I''ll locate Little Goose Dam

      - Little Goose Dam is actually located in Washington state, on the Snake River

      - This is far from Southern California


      3. Since the church is in Southern California and the dam is in Washington state,
      they are in different geographic regions


      4. Therefore, the question of whether the church is east or west of the dam
      becomes moot, as they are in completely different parts of the western United
      States


      5. However, given the geographic locations, the church would technically be
      WEST of Little Goose Dam


      So my answer is: NO (the church is not east of Little Goose Dam)'

      1. First, locate Dunblane Cathedral:

      - Dunblane Cathedral is located in Dunblane, Scotland

      - Specifically, it is in central Scotland, near Stirling


      2. Next, locate Ffestiniog Power Station:

      - Ffestiniog Power Station is located in Wales

      - It is in the northwestern part of Wales, in Snowdonia National Park


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Dunblane is in central Scotland

      - Ffestiniog is in northwestern Wales

      - These are in different countries, with Scotland being east of Wales


      4. Determine the east-west relationship:

      - Since Dunblane is east of Ffestiniog, the cathedral is indeed east of the
      power station
