      the reasoning step by step:


      1. **Identify the location of Haldia Energy Power Station**: The Haldia Energy
      Power Station is located in Haldia, in the state of West Bengal, India.


      2. **Identify the location of Raichak on Ganges**: Raichak is a town located
      on the banks of the Hooghly River (also known as the Ganges) in West Bengal,
      India.


      3. **Determine the relative positions of Haldia and Raichak**: Haldia is situated
      to the south of Kolkata, near the mouth of the Hooghly River, while Raichak
      is located to the south-west of Kolkata, also along the Hooghly River but upriver
      from Haldia.


      4. **Establish east-west orientation**: Since Haldia is closer to the Bay of
      Bengal and downstream along the Hooghly River compared to Raichak, it is positioned
      further east than Raichak.


      After considering these points, the answer is:


      YES.'

    f36abd7e-6d11-4c0f-8de9-d347790d6f6b: 'To determine whether Brockley Hill tube
      station is located east of Kew Bridge railway station, let''s break this down:


      1. **Brockley Hill tube station**: There is no operational tube station named
      Brockley Hill. However, Brockley Hill was a proposed station on the unbuilt
      Northern Heights extension of the London Underground''s Northern line in the
      1930s. It would have been located in the northwestern part of Greater London,
      near the current area of Stanmore.


      2. **Kew Bridge railway station**: This is an existing railway station located
      in the suburb of Kew in the London Borough of Hounslow, west of central London.


      3. **Geographical Orientation**: Stanmore (where Brockley Hill would have been)
      is to the northwest of central London. Kew is to the west-southwest of central
      London.


      Based on the general orientation of these areas:

      - Stanmore (Brockley Hill) is north and slightly to the east of Kew Bridge.


      Therefore, if a Brockley Hill tube station existed in the area it was proposed,
      it would be slightly east of Kew Bridge railway station.


      Final answer: YES.'
    f4ca0cee-c712-49d7-a92f-2df62a46eef6: 'To determine whether Brockley Hill tube
      station is located east of Kew Bridge railway station, we need to establish
      the geographical locations of both places.


      1. **Brockley Hill tube station**: As of my knowledge cutoff date in October
      2023, there is no tube station named Brockley Hill. Brockley Hill is an area
      in the London Borough of Barnet, which is located in the northwest part of Greater
      London.


      2. **Kew Bridge railway station**: This station is located in the London Borough
      of Hounslow, which is in the western part of Greater London.


      Now, assuming Brockley Hill refers to the area in Barnet:


      - Barnet is located to the north/northwest of central London.

      - Hounslow (where Kew Bridge is located) is to the west/southwest of central
      London.


      Thus, Brockley Hill is indeed located to the east of Kew Bridge.


      Considering these geographic locations, the answer is:


      **YES**'

      1. **Identify the location of Strand Hotel**: The Strand Hotel is located in
      Yangon, Myanmar, at 92 Strand Road.


      2. **Identify the location of 54 University Avenue**: This address is located
      in Yangon, Myanmar, as well.

      in the northern part of Yangon, near Inya Lake.


      4. **Assess the cardinal directions**: Given the general layout of Yangon, downtown
      (where Strand Hotel is situated) is south of the University Avenue area.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since Strand Hotel is in the southern part of Yangon and
      east-west directions are relative, we need to establish that Strand Hotel is
      indeed east or not of 54 University Avenue. Downtown Yangon (south) is generally
      southeast of the northern areas like University Avenue.

      - Laos is situated in Southeast Asia, north of Thailand and Vietnam.

      - Malaysia is also in Southeast Asia, with its western part (Peninsular Malaysia)
      located south of Thailand.


      Considering the relative longitudes:
