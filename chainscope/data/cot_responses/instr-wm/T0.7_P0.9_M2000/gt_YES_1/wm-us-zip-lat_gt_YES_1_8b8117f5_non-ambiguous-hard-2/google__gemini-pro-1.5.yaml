      2. **General US Geography:** New York is on the East Coast, and California is
      on the West Coast.  Generally, locations further north have higher latitude
      values. However, due to the curvature of the Earth, simply being East or West
      doesn''t directly translate to North or South. Latitude is the primary determinant.


      3. **Need more specific information:** While we know the general locations of
      the states, zip codes provide a more precise location. We need to consider the
      specific latitude of each zip code to determine which is further north.  Without
      looking up the exact latitude of these zip codes, we can''t be certain.


      4. **General Latitude knowledge (helpful, but not definitive):**  While New
      York *generally* has higher latitudes than California, parts of Northern California
      can be at a similar latitude to parts of Southern New York. Thus, we cannot
      rely on the state alone.


      Since we don''t have the precise latitude of the zip codes, a definitive answer
      is not possible *without more information*.  However, if I *had* to guess based
      on general geography, I''d lean towards YES.  But a guess is not a reliable
      answer.
