      generally follows latitude lines, we can compare the latitudes of the two states
      to determine their relative north-south positions. California is at a higher
      latitude than Georgia, meaning it is located further north.


      4. **Conclusion based on state locations**: Given that California is north of
      Georgia, any location within California, including the area covered by the zip
      code 92240, will be north of any location in Georgia, including the area covered
      by the zip code 31632.

      1. **Identify the states**: First, we need to identify the states associated
      with each zip code. The zip code 10927 is in New York (NY), and the zip code
      22124 is in Virginia (VA).


      2. **General geographic locations of the states**: Next, we consider the general
      geographic locations of New York and Virginia. New York is located in the northeastern
      United States, while Virginia is located in the southeastern part of the country.


      3. **Latitude comparison**: Since north-south positioning in the United States
      generally follows latitude lines, we can compare the latitudes of the two states
      to determine their relative north-south positions. New York is at a higher latitude
      than Virginia, meaning it is located further north.


      4. **Conclusion based on state locations**: Given that New York is north of
      Virginia, any location within New York, including the area covered by the zip
      code 10927, will be north of any location in Virginia, including the area covered

      the general geographic locations of Wisconsin and Indiana. Wisconsin is located
      in the northern part of the United States, while Indiana is located in the central
      part of the country.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Given that Wisconsin is located north of Indiana,
      we can conclude that any location in Wisconsin, including 54143, would be north
      of any location in Indiana, including 46013.

      United States, while Florida is also in the southern United States but is farther
      east.


      3. **Latitude comparison**: To determine if one location is north of another,
      we need to compare their latitudes. Since Louisiana is generally at a higher
      latitude than Florida, any location in Louisiana (including 70062) would be
      north of any location in Florida (including 33187).


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the above steps, we can conclude that 70062, LA
