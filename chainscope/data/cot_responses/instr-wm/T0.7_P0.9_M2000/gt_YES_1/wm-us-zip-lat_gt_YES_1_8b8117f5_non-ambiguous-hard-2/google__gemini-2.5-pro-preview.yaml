      Specifically, it corresponds primarily to the city of Sonoma, CA.

      3.  **Determine the approximate latitude of the first location:** Westport,
      MA is located on the south coast of Massachusetts, roughly around 41.5 degrees
      North latitude.

      4.  **Determine the approximate latitude of the second location:** Sonoma, CA
      is located in Northern California''s wine country, roughly around 38.3 degrees
      North latitude.

      5.  **Compare the latitudes:** 41.5 degrees North (Westport, MA) is a higher
      latitude than 38.3 degrees North (Sonoma, CA). In the Northern Hemisphere, a
      higher latitude means further north.

      6.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, the location of 02790, MA is geographically north
      of the location of 95476, CA.

      1.  **Identify the location of zip code 22134, VA:** This zip code corresponds
      to Quantico, Virginia.

      2.  **Identify the location of zip code 85131, AZ:** This zip code corresponds
      to Florence, Arizona.

      3.  **Determine the approximate latitude of Quantico, VA:** Virginia is located
      on the East Coast of the United States. Quantico is in the northern part of
      Virginia, roughly around 38.5 degrees North latitude.

      4.  **Determine the approximate latitude of Florence, AZ:** Arizona is located
      in the Southwestern United States. Florence is south of Phoenix, roughly around
      33.0 degrees North latitude.

      5.  **Compare the latitudes:** Latitude measures the north-south position. A
      higher latitude number means a location is further north (in the Northern Hemisphere).
      38.5 degrees North (Virginia) is a higher latitude than 33.0 degrees North (Arizona).
