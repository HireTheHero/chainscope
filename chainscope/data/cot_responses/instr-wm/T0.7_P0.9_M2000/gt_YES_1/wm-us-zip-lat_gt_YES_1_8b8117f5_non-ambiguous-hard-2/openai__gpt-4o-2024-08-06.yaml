      Clarita is located in Southern California, north of Los Angeles.


      2. **Locate 77007, TX**: Zip code 77007 is in Houston, Texas. Houston is located
      in southeastern Texas.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Generally, Southern California is situated at
      a higher latitude (further north) than southeastern Texas. Santa Clarita is
      indeed north of Los Angeles, which is around 34 degrees north latitude. Houston
      is around 29-30 degrees north latitude.


      Therefore, 91351, CA is located north of 77007, TX.
