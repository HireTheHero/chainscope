      the latitude of both locations, Connecticut (06770) is at a higher latitude
      (further north) than California (94578).


      4. **Conclusion**: Since 06770, CT is in the northeastern US and 94578, CA is
      in the western US, 06770 is indeed north of 94578.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.'
