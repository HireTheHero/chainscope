      Since Sayville, NY (11782) is in New York state, and Durham, NC (27707) is in
      North Carolina state, and New York is north of North Carolina...


      YES'

      2. Considering basic US geography:

      - Pennsylvania is a northern state, part of the Mid-Atlantic region

      - South Carolina is a southern state, part of the Southeast region

      - Pennsylvania is definitely north of South Carolina

      2) In the US ZIP code system:

      - First digit represents a certain geographical region

      - 32818 (FL) also starts with 3, indicating southeastern US

      - Since they start with the same digit, we can compare the second digits

      - 5 is higher than 2, indicating further north


      4) Additionally, Alabama is geographically located directly north of Florida


      Therefore, since both the ZIP code pattern and basic geography confirm that

    5b9900f8-ef95-4fb3-845c-52db40a05372: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me identify these locations:

      - 72601 is in Harrison, Arkansas

      - 77807 is in Bryan, Texas


      2. General geography reminder:

      - Arkansas is a state that borders Texas

      - Arkansas is located directly north of Texas


      3. More specifically:

      - Harrison, AR (72601) is in northern Arkansas

      - Bryan, TX (77807) is in east-central Texas


      4. Given these locations:

      - Any point in Arkansas will be north of a point in Texas

      - Since 72601 is in Arkansas and 77807 is in Texas, the Arkansas location must
      be north of the Texas location


      Therefore: YES'

      1) 72601 is in Arkansas (AR)

      3) Looking at a map, Arkansas is always north of Texas (they don''t share a
      border, but AR is definitely north of TX)

      4) Therefore, any location in Arkansas will be north of any location in Texas

      5) Since 72601, AR is in Arkansas and 77807, TX is in Texas, the Arkansas location
      must be north of the Texas location


      YES'
