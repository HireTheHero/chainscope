      1. First, identify the states: 84009 is in Utah (UT), and 40475 is in Kentucky
      (KY).

      2. Next, consider the general geographical location of these states. Utah is
      located in the western United States, while Kentucky is in the eastern United

      3. Now, look at their latitudes, which determine their north-south positions.
      Utah is generally at a higher latitude than Kentucky, meaning it is located
      more to the north.


      Given this information, since Utah (where 84009 is located) is generally north

      determine the general geographic locations associated with the zip codes 02790
      in Massachusetts (MA) and 95476 in California (CA), and then compare their positions.


      1. **Identify the states**: 02790 is in Massachusetts, and 95476 is in California.

      2. **General geographic location of the states**: Massachusetts is located in
      the Northeastern United States, while California is on the West Coast.

      3. **Latitude comparison**: Generally, as you move north, the latitude increases.
      Massachusetts is at a higher latitude than California because it is located
      further north.

      4. **Zip code specifics**: Without specific knowledge of each zip code''s exact
      location within their states, we rely on the general geographic positions of
      Massachusetts and California. Massachusetts as a whole is north of California.

      1. First, identify the states: 97236 is in Oregon (OR) and 11561 is in New York
      (NY).

      in the southern United States (like Arkansas).


      Given these considerations, without needing to look up the exact latitudes of

      based on the general geography of the United States that Virginia is north of
      Texas. This is because the entire state of Virginia is located at a higher latitude
      than the state of Texas.


      Given these considerations, we can conclude that 22406, VA is indeed located
      north of 75087, TX, based on the general north-south orientation of the states
      of Virginia and Texas within the United States.

      1. First, we identify the states associated with each zip code: 75149 is in

      2. Next, we consider the general geographical positions of Texas and Florida.
      Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States, while Florida
      is in the southeastern part of the country.

      3. Since both states are in the southern United States, we need to compare their
      latitudes to determine which one is north. Generally, Texas is west and slightly
      north of Florida.

      4. Now, let''s look at the specific zip codes. The zip code 75149 is associated
      with the city of Waxahachie, Texas, and 32601 is associated with the city of
      Gainesville, Florida.

      Step 1: Identify the states associated with each zip code.

      - 28602 is located in North Carolina (NC).

      - 31206 is located in Georgia (GA).


      Step 2: Determine the general geographic location of each state.

      - North Carolina is located north of Georgia.


      Step 3: Since the question asks if 28602, NC is located north of 31206, GA,
      and given that North Carolina is generally north of Georgia, the next step is
      to consider if the specific locations within these states could alter the north-south

      - However, the general north-south relationship between the two states (NC being

      1. First, let''s identify the states: 29205 is in South Carolina (SC), and 77386
      is in Texas (TX).

      2. Next, we need to consider the general geography of the United States. South
      Carolina is located in the southeastern part of the country, while Texas is
      in the south-central part.

      3. Now, let''s look at the latitudes of the two zip codes. The latitude of a
      location tells us how far north or south it is. Without knowing the exact latitudes,
      we can still make an educated guess based on the states. South Carolina is generally
      east and slightly northeast of Texas.

      4. Considering the general geography, South Carolina (where 29205 is located)
      is northeast of Texas (where 77386 is located). Since northeast includes a northern
      component, it''s possible for 29205 to be north of 77386.

      5. To confirm, we would ideally need the exact latitudes of the two zip codes.
      However, given the general geographic relationship between South Carolina and
      Texas, it''s reasonable to conclude that 29205, SC is indeed north of 77386,
      TX, because South Carolina is at a higher latitude than Texas.
