      1. First, I''ll need to look up the population density for each zip code.


      2. 11239 is located in Brooklyn, New York City, which is known for being extremely
      densely populated.

      - Brooklyn is one of the most densely populated urban areas in the United States

      - This zip code is in a very crowded part of New York City


      3. 37341 is located in Dunlap, Tennessee, which is a rural area in Sequatchie
      County.

      - Rural Tennessee areas typically have very low population density

      - This is a much less populated region compared to urban Brooklyn


      4. Given the significant difference in urban vs. rural settings, Brooklyn''s
      zip code 11239 will almost certainly be much more densely populated than the
      Tennessee zip code 37341.


      5. Therefore, the population density comparison heavily favors the New York
      zip code.
