      1. **Brickerville, PA**: Brickerville is a small unincorporated community in
      Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. As it is an unincorporated area, population
      data might not be as readily available as for incorporated cities or towns.
      Typically, unincorporated communities like Brickerville tend to have smaller
      populations.


      2. **Tubac, AZ**: Tubac is a census-designated place (CDP) in Santa Cruz County,
      Arizona. As a CDP, Tubac''s population is recorded during the census. Historically,
      Tubac has been known as a small community.


      Given that both places are relatively small, we can look at general estimates
      or census data, if available, to compare their populations.


      Without exact numbers, we can reasonably infer that both Brickerville and Tubac
      have small populations. However, Tubac, being a recognized CDP, may have more
      reliable population estimates available, which typically show it as a small
      but established community.


      **Conclusion**: Based on the nature of both places, it''s likely that neither
      has a large population, but without specific figures, one can''t definitively
      say one is more populous than the other. However, historically and typically,
      Tubac is recognized with a slightly higher population compared to small unincorporated

    fa05a0eb-e4e9-42c7-bd70-9b46a4c3c433: 'To determine whether Sawgrass, FL is more
      populous than Mount Ephraim, NJ, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the Population of Sawgrass, FL**: Sawgrass is a community in Florida,
      but it is not an incorporated city or town. It is part of the Jacksonville metropolitan
      area, specifically in the Ponte Vedra Beach area. As a result, specific population
      statistics for Sawgrass as an independent entity may not be readily available
      because it is part of a larger, unincorporated community.


      2. **Identify the Population of Mount Ephraim, NJ**: Mount Ephraim is a borough
      in Camden County, New Jersey. According to the latest available data from the
      U.S. Census Bureau, the population of Mount Ephraim is approximately 4,500 residents.


      3. **Comparison**: Given that Sawgrass is not an incorporated city and does
      not have a distinct population count separate from the larger community of Ponte
      Vedra Beach, it is challenging to provide an exact comparison. However, Ponte
      Vedra Beach, the area encompassing Sawgrass, has a significantly larger population
      than Mount Ephraim. Yet, since Sawgrass itself is a smaller community within
      this area, it is reasonable to infer that the population directly associated
      with Sawgrass is likely less than 4,500, based on typical sizes of such communities.


      Therefore, based on the information available, the answer is:


      NO'

      County, New York. Hamlets typically have small populations. Specific population
      data for hamlets can be difficult to find, but based on the general characteristics,
      it is likely to be a small community.

      1. **Atlantic Mine, MI:** Atlantic Mine is an unincorporated community in Houghton
      County, Michigan. As an unincorporated area, it does not have a defined population
      figure like a city or town would. Generally, unincorporated communities in rural

      2. **Population Data**: Aberdeen Proving Ground is not primarily a residential
      area; it is a military installation. The population tends to be limited to military
      personnel and some civilian employees. Census data typically does not list it
      as a significant population center compared to urban or residential areas.


      3. **Population Comparison**: Paramount-Long Meadow, being a CDP, has a defined
      residential population. According to the latest census data (as of 2020), Paramount-Long
      Meadow has a population of several thousand residents.


      4. **Conclusion from Data**: Given that Aberdeen Proving Ground is a military
      base and not primarily residential, its population is generally not comparable
      to a residential community like Paramount-Long Meadow.

      some civilian employees.

      Given these distinctions, Paramount-Long Meadow is a designated residential

      MD is more populous than Paramount-Long Meadow, MD, we need to analyze a few
      things:


      1. **Understanding Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG):** Aberdeen Proving Ground
      is a United States Army facility located in Harford County, Maryland. It is
      not a traditional city or town with a civilian population; rather, it is a military
      installation. The population typically consists of military personnel and their
      families, along with civilian employees. The population can vary based on military
      assignments and other factors.


      2. **Understanding Paramount-Long Meadow:** Paramount-Long Meadow is a census-designated
      place (CDP) in Washington County, Maryland. It is a residential community with
      a civilian population.


      3. **Population Data:** To compare the populations, we would need specific population
      data for both locations. Typically, census data or estimates for Paramount-Long
      Meadow would be available, whereas Aberdeen Proving Ground''s population might
      be more variable and less straightforward to quantify due to its nature as a
      military facility.


      Given this context, the comparison is not entirely straightforward due to the
      nature of Aberdeen Proving Ground as a military facility rather than a standard
      civilian city or town. However, generally speaking, census-designated places
      like Paramount-Long Meadow tend to have more stable and often larger civilian
      populations compared to the on-base population of military installations like
      Aberdeen Proving Ground.


      Therefore, based on general assumptions and typical census data trends, the
      answer is:


      NO. Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD is not more populous than Paramount-Long Meadow,
      MD.'

      1. **Identify Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD**: Aberdeen Proving Ground is a U.S.
      Army facility located in Harford County, Maryland. It is primarily a military
      installation and not a typical residential city or town. Therefore, its population
      consists mainly of military personnel and their families, as well as civilian
      employees.


      2. **Identify Paramount-Long Meadow, MD**: Paramount-Long Meadow is a census-designated
      place (CDP) in Washington County, Maryland. It is a residential area with a

      like Aberdeen Proving Ground, where the population can vary and is not primarily
      residential in nature. Historically, CDPs like Paramount-Long Meadow have a
      population in the range of a few thousand people.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Aberdeen Proving Ground is a military installation
