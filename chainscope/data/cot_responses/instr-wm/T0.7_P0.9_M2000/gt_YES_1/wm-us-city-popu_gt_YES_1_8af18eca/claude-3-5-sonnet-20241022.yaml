    f08fbd39-3546-4c0f-9eef-78166787692c: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to find the population of Willis, TX

      * Willis is a small city in Montgomery County, Texas

      * Population is approximately 6,800 (as of 2020 census)


      2. Next, I need to find information about Bangor Base, WA

      * Bangor Base (Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor) is a military installation

      * It''s not an incorporated city

      * While it has military personnel and some civilian workers, its residential
      population would be limited to on-base housing

      * Military base populations are typically smaller than established cities


      3. Comparing the two:

      * Willis is an established city with over 6,800 residents

      * Bangor Base is a military installation with a smaller permanent residential
      population


      4. Therefore, Willis, TX would have a larger population than Bangor Base, WA


      Answer: YES'
