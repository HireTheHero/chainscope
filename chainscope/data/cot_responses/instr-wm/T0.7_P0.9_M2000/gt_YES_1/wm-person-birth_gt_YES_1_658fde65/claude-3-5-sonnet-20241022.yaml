      3) Given that Albrecht III has a specific birth date in late 1414, and Wenceslaus

      born later.

      - Cleopatra VI was born around 95-69 BCE (exact date uncertain)

      2. Next, let me identify when Marina of Aguas Santas lived:

      - Marina (also known as Saint Marina) lived in the 2nd century AD

      - More specifically, she is believed to have died around 139 AD


      3. Comparing their dates:

      - Lucian was born around 125 AD

      - Marina died around 139 AD, so she must have been born some years before that,
      likely in the early 2nd century or late 1st century AD


      4. Making the final comparison:

      - Given that Marina died in 139 AD, she was almost certainly born before 125
      AD (when Lucian was born)

      - Therefore, Lucian was born later than Marina

      1. First, I need to identify who Balgi and Zhu Jun were:

      * Balgi was an ancient Sumerian king who ruled around 2800 BCE

      * Zhu Jun was a Chinese military general who lived during the Eastern Han dynasty
      (around 180-190 CE)


      2. Converting the dates to the same format:

      * Balgi: ~2800 BCE (Before Common Era)

      * Zhu Jun: ~180-190 CE (Common Era)


      3. Comparing the dates:

      * 2800 BCE came before 180-190 CE

      * Therefore Balgi lived earlier than Zhu Jun


      NO - Balgi was not born later than Zhu Jun. He was born approximately 3,000
      years earlier.'

      comparison of birth dates between these two figures.


      5) Without being able to determine both birth dates, it''s impossible to definitively
      say who was born later.


      Therefore, I must answer: I CANNOT DETERMINE whether Balgi was born later than
      Zhu Jun due to insufficient information about Balgi.

      3) Zhu Jun was a Chinese military general who lived during the Eastern Han dynasty

      - Aimar V was a Viscount of Limoges who lived in the 12th century

      - He died in 1199

      - He would have been born around the mid-12th century, approximately 1140-1150

      - Yang Cishan was a Chinese philosopher and scholar

      - He lived during the Song Dynasty

      - He was born in 1053


      3) Comparing the dates:

      - Yang Cishan: born in 1053

      Aimar V was definitely born later.

      * Thomas Wykes was a 13th-century English chronicler

      * His exact birth date is uncertain but he is believed to have been born around
      1220-1230


      3. Let me analyze:

      * Eleanor''s birth date is certain: 1223

      * Wykes'' birth date is approximate: 1220-1230

      * Given the range for Wykes, he could have been born before or after Eleanor

      * However, most sources suggest he was active as a chronicler in the mid-to-late
      13th century

      * This suggests he was likely born after Eleanor


      Based on the available information and most likely chronology:


      NO

      2. Now, let me find when Zhao Tingmei lived:

      - Zhao Tingmei was a Chinese official during the Song Dynasty

      - He lived from 985-1043 AD


      3. Comparing their birth years:

      - Emma of Blois: born around 950 AD

      - Zhao Tingmei: born in 985 AD

      - 950 comes before 985


      Therefore, Emma of Blois was born EARLIER than Zhao Tingmei, not later.
