      While exact birth dates are usually not available for many medieval figures,

      Dynasty, which lasted from 618 to 907 AD. The Tang Dynasty is well before the
      12th century, placing Tang Situi earlier in history than Adeliza Basset.


      Given this timeline:


      - Adeliza Basset (12th century)

      - Tang Situi (Tang Dynasty, 618-907 AD)


      Therefore, Adeliza Basset was indeed born later than Tang Situi.

    38121a6d-d8c4-4a58-bc75-0cb179db9021: 'To answer this question, let''s first identify
      the time periods associated with each historical figure:


      1. **Adeliza Basset**: She was an English noblewoman during the 12th century.
      Specific birth and death dates are not well-documented, but she lived during
      the 1100s.


      2. **Tang Situi**: He was a Chinese scholar and official during the Song dynasty.
      The Song dynasty lasted from 960 to 1279, and Tang Situi lived during this period.
      However, without specific dates, we generally place his active period around
      the mid to late part of the Song dynasty.


      Now, let''s compare the time periods:


      - Adeliza Basset: 12th century (1100s)

      - Tang Situi: Song dynasty (960-1279), likely active in the later part


      Given these approximate periods, Adeliza Basset lived in the 12th century, while
      Tang Situi was likely active later, during the later years of the Song dynasty.

      1. **Adeliza Basset**: She was an English noblewoman who lived during the 12th
      century. Specific birth dates for medieval figures like Adeliza are often not
      well-documented, but it is known that she belonged to the Basset family and
      was active in the 12th century.


      2. **Tang Situi**: This name likely refers to a figure from Chinese history.
      The Tang Dynasty in China lasted from 618 to 907 AD. Situi is a title or position,
      often meaning "Minister of State" in historical Chinese contexts. Without a

      to assume that a person with this title would have lived during or before the
      Tang Dynasty.


      Given this information, Adeliza Basset, who lived during the 12th century (1100s),
      would have been born after the Tang Dynasty era (618-907 AD).

      likely in the earlier part given the historical context.

      - Adeliza Basset lived during the 12th century (1100s).

      2. **Tiba Munetane**: This name seems to refer to a historical Japanese figure.
      However, there appears to be a misunderstanding or misspelling, as there is
      no widely recognized historical figure by the name "Tiba Munetane." If you meant
      Taira no Munetaka (a figure from Japanese history), or another similar name,
      more context would be needed to provide accurate information.


      Given the potential for misspelling or confusion around the name "Tiba Munetane,"
      it''s impossible to provide a definitive YES or NO answer without more specific
      information about who this figure is supposed to be.

      Portinari''s birth date. If you can provide further clarification or correct

      1. **Alice de Warenne, Countess of Arundel**: Alice de Warenne was born around
      1287. She was the daughter of William de Warenne and Joan de Vere.


      2. **William de Moravia, 3rd Earl of Sutherland**: William de Moravia lived
      in the 14th century, but specific records of his birth year are less precise.
      He is generally considered to have been born around the late 13th century, likely
      in the 1280s or early 1290s.


      Given this information:


      - Alice de Warenne was born around 1287.

      - William de Moravia was likely born in the late 1280s or early 1290s.


      Based on this, it is not definitive but likely that Alice de Warenne was born
      around the same time or potentially slightly before William de Moravia. However,
      without precise birth years for William, it is challenging to provide a definitive
      yes or no answer. Still, the available evidence suggests:

      2. **William de Moravia, 3rd Earl of Sutherland**: He was born around 1312.

      Kenneth de Moravia, 2nd Earl of Sutherland, which occurred around the early
      1330s, and the fact that his son, Robert de Moravia, became the 6th Earl of

      and death dates for Gao Qu are often not well-documented in historical records,

      Gao Qu''s birth year in comparison to Abu Dawood''s. Gao Qu is typically associated

      was the Queen of the Romans and the wife of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor.


      2. **Zbigniew ze Szczyrzyca**: Zbigniew ze Szczyrzyca, a Polish Cistercian monk
      and bishop, was born in the late 13th century. His exact birth year is not well-documented,
      but it is generally placed around the late 1270s to early 1280s.


      With these estimations and facts in mind, Anne of Bavaria, born in 1329, was
      indeed born later than Zbigniew ze Szczyrzyca, who was born several decades
      earlier.


      The answer is: **YES**.'

      The exact birth date of Cleopatra VI is not well recorded, but she likely lived

      unclear. Some scholars suggest she might have been a sister of Cleopatra VII
      and possibly co-ruled for a brief period, but her exact birth date is not well-documented.

      than Ziying, we need to look at the historical timelines of these figures.


      1. **Song Yu**: He was a poet from the Warring States period of ancient China.
      Song Yu is traditionally thought to have lived around the late 3rd century BCE,

      reigned as king for a short period in 207 BCE. His birth date is not well-documented,

      - Song Yu''s activity is generally placed before the end of the Warring States
      period, which concluded with the establishment of the Qin dynasty in 221 BCE.

      1. **Ziying**: Ziying was the last ruler of the Qin dynasty in ancient China.

      of Qin Er Shi.

      Now, let''s compare their timelines:


      - Song Yu was active in the Warring States period, which ended with the unification
      of China under the Qin dynasty in 221 BC. Therefore, he must have been born
      before or around this time.


      - Ziying''s rule was around 207 BC, after the Qin dynasty''s establishment,
      which came after the Warring States period.


      Given these timelines, Song Yu would have been born before Ziying.

      1. **Song Yu**: He was a Chinese poet, traditionally considered to have lived
      during the Warring States period, specifically in the state of Chu. His life
      is often dated to the 3rd century BCE, roughly around the late 200s BCE.

      in 206 BCE, and he is believed to have been alive during the late 3rd century

      - Ziying was active at the end of the 3rd century BCE, and his known historical

      3. Lu Ye was a Chinese politician and writer of the Tang Dynasty, born in 665
