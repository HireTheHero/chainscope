      birth date is unclear, but he was active in historical records around the mid-to-late
      1100s.


      2. **Identify Yang Cishan**: Yang Cishan was a Chinese official and scholar
      during the Song Dynasty. His birth year is also not widely known, but he lived
      during the 12th century.


      3. **Compare their birth periods**: Since both figures lived in the 12th century,
      we must determine who was born first. Yang Cishan served during the Southern
      Song period, which suggests he was likely born earlier in the century. Aimar
      V, being active in the latter part of the 12th century, may have been born later.


      4. **Final conclusion**: Given that Yang Cishan likely lived earlier in the
      12th century and Aimar V was active later in the century, Aimar V was probably
      born later than Yang Cishan.

      a French nobleman who lived during the medieval period. His exact birth date

      2. Identify Yang Cishan: He was a historical figure from China. He lived during

      4. Compare birth years: If Yang Cishan was born in 1093 and Aimar V of Limoges
      was likely born later in the 12th century, then Aimar V was born after Yang
      Cishan.
