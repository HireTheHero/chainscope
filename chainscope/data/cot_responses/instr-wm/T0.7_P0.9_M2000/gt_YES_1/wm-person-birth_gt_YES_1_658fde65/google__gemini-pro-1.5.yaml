      2. **Zhang Qian:** Lived approximately 2nd century BCE (born around 164 BCE).


      Since Judah Maccabee lived around the 160s BCE and Zhang Qian was born around
      164 BCE, it''s likely Judah Maccabee was born *after* Zhang Qian.


      Answer: YES

    9dac20d2-14a5-4001-8fab-33ccfa5e55cc: '1. **Judah Maccabee:**  A Jewish leader
      who led the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire. This revolt took place
      approximately between 167-160 BCE.  Thus, Judah Maccabee lived during the 2nd
      century BCE.


      2. **Zhang Qian:** A Chinese official and diplomat who served Emperor Wu of
      Han during the 2nd century BCE. His journeys to Central Asia began around 138
      BCE.


      3.  Since Judah Maccabee led the revolt starting around 167 BCE, and Zhang Qian''s
      diplomatic missions began around 138 BCE, Judah Maccabee was active earlier
      than Zhang Qian.  This strongly suggests Judah Maccabee was born earlier.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.

      3. **Comparison:**  Zhang Qian''s known dates (138-126 BCE) fall within the
      timeframe of the Maccabean Revolt (167-160 BCE).  Since the revolt lasted several
      years, it''s possible Judah Maccabee was born before Zhang Qian started his
      missions, but it is more likely he was born during or after Zhang Qian''s explorations
      began.


      Therefore, the answer is likely YES.

      II:**  Anaxandridas II was a king of Sparta in the 6th century BC.  His reign
      is generally placed between roughly 560 BC and 520 BC.  This means he was likely
      born sometime before 560 BC.


      2. **Find approximate dates for Yan Ying:** Yan Ying (also known as Yan Zi)
      was a Chinese philosopher and politician who lived during the Spring and Autumn
      period.  He is generally believed to have lived between approximately 578 BC
      and 500 BC.


      3. **Compare the dates:** Anaxandridas II was born before 560 BC.  Yan Ying
      was born around or before 578 BC.  Therefore, it''s possible Anaxandridas II
      could have been born either before or after Yan Ying. We don''t have precise
      birth years to be certain.

      key figure in the early Khawarij movement in Islam.  The Khawarij emerged during
      the First Fitna (Islamic civil war) which occurred around 656-661 CE.  Therefore,
      Abd Allah ibn Hanzala lived in the 7th century CE.

      Tang dynasty. Her reign was from 690 to 705 CE. Therefore, Wu Zetian lived in

      was born earlier than Wu Zetian.
