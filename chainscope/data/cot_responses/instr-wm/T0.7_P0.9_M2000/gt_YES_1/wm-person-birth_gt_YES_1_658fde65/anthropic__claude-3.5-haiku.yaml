      - He lived from approximately 110 BC to 40 BC


      3. Comparing their birth years:

      - Cleopatra VI was born in 69 BC

      - Theophanes was born around 110 BC


      4. Comparing their birth dates:

      - 110 BC is earlier than 69 BC

      - This means Theophanes was born before Cleopatra VI


      5. Therefore, Cleopatra VI was NOT born later than Theophanes of Mytilene.

    c156e2f1-b7b0-472e-afae-860e455c9f50: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Melania the Younger was a Christian ascetic who lived in the late 4th to
      early 5th century CE (around 383-439 CE).


      2. Sima Yuanxian was a Chinese historian who lived during the Tang Dynasty,
      which was from 618-907 CE.


      3. Comparing their time periods, Melania the Younger lived significantly earlier
      than Sima Yuanxian.


      4. Therefore, Melania the Younger was NOT born later than Sima Yuanxian.

      - Wu Zetian was an empress of China who ruled from 690-705 CE

      - She lived from approximately 624-705 CE


      3. Comparing their lifetimes:

      - Abd Allah ibn Hanzala lived from around 620-680 CE

      - Wu Zetian lived from around 624-705 CE


      4. Comparing their birth times:

      - Abd Allah ibn Hanzala was born around 620 CE

      - Wu Zetian was born around 624 CE


      5. Conclusion:

      - Abd Allah ibn Hanzala was actually born slightly EARLIER than Wu Zetian


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      2. Emperor Suzong of Tang:

      - He was a Chinese emperor

      - He ruled from 756 to 762 CE

      1. First, I''ll need to determine the birth years of Alice of Chatillon and
      Heinrich I von Stolberg.


      2. Alice of Chatillon was a noblewoman from medieval France, likely from the
      12th or 13th century.


      3. Heinrich I von Stolberg was a German nobleman, and I believe he lived in
      the late medieval period.

      would allow me to definitively compare their ages.


      5. Without specific, verifiable birth dates, I cannot confidently state whether
      Alice was born later or earlier than Heinrich.


      6. In such a case of uncertainty, the responsible answer is to say I do not
      have enough information to determine this.


      However, the question requires a YES or NO answer. Since I cannot confirm the
      details, I cannot responsibly choose either YES or NO.
