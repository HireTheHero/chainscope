      Atlantic coast.


      2. **Identify the location of Cuthbert, GA**: Cuthbert is a city located in

      3. **Compare the longitudes of the two locations**: Generally, locations that
      are further east have a higher longitude (in the western hemisphere, longitude
      values decrease as you move east). Folly Beach, being on the Atlantic coast,
      is significantly east of Cuthbert, which is inland.
