      1.  **Locate Florissant, MO:** Florissant is a city in St. Louis County, Missouri.
      Missouri is in the central United States.

      2.  **Locate Blende, CO:** Blende is an unincorporated community in Pueblo County,
      Colorado. Colorado is west of Missouri.

      3.  **Compare positions:** Since Colorado is west of Missouri, any point in
      Missouri will be east of any point in Colorado, assuming similar latitudes (which
      is generally true for these two locations).


      Therefore, Florissant, MO is located east of Blende, CO.

      **Step 1: Identify the locations.**

      *   North Beach, MD (Maryland)

      *   Riverwood, KY (Kentucky)


      **Step 2: Determine the general geographical relationship between Maryland and
      Kentucky.**

      Maryland is on the East Coast of the United States. Kentucky is in the East
      South Central region. Maryland is generally to the east of Kentucky.


      **Step 3: Consider the specific longitudes.**

      To be precise, we can look at the approximate longitudes of these states/cities.


      *   Maryland''s westernmost point is around 79 degrees West longitude. Its easternmost
      point is around 75 degrees West longitude.

      *   Kentucky''s westernmost point is around 89 degrees West longitude. Its easternmost
      point is around 81 degrees West longitude.


      Since smaller negative numbers (like -75) are east of larger negative numbers
      (like -81 or -89), any point in Maryland will be east of any point in Kentucky.


      **Step 4: Conclude.**

      North Beach, MD is in Maryland, and Riverwood, KY is in Kentucky. Since all
      of Maryland is east of all of Kentucky, North Beach, MD must be east of Riverwood,
      KY.
