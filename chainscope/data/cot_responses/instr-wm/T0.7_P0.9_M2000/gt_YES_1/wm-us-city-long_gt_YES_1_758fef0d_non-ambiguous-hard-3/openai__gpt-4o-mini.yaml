      \ east of Blende, CO, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Locations**:\n\
      \   - Florissant, MO is located in the central part of the United States, specifically\
      \ in the state of Missouri.\n   - Blende, CO is located in the southeastern\

      1. **Locate Orwigsburg, PA**: Orwigsburg is in Schuylkill County in southeastern
      Pennsylvania.


      2. **Locate Coal Valley, IL**: Coal Valley is located in Rock Island County
