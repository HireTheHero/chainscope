      - Box Elder is located in Pennington County, South Dakota

      - It is near Rapid City, which is in western South Dakota


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Prior Lake is in southeastern Minnesota

      - Box Elder is in western South Dakota

      - When looking at a map, Box Elder is west of Prior Lake


      4. Reasoning about east/west positioning:

      - Since Box Elder is west of Prior Lake, Prior Lake is east of Box Elder


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      Looking at their relative positions:

      - Lake Panorama is in east-central Iowa

      - Morrill is in western Nebraska

      - Western Nebraska is west of Iowa


      Therefore, Lake Panorama is EAST of Morrill.


      Answer: YES'
    dac3a2eb-e32a-4dc4-ac10-bdad1fc83595: "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. First,\
      \ I'll locate Lake Panorama, IA (Iowa) on a map\n   - Lake Panorama is in central\
      \ Iowa, specifically in Dallas County\n\n2. Next, I'll locate Morrill, NE (Nebraska)\
      \ on a map\n   - Morrill is in the western part of Nebraska, near the Wyoming\
      \ border\n\n3. To determine their relative east-west positions, I'll compare\
      \ their longitudes\n   - Lake Panorama, IA is around 94.4\xB0 W longitude\n\
      \   - Morrill, NE is around 103.9\xB0 W longitude\n\n4. Comparing these longitudes:\n\
      \   - A lower (more eastward) longitude means the location is further east\n\
      \   - Lake Panorama's longitude (94.4\xB0 W) is lower/more eastward than Morrill's\
      \ (103.9\xB0 W)\n\n5. Therefore, Lake Panorama, IA is east of Morrill, NE\n\n\
      The answer is: YES."
