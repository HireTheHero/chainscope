      2. **Specific Locations:**  While Pennsylvania is generally east of Ohio, it''s

      how far west in Ohio Circleville is, and how far east in Pennsylvania West Conshohocken
      is.

      will have a lower numerical longitude value (in the Western Hemisphere).  I
      would need to look up the longitude of both cities to be certain.

      2. **Specific Locations Needed:**  While PA is generally east of OH, it''s a

      PA to overcome the fact that Circleville is relatively western in OH.  A map
      or coordinates are needed for a definitive answer.


      3. **Assume East Coast Proximity:** West Conshohocken is near Philadelphia,

      than Camp Pendleton South, CA, then it is east.


      Peridot, AZ is located at approximately -110.75 longitude. Camp Pendleton South,
      CA is located at approximately -117.35 longitude. Since -110.75 is greater than
      -117.35, Peridot is east of Camp Pendleton South.

      Alabama is generally east of Louisiana.


      3. **Consider the specific locations within the states.** While Alabama is generally
      east of Louisiana, Coosada is in central Alabama, and Banks Springs is in northern
      Louisiana. This means Coosada isn''t as far east as it could be within Alabama,
