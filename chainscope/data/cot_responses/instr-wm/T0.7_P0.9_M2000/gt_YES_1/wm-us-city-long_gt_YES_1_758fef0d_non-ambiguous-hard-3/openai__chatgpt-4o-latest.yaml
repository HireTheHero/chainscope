      Atlantic coast.


      3. **Relative Position**: New Jersey is generally east of Indiana. Specifically,
      southern New Jersey (where Mauricetown is located) lies significantly east of
      southern Indiana (where French Lick is located).


      4. **Longitude Consideration**: Indiana is in the Central or Eastern Time Zone,
      while New Jersey is firmly in the Eastern Time Zone. This also supports that
      Mauricetown is east of French Lick.


      Therefore, based on their geographic positions:


      **YES**, Mauricetown, NJ is located east of French Lick, IN.'

      \n1. **Locate French Lick, IN:**\n   - French Lick is a town in southern Indiana.\n\
      \   - Indiana is in the Midwestern United States.\n   - French Lick lies roughly\
      \ at longitude 86.6\xB0W.\n\n2. **Locate Mauricetown, NJ:**\n   - Mauricetown\

      east of Gruver, TX, we need to analyze their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Gruver, TX.

      - Gruver is a city in the northern part of the Texas Panhandle, specifically
      in Hansford County.

      - It is located in the northwest region of Texas, relatively close to the Oklahoma
      border.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Pocola, OK.

      - Pocola is a town in eastern Oklahoma, located in Le Flore County.

      - It is situated near the Arkansas border, close to Fort Smith, Arkansas.


      Step 3: Compare their relative longitudes.

      - Gruver, TX is in the western part of Texas.

      - Pocola, OK is in the far eastern part of Oklahoma.


      Since Oklahoma is directly north of Texas, and Pocola is on the eastern edge
      of Oklahoma while Gruver is in the western part of the Texas Panhandle, Pocola
      is significantly farther east than Gruver.


      Therefore, the answer is:

      Pennsylvania is located east of Knightsville, Indiana by reasoning through their
      geographic locations.


      Step 1: Determine the location of Juniata Terrace, PA.

      - Juniata Terrace is a borough in Mifflin County, Pennsylvania.

      - Mifflin County is located in central Pennsylvania, which is in the eastern
      half of the United States.


      Step 2: Determine the location of Knightsville, IN.

      - Knightsville is a town in Clay County, Indiana.

      - Indiana is located to the west of Pennsylvania, and Clay County is in the
      western part of Indiana.


      Step 3: Compare the relative longitudinal positions.

      - Pennsylvania lies to the east of Indiana.

      - Therefore, a town in central Pennsylvania (Juniata Terrace) will be east of
      a town in western Indiana (Knightsville).


      Conclusion: Since Juniata Terrace, PA is in central Pennsylvania and Knightsville,
      IN is in western Indiana, Juniata Terrace is indeed east of Knightsville.
