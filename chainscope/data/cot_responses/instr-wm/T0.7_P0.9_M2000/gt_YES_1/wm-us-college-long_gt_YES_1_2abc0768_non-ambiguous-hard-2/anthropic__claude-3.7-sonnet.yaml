      Central Arkansas (UCA) in Arkansas is located east of National American University
      (NAU) in South Dakota.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - UCA is in Arkansas (AR)

      - NAU is in South Dakota (SD)


      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of these states in the US.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States

      - South Dakota is located in the north-central United States


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning.

      - Arkansas is positioned in the central-eastern part of the country

      - South Dakota is positioned more toward the central-western part of the country


      Step 4: Compare the longitudes.

      - Arkansas is generally east of South Dakota on a US map

      - States east of the Mississippi River are generally considered eastern, while
      SD is well west of the Mississippi


      Step 5: Make the determination.

      Since Arkansas is east of South Dakota, the University of Central Arkansas would
      be east of National American University.


      YES'

      Step 4: In California, locations are generally considered "east" of each other
      based on their position along the coast, which runs roughly north-south. San
      Diego is south of Monterey Bay, not east of it.


      Step 5: To be more precise, San Diego is actually slightly east of Monterey
      Bay because the California coastline curves inward as it goes south. However,
      this is primarily a north-south relationship rather than an east-west one.


      Step 6: Looking at the actual coordinates, San Diego is indeed slightly east
      of Monterey Bay, but this is due to the curvature of the coastline rather than
      a significant eastward position.


      NO. While San Diego (where Coleman University was located) is slightly east
      of Monterey Bay due to the curve of California''s coastline, the primary geographical
      relationship is that San Diego is south of Monterey Bay, not meaningfully east
      of it in the way the question implies.'

      positions of these two universities in California.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both universities.

      - Coleman University was located in San Diego, California (in the southern part
      of the state)

      - California State University, Monterey Bay is located in Seaside/Marina, near
      Monterey, California (on the central California coast)


      Step 2: Consider the geography of California.

      - San Diego is in the far southern part of California, near the Mexican border

      - Monterey Bay is on the central California coast, south of San Francisco


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      - San Diego is located further east than Monterey Bay

      - The California coastline curves eastward as it moves south, placing San Diego
      further east than Monterey Bay


      Therefore, Coleman University (in San Diego) is located east of California State

      2) Grand Valley State University is located in Allendale, Michigan (with additional
      campuses in Grand Rapids and other Michigan locations).


      3) I need to check "Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX." This requires
      careful consideration, as Texas Tech University''s main campus is in Lubbock,
      TX. However, I''m not aware of Texas Tech having a campus specifically in Fredericksburg,
      TX. Texas Tech has some satellite locations, but Fredericksburg is not a well-known
      Texas Tech campus location.


      4) Regardless of the potential confusion about the second location, I can determine

      Lakes region of the US, while Texas is in the South/Southwest.

      2) Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX would be in Fredericksburg, Texas,

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Texas is in the South-Central region of the United States

      - Geographically, Michigan is east of Texas


      Even though Grand Valley State is in western Michigan, all of Michigan is still
      east of Texas. Fredericksburg is in central Texas, but this doesn''t change
      the fact that Michigan is east of Texas.


      Therefore, Grand Valley State University in Michigan is located east of Texas

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both universities.

      - Grand Valley State University is located in Allendale, Michigan (MI).

      - I need to check if Texas Tech University has a campus in Fredericksburg, Texas
      (TX).


      Step 2: Checking Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX.

      Based on my knowledge, Texas Tech University''s main campus is in Lubbock, Texas,
      and I don''t have information confirming they have a campus specifically in
      Fredericksburg, TX. However, for the purpose of this geographic comparison,
      I''ll consider Fredericksburg, TX as the reference point.


      Step 3: Compare the geographic positions.

      - Michigan is in the northern United States, bordering the Great Lakes.

      - Texas is in the southern United States.

      - When comparing east-west positioning, Michigan is east of Texas.

      - Specifically, Allendale, MI is east of Fredericksburg, TX.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on the east-west positioning.

      Since Michigan is east of Texas on a map of the United States, Grand Valley
      State University in Michigan would be east of any location in Texas, including
      Fredericksburg.

      (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.

      - Massachusetts is located on the east coast of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts


      Step 3: More specifically, compare the cities.

      - Westfield is in western Massachusetts

      - Pittsburgh is in western Pennsylvania


      Step 4: Despite Westfield being in western Massachusetts, Massachusetts as a
      whole is east of Pennsylvania.


      Step 5: Therefore, Westfield, MA is east of Pittsburgh, PA, meaning Westfield
      State University is east of University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine.


      NO.


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me reconsider:


      Massachusetts is indeed east of Pennsylvania on a map of the United States.
      Even though Westfield is in western Massachusetts and Pittsburgh is in western
      Pennsylvania, any point in Massachusetts would still be east of any point in
      Pennsylvania in terms of longitude.

      - Florida is in the southeastern United States

      - On a map of the US, Massachusetts is to the right (east) of Florida


      Step 3: Compare the specific longitudes.

      - Massachusetts locations are generally around 71-73 degrees west longitude

      - St. Petersburg, Florida is around 82-83 degrees west longitude

      - Lower longitude numbers (moving from west to east) indicate more easterly

      locations of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Hampton University is located in Hampton, Virginia (VA)

      - Bellarmine University is located in Louisville, Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of Virginia and Kentucky on the US map.

      - Virginia is on the Atlantic coast in the eastern United States

      - Kentucky is an inland state, west of Virginia


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning specifically.

      - Virginia is positioned to the east of Kentucky

      - Hampton, VA would be even further east as it''s near the coast of Virginia

      - Louisville, KY is in the northern part of Kentucky


      Step 4: Make the final determination based on longitude.

      - Since Hampton, VA is in a state that is entirely east of Kentucky, and Hampton
      itself is on the eastern side of Virginia, Hampton University must be east of
      Bellarmine University.


      YES, Hampton University, VA is located east of Bellarmine University, KY.'
