      is near Pittsburgh in the western part of Pennsylvania.


      3. Both universities are in Pennsylvania, not Illinois (despite the "Illinois"
      in Robert Morris University''s name).


      4. Since East Stroudsburg is in eastern Pennsylvania and Robert Morris is in
      western Pennsylvania, East Stroudsburg is indeed east of Robert Morris University.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      university location, I cannot definitively determine geographic positioning.


      4. Without being able to place Middlesex University in a specific location in
      Massachusetts, I cannot determine if it is east or west of the George Washington
      University School of Nursing.


      Therefore, I cannot confidently answer YES or NO to this question. The premises
      of the question are problematic.'
    d1a1e943-224b-46b4-8625-a5196ca2f786: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Middlesex University in Massachusetts

      - Middlesex University is actually in the UK, not in Massachusetts

      - There might be a Middlesex Community College in Massachusetts, but not a "Middlesex
      University"


      2. Next, I''ll confirm the location of George Washington University School of
      Nursing in Washington, DC

      - This is a real institution located in Washington, DC


      3. Since the first part of the premise (Middlesex University, MA) is not a real
      place, the geographical comparison cannot be made.


      4. Without a valid first location, I cannot determine whether it is east or
      west of the George Washington University School of Nursing.


      Therefore, the question cannot be answered as stated.


      But if the question requires a strict YES or NO answer, I would say:


      NO


      (Because the first part of the premise is not a real location, so the geographical
      comparison is impossible)'

      2. Locate University of West Florida:

      - University of West Florida is located in Pensacola, Florida

      - Florida is also on the East Coast, but further south


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Virginia is north of Florida

      - Virginia Beach, VA is east of Pensacola, FL


      4. Reasoning about east/west positioning:

      - Since Regent University (in Virginia) is north and east of the University
      of West Florida (in Florida), it is indeed east of the University of West Florida


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
