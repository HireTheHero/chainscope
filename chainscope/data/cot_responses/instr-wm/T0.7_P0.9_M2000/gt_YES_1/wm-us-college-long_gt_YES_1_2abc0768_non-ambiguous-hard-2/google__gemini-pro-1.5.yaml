      in the western part *of Florida*, not the western part of the US.


      3. **East vs. West:**  Since both are on the East Coast, the question is whether
      Virginia is east *of* Florida.  Since Virginia is north of Florida, and the
      East Coast runs roughly north-south, Virginia is not east of Florida.  It''s
      actually slightly *west* of Florida due to the curvature of the coastline.


      **Answer:** NO

      2. **University of West Florida''s Location:** The University of West Florida
      is in Florida. Florida is also on the East Coast, but further south than Virginia.  "West"
      in the university''s name refers to its location in the Florida panhandle, the
      western part *of* Florida.


      3. **East vs. West:**  Since Virginia is north of Florida, and both are on the
      East Coast, Regent University is east *and* north of the University of West

      2. **University of West Florida''s Location:** The University of West Florida
      is located in Pensacola, Florida. Florida is also on the East Coast, but further
      south than Virginia.


      3. **East vs. West:**  "East of" means to the right on a map. Since both are
      on the East Coast, we need to determine if Virginia is further east *longitudinally*
      than Florida.


      4. **Longitude:**  While Florida extends further south than Virginia, Virginia
      is generally east of the Florida panhandle where Pensacola is located.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

      is roughly at longitude -90.


      * Williston State College is in Williston, ND. Williston, ND is roughly at longitude
