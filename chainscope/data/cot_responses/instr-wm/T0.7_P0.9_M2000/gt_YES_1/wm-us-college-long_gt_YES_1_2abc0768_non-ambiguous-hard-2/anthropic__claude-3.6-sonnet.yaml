      - Shepherd University is in Shepherdstown, West Virginia

      - University of West Alabama is in Livingston, Alabama


      2. Looking at relative positions:

      - Shepherdstown, WV is in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia

      - Livingston, AL is in western Alabama


      3. Comparing on a west-to-east basis:

      - Alabama is significantly west of West Virginia

      - Moreover, Shepherd is in eastern WV while UWA is in western AL

      - This makes the east-west distance even more pronounced


      4. Therefore, Shepherd University is clearly located east of University of West
      Alabama

      1. First, let me identify the locations:

      - Governors State University is in University Park, Illinois

      - Clary Sage College is in Tulsa, Oklahoma


      2. To determine which is more east, I need to compare their relative positions:

      - Illinois is in the Midwest, east of Oklahoma

      - Oklahoma is further west in the central United States


      3. On a map:

      - Illinois borders Indiana and is close to Lake Michigan

      - Oklahoma is several states west of Illinois


      4. Therefore, since Governors State University (IL) is located in a state that
      is east of Oklahoma where Clary Sage College is located, Governors State University
      is east of Clary Sage College.

      2. To determine which is more east, I need to compare their locations:

      - Georgia is on the east coast of the US

      - Texas is in the south-central US


      3. Any location in Georgia will be east of any location in Texas, as Georgia
      is several states east of Texas.


      Therefore: YES, University of North Georgia is located east of Lee College.'

      - Central State University is in Wilberforce, Ohio


      2. In terms of geography:

      - Charleston, SC is on the Atlantic coast

      - Wilberforce, OH is in southwestern Ohio, inland


      3. When comparing east-west positions:

      - Anything on the Atlantic coast is further east than Ohio

      - South Carolina''s coast is definitely east of Ohio


      4. Therefore, College of Charleston (being on the Atlantic coast) must be east
      of Central State University in Ohio.

      - Wilberforce, OH is in the midwest, far from the coast


      3. When comparing states:

      - South Carolina is clearly east of Ohio

      Answer: YES'
    ef74fe43-3ba1-4421-b193-b02ea0d806ce: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, I need to locate both universities:

      - Stevenson University is in Maryland (MD)

      - Selma University is in Alabama (AL)


      2) To determine which is more east, I need to think about the relative positions
      of these states:

      - Maryland is on the eastern seaboard of the US

      - Alabama is in the southeastern US, but not on the Atlantic coast


      3) Maryland is clearly east of Alabama on any US map, as it''s right on the
      Atlantic coast while Alabama is several states inland.


      4) Since Stevenson University is in Maryland and Selma University is in Alabama,
      Stevenson must be east of Selma.


      Therefore: YES'
