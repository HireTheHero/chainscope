      1. **Location of Coleman University**: Coleman University was located in San
      Diego, California. San Diego is in the southern part of the state, close to
      the Pacific Ocean.


      2. **Location of California State University, Monterey Bay**: This university

      the state, near the city of Monterey.


      3. **Comparing the Locations**: San Diego is located to the south and slightly
      east compared to Seaside. However, because we are focusing on the east-west
      comparison, San Diego is generally further west compared to Monterey.

      Technical College, but the original location remains relevant for this question.


      2. **Identify the location of the University of Texas at Tyler, TX**: The University
      of Texas at Tyler is located in Tyler, Texas.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Georgia is located to the east of Texas.
      Therefore, any location in Georgia, including Jesup, would be east of any location
      in Texas, including Tyler.


      Based on this reasoning, Altamaha Technical College, GA is located east of the
      University of Texas at Tyler, TX.

      1. Andrews University is located in Berrien Springs, Michigan.

      2. The University of Louisiana at Monroe is located in Monroe, Louisiana.


      Now, let''s consider the general longitudinal positions of these locations:


      - Berrien Springs, MI, is in the western part of Michigan, which is in the Eastern

      - Monroe, LA, is in the northern part of Louisiana, which is in the Central

      In terms of longitude:

      - Michigan is generally further east compared to Louisiana because Michigan
      is closer to the eastern U.S. coastline, while Louisiana is closer to the central
      part of the country.


      Therefore, Andrews University in Michigan is located east of the University
