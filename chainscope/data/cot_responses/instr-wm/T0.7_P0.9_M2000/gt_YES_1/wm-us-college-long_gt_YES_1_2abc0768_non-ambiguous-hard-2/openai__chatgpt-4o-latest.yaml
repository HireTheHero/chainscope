      Florida Southwest Recreation Center (in Gainesville, Florida) is located east
      of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (specifically the College of
      Education in Urbana, Illinois), we need to compare their longitudinal coordinates.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - The University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center is in Gainesville, Florida.

      - The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) College of Education is
      in Urbana, Illinois.


      Step 2: Understand longitude.

      - Longitude measures how far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian.

      - Locations with smaller (more negative) longitude values in the Western Hemisphere
      are farther west.

      - So, a greater (less negative) longitude means the location is farther east.


      Step 3: Find the approximate longitudes:

      - Gainesville, FL is approximately at longitude -82.35.

      - Urbana, IL is approximately at longitude -88.21.


      Step 4: Compare the longitudes:

      - -82.35 (Gainesville) is greater than -88.21 (Urbana), meaning Gainesville
      is farther east than Urbana.


      Final Step: Based on this comparison, Gainesville, FL is east of Urbana, IL.

      Step 1: Identify locations

      - George Washington University School of Nursing is located in Washington, D.C.

      - Middlesex University in Massachusetts is likely referring to Middlesex Community
      College or a similarly named institution in Massachusetts. Massachusetts is
      a state in the northeastern United States.

      around 71-72 degrees west.


      Step 3: Compare longitudes

      \ 105.9\xB0W (Alamosa) is east of 115.0\xB0W (Henderson), Adams State University\
      \ is indeed located east of Roseman University.\n\n\u2705 Final Answer: YES."

      \ in Colorado is located east of Roseman University of Health Sciences in Nevada,\
      \ let's go through the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the locations\
      \ of both universities:**\n\n   - **Adams State University** is located in Alamosa,\
      \ Colorado.\n   - **Roseman University of Health Sciences** is located in Henderson,\
      \ Nevada (just outside Las Vegas).\n\n2. **Understand geographic orientation:**\n\
      \n   - Colorado is generally east of Nevada.\n   - Alamosa, CO is in the southern\
      \ part of Colorado.\n   - Henderson, NV is in the southern part of Nevada.\n\
      \n3. **Compare longitudes:**\n\n   - Alamosa, CO is approximately at longitude\
      \ **-105.9\xB0**.\n   - Henderson, NV is approximately at longitude **-114.9\xB0\
      **.\n\n   Since -105.9\xB0 is a smaller absolute number than -114.9\xB0, and\
      \ both are west longitudes, that means Alamosa (Adams State University) is further\
      \ east than Henderson (Roseman University).\n\n**Therefore, the answer is: YES.**"
