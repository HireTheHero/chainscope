      Locations to the west have a more western longitude (further from 0 degrees).


      4. **Compare longitudes:** Nebraska is east of the Rocky Mountains, while Utah
      is within or west of the Rocky Mountains. Therefore, Nebraska has a more eastern
      longitude than Utah.


      5. **Conclusion:** Since Kearney, NE is located in Nebraska and Provo, UT (home
      to BYU) is located in Utah, and Nebraska is east of Utah, the University of
      Nebraska at Kearney is located east of the BYU Honors Program.

    99c51704-a6cf-4de3-bd6c-3f507ff089e1: 'Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the locations:** We need to compare the locations of SUNY Oneonta,
      NY and St. Andrews University, NC.

      2.  **Determine the general direction of each state relative to the other:**
      New York (NY) is north of North Carolina (NC).

      3.  **Determine the general direction of the specific cities/campuses:** Oneonta,
      NY is in central New York. Laurinburg, NC (where St. Andrews University is located)
      is in southern North Carolina.

      4.  **Consider the East/West comparison:** Since New York is generally north
      of North Carolina, and Oneonta and Laurinburg are roughly in the central/southern
      parts of their respective states, we need to think about their longitudinal
      positions. While both are on the east coast of the US, Oneonta, NY is further
      west than many points in North Carolina, especially the coastal areas. However,
      Laurinburg, NC is located in the inland part of North Carolina.

      5.  **Visualize or use a map:** Imagine a line of longitude passing through
      Oneonta, NY. Now imagine a line of longitude passing through Laurinburg, NC.
      Oneonta is further west than Laurinburg.

      6.  **Formulate the comparison:** The question asks if SUNY Oneonta is located
      *east* of St. Andrews University. Since Oneonta is further *west* than Laurinburg,
      it is not located east of it.

      Rancho Santiago Community College District is in Santa Ana, Orange County, California.

      California State University, East Bay is in Hayward, Alameda County, California.
      This is in the East Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area, in Northern California.

      4.  **Compare the general locations:** Southern California is geographically
      south of Northern California. Santa Ana (Rancho Santiago CCD) is significantly
      south of Hayward (Cal State East Bay).

      5.  **Consider the East/West aspect:** Since Santa Ana is south of Hayward,
      and we are asking if Santa Ana is *east* of Hayward, we need to think about
      their relative positions on a map. Hayward is near the coast (East Bay). Santa
      Ana is also relatively near the coast in Southern California. On a standard

      (like Santa Ana). Alternatively, Southern California (like Santa Ana) is generally
      southeast of Northern California (like Hayward).

      6.  **Final comparison:** To be east of Cal State East Bay (Hayward), Rancho
      Santiago CCD (Santa Ana) would need to be further east than Hayward while being
      on roughly the same latitude or slightly south. However, Santa Ana is primarily
      *south* and *slightly east* of a direct north-south line from Hayward, but it''s
      not primarily *east* of Hayward in the sense that it''s further inland at the
      same latitude. More importantly, Southern California is geographically southeast
      of the San Francisco Bay Area. Therefore, Rancho Santiago CCD is primarily south
      and somewhat east of Cal State East Bay. The question is specifically about
      being *east* of. While there''s an east component, it''s dominated by the south
      component, and Santa Ana is not located *east* in the primary directional sense

      \ east of it in the way the question implies a direct east-west relationship.\
      \ While Orange County *is* generally east of the Pacific Ocean coastline compared\
      \ to some parts of the Bay Area coastline, asking if one location is \"east\
      \ of\" another typically implies a lateral comparison at similar latitudes.\
      \ Given the significant difference in latitude, the primary directional relationship\
      \ is North/South. If we project Cal State East Bay's longitude southward, Rancho\
      \ Santiago CCD would likely be slightly west of that longitude, or at best,\
      \ roughly aligned. It is certainly not clearly *east*.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\
      \ Rancho Santiago Community College District is located in Southern California,\
      \ while Cal State East Bay is located in the San Francisco Bay Area. Southern\

      Step 3: Determine the general direction of Burlington, MA relative to Washington,
      D.C. Massachusetts is located north and east of Washington, D.C.

      Step 4: The question asks if Middlesex University, MA is located *east* of George
      Washington University School of Nursing, DC. Since Massachusetts is generally
      northeast of Washington, D.C., Middlesex University is located east (and north)
      of George Washington University School of Nursing.

      \ University, MA:** A quick search reveals that Middlesex University is located\
      \ in London, UK. The question specifies \"Middlesex University, MA,\" which\
      \ is a bit of a trick. While there might be smaller, unrelated institutions\
      \ or programs with similar names in Massachusetts, the well-known Middlesex\
      \ University is in London. However, let's assume *for the sake of answering\

    fa2ee063-e88f-4a77-b6b0-1ba2ea1c4900: '1.  **Identify the locations:** Eastern
      Washington University is in Washington state. California College of the Arts
      is in California state.

      2.  **Understand the relative positions of the states:** Washington state is
      north of California state.

      3.  **Consider the question:** The question asks if Eastern Washington University
      (in WA) is *east* of California College of the Arts (in CA).

      4.  **Analyze the east/west relationship:** States in the US generally run north-south
      relative to each other. While California has an eastern border and Washington
      has a western border, the states themselves are primarily aligned North-South.
      To be "east of" a location in California means to be further east geographically.

      5.  **Compare the overall locations:** Washington state is located to the North
      of California state. While parts of Eastern Washington might be geographically
      further east than parts of Western California, the general location of Washington
      *as a state* is not east of California *as a state*. The question is about the
      locations of the *universities* within their respective states.

      6.  **Refine the comparison:** Eastern Washington University is in the eastern
      part of Washington. California College of the Arts has campuses in Oakland and
      San Francisco, both in the western part of California.

      7.  **Determine the longitudinal relationship:** Washington state is generally
      situated at a similar or slightly more western longitude than California state
      (excluding the eastern tip of California). Eastern Washington, while east within
      Washington, is still at a longitude that is likely *west* of most of California,
      or at best, roughly the same longitude as the eastern parts of California. The
      western part of California (where CCA is) is significantly further west than
      Eastern Washington.

      8.  **Conclusion:** Eastern Washington is geographically west of the vast majority
      of California, especially the western locations like Oakland and San Francisco
      where CCA is located. Therefore, Eastern Washington University is not located
      east of California College of the Arts.

      4. **Consider the east/west orientation:** Both states are on the eastern side
      of the US. However, to determine if one is *east* of the other, we need to think
      about their longitudinal positions. While both are on the Atlantic coast, Florida
      extends further west than most of Virginia. Think of a vertical line down the
      US. Florida is generally to the west of Virginia.

      5. **Apply the concept of "east of":** For Marymount University to be *east*
      of Florida State University, it would need to be further towards the Atlantic
      Ocean than Florida State. Looking at a map, this is not the case. Florida State
      University is in Tallahassee, FL, which is in the Florida panhandle and further
      west than Arlington, VA, where Marymount University is located.

      1.  **Identify the two locations:** The question asks about the relative positions
      of Full Sail University, FL and Davenport University, MI.

      2.  **Determine the location of Full Sail University, FL:** I need to know the
      general location of Full Sail University. A quick search or prior knowledge
      tells me it''s in Winter Park, near Orlando, Florida. Florida is a southeastern
      state in the US.

      3.  **Determine the location of Davenport University, MI:** I need to know the
      general location of Davenport University. A quick search or prior knowledge
      tells me it has multiple campuses in Michigan, but its main campus and historical
      location are in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Michigan is a midwestern state, located
      relatively north compared to Florida.

      4.  **Visualize the relative positions:** I need to imagine a map of the US

      \ and compare their longitudes.\n    *   Wichita, KS is in the central part\
      \ of the US, relatively north compared to Texas.\n    *   Lubbock, TX is in\

      \ centrally located within Kansas, but significantly *east* of the panhandle\
      \ region of Texas where Lubbock is.\n\n5.  **Compare longitudes (implicit in\

      \    *   Pensacola is in the western part of Florida, near the border with Alabama.\n\
      \n6.  **Compare the longitudes:** To determine east/west relationships, longitude\
      \ is the key factor. Locations with a *lower* longitude (closer to 0 degrees)\
      \ are farther east. Locations with a *higher* longitude (more negative in the\
      \ Western Hemisphere) are farther west.\n    *   Virginia Beach, VA: Approximately\
      \ 76.0 degrees West longitude.\n    *   Pensacola, FL: Approximately 87.2 degrees\
      \ West longitude.\n\n7.  **Compare the longitudes directly:** 76.0 is less than\
      \ 87.2.\n\n8.  **Interpret the longitude comparison:** A lower (less negative)\
      \ West longitude means the location is *east* of the location with the higher\
      \ (more negative) West longitude.\n\n9.  **Formulate the conclusion:** Since\
      \ Virginia Beach, VA (where Regent University is) has a longitude of approximately\
      \ 76.0 W and Pensacola, FL (where the University of West Florida is) has a longitude\
      \ of approximately 87.2 W, Regent University is located east of the University\
      \ of West Florida.\n\n10. **Final Answer Check:** Does this make sense geographically?\
      \ Yes, Virginia is generally northeast of Florida, and Virginia Beach is on\
      \ the eastern side of Virginia, while Pensacola is on the western side of Florida.\
      \ So, a point on the eastern coast of Virginia is certainly east of a point\
      \ on the western panhandle of Florida.\n\n11. **Extract the YES/NO answer:**\
      \ The conclusion is that Regent University is located east of the University\
      \ of West Florida. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n\n**Final Answer:** YES"

      5.  **Compare longitudes:** Ohio''s longitude is roughly -80 to -84 degrees
      West. Texas''s longitude is roughly -93 to -107 degrees West. A smaller negative
      number (closer to 0) indicates a more eastern location.

      \ University, CO\n    *   Roseman University of Health Sciences, NV\n3.  **Determine\
      \ the geographical coordinates (or approximate location) of each university:**\n\
      \    *   Adams State University is in Alamosa, Colorado. Colorado is a state\
      \ in the Western United States.\n    *   Roseman University of Health Sciences\
      \ has campuses in Henderson, Nevada, and South Jordan, Utah. The question just\
      \ says \"NV\", so I'll focus on the Nevada campus (Henderson). Nevada is a state\
      \ in the Western United States, west of Colorado.\n4.  **Compare the locations:**\n\
      \    *   Colorado is generally located east of Nevada.\n    *   Alamosa, CO\
      \ is in southern Colorado.\n    *   Henderson, NV is in southern Nevada.\n5.\
      \  **Relate the states:** Colorado is geographically east of Nevada.\n6.  **Relate\
      \ the specific cities/universities:** Since Alamosa, CO is in Colorado and Henderson,\
      \ NV is in Nevada, and Colorado is east of Nevada, Alamosa (and thus Adams State\
      \ University) must be east of Henderson (and thus Roseman University of Health\
      \ Sciences, NV).\n7.  **Formulate the final answer based on the comparison:**\
      \ Adams State University, CO is located east of Roseman University of Health\

      \ the answer is YES.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n*   Adams State University\
      \ is in Colorado.\n*   Roseman University of Health Sciences (NV campus) is\
      \ in Nevada.\n*   Geographically, Colorado is east of Nevada.\n*   Therefore,\
      \ the university in Colorado is east of the university in Nevada.\n*   The answer\
      \ is YES.\n\n**Thinking Process Conclusion:** The steps clearly show that Adams\
      \ State University, located in Colorado, is east of Roseman University of Health\
      \ Sciences, located in Nevada.\n\n**YES / NO Answer Formulation:** The final\
      \ step is to provide only the YES or NO answer as requested.\n\n**Self-Correction/Refinement:**\
      \ Could there be a tricky edge case? Could a specific part of Colorado be west\
      \ of a specific part of Nevada? No, looking at a map, the entire state of Colorado\
      \ is east of the entire state of Nevada. The specific locations of Alamosa and\
