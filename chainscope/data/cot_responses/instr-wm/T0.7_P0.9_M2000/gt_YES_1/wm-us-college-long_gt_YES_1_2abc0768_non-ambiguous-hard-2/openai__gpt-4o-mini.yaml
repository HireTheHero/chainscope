      Texas, we need to consider the geographical locations of both universities.


      1. **Location of Grand Valley State University**: GVSU is located in Allendale,
      Michigan, which is near the western side of Michigan and relatively close to
      the Great Lakes.


      2. **Location of Texas Tech University in Fredericksburg**: Fredericksburg,
      Texas, is located in the central part of Texas, which is southwest of Michigan.


      3. **Comparing the Longitudes**: Michigan is generally to the north and east
      of Texas. When comparing the longitudinal positions, Michigan (where GVSU is
      located) is east of Texas (where Fredericksburg is).


      4. **Determining "East"**: Since GVSU is in Michigan and Fredericksburg is in
      Texas, GVSU is indeed positioned eastward relative to Fredericksburg.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is YES, Grand Valley State University is
      located east of Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX.'

      - Washington is north of California, and Cheney is located in the eastern part

      - San Francisco is located on the west coast of the United States.


      Now, considering the geographical layout:


      - Eastern Washington University (Cheney, WA) is north of California College

      - Since "east" refers to the direction relative to a point, and both locations

      it would be further to the right when looking at a map.


      Thus, Cheney, WA is not east of San Francisco, CA; it is actually north.

      1. **Location of Oklahoma Baptist University**: OBU is located in Shawnee, Oklahoma.

      2. **Location of Midland College**: Midland College is located in Midland, Texas.


      Next, we need to compare the relative positions of these two cities:


      - Shawnee, Oklahoma is situated to the north of Midland, Texas, and slightly
      to the east.

      - Midland, Texas is located in the western part of Texas.
