      to determine the east-west relationship between University of Dayton in Ohio
      and Xavier University of Louisiana in Louisiana.


      I''ll approach this by considering the relative geographic positions of Ohio
      and Louisiana within the United States:


      1. Ohio is located in the Midwest/Eastern part of the United States

      2. Louisiana is located in the Southern/Gulf Coast region of the United States


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Ohio is definitely east of Louisiana. Ohio
      borders Pennsylvania to its east and West Virginia to its southeast, while Louisiana
      sits along the Gulf of Mexico in the south-central part of the country.


      Now specifically for the universities:

      - University of Dayton is in Dayton, Ohio

      - Xavier University of Louisiana is in New Orleans, Louisiana


      Since Dayton, Ohio is in Ohio, and New Orleans, Louisiana is in Louisiana, and
      Ohio is east of Louisiana, it follows that University of Dayton is east of Xavier
      University of Louisiana.


      So the answer would be YES.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Ohio and Louisiana.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Eastern region of the United States

      - Louisiana is located in the Southern Gulf Coast region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes.

      - Ohio is significantly further east in the country compared to Louisiana

      - Looking at the US map, Ohio sits much further east than Louisiana


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since University of Dayton is in Ohio and Xavier University of Louisiana is
      in Louisiana, and Ohio is east of Louisiana, the University of Dayton is east
      of Xavier University of Louisiana.

      - Dayton, OH would be in the western part of Ohio

      - Xavier University of Louisiana is in New Orleans, LA (I believe)


      Even though Dayton is in the western part of Ohio, Ohio as a whole is significantly

      5) University of Dayton is in Dayton, Ohio, in the western part of the state.

      6) Xavier University of Louisiana is in New Orleans, Louisiana.

      7) Even though Dayton is in western Ohio, the entire state of Ohio is still

      - Arkansas (AR) is located in the south-central United States

      - Colorado (CO) is located in the western/mountain region of the United States


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Arkansas is situated east of Colorado on the U.S. map

      - Colorado is farther west than Arkansas


      Step 3: Since the universities are in their respective states, Henderson State

      to determine the relative geographic locations of Henderson State University
      in Arkansas and the University of Northern Colorado in Colorado.


      Step 1: Let''s identify where Henderson State University is located in Arkansas.

      Henderson State University is in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, which is in the southwestern
      part of Arkansas.


      Step 2: Let''s identify where the University of Northern Colorado is located
      in Colorado.

      The University of Northern Colorado is in Greeley, Colorado, which is in the
      northern part of Colorado.


      Step 3: Now I need to determine whether Arkansas (specifically Arkadelphia)
      is east of Colorado (specifically Greeley).


      Looking at a map of the United States, Colorado is west of Arkansas. Colorado
      is in the western/mountain region of the US, while Arkansas is in the southeastern/south-central
      region. Therefore, Arkansas is east of Colorado.

      Arkansas is located in the south-central United States.

      Colorado is located in the western/Rocky Mountain region of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare east-west positioning.

      Looking at a US map, Arkansas is entirely east of Colorado. All points in Arkansas
      (including Arkadelphia) are east of all points in Colorado (including Greeley).


      Therefore, Henderson State University in Arkansas is located east of the University
      of Northern Colorado in Colorado.

      Let''s think about the geographic layout of the United States:

      - Colorado (CO) is located in the western/mountain region of the United States

      - California is a state on the west coast of the United States.

      - In the United States, as you move from west to east, you generally go from
      the Pacific Ocean toward the Atlantic Ocean.

      - California is on the Pacific coast, so it''s very far west.

      - Montana is inland and east of California.


      So Montana is east of California. This means Montana State University (in Montana)
      would be east of any university in California, including California South Bay
      University.


      Actually, let me double-check if California South Bay University is a real university.
      I''m not immediately familiar with a university by that exact name. The South
      Bay area in California typically refers to the southern region of the San Francisco
      Bay Area. There are universities in that region like San Jose State University,

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Montana is an inland state in the northwestern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Moving from west to east across the United States, you would encounter California

      west coast of the United States.


      To determine if Montana State University is east of California South Bay University,
      I need to compare their relative positions on a map of the United States.


      California is the westernmost contiguous state in the US, bordering the Pacific
      Ocean. Montana is located to the east and north of California.


      Since Montana is east of California, Montana State University would be east
      of any university in California, including California South Bay University.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Montana State University is in Montana (MT), which is in the northwestern
      United States.

      - California South Bay University is in California (CA), which is on the west
      coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - California is the westernmost contiguous state in the US, directly bordering
      the Pacific Ocean.

      - Montana is located to the east and northeast of California.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on the states'' positions.

      - Since Montana is entirely east of California on the map, any location in Montana
      (including Montana State University) would be east of any location in California

      - California (CA) is on the west coast of the United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, Montana is located east of California. The

      (like San Jose State University, Stanford University, Santa Clara University,
      etc.), all of these would be in California, which is entirely west of Montana.


      Therefore, Montana State University in Montana is east of any university in
      California, including any university in California''s South Bay region.</think>I
      need to determine the east-west relationship between these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Montana State University is located in Bozeman, Montana.

      - California South Bay University would be in California''s South Bay area,
      which is in California.


      Step 2: Compare the east-west positions of Montana and California.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States.

      - Montana is an inland state located east of California.


      Step 3: Since Montana is entirely east of California, any location in Montana
      (including Montana State University) would be east of any location in California

      CA is located east of California State University, Monterey Bay, CA, I need
      to consider the locations of both universities in California.


      First, let me think about California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB).
      As the name suggests, it''s located in Monterey Bay, which is on the central
      coast of California, facing the Pacific Ocean on the western side of the state.


      Now for Coleman University in California. I need to recall where this is located.
      Coleman University was in San Diego, in the southern part of California. San
      Diego is also on the coast, but further south than Monterey Bay.


      When comparing east-west positions in California, I need to consider that the
      California coastline runs roughly north-south, but with some variations. Generally:

      - Monterey Bay is on the central coast

      - San Diego is on the southern coast


      In terms of east-west positioning, San Diego is actually slightly east of Monterey
      Bay, because the California coastline curves inward as it goes south. So even
      though both are coastal cities, San Diego (and thus Coleman University) would
      be slightly east of Monterey Bay (and thus CSUMB).


      However, I should note that Coleman University closed permanently in 2018, so
      it no longer exists as an active institution. But for the purpose of this geographic
      question, I''m considering its former location.</think># Is Coleman University,
      CA located east of California State University, Monterey Bay, CA?


      I need to determine the east-west relationship between these two universities
      by identifying their locations in California.


      Step 1: Locate California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB).

      - CSUMB is located in Monterey Bay on the central California coast.

      - Monterey Bay is on the western edge of California, facing the Pacific Ocean.


      Step 2: Locate Coleman University.

      - Coleman University was located in San Diego, in southern California.

      - San Diego is also on the coast, but further south than Monterey Bay.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      - While both are near the coast, the California coastline curves inward as it
      moves south.

      - This means San Diego is slightly east of Monterey Bay, even though both are
      coastal cities.


      YES, Coleman University (when it existed before closing in 2018) was located
      east of California State University, Monterey Bay.'

      To answer this question, I need to know where each university is located within
      California. Then I can determine which one is more easterly.


      California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB) is located in Monterey Bay,
      which is on the central coast of California. Monterey is on the Pacific Ocean.


      Now I need to determine where Coleman University is located in California. Coleman
      University was in San Diego, California, which is in Southern California, also
      on the coast.


      Now I need to determine which is more easterly:

      - San Diego is in the southern part of California

      - Monterey Bay is in the central part of California


      The coast of California runs roughly north-south, with some variations. Looking
      at a map, San Diego is slightly more easterly than Monterey Bay because of the
      way the California coastline curves. The coastline angles somewhat southeast
      as you move from central to southern California.


      So Coleman University (in San Diego) should be slightly east of CSU Monterey
      Bay.


      However, I should note that Coleman University closed permanently in 2018, so
      it no longer exists as an active institution.</think># Is Coleman University,
      CA located east of California State University, Monterey Bay, CA?


      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify where each university is located in California.


      2) Coleman University was located in San Diego, in the southern part of California.


      3) California State University, Monterey Bay is located in Monterey Bay, on
      the central coast of California.


      4) Looking at California''s geography, the coastline curves inward as it moves
      south from central California to southern California.


      5) Because of this coastal curve, San Diego (where Coleman University was located)
      is actually slightly more eastward than Monterey Bay.


      6) I should note that Coleman University closed permanently in 2018, but its
      former location is what matters for this question.


      YES'
    d910154e-10a2-4f0f-ad48-1dcefed6b54a: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative locations of:

      1. Coleman University, CA

      2. California State University, Monterey Bay, CA


      I need to figure out where each is located, and then determine if Coleman University
      is east of CSU Monterey Bay.


      Let me think about the locations:


      - California State University, Monterey Bay is located in Monterey Bay, which
      is on the central coast of California, west of most of the state (since it''s
      on the Pacific Ocean).


      - Coleman University was located in San Diego, California, which is in Southern
      California near the Mexico border.


      Now I need to determine if San Diego is east of Monterey Bay:

      - Monterey Bay is on the central California coast

      - San Diego is on the southern California coast


      Both are coastal cities, but San Diego is further south. In terms of east-west
      positioning, they''re both on the coast, but Monterey Bay is slightly further
      west because of how the California coastline curves. San Diego''s position in
      Southern California puts it slightly more eastward than Monterey Bay.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the locations of both universities
      and compare their east-west positions.


      Step 1: Identify the location of California State University, Monterey Bay.

      CSU Monterey Bay is located in Seaside, California, on the central California
      coast in Monterey Bay. This puts it directly on the Pacific coastline.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Coleman University.

      Coleman University was located in San Diego, California, in the southern part
      of the state.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      Both locations are coastal, but due to the curvature of California''s coastline,
      San Diego is actually slightly east of Monterey Bay. The California coast curves
      inward as it moves south, meaning southern coastal cities like San Diego are
      slightly more eastward than central coast locations like Monterey Bay.


      Therefore, Coleman University (in San Diego) was located east of CSU Monterey
      Bay.

      2. Then I need to determine if Marywood is east of Radford.


      First, let''s identify where these universities are located:

      - Marywood University is located in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which is in the
      northeastern part of Pennsylvania.

      - Radford University is located in Radford, Virginia, which is in the southwestern
      part of Virginia.


      Now I need to think about their relative east-west positions.

      - Pennsylvania is generally northeast of Virginia.

      - Scranton, PA is in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania.

      - Radford, VA is in southwestern Virginia, closer to the western border with
      West Virginia.


      Given that Pennsylvania is east of Virginia, and specifically Scranton (in northeast
      PA) compared to Radford (in southwest VA), it''s very likely that Marywood University

      northeastern part of Pennsylvania.

      - Radford University is located in Radford, Virginia, which is in the southwestern
      part of Virginia.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Pennsylvania is generally positioned to the northeast of Virginia on the map.

      - Scranton, PA (where Marywood is) is in the northeastern region of Pennsylvania.

      - Radford, VA is in the southwestern region of Virginia, closer to the Appalachian
      mountains.


      Step 3: Determine relative position.

      - When looking at a map of the eastern United States, Scranton, PA is clearly

      To answer this, I need to figure out the relative east-west positioning of these
      two locations.


      First, let me identify where each university is located:


      1. University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) is in Baltimore County, Maryland

      of the United States.


      3. Purdue University Calumet is in Indiana (IN). Indiana is in the Midwest of
      the United States, not on the coast.


      4. When comparing east-west positions in the US, states on the east coast (like

      - Indiana is an inland state in the Midwest, positioned much further west than
      Delaware.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      - All of Delaware, including any institution there, is east of all of Indiana.

      1. Shaw University in North Carolina (NC)

      2. University of Michigan-Dearborn in Michigan (MI)


      I need to determine which one is located further east.


      Let me think about the general geographic positions:

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - North Carolina is on the East Coast


      Looking at the relative positions on a US map:

      - Michigan is roughly around the Great Lakes region, extending west from Lake
      Erie and Lake Huron

      - North Carolina is on the Atlantic coast, significantly east of Michigan


      Dearborn specifically is near Detroit in the southeastern part of Michigan,
      but even the easternmost parts of Michigan are still west of North Carolina.


      North Carolina (including Shaw University in Raleigh, NC) would be several hundred
      miles east of Michigan (including the University of Michigan-Dearborn).


      So Shaw University in NC is located east of University of Michigan-Dearborn
      in MI.</think>To determine if Shaw University in North Carolina is located east
      of University of Michigan-Dearborn in Michigan, I need to consider the geographic

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Shaw University is located in Raleigh, North Carolina.

      - University of Michigan-Dearborn is located in Dearborn, Michigan.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positioning of these states on the US map.

      - Michigan is in the Great Lakes region of the Midwest.

      - North Carolina is on the Atlantic Coast in the southeastern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions (east-west).

      - Michigan is positioned much further west compared to North Carolina.

      - North Carolina''s eastern position along the Atlantic coast places it significantly
      east of Michigan.


      Step 4: Even though Dearborn is in eastern Michigan, and Raleigh is in central
      North Carolina, the entire state of North Carolina is still east of Michigan.


      YES, Shaw University in North Carolina is located east of University of Michigan-Dearborn

      from the Pacific Ocean on the west to the Atlantic Ocean on the east. Going
      from west to east:

      - California is on the West Coast

      - Colorado is inland, in the Rocky Mountain region


      Los Angeles is in southern California, on the west coast of the US. Colorado
      Springs is in Colorado, which is east of California.


      In the United States, locations in California will generally be west of locations
      in Colorado. Since Los Angeles is in California and Colorado Springs is in Colorado,
      Colorado Springs would be east of Los Angeles.


      Therefore, the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, CO is located east
      of the Los Angeles Recording School, CA.</think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative east-west positions of these two institutions based
      on their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - University of Colorado at Colorado Springs is in Colorado Springs, Colorado

      - Los Angeles Recording School is in Los Angeles, California


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states within the US.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Colorado is an inland state, located to the east of California


      Step 3: Compare the specific cities.

      - Los Angeles is in southern California, on the western side of the country

      - Colorado Springs is in central Colorado, significantly east of Los Angeles


      When looking at a US map, any location in Colorado will be east of any location
      in California, as the entire state of Colorado is east of California.


      YES, the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs is located east of the Los
      Angeles Recording School.'

      To solve this, I need to think about the relative positions of Virginia (VA)
      and Ohio (OH) in the United States.


      The United States has its eastern coast along the Atlantic Ocean. As we move
      westward from the Atlantic coast, we encounter states in roughly this order
      (focusing on the relevant region):

      - Eastern seaboard states (including Virginia)

      - Then more inland states (including Ohio)


      Virginia is on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while Ohio is more
      inland and to the west of Virginia.


      Since Virginia is east of Ohio, and Stratford University is in Virginia while
      Otterbein University is in Ohio, it follows that Stratford University is east
      of Otterbein University.</think># Is Stratford University, VA located east of
      Otterbein University, OH?


      I need to determine the relative locations of these universities based on their
      states.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Stratford University is in Virginia (VA)

      - Otterbein University is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between Virginia and Ohio.

      - Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Ohio is located inland, west of Virginia


      Step 3: Since the universities are in their respective states, their relative
      positions follow the same pattern.

      - Stratford University (in Virginia) would be east of Otterbein University (in
      Ohio)


      YES, Stratford University, VA is located east of Otterbein University, OH.'

      Virginia (VA) is a state on the East Coast of the United States.

      Ohio (OH) is a state in the Midwest, located west of the East Coast states.


      Generally speaking, Virginia is east of Ohio. Therefore, a university in Virginia
      would typically be east of a university in Ohio.


      So, Stratford University in Virginia would be located east of Otterbein University
      in Ohio.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region, west of the East Coast states

      - When looking at a U.S. map, Virginia is positioned to the east of Ohio


      Step 3: Apply this state-level geographic relationship to the universities.

      - Since Virginia is east of Ohio, universities in Virginia would be east of
      universities in Ohio


      YES, Stratford University in Virginia is located east of Otterbein University

      Let''s think about the geographic positions of Florida and Illinois:

      - Florida is in the southeastern United States

      - Illinois is in the midwestern United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Florida is generally east of Illinois

      - This means locations in Florida tend to be east of locations in Illinois


      Since the University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center is in Florida, and
      the UIUC College of Education is in Illinois, it''s very likely that the UF
      facility is east of the UIUC facility.


      To be more precise:

      - The University of Florida is in Gainesville, FL

      - UIUC (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) is in Urbana-Champaign, IL

      - Gainesville, FL is significantly east of Urbana-Champaign, IL


      So yes, the University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center would be east
      of the UIUC College of Education.</think>To answer this question, I need to
      determine the relative east-west positions of these two university facilities.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these facilities are located.

      - University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center is in Florida (FL)

      - UIUC College of Education is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States

      - Illinois is located in the midwestern United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitude (east-west position).

      - Florida is significantly east of Illinois on the map of the United States

      - Gainesville (where University of Florida is located) is east of Urbana-Champaign
      (where UIUC is located)


      Step 4: Draw conclusion about the specific facilities.

      Since the University of Florida facility is in a state that is east of the state
      where the UIUC facility is located, the University of Florida Southwest Recreation
      Center is east of the UIUC College of Education.

      West Alabama in Alabama.


      To solve this problem, I need to know the approximate locations of these two
      universities within their respective states.


      1. Shepherd University is in West Virginia (WV). West Virginia is a state in
      the eastern United States, specifically in the Appalachian region.


      2. University of West Alabama is in Alabama (AL). Alabama is in the southeastern
      United States.


      3. In terms of east-west positioning in the US, West Virginia is generally east
      of Alabama. If you look at a US map, Alabama is further west than West Virginia.


      More specifically:

      - Shepherd University is located in Shepherdstown, which is in the far eastern
      panhandle of West Virginia, very close to the Maryland border.

      - The University of West Alabama is in Livingston, which is in western Alabama.

      part of West Virginia while University of West Alabama is in western Alabama,
      Shepherd University is definitely east of the University of West Alabama.</think>To
      determine if Shepherd University in West Virginia is located east of the University
      of West Alabama in Alabama, I need to consider the geographic positions of these

      - Shepherd University is located in Shepherdstown, in the eastern panhandle
      of West Virginia.

      - The University of West Alabama is located in Livingston, in western Alabama.


      Step 2: Consider the overall geographic positions of West Virginia and Alabama.

      - West Virginia is located in the Appalachian region in the eastern United States.

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States, but is positioned west
      of West Virginia.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - West Virginia''s eastern panhandle (where Shepherd University is) is one of
      the easternmost parts of the state.

      - Western Alabama (where University of West Alabama is) is one of the westernmost
      parts of Alabama.

      - The distance between them is substantial, with West Virginia being significantly
      east of Alabama.


      YES, Shepherd University in West Virginia is located east of the University
      of West Alabama in Alabama.'

      if State University of New York at Oneonta, NY is located east of St. Andrews
      University, NC.


      To answer this, I need to know the relative east-west positioning of these two
      locations. In the United States, locations that are more toward the east coast
      have higher longitude values (when using negative numbers for western hemisphere,
      they have smaller absolute values).


      Let me consider the states first:

      - NY (New York) is in the northeastern United States

      - NC (North Carolina) is on the east coast but further south than New York


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New York is generally east of many states, being on the eastern seaboard

      - North Carolina is also on the eastern seaboard


      Now I need to specifically think about Oneonta, NY versus St. Andrews, NC.


      Oneonta is in central/eastern New York state.

      St. Andrews is in North Carolina.


      Since both New York and North Carolina are eastern states, I need to compare
      their exact longitudes to determine which is further east.


      Generally, New York state is positioned east of North Carolina on the map. So
      SUNY Oneonta should be east of St. Andrews University in NC.</think># Is State
      University of New York at Oneonta, NY located east of St. Andrews University,
      NC?


      Let me determine this by thinking about the geographic locations:


      1) First, I need to consider the states: New York (NY) is in the northeastern
      United States, while North Carolina (NC) is in the southeastern United States.


      2) Looking at a U.S. map, New York state is positioned significantly further
      east than North Carolina. The entire state of New York is east of North Carolina.


      3) Oneonta is located in east-central New York state.


      4) St. Andrews University is located in North Carolina, which is west of New
      York.


      5) Therefore, SUNY Oneonta must be east of St. Andrews University.

      Eastern\" in its name, this refers to its location within Michigan, not its\
      \ position in the country as a whole.\n\n4) Comparing their absolute geographic\

      in Pennsylvania is located east of Eastern Michigan University in Michigan.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both universities.

      - Lincoln University is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is on the east coast of
      the United States.

      - Eastern Michigan University is in Michigan (MI), which is in the Midwest region
      of the United States.


      Step 2: More specifically, I need to determine their relative east-west positioning.

      - Pennsylvania is generally east of Michigan on a map of the United States.

      - States on the east coast (like Pennsylvania) are east of midwestern states
      (like Michigan).


      Step 3: To be more precise:

      - Lincoln University, PA is likely in eastern Pennsylvania, as most of Pennsylvania
      is east of all of Michigan.

      - Eastern Michigan University, despite having "Eastern" in its name, is still
      in Michigan, which is west of Pennsylvania.


      Therefore, Lincoln University in Pennsylvania would be east of Eastern Michigan
      University in Michigan.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the geographical positions of both universities and compare their east-west
      locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' positions

      Pennsylvania (PA) is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while
      Michigan (MI) is in the Midwest region.


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship

      Pennsylvania is east of Michigan on the map. Pennsylvania borders the Atlantic
      Ocean (via Delaware Bay), while Michigan is further inland around the Great
      Lakes.


      Step 3: Consider the specific university locations

      Lincoln University is in southeastern Pennsylvania, near the Maryland border.

      Eastern Michigan University is in Ypsilanti, Michigan, in the southeastern part
      of that state.


      Step 4: Compare east-west positions

      Even though Eastern Michigan University has "Eastern" in its name (referring
      to its position within Michigan), it is still located in a state that is entirely
      west of Pennsylvania.


      YES, Lincoln University, PA is located east of Eastern Michigan University,
      MI.'

      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States

      - Alabama is in the southeastern United States, but it''s west of North Carolina


      More specifically:

      - Winston-Salem is a city in the northwestern part of North Carolina

      - North Carolina is on the Atlantic coast in the southeastern United States

      - Alabama is also in the southeastern US, but is west of North Carolina


      Step 3: Even though Winston-Salem is in the western part of North Carolina,
      the entire state of North Carolina lies east of Alabama.


      Step 4: Therefore, Winston-Salem State University in North Carolina is positioned

      First, let''s establish the locations:

      1. Winston-Salem State University is in Winston-Salem, North Carolina (NC)

      2. Faulkner University is in Montgomery, Alabama (AL)


      In terms of US geography, North Carolina is on the east coast, while Alabama

      (MS), and then figure out if Brenau is east of Mount Hermon.


      First, let''s think about the relative positions of the states:

      - Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Mississippi (MS) is located in the southern United States, along the Mississippi
      River


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Georgia is east of Mississippi

      - Mississippi is west of Georgia


      Since Brenau University is in Georgia and Mount Hermon Female Seminary is in
      Mississippi, and Georgia is east of Mississippi, then Brenau University would
      be east of Mount Hermon Female Seminary, regardless of the specific locations
      within those states.</think>I''ll solve this step-by-step by considering the
      geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each institution is located.

      - Brenau University is in Georgia (GA)

      - Mount Hermon Female Seminary is in Mississippi (MS)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, while Mississippi is located
      in the south-central United States. On a map of the US, Georgia is positioned
      to the east of Mississippi.


      Step 3: Since both institutions are in their respective states, their east-west
      relationship will follow the same pattern as their states.

      Since Georgia is east of Mississippi, Brenau University in Georgia would be
      east of Mount Hermon Female Seminary in Mississippi.


      YES, Brenau University, GA is located east of Mount Hermon Female Seminary,
      MS.'

      1) First, I need to locate Brenau University in Georgia (GA).

      Brenau University is located in Gainesville, Georgia, which is in the northeastern
      part of Georgia.


      2) Next, I need to locate Mount Hermon Female Seminary in Mississippi (MS).

      I need to check if this institution still exists and where it''s located. Mount
      Hermon is a location in Mississippi, but I''m not immediately familiar with
      this specific seminary.


      3) Once I have both locations, I need to determine their relative positions
      - specifically whether Brenau University (in GA) is east of Mount Hermon Female
      Seminary (in MS).


      Georgia is generally east of Mississippi in the United States. Mississippi borders
      the Gulf of Mexico on the south and is west of Alabama, while Georgia is east
      of Alabama bordering the Atlantic Ocean. So geographically, any location in
      Georgia would typically be east of any location in Mississippi.


      4) Therefore, Brenau University in Georgia would be east of Mount Hermon Female
      Seminary in Mississippi.</think># Is Brenau University, GA located east of Mount

      2) Brenau University is located in Gainesville, Georgia, which is in the northeastern
      part of Georgia.


      3) Mount Hermon Female Seminary was located in Mississippi (MS).


      4) Looking at the geographic positions of these states: Mississippi is in the
      southern United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico. Georgia is also a southern
      state, but it''s located to the east of Mississippi, with Alabama in between.


      5) Since Georgia is east of Mississippi on the US map, any location in Georgia
      (including Brenau University) would be east of any location in Mississippi (including
      Mount Hermon Female Seminary).

      3. Compare their east-west positions to determine if Brenau is east of Mount
      Hermon


      Step 1: Let me think about Brenau University in GA.

      Brenau University is located in Gainesville, Georgia. Georgia is on the east
      coast of the United States, bordering the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 2: Let me think about Mount Hermon Female Seminary in MS.

      Mississippi (MS) is located west of Georgia. Mississippi is on the Gulf Coast,
      west of Alabama, which is west of Georgia.


      So geographically, Georgia is east of Mississippi on the US map. Since Brenau
      University is in Georgia and Mount Hermon Female Seminary is in Mississippi,
      Brenau University would be east of Mount Hermon Female Seminary.</think>I''ll
      solve this step-by-step:


      Step 1: Determine the locations of both institutions.

      - Brenau University is located in Gainesville, Georgia (GA)

      - Mount Hermon Female Seminary is (or was) located in Mississippi (MS)


      Step 2: Compare the geographical positions of Georgia and Mississippi.

      - Georgia is on the southeastern coast of the United States

      - Mississippi is located in the deep south, bordering the Gulf of Mexico

      - When looking at a US map, Georgia is positioned to the east of Mississippi

      - Alabama lies between these two states


      Step 3: Make the east-west comparison.

      Since Georgia is east of Mississippi on the US map, and Brenau University is
      in Georgia while Mount Hermon Female Seminary is in Mississippi, Brenau University
      is indeed east of Mount Hermon Female Seminary.

      - The entire state of Mississippi lies east of the state of Texas

      - The Mississippi River generally forms the western border of Mississippi, while
      Texas extends much further west


      Step 4: Conclude based on state locations.

      Since Mississippi Valley State University is in Mississippi, and Angelo State
      University is in Texas, and Mississippi is entirely east of Texas, the Mississippi
      university must be east of the Texas university.

      - Angelo State University is in Texas (TX)


      Generally speaking, Mississippi is east of Texas in the United States. The states
      border as follows from west to east: Texas -> Louisiana -> Mississippi.


      So by state location alone, Mississippi is east of Texas, which means Mississippi

      Michigan is generally east of Texas. On a US map, Michigan is in the eastern
      half of the country, while Texas is in the southern/central part.


      To be more precise:

      - Grand Valley State University is located in Allendale, Michigan, which is

      - Fredericksburg, Texas is in central Texas


      Even though Grand Valley is in western Michigan, Michigan as a whole is still

      To answer whether Texas A&M University-San Antonio is east of New Mexico Highlands
      University, I need to analyze their geographic locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Texas A&M University-San Antonio is in San Antonio, Texas

      - New Mexico Highlands University is in Las Vegas, New Mexico


      ## Step 2: Consider the states'' positions

      - New Mexico lies directly west of Texas on a US map

      - The entire eastern border of New Mexico connects to the western border of
      Texas


      ## Step 3: Consider the cities'' positions

      - San Antonio is in south-central Texas

      - Las Vegas, NM is in northeastern New Mexico

      - Even though these cities aren''t directly east-west of each other, any point
      in Texas will be east of any point in New Mexico due to the states'' positions


      Therefore, YES, Texas A&M University-San Antonio is located east of New Mexico
      Highlands University.'

      York (NY). This is on Long Island, which is in the eastern part of New York
      state.


      2. Baldwin Wallace University is located in Berea, Ohio (OH). Ohio is in the
      Midwest region of the United States.


      Now, I need to determine their relative positions. In the United States, New
      York is east of Ohio. In fact, if you look at a map of the US:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest

      - New York is in the Northeast


      More specifically, Stony Brook is on Long Island in the eastern part of New
      York state, which puts it even further east. Berea, Ohio is near Cleveland in
      the northern part of Ohio.


      Therefore, Stony Brook University School of Medicine in NY is indeed located
      east of Baldwin Wallace University in OH.</think>I need to determine the relative
      locations of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Stony Brook University School of Medicine is located in Stony Brook, New York
      (NY), on Long Island.

      - Baldwin Wallace University is located in Berea, Ohio (OH), near Cleveland.


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      - The United States is generally oriented so that locations further east have
      higher longitudes.

      - New York state is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States.

      - All of New York state is east of all of Ohio.

      - Additionally, Stony Brook is on Long Island, which extends into the Atlantic
      Ocean, putting it even further east.


      YES, Stony Brook University School of Medicine in NY is located east of Baldwin
      Wallace University in OH.'

      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - Missouri (MO) is in the Midwest region

      - Colorado (CO) is in the Mountain West region

      - Generally, the United States has the East Coast on the right side of the map,
      and the West Coast on the left side

      - Moving from west to east, we have: West Coast states, Mountain states, Midwest
      states, and then East Coast states


      So Colorado is in the Mountain region, which is west of the Midwest region where
      Missouri is located.


      St. Louis is located on the eastern side of Missouri, near the border with Illinois,
      along the Mississippi River.


      Therefore, University of Missouri-St. Louis (in Missouri) would be east of Regis
      University (in Colorado).</think>I need to determine the relative locations

      Step 1: Identify the locations of each university.

      - Regis University is in Colorado (CO)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Missouri is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Colorado is located in the Mountain West region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - On a U.S. map, Colorado is significantly west of Missouri

      - St. Louis is actually on the eastern side of Missouri, near the Illinois border


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Colorado is west of Missouri, and St. Louis is on the eastern side of
      Missouri, University of Missouri-St. Louis is definitely east of Regis University
      in Colorado.

      1. Find the location of Premier Flight Academy in Ohio (OH)

      2. Find the location of Indiana University Northwest in Indiana (IN)

      3. Determine if Premier Flight Academy is east of Indiana University Northwest


      Let me think about the geography of these states:

      - Ohio (OH) is located to the east of Indiana (IN)

      - So generally, locations in Ohio tend to be east of locations in Indiana


      Now let''s be more specific:

      - Indiana University Northwest is likely in northwestern Indiana (given its
      name)

      - Premier Flight Academy in Ohio could be anywhere in Ohio


      Since Ohio is east of Indiana, and Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana
      (likely the northwestern part), Premier Flight Academy in Ohio is almost certainly
      east of Indiana University Northwest.


      The only exception would be if Premier Flight Academy were in far western Ohio
      and Indiana University Northwest were in far eastern Indiana. But given that
      Indiana University Northwest has "Northwest" in its name, it''s likely in the
      northwestern part of Indiana, not the eastern part.</think>I need to determine

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Ohio and Indiana.

      - Ohio is located directly east of Indiana

      - The entire state of Ohio is east of the entire state of Indiana


      Step 3: Consider the specific location of Indiana University Northwest.

      - The "Northwest" in its name indicates it''s in northwestern Indiana

      - This would place it in the western portion of Indiana, far from the Ohio border


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these geographical facts.

      - Any location in Ohio (including Premier Flight Academy) must be east of any
      location in Indiana (including Indiana University Northwest)


      YES, Premier Flight Academy in Ohio is located east of Indiana University Northwest

      1. Find the location of Premier Flight Academy in Ohio (OH)

      2. Find the location of Indiana University Northwest in Indiana (IN)

      Let me think about the geography. Ohio is generally east of Indiana on a US
      map. So a location in Ohio would typically be east of a location in Indiana.


      Premier Flight Academy in OH would be somewhere in Ohio state.

      Indiana University Northwest, as the name suggests, would be in the northwest
      part of Indiana.

      Premier Flight Academy would be east of Indiana University Northwest.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Ohio is located directly east of Indiana on the US map.


      Step 3: Analyze the specific locations within their states.

      - Indiana University Northwest is specifically in the northwest part of Indiana

      - Premier Flight Academy is somewhere in Ohio, which is entirely east of Indiana.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      Since Ohio is east of Indiana, and Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio while Indiana
      University Northwest is in Indiana (particularly in the northwestern part),
      Premier Flight Academy must be east of Indiana University Northwest.

      Based on the general geography of US states, since Premier Flight Academy is
      in Ohio, and Ohio is east of Indiana, and Indiana University Northwest is in
      Indiana, Premier Flight Academy should be east of Indiana University Northwest.


      However, I should consider that Indiana University Northwest might be on the

      - Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: I need to determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Indiana and Ohio are neighboring states in the Midwest

      - Ohio is located directly east of Indiana


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Even though I don''t know the exact cities for these institutions, I can reason

      states

      - Arizona is east of Oregon on a map of the United States


      Step 4: Verify the specific cities

      - Concordia University Portland is in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - Oregon is on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona is in the southwestern United States, but inland


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - States on the west coast (like Oregon) are further west than inland states

      - On a U.S. map, Arizona is positioned east of Oregon


      Step 4: Consider the specific cities.

      - Portland is in the northwestern part of Oregon

      - UAT is in Tempe, Arizona, which is in central Arizona

      of Advancing Technology (UAT) in Arizona is located east of Concordia University
      Portland in Oregon, I need to compare the longitudes of these two locations.


      Let me work through this step by step:


      1. University of Advancing Technology is in Arizona (AZ).

      2. Concordia University Portland is in Oregon (OR).

      3. In the United States, states that are further east have higher longitude
      values (measured in degrees west, but with smaller numbers as you go east).

      4. Oregon is on the west coast of the United States.

      5. Arizona is inland, in the southwestern United States.


      Geographically, Oregon is west of Arizona. On a map of the US, Oregon is on
      the Pacific coast, while Arizona is inland. Moving from west to east across
      the US, you would encounter Oregon before Arizona.


      Therefore, Arizona (where UAT is located) is east of Oregon (where Concordia
      University Portland is located).</think>I need to determine the relative positions
      of these two universities by examining their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of Advancing Technology (UAT) is in Arizona (AZ)

      - Concordia University Portland is in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Arizona and Oregon.

      - Oregon is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, but inland from the
      coast


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - States along the west coast (like Oregon) are generally west of inland states

      - Arizona is east of Oregon on a U.S. map


      Step 4: Make the final determination based on these states'' positions.

      - Since UAT is in Arizona, and Arizona is east of Oregon, then UAT is east of
      Concordia University Portland

      2. Concordia University Portland in Oregon (OR)


      I need to determine which one is located further east. Let me think about the
      geographic locations of Arizona and Oregon.


      Oregon is on the west coast of the United States, bordering the Pacific Ocean.
      Portland is Oregon''s largest city, located in the northwestern part of the
      state.


      Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, but it''s inland and east
      of California, Nevada, and Oregon.


      When comparing east-west positioning in the US, we''re essentially comparing
      longitudes. Lower (more negative) longitude numbers are further west, higher
      (less negative) numbers are further east.


      Since Oregon is on the west coast and Arizona is more inland and to the east,
      I can conclude that University of Advancing Technology in AZ would be east of
      Concordia University Portland in OR.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic locations of these states within the US.

      - Oregon is on the west coast of the United States, bordering the Pacific Ocean.
      Portland is in the northwestern part of Oregon.

      - Arizona is in the southwestern United States, but it''s inland and east of
      the westernmost states including Oregon.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on a west-to-east basis.

      - Oregon is significantly west of Arizona on the US map.

      - All of Arizona is east of all of Oregon in terms of longitude.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on the states'' positions.

      Since any location in Arizona would be east of any location in Oregon, University
      of Advancing Technology in Arizona must be east of Concordia University Portland

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States

      - Louisiana is located in the Deep South/Gulf Coast region

      - On a US map, Ohio is positioned significantly to the east of Louisiana


      Step 3: Since these colleges are in their respective states, their east-west
      relationship follows the same pattern as their states.

      - Any location in Ohio would be east of any location in Louisiana


      Therefore, Western College for Women in Ohio is indeed located east of the University
      of Louisiana at Lafayette in Louisiana.

      I need to determine which one is further east. In the United States, locations
      further east have higher longitude values (more degrees east).


      Approximate locations:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/eastern part of the US

      - Louisiana is in the southern part of the US


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Ohio is significantly east of Louisiana

      - Ohio is roughly in line with states like Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky

      - Louisiana is roughly in line with states like Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi


      Given the continental geography of the US, Ohio is clearly east of Louisiana.

      First, let me think about the states:

      - PA (Pennsylvania) is east of OH (Ohio)

      - Pennsylvania borders Ohio on Ohio''s eastern border


      Now, let''s think about the specific locations within these states:

      Let me break it down:

      1. West Chester University is located in West Chester, Pennsylvania (PA)

      2. Urbana University is located in Urbana, Ohio (OH)


      Now I need to think about the geographical positions of Pennsylvania and Ohio.
      In the United States:

      - Pennsylvania is located east of Ohio

      - Ohio is west of Pennsylvania


      Since West Chester is in Pennsylvania and Urbana is in Ohio, and Pennsylvania

      But let me double-check this reasoning. The names of the cities could potentially
      be misleading. "West Chester" sounds western, but that''s just the city name.


      West Chester, PA is in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia and
      the Atlantic coast.

      is on the Atlantic coast of South Carolina, in the eastern part of the United
      States.


      Central State University is located in Wilberforce, Ohio (OH). Ohio is in the
      Midwest region of the United States, and is west of South Carolina.


      When comparing locations in the United States on an east-west axis, locations
      farther east have more eastern longitudes (closer to the Atlantic Ocean), while
      locations farther west have more western longitudes (closer to the Pacific Ocean).


      Since South Carolina is on the Atlantic coast and Ohio is in the Midwest, College
      of Charleston (in SC) is east of Central State University (in OH).</think>#
      Determining if College of Charleston, SC is east of Central State University,
      OH


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two institutions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - College of Charleston is located in Charleston, South Carolina (SC)

      - Central State University is located in Wilberforce, Ohio (OH)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographical positions

      - Charleston, SC is on the Atlantic coast in the eastern part of the United
      States

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region, located inland and west of the Atlantic coastal
      states


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      - States along the Atlantic coast (like South Carolina) are generally east of
      Midwestern states (like Ohio)

      - On a map of the United States, South Carolina is clearly east of Ohio


      ## Conclusion

      YES, College of Charleston in South Carolina is located east of Central State
      University in Ohio.'

      - Colorado is located in the western/mountain region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Louisiana is entirely east of Colorado on the map of the United States

      - All locations in Louisiana will be east of all locations in Colorado


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since McNeese State University is in Louisiana, and Colorado State University
      Pueblo is in Colorado, and Louisiana is east of Colorado, McNeese State University
      must be east of Colorado State University Pueblo.

      to determine the geographical locations of Eastern Washington University (EWU)
      in Washington state and California College of the Arts (CCA) in California,
      and then compare their relative east-west positions.


      First, let''s think about the states:

      - Washington state is north of California

      - However, the question is about east-west positioning, not north-south


      Eastern Washington University is likely in the eastern part of Washington state
      (as the name suggests). Washington state is along the Pacific coast, but extends
      quite far inland to the east.


      California College of the Arts is in California. Let me think about where it
      might be located. California extends from the Pacific coast eastward, but doesn''t
      go as far east as Washington''s eastern border.


      Without knowing the exact locations of these schools within their states, I
      can make an educated guess:

      - Something called "Eastern Washington University" is very likely in the eastern
      part of Washington state

      - California College of the Arts could be anywhere in California, but many arts
      colleges tend to be in urban areas like San Francisco or Los Angeles, which
      are on or near the western coast


      The western parts of both states are aligned along the Pacific coast, but Washington''s
      eastern border extends further east than California''s eastern border. If Eastern
      Washington University is truly in the eastern part of Washington, it''s likely
      east of most or all locations in California, including where California College
      of the Arts would be.</think>To determine if Eastern Washington University (EWU)
      is located east of California College of the Arts (CCA), I need to find their
      relative positions on a west-east axis.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Eastern Washington University is located in Cheney, Washington, in the eastern
      part of Washington state.

      - California College of the Arts has campuses in San Francisco and Oakland,
      California, both of which are coastal cities on the western edge of California.


      Step 2: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Eastern Washington state is significantly inland from the Pacific coast.

      - San Francisco and Oakland are directly on the Pacific coast, at the westernmost
      side of the continental US.

      - Locations on the west coast have more westerly longitudes than inland locations
      to their east.


      Step 3: Consider their states'' relative positions.

      - While Washington is north of California, its eastern portions extend quite
      far inland.

      - Coastal California cities are among the westernmost points in the contiguous
      United States.


      Therefore, Eastern Washington University (being in eastern Washington) is located
      east of California College of the Arts (being on the California coast).

      1. Eastern Washington University (EWU) is in Washington state (WA), which is
      on the west coast of the United States, but inland from the coast in the eastern
      part of Washington.


      2. California College of the Arts (CCA) is in California (CA), which is also
      on the west coast of the United States, south of Washington state.


      3. In terms of east-west positioning in the United States, Washington state
      is north of California, but they are roughly aligned on the north-south axis.
      However, the question is about east-west positioning.


      4. California extends further west into the Pacific Ocean than Washington does.


      5. Eastern Washington University, as its name suggests, is in the eastern part
      of Washington state. The campus is in Cheney, Washington, which is in the eastern
      part of the state.


      6. California College of the Arts has campuses in San Francisco and Oakland,
      which are both in the western part of California, near the Pacific coast.


      7. Since Eastern Washington University is in the eastern part of Washington,
      and California College of the Arts is in the western part of California, and
      Washington is already east of California in general, Eastern Washington University
      would be east of California College of the Arts.</think># Is Eastern Washington

      - Eastern Washington University is located in Cheney, Washington (in the eastern
      part of Washington state)

      - California College of the Arts has campuses in San Francisco and Oakland,
      California (in the western part of California)


      Step 2: Compare the states geographically.

      - Washington state is north of California

      - Both are on the west coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations within their states.

      - Eastern Washington University is in the eastern part of Washington

      - California College of the Arts is in the western part of California, right
      near the Pacific coast


      Step 4: Determine relative east-west positioning.

      - California''s western coast extends further west than Washington''s coast

      - Eastern Washington is significantly inland from the Pacific coast

      - The eastern part of Washington state is east of the San Francisco Bay Area


      Therefore, YES, Eastern Washington University is located east of California

      of the United States.


      The United States runs roughly from west to east, with the Pacific Ocean on
      the west coast and the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast.


      Let me think about the locations of Washington state and California:

      - Washington state is in the northwestern United States, bordering the Pacific
      Ocean

      - California is also on the west coast, south of Washington state

      - Both states share the Pacific coast, but Washington is north of California


      Now, within these states:

      - Eastern Washington University, as the name suggests, is likely in the eastern
      part of Washington state

      - California College of the Arts is somewhere in California


      Generally speaking, locations in Washington state would be north of locations
      in California, but the question is about east-west positioning, not north-south.


      Since both states are on the west coast, their east-west positioning would depend
      on their exact locations within their respective states. Eastern Washington
      University is specifically noted to be in the "eastern" part of Washington,
      which suggests it''s further inland (eastward) from the Pacific coast. However,
      I don''t have specific information about the exact location of California College
      of the Arts within California.


      But I can make a reasonable inference: Washington state as a whole is east of
      California (because the US west coast angles northwest to southeast). So Eastern
      Washington University, being in the eastern part of Washington, would almost
      certainly be east of any location in California, including California College
      of the Arts.</think># Is Eastern Washington University, WA located east of California

      coast where San Francisco and Oakland are located.


      4) Eastern Washington University, being in the eastern part of Washington, is

      Eastern Washington University (EWU) is in Washington state (WA), and specifically
      in Cheney, Washington. Washington state is in the Pacific Northwest region of
      the United States.


      California College of the Arts (CCA) is in California (CA). California is on
      the west coast of the United States, south of Washington state.


      Now, to determine if EWU is east of CCA, I need to compare their longitudinal
      positions. "East" in geographical terms means further to the east in terms of
      longitude.


      Washington state is north of California, but that doesn''t automatically tell
      us about the east-west relationship. However, generally speaking, Washington
      state is not east of California - they''re both on the west coast, with Washington
      being north of California.


      Let me think about the specific locations of these institutions:

      - Eastern Washington University is in Cheney, Washington, which is in the eastern
      part of Washington state (hence the name "Eastern").

      - California College of the Arts has campuses in San Francisco and Oakland,
      California, which are in the western part of California.


      Since Washington state is not east of California (they''re both western states),
      and Eastern Washington University is in eastern Washington while California
      College of the Arts is in western California, it''s possible that EWU could
      be east of CCA, but I need to be more precise about their longitudinal positions.


      Actually, I know that eastern Washington is indeed east of western California.

      part of Washington state.

      - California College of the Arts has campuses in San Francisco and Oakland,
      California, which are in the western part of California.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions (longitudes).

      - Washington state is north of California, but that doesn''t tell us about their
      east-west relationship.

      - Eastern Washington (as the name suggests) is in the eastern portion of Washington
      state.

      - San Francisco and Oakland are on the Pacific coast, in the westernmost part
      of California.

      - The eastern part of Washington state is significantly east of the California

      Since Eastern Washington University is in eastern Washington, and California
      College of the Arts is on the California coast (the westernmost part of the

      2. Air University is located in Alabama (AL), which is a state in the southeastern

      Vermont is definitely located in the northeastern part of the US, while Alabama

      - Air University is in Alabama (AL)


      Vermont is located in the northeastern United States, along the eastern seaboard.

      Alabama is located in the southeastern United States, but is positioned more
      inland and westward compared to the New England states.


      On a west-to-east axis of the United States, Vermont is positioned significantly
      further east than Alabama. You can verify this by looking at a map - Vermont
      borders New Hampshire and is near the Atlantic coast, while Alabama is several
      states away from the eastern seaboard.


      Therefore, Community College of Vermont is located east of Air University.

      Let me think about the geography of the United States. The eastern states include
      the New England states (Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode
      Island, Connecticut), as well as New York, Pennsylvania, and states along the
      eastern seaboard.


      Alabama (AL) is located in the southeastern part of the United States, but it''s

      If I imagine a map of the US:

      - Vermont is in the northeast

      - Alabama is in the southeast


      On a west-to-east orientation:

      Alabama is further west than Vermont, which means Vermont is east of Alabama.

      - Vermont (VT) is located in the northeastern United States, specifically in
      New England.

      - Alabama (AL) is located in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Looking at a US map, Vermont is much further east than Alabama.

      - Vermont borders New Hampshire and is near the Atlantic coast.

      - Alabama is west of Georgia and several other eastern states.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      - Since Vermont as a state is east of Alabama, the Community College of Vermont
      must be east of Air University in Alabama.

    5613f352-580f-43f5-8656-31eb0d01ca81: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the geographic locations of both schools and compare them on an
      east-west basis.


      Step 1: Identify where Lyndon State College in Vermont is located geographically.

      Lyndon State College (now part of Northern Vermont University) is in Lyndonville,
      Vermont. Vermont is in the northeastern United States, bordering New York, Massachusetts,
      New Hampshire, and Canada.


      Step 2: Identify where Indiana University of Pennsylvania is located geographically.

      Indiana University of Pennsylvania is in Indiana, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania
      is in the northeastern/mid-Atlantic United States, west of New York and New
      Jersey.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west basis.

      Vermont is generally east of Pennsylvania on a map of the United States. Vermont
      is along the eastern border of New York, while Pennsylvania is west of New York.


      So if we''re comparing strictly on an east-west basis (longitude), Lyndon State
      College in Vermont would be east of Indiana University of Pennsylvania.</think>I''ll
      solve this by comparing the geographic locations of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Vermont (VT) is located in the northeastern United States, while Pennsylvania
      (PA) is in the mid-Atlantic region.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      Looking at a map of the US, Vermont is positioned to the east of Pennsylvania.
      Vermont borders New Hampshire on its east and New York on its west, while Pennsylvania
      is further west.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      Lyndon State College (now part of Northern Vermont University) is in Lyndonville,
      Vermont, in the northeastern part of the state.

      Indiana University of Pennsylvania is in Indiana, PA, which is in the western
      half of Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison.

      Since Vermont as a whole is east of Pennsylvania, and Lyndon State College is
      in the northeastern part of Vermont, while Indiana University of Pennsylvania
      is in the western part of Pennsylvania, Lyndon State College is definitely east
      of Indiana University of Pennsylvania.


      YES'

      1. Lyndon State College is in Lyndon, Vermont (VT)

      2. Indiana University of Pennsylvania is in Indiana, Pennsylvania (PA)


      Now I need to determine if Vermont is east of Pennsylvania. Looking at the US
      map:

      - Vermont is in the northeastern United States, bordering New York to the west
      and New Hampshire to the east

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern/mid-Atlantic United States, south of New
      York


      In terms of east-west positioning, Vermont is east of Pennsylvania. So Lyndon
      State College in Vermont would be east of Indiana University of Pennsylvania
      in Pennsylvania.


      To be even more precise, I should consider the specific locations within their
      states:

      - Lyndon is in northeastern Vermont

      - Indiana, PA is in western Pennsylvania


      This further confirms that Lyndon State College is east of Indiana University
      of Pennsylvania.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both colleges.

      - Lyndon State College (now part of Northern Vermont University) is located

      - Indiana University of Pennsylvania is located in Indiana, Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the east-west relationship between these states.

      - Vermont is in the northeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is also in the northeastern United States, but positioned west
      of Vermont


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within each state.

      - Lyndon is in northeastern Vermont

      - Indiana, PA is in western Pennsylvania


      Step 4: Compare the relative positions.

      Vermont lies entirely east of Pennsylvania on the US map. Furthermore, Lyndon''s
      position in northeastern Vermont puts it even further east compared to Indiana''s
      position in western Pennsylvania.


      YES, Lyndon State College in Vermont is located east of Indiana University of
      Pennsylvania.'

      University.


      To solve this, I need to think about the geographic positions of Vermont and
      Indiana within the United States:


      - Vermont (VT) is located in the northeastern United States, specifically in
      the New England region

      - Indiana (IN) is located in the midwestern United States


      On a west-to-east orientation of the United States:

      Let me think about the geographical locations:

      1. Saint Louis University is in St. Louis, Missouri

      2. Oklahoma State University-Tulsa is in Tulsa, Oklahoma


      Looking at a mental map of the United States:

      - Missouri is east of Oklahoma

      - St. Louis is on the eastern side of Missouri, near the Illinois border

      - Tulsa is in northeastern Oklahoma


      On a west-to-east orientation:

      Oklahoma is west of Missouri, and therefore Tulsa, OK would be west of St. Louis,
      MO.


      If Tulsa, OK is west of St. Louis, MO, then Saint Louis University would be
      east of Oklahoma State University-Tulsa.</think>To answer this question, I''ll
      determine the relative geographic positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Saint Louis University College of Arts and Sciences is in St. Louis, Missouri.

      - Oklahoma State University-Tulsa is in Tulsa, Oklahoma.


      Step 2: Compare the states geographically.

      - Oklahoma is located west of Missouri on the U.S. map.

      - Missouri''s eastern border touches Illinois, while Oklahoma is further west.


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      - St. Louis is on the eastern side of Missouri, along the Mississippi River.

      - Tulsa is in northeastern Oklahoma.


      Step 4: Determine relative position.

      - Since Oklahoma is west of Missouri, and Tulsa and St. Louis are both in their
      respective states, Saint Louis University must be east of Oklahoma State University-Tulsa.


      YES, Saint Louis University College of Arts and Sciences in Missouri is located
      east of Oklahoma State University-Tulsa in Oklahoma.'

      3. To determine if Lewis University is east of Midwestern State University of
      Texas, I need to compare their geographical positions on a west-east axis.


      4. Illinois is generally east of Texas on a US map. Illinois borders the Mississippi
      River on its western side and extends eastward toward Indiana and Lake Michigan.
      Texas is much further west, bordering New Mexico to its west and extending eastward
      to Louisiana.


      5. Therefore, any location in Illinois would typically be east of any location
      in Texas.


      Since Lewis University is in Illinois and Midwestern State University is in
      Texas, Lewis University would be east of Midwestern State University of Texas.</think>To
      determine whether Lewis University in Illinois is located east of Midwestern
      State University of Texas, I need to consider their geographical positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Lewis University is located in Illinois (IL), which is in the Midwest region
      of the United States.

      - Midwestern State University is located in Texas (TX), which is in the south-central
      part of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Illinois is positioned in the eastern part of the Midwest, bordering Indiana
      to its east and the Mississippi River to its west.

      - Texas is positioned significantly farther west than Illinois, lying in the
      southern plains region.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on U.S. geography.

      - All of Illinois is east of Texas on a map of the United States.

      - Therefore, Lewis University (in Illinois) must be east of Midwestern State
      University (in Texas).

      United States

      2. Midwestern State University of Texas is in Texas (TX), which is in the southern
      central part of the United States


      Now, I need to determine their positions in terms of east and west:

      - Illinois is generally east of Texas on a US map

      - States east of the Mississippi River (like Illinois) are east of states in
      the central/western part of the country (like Texas)


      To be more specific:

      - Lewis University is located in Romeoville, Illinois

      - Midwestern State University is located in Wichita Falls, Texas


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), places farther east have higher
      longitude values, while places farther west have lower longitude values. Illinois
      is definitely east of Texas on a map of the United States.

      1. Keuka College is located in Keuka Park, New York (NY).

      2. Reinhardt University is located in Waleska, Georgia (GA).


      Now I need to determine if Keuka College is east of Reinhardt University.


      Generally speaking:

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New York is typically east of Georgia on a map of the United States

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - On a map of the United States, New York is positioned east of Georgia

      - This means locations in New York (including Keuka College) are generally east
      of locations in Georgia (including Reinhardt University)

      - New York is in the northeastern part of the United States

      - Georgia is in the southeastern part of the United States


      Step 2: When comparing east-west positioning in the US:

      - Generally, states further east have smaller longitude values (when using negative

      Step 3: More specifically:

      - Keuka College is in New York state

      - Reinhardt University is in Georgia state

      - Since New York is east of Georgia, Keuka College would be east of Reinhardt
      University

      New York state is generally around 73-79 degrees west longitude.

      Georgia is generally around 81-85 degrees west longitude.

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - University of New Hampshire at Manchester is in Manchester, New Hampshire
      (NH)

      - Shorter University is in Georgia (GA)


      I need to compare their positions from east to west. In the United States, locations
      further east have higher longitude values (more towards the Atlantic Ocean),
      while locations further west have lower longitude values (more towards the Pacific

      New Hampshire is a state in the northeastern United States, part of the New
      England region.

      Georgia is a state in the southeastern United States.


      In terms of geographical position:

      - New Hampshire is located on the east coast of the US, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean

      - Georgia is also in the eastern US, but not as far east as New Hampshire


      New Hampshire is definitely east of Georgia on a US map. Manchester, NH would

      if Andrews University in Michigan is located east of University of Louisiana
      at Monroe in Louisiana.


      To answer this, I need to think about the relative geographic positions of Michigan
      and Louisiana, and specifically these two universities.


      Michigan is in the Great Lakes region in the northern part of the United States,
      while Louisiana is in the southern part of the country along the Gulf of Mexico.


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Michigan is generally in the Midwest/Great Lakes region

      - Louisiana is in the South/Gulf Coast region


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Michigan is roughly positioned in the north-central to northeastern part of
      the country

      - Louisiana is positioned in the south-central part of the country


      While Michigan is more northern than Louisiana, the question is specifically
      about east-west positioning.


      Michigan is generally east of Louisiana. Andrews University is in Berrien Springs,
      Michigan which is in the southwestern part of Michigan. University of Louisiana
      at Monroe is in Monroe, Louisiana, which is in the northeastern part of Louisiana.


      Even though Andrews is in western Michigan and UL Monroe is in eastern Louisiana,
      Michigan as a whole is still east of Louisiana in the country.</think>To determine
      if Andrews University (Michigan) is east of University of Louisiana at Monroe
      (Louisiana), I need to consider their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the general locations of these states.

      - Michigan is in the Great Lakes region in the northern United States

      - Louisiana is in the southern United States along the Gulf of Mexico


      Step 2: Consider their east-west positioning.

      - Michigan is located in the eastern half of the United States

      - Louisiana is also in the eastern half, but further west than Michigan


      Step 3: Check the specific locations within their states.

      - Andrews University is in Berrien Springs, in southwestern Michigan

      - University of Louisiana at Monroe is in northeastern Louisiana


      Step 4: Compare their longitudes.

      - Even though Andrews is in western Michigan and UL Monroe is in eastern Louisiana,
      Michigan as a whole is still considerably east of Louisiana on the US map

      - The westernmost parts of Michigan are generally still east of the easternmost
      parts of Louisiana

      Specifically, it''s asking if Wichita State University is located east of Lubbock
      Christian University.


      Let me think about their locations:


      Wichita State University is in Wichita, Kansas. Kansas is in the central part
      of the United States.


      Lubbock Christian University is in Lubbock, Texas. Texas is in the southern
      part of the United States, but extends quite far west.


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to consider their longitude.
      A lower longitude number indicates a more western location, while a higher longitude
      number indicates a more eastern location.

      - Wichita, Kansas is located in south-central Kansas

      - Lubbock, Texas is located in the northwestern part of Texas, in what''s sometimes

      - Wichita is located in south-central Kansas

      - Lubbock is located in the northwestern part of Texas (in the Texas Panhandle
      region)


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Lubbock, Texas is significantly further west in the United States compared
      to Wichita, Kansas

      - The Texas Panhandle extends quite far west, while Kansas as a whole lies more
      eastward


      Step 4: Make the east-west determination.

      - Since Lubbock is further west, Wichita must be further east

      The United States generally has states arranged where:

      University is in California (CA), Utah State University Eastern would be located
      east of National Hispanic University.


      Let me double-check this logic. On a map of the United States:

      - Utah is inland, to the east of California


      So this confirms my reasoning.</think>I need to determine the relative geographic

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Utah is located inland, to the east of California


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the universities.

      - Utah is located inland, to the east of California

      - Utah and California aren''t adjacent states (Nevada lies between them)


      Step 3: Since Utah is east of California on the map of the United States, it
      follows that Utah State University Eastern (in Utah) would be east of National
      Hispanic University (in California).

      colleges are located.


      Wittenberg University is in Ohio (OH), and Mitchell Technical College is in
      South Dakota (SD).


      Now I need to determine their relative east-west positions. In the United States,
      states that are further east have a lower longitude value, and states that are
      further west have a higher longitude value.


      Ohio is in the eastern part of the United States, while South Dakota is in the
      middle/northern part of the United States.


      Specifically, Ohio is in the Midwest but borders the eastern states of Pennsylvania
      and West Virginia. South Dakota is further west in the Great Plains region.


      So comparing these two:

      - Ohio is east of South Dakota

      - Therefore, Wittenberg University in Ohio is east of Mitchell Technical College
      in South Dakota</think>Let me determine the relative east-west positions of
      these two institutions:

      Step 2: Compare the geographic positions of these states.

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region of the United States, bordering Pennsylvania
      to its east

      - South Dakota is in the Great Plains region, much further west than Ohio


      Step 3: Verify the east-west relationship.

      - On a US map, Ohio is significantly east of South Dakota

      - All locations in Ohio have a lower longitude (more eastern) than locations
      in South Dakota


      Therefore, Wittenberg University in Ohio is indeed located east of Mitchell
      Technical College in South Dakota.

      First, let me think about the geographic locations of these states:

      - New Jersey (NJ) is on the east coast of the United States

      - Indiana (IN) is in the Midwest region of the United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New Jersey is significantly east of Indiana

      - States east of Indiana include Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and the New England
      states, along with New Jersey


      Since Kean University is in New Jersey and Purdue University Fort Wayne is in
      Indiana, and New Jersey is east of Indiana, it follows that Kean University
      would be east of Purdue University Fort Wayne.


      Let me double-check this reasoning: moving from west to east across the US,
      you would encounter Indiana before New Jersey. This confirms that any point
      in New Jersey would be east of any point in Indiana (barring any extremely unusual
      campus locations that cross state lines, which is not typical).</think>I''ll
      think about this step by step, considering the geographic locations of these
      universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Kean University is located in Union, New Jersey (NJ)

      - Purdue University Fort Wayne is located in Fort Wayne, Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Indiana is significantly west of New Jersey

      - Moving from west to east across the continental US, you would encounter Indiana
      before reaching New Jersey


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on their state locations.

      Since Kean University is in New Jersey (an East Coast state) and Purdue University
      Fort Wayne is in Indiana (a Midwest state), Kean University is located east
      of Purdue University Fort Wayne.

      determine the relative east-west positions of:

      1. Westfield State University in Massachusetts (MA)

      2. University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine in Pennsylvania (PA)


      First, let''s identify where they are approximately located:

      - Westfield State University is located in Westfield, Massachusetts, which is
      in western Massachusetts

      - University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
      which is in western Pennsylvania


      Now I need to think about their relative positions on an east-west axis. Going
      by US geography:

      - Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania on the US map

      - Even though Westfield is in western Massachusetts, Massachusetts as a whole
      is east of Pennsylvania

      - Pittsburgh is located in the western part of Pennsylvania


      So even though Westfield is in "western" Massachusetts, the entire state of
      Massachusetts is east of western Pennsylvania where Pittsburgh is located.</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Westfield State University is in Westfield, Massachusetts (MA)

      - University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
      (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is located west of Massachusetts


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within each state.

      - Westfield is in western Massachusetts

      - Pittsburgh is in western Pennsylvania


      Step 4: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Even though Westfield is in "western" Massachusetts, Massachusetts as a whole
      is east of Pennsylvania

      - Pittsburgh is quite far west in Pennsylvania, near the Ohio border


      Step 5: Make the final determination.

      - Westfield, MA (even in western MA) is still east of Pittsburgh, PA

      1) Westfield State University is in Westfield, Massachusetts (MA)

      2) University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
      (PA)


      To figure out which is more eastern, I need to consider the relative positions
      of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. In the United States:

      - Massachusetts is located in New England, on the eastern seaboard

      - Pennsylvania is also on the eastern part of the US, but is west of Massachusetts


      Generally speaking, Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania. So a university in
      Massachusetts would typically be east of a university in Pennsylvania.


      To be more precise:

      - Westfield, MA is in western Massachusetts

      - Pittsburgh, PA is in western Pennsylvania


      However, even western Massachusetts is still east of western Pennsylvania in
      terms of longitude. The entirety of Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania.


      So Westfield State University in Massachusetts would be east of the University
      of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine in Pennsylvania.</think>I''ll determine
      which institution is further east by examining their locations.

      - Westfield State University is in Westfield, Massachusetts (MA)

      - University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
      (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical position of Massachusetts relative to Pennsylvania.

      - Massachusetts is located in New England on the eastern seaboard

      - Pennsylvania is also on the eastern side of the US, but positioned west of
      Massachusetts


      Step 3: Even though Westfield is in western Massachusetts, and Pittsburgh is
      in western Pennsylvania, the entire state of Massachusetts lies east of Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Therefore, Westfield State University in MA is positioned east of the
      University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine in PA.

      Now to determine which is more eastern:

      - Virginia Beach, VA is on the Atlantic coast, pretty far east

      - Pensacola, FL is on the Gulf Coast, in the westernmost part of Florida

      Step 1: Let me identify where Regent University in Virginia is located.

      Regent University is located in Virginia Beach, Virginia, which is on the Atlantic
      coast of Virginia, in the eastern part of the United States.


      Step 2: Let me identify where the University of West Florida is located.

      The University of West Florida is located in Pensacola, Florida, which is in
      the Florida Panhandle, on the Gulf Coast in the western part of Florida.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Virginia is located on the east coast of the United States, while Florida extends
      from the Gulf of Mexico in the west to the Atlantic Ocean in the east. Specifically,
      Pensacola (where UWF is) is in the westernmost part of Florida''s panhandle,

      Pensacola, FL is in the far western part of Florida, in the panhandle that extends
      along the Gulf Coast. This is one of the westernmost points in Florida.


      Virginia Beach, VA where Regent University is located is on the Atlantic coast,
      which is the eastern edge of Virginia.

      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1) Bentley University is located in Waltham, Massachusetts, which is in the
      northeastern United States on the Atlantic coast.


      2) The University of South Florida St. Petersburg is in St. Petersburg, Florida,
      which is on Florida''s west coast along the Gulf of Mexico.


      3) St. Petersburg is on the western side of the Florida peninsula, not on Florida''s
      eastern Atlantic coast.


      4) Massachusetts is entirely east of the Gulf Coast of Florida.


      5) Cities on the Atlantic Coast (like Waltham, MA) are generally further east
      than cities on the Gulf Coast (like St. Petersburg, FL).


      Therefore, Bentley University in Massachusetts is located east of the University
      of South Florida St. Petersburg.

      Let me think about where these universities are located:


      1. Bentley University is in Waltham, Massachusetts, which is near Boston on
      the East Coast.


      2. University of South Florida St. Petersburg is in St. Petersburg, Florida,
      which is on the west coast of Florida, on the Gulf of Mexico.

      Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States, while Florida is in the
      southeastern United States. But the question is specifically about the east-west
      positioning.


      Generally, Massachusetts is further east than Florida. The west coast of Florida

      I need to determine the east-west relationship between these two universities
      based on their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Bentley University is in Waltham, Massachusetts, which is near Boston on the
      northeastern coast of the US.

      - University of South Florida St. Petersburg is in St. Petersburg, Florida,
      which is on the Gulf Coast (western side) of Florida.

      State University Paragould, AR located east of Williston State College, ND?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states. Arkansas (AR) is in the south-central United States,
      while North Dakota (ND) is in the northern Great Plains region.


      Step 2: Consider their positions on the US map. In terms of longitude (east-west
      positioning), Arkansas is generally east of North Dakota. North Dakota is part
      of the upper Great Plains region, while Arkansas is closer to the Mississippi
      River.


      Step 3: Looking more specifically at the cities, Paragould is in northeastern
      Arkansas, while Williston is in northwestern North Dakota. This further increases
      the east-west distance between them.


      Step 4: Arkansas State University Paragould would have a lower longitude value
      (more eastern position) than Williston State College.

      Ave Maria University is located in Ave Maria, Florida. Florida is in the southeastern
      United States, extending into the Atlantic Ocean.


      ## Step 2: Locate Western Kentucky University-Owensboro

      Western Kentucky University-Owensboro is in Owensboro, Kentucky. As the name
      suggests, Owensboro is in the western part of Kentucky, which is already west
      of Florida geographically.


      ## Step 3: Compare relative positions

      - Kentucky is north of Florida

      - Western Kentucky, specifically, is in the western portion of Kentucky

      - Florida extends further east than Kentucky

      - Owensboro, being in western Kentucky, is even further west

      First, let''s identify the locations:

      1. Everglades University is in Florida (FL). Florida is on the southeastern
      coast of the United States.

      2. Southwest Baptist University is in Missouri (MO). Missouri is in the central
      United States.


      Geographically speaking, the United States has its eastern edge on the Atlantic
      Ocean and western edge on the Pacific Ocean. States on the east coast (like

      - Everglades University is in Florida (FL), which is on the southeastern coast
      of the United States.

      - Southwest Baptist University is in Missouri (MO), which is located in the
      central part of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Florida is on the Atlantic coast, forming part of the eastern seaboard of
      the US.

      - Missouri is an inland state in the middle of the country, significantly west
      of the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Apply the cardinal directions.

      - States on the Atlantic coast (like Florida) are east of central states (like
      Missouri).

      - Looking at a US map, Florida is clearly east of Missouri.


      YES, Everglades University in Florida is located east of Southwest Baptist University

      1. Troy University is in Troy, Alabama (AL)

      2. New Orleans University would be in New Orleans, Louisiana (LA)


      Now, I need to think about the geography of the southeastern United States.


      Alabama is generally east of Louisiana. Looking at a mental map:

      - Louisiana is on the Gulf Coast, with Mississippi to its east

      - Alabama is east of Mississippi

      - So Alabama is east of Louisiana


      More specifically:

      - Troy, AL is in the southeastern part of Alabama

      - New Orleans, LA is in the southeastern part of Louisiana, on the Gulf Coast


      Given that Alabama is east of Louisiana, Troy University would be east of New

      However, for the purpose of this geographical question, I can still determine
      if Troy, AL is east of New Orleans, LA.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Troy University is located in Troy, Alabama (AL)

      - New Orleans University would be in New Orleans, Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - On a US map, Alabama is located to the east of Louisiana

      - Troy is in the southeastern part of Alabama

      - New Orleans is in the southeastern part of Louisiana


      Step 3: Compare their specific east-west positions.

      - Louisiana and Alabama share a general north-south alignment

      - But Alabama is clearly positioned to the east of Louisiana on the map

      - This means Troy, AL would be east of New Orleans, LA


      YES, Troy University in Alabama is located east of New Orleans University in
      Louisiana.'

      in Alabama is located east of New Orleans University in Louisiana.


      To solve this problem, I need to know the relative geographical positions of
      these two universities. Let me think about the general geography of Alabama
      and Louisiana in the United States:


      - Alabama is located east of Louisiana in the United States

      - Troy, Alabama would be somewhere in Alabama

      - New Orleans, Louisiana would be in southeastern Louisiana


      Generally speaking, locations in Alabama tend to be east of locations in Louisiana
      because Alabama is east of Louisiana. However, I should be more precise about
      these specific universities.


      Troy University is located in Troy, Alabama, which is in the southeastern part
      of Alabama.


      I need to be careful here because the question refers to "New Orleans University,
      LA" - I need to check if there is actually a university with this exact name.
      There''s the University of New Orleans, but I''m not immediately sure if there
      is a "New Orleans University" specifically.


      For the purposes of reasoning, let''s assume the question refers to a university
      in New Orleans, Louisiana. New Orleans is located in the southeastern part of
      Louisiana, close to the Gulf of Mexico.


      Given that Alabama is east of Louisiana, and Troy is in Alabama while New Orleans
      is in Louisiana, Troy University would be east of any university in New Orleans.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions
      of Troy University in Alabama and New Orleans University in Louisiana.


      Step 1: Consider the states where these universities are located.

      - Troy University is in Alabama (AL)

      - New Orleans University is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - Alabama is located to the east of Louisiana on the US map

      - Both states are along the Gulf Coast, with Louisiana to the west and Alabama
      to the east


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - Troy, Alabama is in the southeastern part of Alabama

      - New Orleans is in the southeastern part of Louisiana


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      - Even accounting for their specific locations within their states, any location
      in Alabama (including Troy) would be east of New Orleans because of the overall
      geographic arrangement of these states.


      YES, Troy University in Alabama is located east of New Orleans University in
      Louisiana.'

      5. I need to be careful here because the question mentions "New Orleans University,
      LA" - I should check if this is a real institution. There is the University
      of New Orleans, but I''m not certain there is a university specifically called
      "New Orleans University." For this geographic reasoning, I''ll assume it refers
      to a university in New Orleans, Louisiana.


      6. New Orleans is located in the southeastern part of Louisiana, near the Gulf
      Coast.


      7. Since Alabama is east of Louisiana, and Troy is not in the extreme western
      part of Alabama while New Orleans is in the southeastern part of Louisiana,
      Troy University would be east of any university in New Orleans.


      So yes, Troy University in Alabama is located east of New Orleans (or any university
      in New Orleans), Louisiana.</think># Reasoning Step by Step


      To determine if Troy University in Alabama is east of New Orleans University
      in Louisiana, I need to analyze their geographic locations:


      1) First, let me consider the states: Alabama is located east of Louisiana on
      the US map.


      2) Troy University is located in the city of Troy in southeastern Alabama.


      3) New Orleans is located in southeastern Louisiana, near the Gulf Coast.


      4) Even though both cities are in the southeastern portions of their respective
      states, since Alabama as a whole is east of Louisiana, Troy (in Alabama) must
      be east of New Orleans (in Louisiana).


      5) Looking at a map, Troy, AL is approximately 300 miles east of New Orleans,
      LA.

      First, let''s identify where each university is located:

      - Benedictine University is in Illinois (IL)

      - University of Texas at San Antonio is in Texas (TX)


      Now I need to think about the relative locations of Illinois and Texas on a
      map of the United States:


      Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States, roughly in the middle-eastern
      part of the country.

      Texas is in the southern United States, and particularly San Antonio is in the
      south-central part of Texas.


      In terms of east-west orientation:

      - Illinois is generally east of Texas

      - Specifically, Benedictine University in Illinois would be east of the University
      of Texas at San Antonio


      Looking at their approximate coordinates:

      - Illinois is roughly around 88-91 degrees West longitude

      - San Antonio, Texas is roughly around 98 degrees West longitude


      Lower longitude numbers in the Western Hemisphere mean further east, so Illinois
      having a lower longitude number than Texas confirms that Illinois is east of
      Texas.</think># Determining if Benedictine University, IL is east of University
      of Texas at San Antonio, TX


      I need to analyze the geographic locations of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Benedictine University is in Illinois (IL), specifically in Lisle, a suburb
      of Chicago

      - University of Texas at San Antonio is in San Antonio, Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Consider their positions on the US map

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - On a west-to-east orientation, Illinois is positioned to the east of Texas


      ## Step 3: Compare approximate longitudes

      - Illinois is roughly around 88-90 degrees West longitude

      - San Antonio, Texas is roughly around 98 degrees West longitude

      - Lower longitude numbers in the Western Hemisphere indicate locations further
      east


      Therefore, Benedictine University in Illinois is indeed located east of the

      - Illinois borders Lake Michigan on the east side and the Mississippi River
      on the west

      - Texas is much further west, bordering the Gulf of Mexico and extending toward
      the southwestern US


      ## Step 3: Determine specific city locations

      - Benedictine University is in Lisle, Illinois (suburban Chicago area)

      - University of Texas at San Antonio is in San Antonio, Texas (central/southern
      Texas)

      I need to determine if Wayne State is east of Drury University.


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Michigan (MI) is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, on the eastern side of
      the Midwest

      - Missouri (MO) is also in the Midwest, but further west than Michigan

      - Wayne State University is in Detroit, Michigan, which is in the eastern part
      of Michigan

      - Drury University is in Springfield, Missouri, which is in the southwestern
      part of Missouri


      Looking at a mental map of the United States, Missouri is west of Michigan.
      Detroit is in the eastern part of Michigan, near the border with Canada, while
      Springfield, Missouri is more centrally located in the US.


      So geographically, Wayne State University in Detroit, MI would be east of Drury

      ## Step 1: Locate both universities

      - Wayne State University School of Social Work is in Detroit, Michigan (MI)

      - Drury University is in Springfield, Missouri (MO)


      ## Step 2: Determine their relative east-west positions

      - Michigan is located in the Great Lakes region in the eastern part of the Midwest

      - Missouri is located in the central United States, west of Michigan

      - Detroit (where Wayne State is located) is in the eastern part of Michigan

      - Springfield (where Drury University is located) is in southwestern Missouri


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      Looking at their relative positions on a map of the United States, Detroit,
      MI is clearly east of Springfield, MO. The entire state of Michigan is east
      of Missouri.


      ## Conclusion

      YES, Wayne State University School of Social Work in Michigan is located east
      of Drury University in Missouri.'

      relative geographic positions of two institutions:

      1. Graceland University in Iowa (IA)

      2. Whitacre College of Engineering in Texas (TX)


      I need to determine if Graceland University is east of Whitacre College of Engineering.


      First, let me locate these institutions more precisely:


      Graceland University is in Lamoni, Iowa. Iowa is in the Midwest region of the
      United States.


      Whitacre College of Engineering is part of Texas Tech University, which is located
      in Lubbock, Texas. Texas is in the South/Southwest region of the United States.


      Now, to determine which is further east, I need to compare their relative positions
      on a map. In the United States:

      - East is toward the Atlantic Ocean

      - West is toward the Pacific Ocean


      Iowa is generally east of Texas on a map of the United States. Iowa is in the
      central part of the country but further east than Texas, which extends further
      to the southwest.</think>To determine if Graceland University in Iowa is located
      east of Whitacre College of Engineering in Texas, I need to consider the geographic
      locations of these institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations more precisely.

      - Graceland University is located in Lamoni, Iowa (IA)

      - Whitacre College of Engineering is part of Texas Tech University, located
      in Lubbock, Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions on the map of the United States.

      - Iowa is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Texas is in the South/Southwest region


      Step 3: Determine their relative east-west positioning.

      - Iowa is positioned in the central part of the country

      - Texas is positioned further southwest

      - On a standard map of the United States, Iowa is east of Texas


      Therefore, Graceland University in Iowa is indeed located east of Whitacre College
      of Engineering in Texas.


      YES'

      University in Iowa is located east of Whitacre College of Engineering in Texas.
      I''ll solve this by identifying the locations and comparing their relative positions
      on a map (east-west orientation).


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Graceland University is in Iowa (IA)

      - Whitacre College of Engineering is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      Iowa is in the Midwest region of the United States, while Texas is in the South/Southwest
      region. Generally, Iowa is located to the north and east of Texas.


      Step 3: More specifically, Iowa borders Illinois to its east, Missouri to its
      south, Nebraska to its west, and Minnesota and Wisconsin to its north. Texas
      is much further south and west compared to Iowa.


      Step 4: In terms of longitude (east-west position), Iowa is generally east of
      Texas. The easternmost part of Texas might be similar in longitude to the westernmost
      part of Iowa, but overall, Iowa is east of Texas.


      Since Graceland University is in Iowa and Whitacre College of Engineering is
      in Texas, Graceland University should be east of Whitacre College of Engineering.</think>#
      Is Graceland University, IA located east of Whitacre College of Engineering,
      TX?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two institutions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Graceland University is in Iowa (IA)

      - Whitacre College of Engineering is in Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Consider US geography

      Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Texas is in
      the South/Southwest region.


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positions

      Looking at US geography, Iowa is positioned significantly east of Texas on the
      map. Even the westernmost part of Iowa is generally east of most of Texas.


      ## Step 4: Conclude based on states'' positions

      Since Graceland University is in Iowa and Whitacre College of Engineering is
      in Texas, and Iowa is east of Texas, Graceland University is east of Whitacre
      College of Engineering.

      - Nevada is located west of Utah

      - Therefore, Colorado is east of Nevada


      Step 3: Since Adams State University is in Colorado, and Colorado is east of
      Nevada (where Roseman University is located), Adams State University must be
      east of Roseman University of Health Sciences.

    b8692be8-cc04-43e6-9688-3e5ab5312ee5: '<think>To determine if Adams State University
      in Colorado is east of Roseman University of Health Sciences in Nevada, I need
      to consider the relative positions of these two states and universities within
      the United States.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' locations.

      - Colorado (CO) is located in the Rocky Mountain region of the western United
      States.

      - Nevada (NV) is located in the western United States, bordering California
      to the west.


      Step 2: Compare the east-west positions of the states.

      Looking at a US map, Colorado is directly east of Utah, which is east of Nevada.
      So Colorado as a state is east of Nevada.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations of the universities within their states.

      - Adams State University is in Alamosa, CO, which is in southern Colorado.

      - Roseman University of Health Sciences has campuses in Henderson and Summerlin,
      NV, both near Las Vegas in southern Nevada.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Colorado is east of Nevada on a map of the United States, and these universities
      are not on opposite edges of their respective states in a way that would change
      this relationship, Adams State University in Colorado would be east of Roseman
      University of Health Sciences in Nevada.</think>To determine if Adams State
      University in Colorado is located east of Roseman University of Health Sciences
      in Nevada, I need to analyze their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Consider the locations of Colorado and Nevada.

      Colorado is positioned in the Rocky Mountain region of the western United States,
      while Nevada is further west, bordering California.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on the east-west axis.

      On a US map, Colorado is clearly east of Nevada. The entire state of Colorado
      sits east of the entire state of Nevada, with Utah positioned between them.


      Step 3: Consider specific locations within each state.

      Adams State University is in Alamosa, Colorado (southern Colorado).

      Roseman University has campuses in Henderson and Summerlin, Nevada (near Las
      Vegas).


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Colorado is entirely east of Nevada, any location in Colorado (including
      Adams State University) would be east of any location in Nevada (including Roseman
      University).


      YES'
    db0d2b1c-800a-4e5c-bf80-c559acc548f8: '<think>Let me solve this by identifying
      the locations of these two universities and comparing their east-west positions.


      1. Adams State University is located in Alamosa, Colorado (CO).

      2. Roseman University of Health Sciences is located in Nevada (NV).


      Now I need to determine which is further east. The United States generally has
      states arranged with western states on the left (west) and eastern states on
      the right (east) when looking at a map.


      Colorado is located east of Nevada. Nevada borders California on the west, while
      Colorado is several states to the east of Nevada (with Utah in between).


      So in terms of states:

      - Nevada is more western

      - Colorado is more eastern


      Therefore, Adams State University in Colorado would be located east of Roseman
      University of Health Sciences in Nevada.</think>To determine if Adams State
      University in Colorado is located east of Roseman University of Health Sciences
      in Nevada, I need to compare their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' locations.

      Colorado (CO) is located in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States.

      Nevada (NV) is located in the western United States.


      Step 2: Compare the east-west positioning of these states.

      Looking at a US map, Nevada is positioned to the west of Colorado. Colorado
      and Nevada are not adjacent - Utah sits between them.


      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      Since Colorado is east of Nevada, and Adams State University is in Colorado
      while Roseman University is in Nevada, Adams State University must be east of
      Roseman University.
