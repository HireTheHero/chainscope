      - This is actually a Star Wars anthology book edited by Kevin J. Anderson, published
      in 1995

      - Mark Budz is not the primary author of this book, so I''ll confirm the publication
      year


      3. Comparing the publication years:

      - "Millicent Min, Girl Genius" (2003)

      - "Tales from Jabba''s Palace" (1995)


      4. Determining which came later:

      - 2003 is later than 1995
