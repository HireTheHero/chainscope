      \ check their latitudes:\n   - Swainsboro, GA is located at approximately 32.6\xB0\
      \ N latitude\n   - Timber Pines, FL is located at approximately 28.5\xB0 N latitude\n\
      \n4. Since Swainsboro's latitude is higher (more northerly) than Timber Pines,\
      \ Swainsboro is located north of Timber Pines.\n\nAnswer: YES"

      \ I'll locate Swainsboro, GA on a map. It is in Emanuel County in southeastern\
      \ Georgia.\n\n2. Next, I'll locate Timber Pines, FL. It is in Hernando County\
      \ in west-central Florida.\n\n3. Looking at their latitudes:\n   - Swainsboro,\
      \ GA is at approximately 32.6\xB0 N latitude\n   - Timber Pines, FL is at approximately\
