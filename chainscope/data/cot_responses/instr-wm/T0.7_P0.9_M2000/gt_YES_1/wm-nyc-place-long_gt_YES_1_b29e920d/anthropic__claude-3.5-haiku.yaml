      5. Looking at the street numbers, Alpine Cinemas is at 6817 and Bravo Ambulance
      is at 7420.


      6. In Brooklyn, lower street numbers are generally west, and higher street numbers
      are generally east.


      7. Since Alpine Cinemas has a lower street number (6817) compared to Bravo Ambulance
      (7420), Alpine Cinemas is WEST of Bravo Ambulance.


      8. Therefore, Alpine Cinemas is NOT east of Bravo Volunteer Ambulance Service.


      The answer is: NO.'

      - Specifically, it is on the Lower East Side of Manhattan

      - Its address is near the East River


      2. Next, let''s locate Dyker Beach Park Ballfield 5:

      - It is located in Brooklyn

      - Specifically, it is in the southwestern part of Brooklyn


      3. Now, let''s consider their relative east-west positions:

      - Manhattan is generally east of Brooklyn

      - The Lower East Side of Manhattan is even further east than Brooklyn''s southwestern
      area


      4. Therefore, Stuyvesant High School is located east of Dyker Beach Park Ballfield
      5.


      Answer: YES'

      1. First, let''s locate Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan:

      - It is located in Lower Manhattan, specifically in the Tribeca neighborhood

      - Its precise location is on Chambers Street near the West Side Highway


      2. Next, let''s locate Dyker Beach Park Ballfield 5 in Brooklyn:

      - Dyker Beach Park is located in southwestern Brooklyn, in the Dyker Heights
      neighborhood

      - This means the ballfield is in southern Brooklyn


      3. Now, let''s compare their geographical positions:

      - Stuyvesant High School is in Lower Manhattan, which is west of Brooklyn

      - Dyker Beach Park is in southern Brooklyn, which is east of Manhattan


      4. Therefore, Stuyvesant High School is west of Dyker Beach Park Ballfield 5.


      The question asks: "Is STUYVESANT HIGH SCHOOL, Manhattan located east of DYKER
      BEACH PARK BALLFIELD 5, Brooklyn?"


      Since Stuyvesant High School is west of the ballfield, not east, the answer
      is:


      NO'

      Step 1: Arch Street Yard is in Queens, which is east of Manhattan.


      Step 2: St. Nicholas Houses are located in Manhattan, specifically in Harlem,
      which is in the western part of Manhattan.


      Step 3: Since Queens is east of Manhattan, and Arch Street Yard is in Queens,
      it is definitively east of any location in Manhattan.


      Therefore, Arch Street Yard is east of St. Nicholas Houses Building 13.

      - Pink Houses is in the eastern part of Brooklyn


      4. To determine "east of", I''ll compare their longitude coordinates

      - The Bronx is west of Brooklyn

      - Therefore, a location in the Bronx cannot be east of a location in Brooklyn


      5. Conclusion: Blessed Sacrament Church is NOT east of Pink Houses Building
      3


      Answer: NO'
    d67f28ac-adbc-4c29-b655-4bc7b1720c33: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to understand the locations of these two places in NYC.


      2. Blessed Sacrament Church is located in the Bronx, which is in the northern
      part of New York City.


      3. Pink Houses Building 3 is located in Brooklyn, which is in the southeastern
      part of NYC.


      4. To determine if Blessed Sacrament Church is east of Pink Houses Building
      3, I need to compare their geographical positions.


      5. The Bronx is located north and west of Brooklyn.


      6. This means that Blessed Sacrament Church is actually west and north of Pink
      Houses Building 3, not east.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'
    ed2814bd-c2a6-4333-bafa-aa587800b8cc: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Blessed Sacrament Church in the Bronx

      - This church is located in the Bronx borough, specifically in the Fordham area


      2. Next, I''ll locate Pink Houses Building 3 in Brooklyn

      - Pink Houses is a public housing complex located in the East New York neighborhood
      of Brooklyn


      3. Now I''ll determine their relative east-west positions

      - The Bronx is generally north and west of Brooklyn

      - Fordham (where the church is) is northwest of East New York (where Pink Houses
      is)


      4. So if the Bronx location is northwest of the Brooklyn location, it cannot
      be east of it
