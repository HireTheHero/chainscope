      1. **Identify the locations**: The first step is to identify the exact locations
      of both PS 146 Ann M Short in Manhattan and Cooper Park Houses Building 11 in
      Brooklyn. This can be done by looking up their addresses on a map or using a
      geographical information system (GIS).

      2. **Understand the geography**: New York City is divided into five boroughs:
      Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. Manhattan is located
      to the west of Brooklyn, with the East River separating the two boroughs.

      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Given that Manhattan is west of Brooklyn,
      any location in Manhattan would generally be west of any location in Brooklyn.

      4. **Apply the information**: Based on the relative positions of Manhattan and
      Brooklyn, PS 146 Ann M Short in Manhattan would not be located east of Cooper
      Park Houses Building 11 in Brooklyn.

    fe8e6148-479f-4699-9d31-0874e598c090: 'To determine if BFFY PETE MCGUINESS SENIOR
      CTR is located east of BROOKLYN COLLEGE CHILD CARE SERVICES, we need to follow
      these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: BFFY PETE MCGUINESS SENIOR CTR and BROOKLYN COLLEGE
      CHILD CARE SERVICES are both in Brooklyn, one of the five boroughs of New York
      City.

      2. **Understand geographic orientation**: Brooklyn is a large borough with a
      diverse geography. It''s essential to consider the relative positions of the
      two locations.

      3. **Determine east-west relationship**: To be "east" of something means it
      is located to the right if you are facing north. In the context of New York
      City, east-west orientation is often relative to Manhattan, the central borough.

      4. **Specific locations**: The exact addresses of the two locations are needed
      to determine their precise positions within Brooklyn. However, given the lack
      of specific addresses in the question, we can still make a reasonable inference
      based on general geographic knowledge of Brooklyn.

      5. **Compare locations**: Without exact addresses, we can''t determine the precise
      east-west relationship between the two locations. However, we can make a general
      assessment based on the typical layout of Brooklyn.

      6. **East-west comparison**: Considering the east-west axis, different parts
      of Brooklyn can be east or west of each other depending on their specific locations.
      Some neighborhoods in Brooklyn extend eastward beyond the western edge of other
      neighborhoods.


      Given these steps and understanding that Brooklyn is a large borough with varying
      east-west orientations, we can''t definitively say whether BFFY PETE MCGUINESS
      SENIOR CTR is east of BROOKLYN COLLEGE CHILD CARE SERVICES without knowing their
      exact addresses. However, based on general geographic knowledge of Brooklyn,
      it''s plausible that some parts of Brooklyn could be east of others, but without
      specific details, any answer would be speculative.


      **Conclusion**: After analyzing the geographic relationship and typical orientations,
      it''s reasonable to assume that without precise information about the locations,
      we can''t definitively answer whether BFFY PETE MCGUINESS SENIOR CTR is east
      of BROOKLYN COLLEGE CHILD CARE SERVICES.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      refers to the direction towards the Hudson River and New Jersey.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Beach Channel Park is located in the Rockaway
      Peninsula area of Queens, which is relatively closer to the Atlantic Ocean and
      is generally considered to be in the eastern part of the borough. Mall Eighteen,
      on the other hand, is likely to be located in a different area of Queens, and

      \ we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the locations**: Fordham University\
      \ Rose Hill Gymnasium is located in the Bronx, and St. Joan of Arc is located\
      \ in Queens.\n2. **Understand NYC geography**: The Bronx and Queens are two\
      \ of the five boroughs of New York City. The Bronx is located north of Manhattan\
      \ and is the northernmost borough. Queens is located east of Manhattan and is\
      \ the easternmost borough.\n3. **Determine east-west orientation**: The Bronx\
      \ and Queens have a complex geographic relationship. While the Bronx is generally\
      \ north of Queens, there are parts of the Bronx that extend eastward beyond\
      \ the western edge of Queens. Similarly, there are parts of Queens that extend\
      \ westward beyond the eastern edge of the Bronx. To determine whether Fordham\
      \ University Rose Hill Gymnasium is located east of St. Joan of Arc, we need\
      \ to consider their specific locations within their respective boroughs.\n4.\
      \ **Specific locations**: \n   - Fordham University Rose Hill Gymnasium is located\
      \ at 441 East Fordham Road, Bronx, NY 10458.\n   - St. Joan of Arc is located\
      \ at 82-00 35th Avenue, Jackson Heights, NY 11372.\n5. **Compare locations**:\
      \ \n   - The Rose Hill Gymnasium is located in the eastern part of the Bronx,\
      \ close to the Bronx-Queens border.\n   - St. Joan of Arc is located in the\
      \ western part of Queens, near the Queens-Brooklyn border.\n6. **East-west comparison**:\
      \ Considering the east-west axis, parts of the Bronx, including the eastern\
      \ parts, can be east of parts of Queens, especially considering the irregular\
      \ shapes of these boroughs. However, the specific question is whether Fordham\
      \ University Rose Hill Gymnasium (in the eastern part of the Bronx) is east\
      \ of St. Joan of Arc (in the western part of Queens).\n\nGiven these steps and\
      \ understanding that Fordham University Rose Hill Gymnasium is located in the\
      \ eastern part of the Bronx, while St. Joan of Arc is in the western part of\
      \ Queens, it's plausible that the gymnasium is east of St. Joan of Arc. However,\
      \ without precise longitude comparisons, it's difficult to provide a definitive\
      \ answer.\n\n**Conclusion**: After analyzing the geographical relationship and\
      \ typical orientations, it seems that Fordham University Rose Hill Gymnasium\
      \ is likely east of St. Joan of Arc, given the general layout of NYC. Thus,\
      \ the answer is based on understanding that the Bronx and Queens have complex\
      \ geometries, but generally, the gymnasium is not as far west as the western\
      \ parts of Queens might extend.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{YES}$\n\n"

      2. **Understand Manhattan Geography**: Manhattan is a long and narrow island
      with the Hudson River to the west and the East River to the east. It''s generally
      divided into three sections: Lower Manhattan (south), Midtown (central), and
      Upper Manhattan (north).

      3. **Determine East-West Orientation**: In Manhattan, east-west orientation

      while avenues run north-south.

      4. **Specific Locations**: Without specific addresses, we can''t pinpoint the

      some general assumptions based on their names.

      5. **Conclusion**: Given that both locations are in Manhattan and without precise

      1. **Identify the Locations**: Both MIKVAH MID MANHATTAN and ALTERNATE LEARNING
      CENTER THOMPKINS PARK are in Manhattan, one of the five boroughs of New York
      City.


      2. **Understand Manhattan''s Geography**: Manhattan is a long, narrow island,
      and its east-west orientation is primarily along the Hudson River to the west
      and the East River to the east.


      3. **Determine Relative Positions**: To determine if one location is east of
      another within Manhattan, we need to consider their relative positions on the
      island. Since Manhattan is relatively narrow, locations in the eastern part
      of the island would be considered east of locations in the western part.


      4. **Approximate Locations**: Without exact addresses or coordinates, we can
      make an educated guess based on the names. MIKVAH MID MANHATTAN suggests a central
      location, while ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER THOMPKINS PARK might be in the vicinity
      of Tompkins Square Park, which is in the East Village area of Manhattan.

      Manhattan is located east of Alternate Learning Center Thompkins Park in Manhattan,
      we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: Mikvah Mid Manhattan and Alternate Learning Center
      Thompkins Park are both located in Manhattan, one of the five boroughs of New
      York City.


      2. **Understand Manhattan Geography**: Manhattan is a relatively narrow island,
      and its orientation is primarily north-south. The East River is located to the
      east of Manhattan.


      3. **Determine East-West Relationship**: To be "east" of something, it must
      be located to the right if you are facing north. Given that both locations are
      in Manhattan and the island''s orientation is primarily north-south, it''s possible
      for locations in Manhattan to be east of each other.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Without specific addresses or coordinates, it''s challenging
      to determine the exact east-west relationship between these two locations in
      Manhattan. However, given the island''s orientation and the potential for locations
      to be east of each other within Manhattan, it''s possible that Mikvah Mid Manhattan
      could be east of Alternate Learning Center Thompkins Park.


      5. **Conclusion**: Without more specific information about the locations'' coordinates
      or addresses, it''s difficult to provide a definitive answer. However, based
      on the general layout of Manhattan and the potential for east-west relationships
      within the borough, it''s possible that Mikvah Mid Manhattan is east of Alternate

      1. **Identify the locations**: The question mentions two specific locations
      in Staten Island: FT WADSWORTH GUARD SHACK and FT WADSWORTH GARAGE.

      2. **Understand NYC geography**: Staten Island is one of the five boroughs of
      New York City. It is the southernmost borough and is located southwest of Manhattan.

      3. **Determine relative positions**: To determine if one location is east of
      another, we need to consider their positions on a map. In this case, both locations
      are in the same borough (Staten Island), so we need to understand their positions
      within the borough.

      4. **Specific locations**: The question doesn''t provide specific addresses
      for the two locations. However, we can assume that these locations are part
      of Fort Wadsworth, which is a historic military installation in Staten Island.
      Fort Wadsworth is located on the northeastern tip of Staten Island, overlooking
      the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and the Upper New York Bay.

      5. **East-west orientation**: Generally, locations in Staten Island that are
      closer to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and the northeastern tip of the island
      are considered to be more eastward. Locations that are farther away from this
      northeastern tip are considered to be more westward.

      6. **Conclusion**: Without specific addresses, it''s difficult to provide an
      exact answer. However, based on the general understanding of Staten Island''s
      geography and the location of Fort Wadsworth, it''s plausible that the FT WADSWORTH
      GUARD SHACK could be located east of the FT WADSWORTH GARAGE, as both are likely

      \ Since both locations are in Staten Island, we need to consider the orientation\

      1. **Identify the Locations**: Mott Haven Library and Cardinal Hayes High School
      Athletic Field are both located in the Bronx, which is one of the five boroughs
      of New York City.


      2. **Understand the Bronx''s Geography**: The Bronx is the northernmost borough
      of New York City. It is bordered by the Hudson River to the west, the East River
      to the south, and the Long Island Sound to the east.


      3. **Determine East-West Orientation**: To determine if one location is east
      of another, we need to consider their positions on a map. In the case of the
      Bronx, east is generally toward the east side of the borough, closer to the
      Long Island Sound.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Now, we can compare the positions of Mott Haven Library
      and Cardinal Hayes High School Athletic Field on a map of the Bronx. If Mott
      Haven Library is located to the east of Cardinal Hayes High School Athletic
      Field, then the answer to the question would be "YES."


      However, without specific addresses or the ability to look up these locations
      on a map, it''s difficult to provide a definitive answer. The Bronx is a large
      borough, and the relative positions of these two locations could vary depending
      on their exact addresses.


      In general, if Mott Haven Library is located east of Cardinal Hayes High School

      2. **Understand geographic orientation**: The Bronx is generally located north
      of Manhattan and is the northernmost of the five boroughs. Manhattan is located
      south of the Bronx.


      3. **Determine east-west relationship**: To be "east" of something means that
      it is located to the right if you are facing north. Given that the Bronx is
      north of Manhattan and that the Mott Haven Library and Cardinal Hayes High School
      Athletic Field are both in the Bronx, we need to consider their positions relative
      to each other.


      4. **Specific locations**: Without specific addresses or coordinates, it''s
      challenging to determine the exact positions of these locations. However, we
      can use a map or a geographic information system (GIS) to estimate their relative
      positions.


      5. **Estimate east-west relationship**: Based on the typical layout of the Bronx,

      6 is located at 1 West Street, which is on the western side of Manhattan.


      6. **Conclusion**: Since Building 7 is on the eastern side of Manhattan and

      \ 7 in Manhattan is located east of Smith Houses Building 6 in Manhattan, we\
      \ need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need\
      \ to identify the exact addresses of both buildings. This can be done by searching\
      \ for the addresses on the internet or using a map service.\n\n2. **Determine\
      \ the geographic orientation**: Once we have the addresses, we can use a map\
      \ or a geographic information system (GIS) to determine the relative positions\
      \ of the two buildings in terms of east-west orientation.\n\nGiven the lack\
      \ of specific addresses provided in the question, let's consider a hypothetical\
      \ approach based on typical research steps:\n\n- **Smith Houses Building 7**\
      \ is located in Manhattan. Without a specific address, we can't directly pinpoint\
      \ its location, but we know it's within the borough.\n  \n- **Smith Houses Building\
      \ 6** is also in Manhattan. Again, without an exact address, we can't determine\
      \ its precise location relative to the other building.\n\nHowever, to give a\
      \ definitive YES or NO answer, we would ideally look up the exact addresses\
      \ of both buildings and compare their locations on a map. Since I don't have\
      \ real-time access to current data or the ability to browse the internet for\
      \ the most up-to-date addresses and maps, I'll guide you through a logical deduction\
      \ based on the information typically available:\n\n- If Smith Houses Building\
      \ 7 is located at a higher longitude (eastern longitude) than Smith Houses Building\
      \ 6, the answer would be YES.\n- If Smith Houses Building 7 is located at a\
      \ lower longitude (western longitude) than Smith Houses Building 6, or at the\
      \ same longitude, the answer would be NO.\n\nWithout the specific addresses\
      \ or the ability to look them up, I must rely on the premise of the question\

    bb1a53c2-82ab-4c9b-9913-1a7dd1898015: 'To answer this question, we need to follow
      these steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: SMITH HOUSES BUILDING 7 and SMITH HOUSES BUILDING
      6 are both located in Manhattan, one of the five boroughs of New York City.


      2. **Understand Geographic Relationships**: Manhattan is generally oriented
      north-south, with the Hudson River to the west and the East River to the east.
      Since both locations are in Manhattan, we need to determine their positions
      relative to each other within the borough.


      3. **Determine East-West Orientation**: To determine if SMITH HOUSES BUILDING
      7 is east of SMITH HOUSES BUILDING 6, we need to know their exact locations
      within Manhattan. However, without specific addresses or coordinates, we can''t
      definitively determine their east-west relationship.


      4. **Consider General Manhattan Orientation**: Manhattan''s general orientation
      is north-south, but there are variations in the east-west axis. Some parts of
      Manhattan extend eastward, while others are more centrally located.


      5. **Apply to the Question**: Since we don''t have specific locations for the
      buildings, we can''t definitively say whether SMITH HOUSES BUILDING 7 is east
      of SMITH HOUSES BUILDING 6. It''s possible that they are relatively close to
      each other within Manhattan, making it challenging to determine their exact
      east-west relationship.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given the limited information provided, it''s not possible
      to definitively answer whether SMITH HOUSES BUILDING 7 is east of SMITH HOUSES
      BUILDING 6. Without specific locations or addresses, the east-west relationship
      between the two buildings is uncertain.


      The final answer is: **It''s uncertain without specific location information.**

      in Staten Island is located east of PS 16 John J Driscoll in Staten Island,
      we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Castle Day Care Canal St is located in Staten
      Island. PS 16 John J Driscoll is also located in Staten Island.


      2. **Understand Staten Island geography**: Staten Island is the southernmost
      of the five boroughs of New York City. It is a relatively small island with
      a north-south orientation.


      3. **Determine east-west orientation**: Since both locations are in Staten Island,
      we need to consider their positions relative to each other within the island.
      To determine east-west orientation, we need to know the specific addresses or
      coordinates of both locations.


      4. **Compare locations**: Without specific addresses or coordinates, we can''t
      determine the exact east-west relationship between Castle Day Care Canal St
      and PS 16 John J Driscoll. However, we can make an educated guess based on typical
      street patterns and the general layout of Staten Island.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided, we can''t definitively
      say whether Castle Day Care Canal St is east of PS 16 John J Driscoll. However,
      we can make an educated guess based on the general layout of Staten Island.
      If the two locations are on the same street or nearby, it''s possible that Castle
      Day Care Canal St is east of PS 16 John J Driscoll. If they are on different
      streets or in different neighborhoods, it''s less likely that Castle Day Care
      Canal St is east of PS 16 John J Driscoll.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations
      of both the park and the complex. In this case, both are located in Staten Island,
      which is one of the five boroughs of New York City.

      2. **Understand NYC Geography**: Staten Island is the southernmost borough of
      New York City. It''s connected to the rest of the city by the Verrazzano-Narrows
      Bridge.

      3. **Determine East-West Orientation**: To determine if one location is east
      of another, we need to understand the east-west orientation of Staten Island.
      Generally, the eastern part of Staten Island faces the Atlantic Ocean, while
      the western part faces the rest of New York City.

      4. **Specific Locations**: OLMSTED-BEIL HOUSE PARK and OLMSTED-BEIL COMPLEX
      are both located in the same area of Staten Island. However, their exact locations
      within this area could determine whether one is east of the other.

      PS 81 ROBERT J CHRISTEN and LOW HOUSES BUILDING 1 matter.

      4. **Consider Specific Locations**: The Bronx and Brooklyn are large boroughs,
      and the exact locations of PS 81 ROBERT J CHRISTEN and LOW HOUSES BUILDING 1
      are crucial to determining their east-west relationship.

      5. **Conclusion**: Given that the Bronx is generally north of Brooklyn and the
      specific locations of the two places matter, it''s not possible to definitively
      answer whether PS 81 ROBERT J CHRISTEN is east of LOW HOUSES BUILDING 1 without
      knowing the exact addresses or coordinates of both locations. Without this information,
      the answer cannot be determined.


      In summary, the answer to the question of whether PS 81 ROBERT J CHRISTEN in
      the Bronx is located east of LOW HOUSES BUILDING 1 in Brooklyn cannot be definitively
      answered without more precise location information.

      \ specific addresses provided in the question, let's consider a hypothetical\

      \ DEVELOPMENT** is located in the Bronx. Without a specific address, we can't\

      \ or locations, and without the ability to verify the current locations of these\
      \ places, I must default to a logical deduction that cannot be accurately made\
      \ without more information.\n\nTherefore, based on the requirement for a YES\
      \ or NO answer and acknowledging the lack of specific information to make an\
      \ accurate determination, the most appropriate response would be to recognize\
      \ that an accurate answer cannot be provided with the given information. However,\

      in Brooklyn is located east of New York City Children''s Center in Brooklyn,
      follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Find the addresses of both PS 75 Mayda Cortiella
      and New York City Children''s Center in Brooklyn. This will give you specific
      locations to work with.


      2. **Use a map or GPS**: Use a map or GPS software to locate the two schools
      on a map. This will help you visualize their relative positions.


      3. **Determine east-west orientation**: Once you have located both schools on
      the map, determine their east-west orientation. This can be done by using the
      map''s compass or by looking at the orientation of the streets in the area.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Compare the locations of the two schools. If PS
      75 Mayda Cortiella is located further east on the map than New York City Children''s
      Center, then the answer is YES. If it''s located further west or at the same
      longitude, the answer is NO.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the comparison of the locations, you can conclude
      whether PS 75 Mayda Cortiella is located east of New York City Children''s Center.

      2. **Understand NYC Geography**: Queens and the Bronx are two of the five boroughs
      of New York City. Queens is located to the east of the Bronx, with the East
      River separating them.


      3. **Relative Positions**: To determine whether one location is east of another,
      we need to consider their positions relative to each other. Given that Queens
      is east of the Bronx, any location in Queens is generally east of any location
      in the Bronx.


      4. **Determine East/West Relationship**: To be "east" of something means that
      it is located to the right if you are facing north. Since Queens is east of
      the Bronx, a location in Queens would generally be east of a location in the
      Bronx.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general east-west orientation of Queens and
      the Bronx, we can conclude that Our Lady of Mercy School in Queens is likely
      located east of Gospel of St Luke Church in the Bronx.

      provide a general answer based on the borough.

      6. **Conclusion**: Given that both locations are in Brooklyn and without specific
      addresses, it''s difficult to determine with certainty whether Passages Academy
      Belmont is located east of Linden Houses Building 2. However, based on the general
      layout of Brooklyn, it''s likely that Passages Academy Belmont is not located
      east of Linden Houses Building 2.

      2. **Understand geographic orientation**: We need to understand the general
      layout of Queens and its orientation.


      Given that both locations are in Queens, we can use this information to make
      a reasonable assumption about their relative positions. Here''s a logical deduction
      based on the typical layout of Queens:


      - Queens is a large borough with various neighborhoods and landmarks. It''s
      generally rectangular in shape and extends from west to east.

      - Assuming that Pumpkin Patch Marsh is located in the eastern part of Queens
      and Cedar Grove Cemetery is located in the western part of Queens, we can make
      an educated guess about their relative positions.

      eastern boundary borders Westchester County.


      3. **Determine the east-west relationship**: To determine whether one location
      is east of another, we need to consider their relative positions on the east-west
      axis.


      4. **Analyze the specific locations**: ST MARY''S CONCORD AVE OV CSX RAIL is
      likely located near the intersection of Concord Avenue and CSX Rail in the Bronx.
      ST MARY''S PARK HOUSES BLDG 2 is likely located within the St. Mary''s Park

    5140eaa5-5f29-4857-a936-fd7ae58b7c71: 'To determine whether BAIS ESTHER SCHOOL
      50 ST in Brooklyn is located east of HOLY CROSS CHURCH in Manhattan, we need
      to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to find the exact addresses of both BAIS
      ESTHER SCHOOL 50 ST and HOLY CROSS CHURCH. This will give us their precise locations.


      2. **Understand NYC geography**: Manhattan and Brooklyn are two of the five
      boroughs of New York City. Manhattan is located west of Brooklyn, with the East
      River separating them.


      3. **Relative positions**: Given that Brooklyn is generally east of Manhattan,
      we need to determine whether BAIS ESTHER SCHOOL 50 ST is east of HOLY CROSS
      CHURCH in Manhattan.


      4. **Map comparison**: Using a map or a geographic information system (GIS),
      we can plot the locations of both schools and determine their relative positions.
      Specifically, we need to check whether the longitude (east-west coordinate)
      of BAIS ESTHER SCHOOL 50 ST is greater than the longitude of HOLY CROSS CHURCH.


      5. **Conclusion**: If the longitude of BAIS ESTHER SCHOOL 50 ST is greater than
      the longitude of HOLY CROSS CHURCH, then BAIS ESTHER SCHOOL 50 ST is located
      east of HOLY CROSS CHURCH. If the longitude is not greater, then it is not located
      east of the church.


      Given the lack of specific addresses provided in the question, I can''t perform
      the actual mapping and comparison. However, the process outlined above provides
      a general approach to answering this type of question. Without the exact addresses,
      I can''t provide a definitive YES or NO answer, but the steps I''ve described
      would be necessary to make an accurate determination.

      in different boroughs of New York City.

      2. **Understand NYC geography**: New York City is divided into five boroughs:
      Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island. Manhattan is located
      west of Queens.

      3. **Determine east-west relationship**: To be "east" of something, it must
      be located to the right of that thing when facing north. Since Manhattan is
      west of Queens, any location in Manhattan would be west of any location in Queens.

      4. **Apply to the question**: Given that HARLEM LIBRARY is in Manhattan and
      RAFFERTY TRIANGLE is in Queens, the library is west of the triangle.

      \  - **Anshe Chesed Synagogue** is located in Manhattan, New York City.\n  \
      \ - **TRNVS 1WB OV PD PTH OPP 66** is also located in Manhattan, but its exact\
      \ location is not specified. We can assume it's a road or path in Manhattan.\n\

      \ of New York City.\n   - The borough is divided into different neighborhoods\
      \ and areas.\n\n3. **Determine East-West Relationship**:\n   - To determine\
      \ if one location is east of another, we need to understand their relative positions.\n\
      \   - Since both locations are in Manhattan, we can compare their positions\
      \ within the borough.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Without more specific information\

      \ is one of the five boroughs of New York City, and it's located in the western\
      \ part of Long Island.\n\n3. **Determine Relative Positions**:\n   - To determine\
      \ if one location is east of another, we need to consider their positions on\
      \ a map.\n   - Brooklyn is relatively long and narrow, so the east-west orientation\
      \ can be tricky.\n   - However, in general, locations in Brooklyn are considered\
      \ \"east\" or \"west\" based on their position relative to the center of the\
      \ borough.\n\n4. **Assumption and Conclusion**:\n   - Without specific addresses\
      \ or coordinates for both locations, it's challenging to determine their exact\
      \ relative positions.\n   - However, based on the assumption that Kingsboro\
      \ CC is in the eastern part of Brooklyn and Macon Library is in the central\
      \ or western part, it's likely that Kingsboro CC is east of Macon Library.\n\
      \nGiven the available information and assumptions, the answer is: $\\boxed{YES}$\n\

      3. **Determine East-West Relationship**: To be "east" of something means that
      it is located to the right if you are facing north. Since both locations are
      in Brooklyn, we need to consider their positions relative to each other within
      the borough.


      4. **Find Specific Addresses**: To accurately determine the east-west relationship,
      we need to know the specific addresses of both locations. For this, we can use
      a mapping tool or search for the addresses online.


      5. **Compare Locations**: Once we have the specific addresses, we can compare
