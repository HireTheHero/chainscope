      1) First, I need to understand the general geography:

      - Hunters Point South Park is located on the East River waterfront in Long Island
      City, Queens

      - Long Island City is directly across the East River from Midtown Manhattan


      2) Red Balloon Learning Center is in Manhattan, but I need to consider if it''s
      east or west of Hunters Point South Park


      3) Key geographic fact:

      - Queens is always east of Manhattan (because Manhattan is an island with Queens
      to its east)


      4) Therefore:

      - Any location in Manhattan must be west of any location in Queens, because
      Manhattan is west of Queens


      5) Conclusion:

      Since Red Balloon Learning Center is in Manhattan, and Hunters Point South Park
      is in Queens, the learning center must be WEST of the park, not east.

      - UPACA Senior Center is at 1844 Lexington Avenue

      - Bushman Steps are at St. Nicholas Avenue between W 157th St and W 158th St


      3) Looking at Manhattan''s layout:

      - Lexington Avenue runs north-south on the east side of Manhattan

      - St. Nicholas Avenue runs north-south on the west side of Manhattan


      4) Therefore:

      - Since Lexington Avenue is on the east side and St. Nicholas Avenue is on the

      - UPACA Senior Center is located in East Harlem

      2. Next, I need to locate Bushman Steps

      - Bushman Steps is located in Washington Heights

      3. Now I can compare their locations

      - East Harlem (where UPACA is) is in the eastern part of Manhattan

      - Washington Heights (where Bushman Steps is) is in the western part of Manhattan

      2) Let''s recall the basic geography of NYC boroughs:

      - The Bronx is the northernmost borough

      - Brooklyn is in the southern part of NYC

      - The Bronx is generally north and east of Manhattan

      - Brooklyn is south and east of Manhattan


      3) Therefore:

      - The Bronx is significantly NORTH of Brooklyn

      - The east/west positioning isn''t relevant here because the north/south difference
      is so significant

      - Any point in the Bronx will be north of any point in Brooklyn


      4) Since we''re asked about east/west positioning, but one location is so far
      north of the other, it''s like asking if Toronto is east of New York - the north/south
      difference makes the east/west comparison not meaningful in this context.


      NO (because the locations are so far apart on a north/south axis that an east/west

      3. Comparing their positions:

      - Since Mikvah is on the west side (West 42nd St)

      - And Thompkins Park is on the east side

      - Mikvah Mid Manhattan is actually WEST of Alternate Learning Center Thompkins
      Park


      Therefore, NO - Mikvah Mid Manhattan is not east of Alternate Learning Center
      Thompkins Park.

      - Alternate Learning Center Thompkins Park is located at 600 East 6th Street

      3) In Manhattan''s grid system:

      - Avenues are numbered west to east (1st Ave is east of 3rd Ave)

      - Avenue B and C are east of 1st Avenue

      - Therefore, Thompkins Park location (at Ave B/C) is further east than Mikvah
      (at Lexington)


      Therefore: NO, Mikvah Mid Manhattan is NOT located east of Alternate Learning
      Center Thompkins Park. It''s actually located WEST of it.

      - August Martin High School is at 156-10 Baisley Boulevard

      - Detective Keith L Williams Field House is at 173rd Street and 106th Avenue


      3. Looking at their relative positions:

      - August Martin HS is closer to JFK Airport, in the southeastern part of Jamaica

      - Detective Williams Field House is more in central Jamaica


      4. Comparing their positions:

      - August Martin HS is positioned to the southeast

      - Detective Williams Field House is positioned more northwest
