      \ E 77th St, New York, NY 10075.\n   - **ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER THOMPKINS\
      \ PARK**: This is an educational facility, which is located at 250 E 12th St,\
      \ New York, NY 10003.\n\n2. **Determine the east-west positions:**\n   - The\
      \ street numbers (77th Street and 12th Street) suggest that MIKVAH MID MANHATTAN\
      \ is further north compared to ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER THOMPKINS PARK.\n \
      \  - For east-west positioning, we look at the avenues: 419 E 77th St is between\

      in the Lower East Side of Manhattan.


      1. **Identify the location of the Smith Houses**: The Alfred E. Smith Houses
      are situated in an area bounded by St. James Place to the west, Madison Street
      to the north, Catherine Street to the east, and South Street to the south.


      2. **Determine the specific locations of Buildings 6 and 7**: Within the Smith
      Houses complex, buildings are typically organized in a specific manner. However,
      without a detailed map or layout of the buildings, we must refer to available
      resources or maps (such as Google Maps or the NYC Housing Authority website)
      to ascertain the relative positions of Buildings 6 and 7.


      3. **Check available resources**: By examining a map of the Smith Houses, we
      can pinpoint the locations of Buildings 6 and 7. Typically, such a map will
      show the buildings with their respective numbers, allowing us to determine their
      relative positions.


      4. **Analyze the relative positions**: If Building 7 is located to the right
      (east) of Building 6 on the map, then it is indeed east of Building 6.


      Based on the typical layout of such housing developments and without access
      to a specific map or layout document here, it is common to cross-reference with
      available maps or resources to confirm.


      Assuming the buildings are arranged in a straightforward numerical order from
      west to east, as is often the case in housing developments, Building 7 would
      be east of Building 6.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'

      1. **Identify the Location:** The Alfred E. Smith Houses are located near the
      intersection of South Street and Catherine Slip, bordered by Madison Street
      to the north and St. James Place to the west.


      2. **Building Layout:** The buildings within the Smith Houses are numbered,
      and their layout can typically be found on a map of the development.


      3. **Direction Assessment:** To determine the relative positions of Building
      7 and Building 6, a map indicating the specific locations and numbers of each
      building is essential.


      Upon reviewing an accurate map of the Smith Houses development, if Building
      7 is positioned to the right (east) of Building 6 when facing north, then it
      is indeed east.


      **Conclusion:** Based on the typical layout of housing complexes where buildings
      are numbered sequentially, and assuming the numbering follows a logical order
      without skipping or a non-linear arrangement, the orientation must be checked
      on an official or detailed map. Based on these observations and standard mapping:

      1. **Location of Rockefeller University IT Pavilion**: Rockefeller University
      is located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, alongside the East River. Its

      Forensic Psychiatric Center in Manhattan is located east of Hotel Utica in Brooklyn,
      we need to consider the geographic positions of both locations.


      1. **Locate the NYS OMH Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center**: This facility is
      located on Wards Island in Manhattan. Wards Island is in the East River, situated
      north-northeast of the main part of Manhattan.


      2. **Locate Hotel Utica**: Assuming "Hotel Utica" refers to a specific location
      in Brooklyn, we need to find where it is situated. For this analysis, let''s
      assume Hotel Utica is positioned somewhere in Brooklyn.


      3. **Compare the relative positions**: Brooklyn is generally to the south and
      slightly east of Manhattan. However, the exact position within Brooklyn can
      vary. Wards Island, where the Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center is located,
      is to the northeast of most parts of Brooklyn.


      Given the typical layout of New York City, Wards Island is generally to the
      north and somewhat east of Manhattan, and since Brooklyn is largely to the south
      of Manhattan, most locations in Brooklyn would be west of Wards Island.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      **YES**, the NYS OMH Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center in Manhattan is located
      east of Hotel Utica in Brooklyn.'
