    e9c95dde-4fd8-4bbd-b64e-d61a586db9a9: '1. **Find the locations:** We need to determine
      the locations of UPACA SENIOR CENTER and BUSHMAN STEPS in Manhattan.

      2. **Determine East/West:** Once we have the locations, we can compare their
      longitudinal coordinates.  The location further east will have a higher longitudinal
      value.

      3. **Compare and Answer:**  If UPACA SENIOR CENTER has a higher longitudinal
      value than BUSHMAN STEPS, the answer is YES. Otherwise, the answer is NO.



      Using a map or online search:


      UPACA SENIOR CENTER appears to be located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.


      BUSHMAN STEPS is located in Inwood, in Upper Manhattan.


      Inwood is further north than the Upper East Side, but importantly, also significantly
      further *west*.



      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

    a9ad825f-26e7-456b-af62-573b913d1175: '1. **Locate The Andrews Homeless Shelter:**  A

      East Side.  While some parts of Harlem might extend slightly east of *some*
      parts of the Upper East Side,  the general location of Harlem is north, not
      east, of the Upper East Side.  Therefore, the main Andrews Homeless Shelter

      * **Facing History School:** 525 West 120th Street, New York, NY 10027


      Since 17th Street is significantly south of 120th Street, and streets are numerically
      increasing as you go north, the east/west comparison becomes important.  West
      120th street is further west than East 17th street. This means East 17th is
      EAST of West 120th.

      the precise locations of BRILLA CHARTER SCHOOL PAX and MARBLE HILL HOUSES BUILDING
      5 in the Bronx.

      2. **Determine east/west relationship:** Once I have the locations, I need to
      determine if BRILLA is to the east of MARBLE HILL HOUSES BUILDING 5. This means
      BRILLA would need to have a higher longitude coordinate.


      Using a mapping tool, I find the following approximate locations:


      * **BRILLA CHARTER SCHOOL PAX:**  Near the intersection of Jerome Ave and E
      172nd St.

      * **MARBLE HILL HOUSES BUILDING 5:** Located within the Marble Hill Houses complex,
      west of Exterior Street.


      Marble Hill is a geographically peculiar neighborhood. While politically part
      of the Bronx, it is physically located on the mainland and connected to Manhattan.  Crucially,
      it''s west of the Bronx''s main landmass.


      Therefore, BRILLA, being in the main part of the Bronx, is east of Marble Hill
      Houses.

      3. **Compare Longitude:** I''ll compare the longitude of St. Margaret''s Church
      to the longitude of the Academy.  If St. Margaret''s has a higher longitude,
      it is east of the Academy.


      4. **Answer:**  Based on Google Maps, St. Margaret''s Episcopal Church (2190  Riverdale
      Ave, Bronx, NY 10462) is located at approximately -73.9049, while the Academy
      for Personal Leadership and Excellence (333 E 138th St, Bronx, NY 10454) is
      located at approximately -73.9189. Since -73.9049 is *greater than* -73.9189,
      St. Margaret''s is east of the Academy.

      North-South, while East 140th Street runs East-West.  A higher street number
      in the Bronx generally indicates further East. Since 321 East 140th Street is
      much further east than Grand Concourse, the library is east of the athletic
      field.

      Horace Mann School Spence Cottage is located at approximately 40.8512, -73.9281.


      Since -73.9026 is a *smaller* negative number (i.e. further east) than -73.9281,
      the playground is east of the school cottage.

      Cottage in the Bronx.

      2. **Determine east/west relationship:** Once I have the locations, I need to
      figure out if Clinton Playground is east of Spence Cottage.


      Using a map (e.g., Google Maps):


      Crotona Park - Clinton Playground is located at roughly 173rd Street and Clinton
      Avenue.

      Horace Mann School Spence Cottage is located at roughly 231st Street and Tibbett
      Avenue.


      Tibbett Avenue is considerably west of Clinton Avenue. Lower numbered streets
      in the Bronx are further west. Therefore, Clinton Playground is east of Spence
      Cottage.

      need to determine the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) or addresses
      of Holy Trinity Catholic Academy and District 25 Pre-K Center in Queens, NY.


      2. **Compare the longitudes.**  Longitude determines east/west position. A location
      further east will have a higher longitude value.


      3. **Determine if Holy Trinity has a higher longitude.** If Holy Trinity''s
      longitude is greater than District 25 Pre-K Center''s longitude, then Holy Trinity
      is east of the Pre-K center.


      (Using a map or online search to find the locations)


      Holy Trinity Catholic Academy is at approximately -73.80625895742951, 40.72406196930272


      District 25 Pre-K Center is at approximately -73.8442701, 40.7413715


      Since -73.80625895742951 is *greater* than -73.8442701, Holy Trinity is east
      of District 25 Pre-K Center.

      3. **Compare and Answer:**  If Holy Trinity Catholic Academy has a higher longitudinal
      value than District 25 Pre-K Center, the answer is YES. Otherwise, the answer
      is NO.


      Using online search engines, I find:


      * Holy Trinity Catholic Academy is generally located in Whitestone, Queens.

      * District 25 Pre-K Center appears to refer to multiple locations within school
      district 25, which covers parts of central Queens including Flushing and Elmhurst.  It''s
      unclear which specific pre-K center is meant. However, the district offices
      are generally in this central region.


      Whitestone (Holy Trinity) is significantly east of the central Queens area encompassing
      District 25.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

      Using a search engine:


      Holy Trinity Catholic Academy is located at 20-45 23rd St, Astoria, NY 11105.

      District 25 Pre-K Center''s address isn''t readily available, but District 25
      itself is centered around Flushing, further east than Astoria.  This makes it
      likely that the Pre-K Center is also further east.  To be certain, I''ll look
      for a more specific address for a Pre-K center within District 25.


      After more searching, there is no specific "District 25 Pre-K Center" with a
      single address. District 25 encompasses many pre-K programs. However, since
      Astoria (Holy Trinity) is generally west of Flushing (District 25''s general
      area), it''s highly probable that any Pre-K center within District 25 will be
      east of Holy Trinity.


      NO.  *(Assuming there is no Pre-K program in District 25 located significantly
      west of Astoria, which is highly improbable)*

    a18dbfd0-a5f3-4642-8247-8baf908fcd3d: '1. **Identify the boroughs:** Rainbow School
      for Child Development is in the Bronx, and the gas station is in Queens.


      2. **General location of boroughs:** The Bronx is generally north and east of
      Queens.  However, Queens extends further east than most people realize. LGA
      (LaGuardia Airport) is in northern Queens, fairly close to the Bronx border.  A
      westbound Grand Central Parkway gas station near LGA would be very close to
      the Bronx.


      3. **East vs. West:**  "WB" indicates westbound.  This means the gas station
      is on the westbound side of the Grand Central Parkway, meaning traffic at the
      station is heading west.  This reinforces that the gas station is very close
      to the Bronx border, potentially very close to the western edge of Queens.


      4. **Final determination:** While the Bronx is *generally* east of Queens, the
      specific location of the gas station being near LGA and on the *westbound* side
      of the Grand Central Parkway strongly suggests it is just west of the Bronx
      border.

      for Child Development is in the Bronx, and the gas station is in Queens.


      2. **General locations of boroughs:** The Bronx is generally north of Queens,
      and slightly east.


      3. **Specific location nuance:**  While most of the Bronx is east of Queens,  "Grand
      Central Parkway WB near LGA" suggests a location very close to the western edge
      of Queens, near LaGuardia Airport.  Parts of the Bronx, particularly the southern
      portion, could be *west* of this specific point in Queens.


      4. **Need for more precise locations:** Without specific addresses or coordinates,
      it''s difficult to be absolutely certain. However, given the proximity of the
      gas station to the western edge of Queens and the airport, it''s highly probable
      the school in the Bronx is east of it.


      **Answer:** YES

      2. **Locate 14 Street/Canarsie Tube:** This refers to the L train subway line,
      which has a station at 14th Street in Manhattan.


      3. **East/West Relationship:** 65th Street is further east than 14th Street

      2. **Find the location of the 14 Street/Canarsie L train station in Manhattan:**
      There are multiple L train stations along 14th Street.  For clarity, let''s
      assume the question refers to the one at 8th Avenue and 14th Street (a major
      transfer point).


      3. **Determine the directional relationship:**  65th Street is further north
      than 14th Street.  East and West become relevant when comparing locations on
      the same street or close by. Since the consulate is much further north, its
      east/west position relative to the 14th Street L train station isn''t directly
      relevant.  However, if we project 14th street eastward, the consulate would
      indeed be east of that line.

      3. **Determine the directional relationship:**  65th Street is further north
      than 14th Street.  East and West are irrelevant in this comparison since the
      question is about East/West relative to a North/South dividing line.  Since
      the consulate is further north, the real question is whether it is east of 8th
      Avenue.

      3. **Consider specific locations within the boroughs:** Even though Brooklyn
      is generally east of Manhattan, the specific locations within the boroughs matter.  A
      location in far eastern Brooklyn would be east of a location in western Manhattan.
      However, northwestern Brooklyn could be *west* of a location in far eastern
      Manhattan.  We need more specific location information.


      4. **Assume normal map orientation:**  Without precise coordinates, we assume
      a standard map orientation where north is up, south is down, east is right,
      and west is left.


      5. **Brooklyn is generally east of Manhattan:** Given the general locations
      of the boroughs, and in the absence of specific addresses making the question
      tricky, the church in Brooklyn is likely east of the viaduct in Manhattan.

      are specified as being in Manhattan, simplifying the comparison.


      2. **Find general locations:** Seward Park is on the Lower East Side, while
      the New Delancey Hotel is near Delancey Street, also on the Lower East Side.
      This suggests they are likely close together.


      3. **More precise locations:** Seward Park is at the eastern edge of the Lower
      East Side, practically on the East River. Delancey Street runs roughly east-west,
      and buildings along it will be further west than Seward Park, which is at the
      easternmost edge of the island.


      4. **Conclusion:**  Seward Park is further east.

      Avenue and Eighth Avenue, spanning from 59th Street to 110th Street.  West End
      Avenue is further west than Central Park.  Therefore, Ansche Chesed Synagogue
      is west of Central Park.

      *LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE is at 217 West 166th Street*

      *PIER 107 CVII is at West 25th Street*


      West 166th Street is further east than West 25th Street (higher street numbers
      go further east in Manhattan).

      Using online search engines (Google Maps, etc.):


      LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE appears not to exist in Manhattan. There *is* a Lincolnton
      Post Office in Lincolnton, North Carolina.  There are numerous post offices
      *in* Manhattan, but none specifically named "Lincolnton Post Office."


      PIER 107 CVII does appear to correlate to Pier 107 at West 27th street. CVI
      is 106 in Roman numerals, CVII is 107.


      Since the first location likely doesn''t exist in Manhattan, it cannot be east
      of *anything* in Manhattan.

      Post Offices in other states, but not in Manhattan.  There *is* a Lincoln Center

      (Researching locations...)


      LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE appears to be a fictional place. There''s no such post
      office in Manhattan.  Therefore, I cannot determine its location relative to
      PIER 107, which also doesn''t seem to exist using that exact name. Pier 107
      does exist near the intersection of West 15th Street and 10th Avenue. It is
      possible CVII is meant to be roman numerals 107. Since one location is fictional,
      a proper comparison cannot be made.


      **NO** (due to the fictional nature of "LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE")
