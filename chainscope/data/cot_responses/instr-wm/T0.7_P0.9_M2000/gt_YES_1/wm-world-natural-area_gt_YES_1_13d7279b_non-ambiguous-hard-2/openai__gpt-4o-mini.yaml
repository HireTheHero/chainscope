      both bodies of water.


      1. **Gulf of Oman**: The Gulf of Oman is a significant body of water located
      in the Arabian Sea, bordered by Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Iran. Its
      area is approximately 68,000 square kilometers (about 26,300 square miles).


      2. **Lake Caliraya**: Lake Caliraya is an artificial lake located in the Philippines.
      Its area is approximately 4,000 hectares, which is about 40 square kilometers

      Now, we can compare the two areas:


      - Gulf of Oman: ~68,000 square kilometers

      - Lake Caliraya: ~40 square kilometers


      Since 68,000 square kilometers is much larger than 40 square kilometers, we
