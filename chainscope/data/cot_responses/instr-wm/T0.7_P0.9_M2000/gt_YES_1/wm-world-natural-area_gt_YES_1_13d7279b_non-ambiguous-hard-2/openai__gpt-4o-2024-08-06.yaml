      the sizes of the Gulf of Oman and Lake Caliraya.


      1. **Gulf of Oman:** The Gulf of Oman is a large body of water that connects
      the Arabian Sea with the Strait of Hormuz, which leads into the Persian Gulf.
      It is a significant gulf in terms of geographical size, spanning hundreds of
      kilometers in length and breadth.


      2. **Lake Caliraya:** Lake Caliraya is a man-made lake located in the province
      of Laguna in the Philippines. It is much smaller in comparison to natural lakes
      and is primarily used for recreational purposes.


      By comparing the two, it is clear that the Gulf of Oman is significantly larger
      than Lake Caliraya, as the Gulf of Oman is a major gulf with a vast area, while
      Lake Caliraya is a relatively small man-made lake.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**, the Gulf of Oman has a larger area than Lake
      Caliraya.'

      feature in the region and covers a substantial area.


      2. **Lake Caliraya**: Lake Caliraya is a man-made lake located in the Philippines.
