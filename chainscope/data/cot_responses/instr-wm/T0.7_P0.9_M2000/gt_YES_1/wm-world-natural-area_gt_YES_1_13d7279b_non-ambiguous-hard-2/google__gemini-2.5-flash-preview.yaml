      a larger area than Lake Caliraya. To answer this, we need to compare the approximate
      areas of both bodies of water.


      Step 1: Find the approximate area of the Gulf of Oman. The Gulf of Oman is a
      large body of water, a strait connecting the Arabian Sea to the Strait of Hormuz.
      Its area is vast. A quick search reveals its area is approximately 181,000 square
      kilometers.


      Step 2: Find the approximate area of Lake Caliraya. Lake Caliraya is a man-made
      lake in the Philippines. A quick search reveals its area is approximately 12.6
      square kilometers.


      Step 3: Compare the two areas. The area of the Gulf of Oman (181,000 sq km)
      is vastly larger than the area of Lake Caliraya (12.6 sq km).


      Step 4: Determine the answer based on the comparison. Since 181,000 is much
