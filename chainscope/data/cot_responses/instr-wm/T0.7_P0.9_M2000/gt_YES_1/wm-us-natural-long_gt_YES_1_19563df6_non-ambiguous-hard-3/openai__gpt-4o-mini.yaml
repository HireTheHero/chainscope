      and Lake Winnebago is in the central part of Wisconsin.


      Since Vermont is generally east of Wisconsin, and Lake Elmore is located in
      Vermont, it follows that Lake Elmore is indeed east of Lake Winnebago.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is **YES**.'

      2. **Locate Ouachita Mountains, AR**: The Ouachita Mountains are located in
      the central part of Arkansas, extending into parts of Oklahoma.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: To determine if the Ouachita Mountains

      east of Stanley Lake.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is: **YES**.'

      is located east of Stanley Lake, ID, we can follow these steps:


      1. **Locate Lake Minnetonka, MN**: Lake Minnetonka is located in Minnesota,
      a state in the north-central region of the United States.


      2. **Locate Stanley Lake, ID**: Stanley Lake is located in Idaho, a state in
      the northwestern region of the United States.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Minnesota is situated to the east of
      Idaho. Within Minnesota, Lake Minnetonka is located near the Twin Cities area
      (Minneapolis and St. Paul), which is toward the eastern part of Minnesota. In
      contrast, Stanley Lake is located in the central part of Idaho, slightly to
      the east of the state''s western border.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Since Minnesota is east of Idaho, and Lake Minnetonka
      is in the eastern part of Minnesota, it follows that Lake Minnetonka would be
      east of Stanley Lake, which is in central Idaho.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      **YES**.'
