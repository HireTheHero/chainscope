      **Step 1: Determine the longitude of Lake Thompson (South Dakota).**

      Lake Thompson is located in eastern South Dakota. Its approximate longitude
      is around **97-98 degrees West**.


      **Step 2: Determine the longitude of Seven Devils Mountains (Idaho).**

      The Seven Devils Mountains are located in west-central Idaho, near the border
      with Oregon. Their approximate longitude is around **116-117 degrees West**.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      * Lake Thompson: ~97-98 degrees West

      * Seven Devils Mountains: ~116-117 degrees West


      **Step 4: Understand "east of".**

      On a map, locations with a *smaller* west longitude are further *east*. Conversely,
      locations with a *larger* west longitude are further *west*.


      **Step 5: Apply the comparison to the "east of" question.**

      Since 97-98 is a smaller number than 116-117 (when referring to west longitudes),
      Lake Thompson is indeed further east than the Seven Devils Mountains.

      Sandwich Range is a mountain range in New Hampshire. New Hampshire is on the
