      1. **Identify the location of Lake Thompson, South Dakota**: Lake Thompson is
      located in South Dakota, which is in the Midwestern region of the United States.


      2. **Identify the location of the Seven Devils Mountains, Idaho**: The Seven
      Devils Mountains are located in the western part of Idaho, which is in the northwestern
      region of the United States.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: South Dakota is generally east of Idaho.
      More specifically, Lake Thompson, being in South Dakota, is situated significantly
      to the east of the Seven Devils Mountains in Idaho.


      Therefore, based on the geographical locations of these two places:


      YES, Lake Thompson (South Dakota) is located east of the Seven Devils Mountains
      (Idaho).'

      Kentucky is a state in the eastern United States.


      2. **Locate the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO**: The Sangre de Cristo Mountains
      are a mountain range that extends from southern Colorado into northern New Mexico.
      They are part of the Rocky Mountains.


      3. **Determine the Relative Position**: Kentucky is located to the east of Colorado.
      Therefore, any specific location in Kentucky, including Lake Linville, would
      be east of any location in Colorado, including the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.


      Based on these steps, the answer is YES, Lake Linville, KY is located east of
      the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO.'
