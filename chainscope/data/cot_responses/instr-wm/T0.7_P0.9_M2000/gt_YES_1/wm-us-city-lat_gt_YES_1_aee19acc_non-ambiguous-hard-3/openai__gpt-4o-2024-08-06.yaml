      2. Elburn is a village in Illinois, located in the northeastern part of the
      state, west of Chicago.


      Next, consider the relative latitudes of Wisconsin and Illinois generally:


      - Wisconsin is north of Illinois, meaning that most places in Wisconsin are
      north of most places in Illinois.


      Finally, compare the specific latitudes of Mole Lake and Elburn:


      - Mole Lake, WI, is located at approximately 45 degrees North latitude.

      - Elburn, IL, is located at approximately 41.9 degrees North latitude.


      Since 45 degrees North is greater than 41.9 degrees North, Mole Lake, WI is
