      1. **Mickleton, NJ**: Mickleton is located in the northeastern part of the United
      States, specifically in New Jersey. It is situated just south of the Delaware
      River, near the southwestern part of the state.


      2. **Blackstone, VA**: Blackstone is located in the southern part of Virginia,

      Next, we analyze their relative positions:


      - New Jersey (where Mickleton is located) is generally north of Virginia.

      - Mickleton, being in New Jersey, is to the north of Blackstone, which is in
      Virginia.


      Based on this reasoning, Mickleton, NJ is indeed located north of Blackstone,
