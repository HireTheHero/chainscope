      I''ve started by pinpointing the core inquiry: determining the relative north-south
      positions of Crittenden, KY, and Notasulga, AL. My plan involves first locating
      each place geographically. Next, I''ll compare their latitudes to deduce which
      is further north.



      **Determining Relative Positions**


      I''ve refined my approach. After establishing the core question and breaking
      it down, I''m now detailing each step. I pinpointed the states, Kentucky and
      Alabama, then reasoned that since Kentucky lies north of Alabama, Crittenden,
      being in Kentucky, is undoubtedly north of Notasulga. My next task is to finalize
      the reasoning for the ultimate answer.



      **Reasoning Through Locations**


      I''ve now systematized the logic. I''m organizing the approach to answer the
      question: Is Crittenden north of Notasulga? I''m ensuring the steps are crystal
      clear and logically sound. First, I''ll identify the cities'' states. Next,
      I''ll leverage the known geographical relationship between Kentucky and Alabama.
      Finally, a decisive conclusion: Crittenden is indeed north.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to locate the city of Crittenden. Crittenden is in the state
      of Kentucky (KY).

      2.  Next, we need to locate the city of Notasulga. Notasulga is in the state
      of Alabama (AL).

      3.  Finally, we compare the geographical locations of the two states. The entire
      state of Kentucky is located north of the entire state of Alabama.

      4.  Therefore, any city in Kentucky must be north of any city in Alabama.

      I''ve identified the core question: Determining if Maize, Kansas is north of
      Pottsboro, Texas. I have now pinpointed both locations: Maize, KS and Pottsboro,
      TX. My next step is to compare their latitudes to determine their relative north-south
      positions.



      **Evaluating State Locations**


      I''ve moved on to using the knowledge that Kansas is north of Texas. Now, I''m
      formulating a straightforward conclusion: any location within Kansas is, therefore,
      north of any location within Texas. To verify, I will use the latitude of both
      cities.



      **Constructing a Logical Argument**


      I''ve moved beyond state-level comparisons. Now, I''m mapping out a clear, step-by-step
      reasoning process. This includes identifying locations, comparing state positions,
      and drawing conclusions based on these geographical facts. I''m crafting a response
      structured in a way that delivers a definitive answer, with supporting evidence
      for each step.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of Maize, KS:** Maize is a city in the state of
      Kansas.

      2.  **Identify the location of Pottsboro, TX:** Pottsboro is a city in the state
      of Texas.

      3.  **Compare the relative geography of the states:** The state of Kansas is
      located entirely north of the state of Texas.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Since all of Kansas is north of all of Texas, Maize, KS
      must be north of Pottsboro, TX.
