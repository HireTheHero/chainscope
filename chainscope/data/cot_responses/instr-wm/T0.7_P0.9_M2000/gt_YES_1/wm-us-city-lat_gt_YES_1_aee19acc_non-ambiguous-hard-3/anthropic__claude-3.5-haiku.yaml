      near the Utah border.


      2. Next, I''ll locate Peridot, Arizona. It''s in central Arizona, east of Phoenix.


      3. Colorado is north of Arizona in the United States.


      4. Therefore, any city in Colorado will be north of any city in Arizona.


      5. So Fruita, CO is definitely located north of Peridot, AZ.
