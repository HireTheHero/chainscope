      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Rukum District is a district in western Nepal, a country in South Asia.

      - Ramsey Island is a small island off the coast of Wales in the United Kingdom.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a global map.

      - Nepal is located in Asia, east of Europe.

      - Wales (UK) is in Western Europe.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Rukum District in Nepal would be significantly further east in terms of longitude
      compared to any part of the United Kingdom.

      - Ramsey Island, being off the western coast of Wales, is in the westernmost
      part of the UK.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since Nepal is east of the UK, and Rukum District is in Nepal, while Ramsey
      Island is off the western coast of the UK, Rukum District must be east of Ramsey
      Island.


      YES, Rukum District is located east of Ramsey Island.'

      and Machuelo Abajo, and then compare their east-west positions.


      Step 1: Identify where Capracotta is located.

      Capracotta is a town in Italy, specifically in the Molise region in central-southern
      Italy.


      Step 2: Identify where Machuelo Abajo is located.

      Machuelo Abajo is a barrio (neighborhood or district) in Puerto Rico, which
      is an island territory in the Caribbean.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      Italy is in Europe, which is east of the Caribbean and the Americas. Puerto
      Rico is in the western hemisphere, while Italy is in the eastern hemisphere.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Capracotta (in Italy) is located in the eastern hemisphere and Machuelo
      Abajo (in Puerto Rico) is in the western hemisphere, Capracotta is east of Machuelo
      Abajo.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Mopidevi is a town in the state of Andhra Pradesh in southeastern India.

      - Veliki Preslav is a town in northeastern Bulgaria, in Europe.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on the world map.

      - India is located in South Asia, east of Europe.

      - Bulgaria is in Eastern Europe, west of Asia.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Locations in India have much higher (more eastern) longitudes than locations
      in Bulgaria.

      - India is approximately 60-70 degrees east of Bulgaria in terms of longitude.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since Mopidevi is in India and Veliki Preslav is in Bulgaria, and India is
      east of Bulgaria, Mopidevi must be east of Veliki Preslav.

      in Southeast Asia. However, without confirming Ghasm''s location, I cannot make

      the relative positions of Amethi district and Skuodas.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Amethi district is in Uttar Pradesh, northern India.

      - Skuodas is a city in northwestern Lithuania, in Europe.


      Step 2: Consider their positions on a world map.

      - India is in South Asia.

      - Lithuania is in Eastern Europe.

      - On a world map, India is east of Europe.


      Step 3: Determine their relative east-west positioning.

      - Since India is east of Europe, and Amethi is in India while Skuodas is in
      Lithuania (Europe), Amethi must be east of Skuodas.


      Therefore, my answer is: YES'

      Step 1: Identify where Borivali is located.

      Borivali is a suburb located in the northwestern part of Mumbai, India. India
      is in South Asia.


      Step 2: Identify where Gicumbi District is located.

      Gicumbi District is a district in the Northern Province of Rwanda. Rwanda is
      in East Africa.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a global map.

      When looking at a world map, India is located to the east of Africa. Mumbai
      (containing Borivali) is on India''s western coast, but still significantly
      east of any part of Rwanda.


      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison.

      Even though Borivali is in western India, it is still located east of Gicumbi
      District because India as a whole is east of Rwanda.

      - Llanddona is indeed in Wales, which is part of the United Kingdom.

      - Brandywine is in Maryland, which is on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their positions globally.

      - Wales is located in western Europe.

      - Maryland is located on the eastern coast of North America.

      - The United States is west of Europe when considering global positioning.


      Step 4: Make the east/west comparison.

      - Since Europe is east of North America, and Llanddona is in Europe while Brandywine

      Geographically, South Korea (including Jincheon County) lies significantly east
      of India (including Bandikui).


      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison.

      Since South Korea is east of India, Jincheon County is east of Bandikui.

      Birur is a town located in the Chikmagalur district of Karnataka state in southern
      India.


      Step 2: Identify where Bui department is.

      Bui is a department in the Northwest Region of Cameroon, in central Africa.

      North Carolina is on the eastern coast of the United States. The United Kingdom
      is located east of the United States across the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison.

      Since the UK is east of the United States, and Masham is in the UK, while Robeson
      County is in the eastern United States, Masham must be east of Robeson County.


      NO

      Luxettipet is a town located in Telangana state in southern India.


      Step 2: I need to identify where Rutigliano is located.

      Rutigliano is a town in the metropolitan city of Bari, in the Puglia (Apulia)
      region of southern Italy.


      Step 3: I need to determine their relative positions on a global map.

      India is in South Asia, while Italy is in Southern Europe.

      Looking at a world map, India is located to the east of Italy.


      Step 4: Since Luxettipet is in India and Rutigliano is in Italy, I can determine
      their relative east-west positioning.

      Any location in India would be east of any location in Italy because India as
      a country is east of Italy on the globe.


      Therefore, YES, Luxettipet is located east of Rutigliano.'

      the relative positions of these two places.


      Step 1: Identify where Sarai Alamgir Tehsil is located.

      Sarai Alamgir Tehsil is a tehsil (administrative subdivision) in Punjab province,
      Pakistan. Pakistan is in South Asia.


      Step 2: Identify where Tremadog is located.

      Tremadog is a village in Gwynedd, North Wales, United Kingdom. The UK is in
      Western Europe.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a global east-west axis.

      When considering global geography, Pakistan is located to the east of the United
      Kingdom. Pakistan is in South Asia, while the UK is in Western Europe. On a
      world map, moving from west to east, you would encounter the UK before reaching
      Pakistan.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Sarai Alamgir Tehsil is in Pakistan (South Asia) and Tremadog is in Wales,
      UK (Western Europe), and South Asia is east of Western Europe, Sarai Alamgir
      Tehsil is located east of Tremadog.
