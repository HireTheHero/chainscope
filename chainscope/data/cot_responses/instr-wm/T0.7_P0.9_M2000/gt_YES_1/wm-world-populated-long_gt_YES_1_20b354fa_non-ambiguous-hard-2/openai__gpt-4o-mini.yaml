    045a8898-80db-4478-886e-59fb75755eaa: 'To answer the question, we need to determine
      the locations of both Rukum District and Ramsey Island.


      1. **Identify Ramsey Island**: Ramsey Island is located off the coast of Wales,
      specifically in the Pembrokeshire region.


      2. **Identify Rukum District**: Rukum District is located in Nepal, which is
      in South Asia, far away from Wales.


      3. **Determine their relative positions**: Since Rukum District is in Nepal
      and Ramsey Island is in Wales, we can establish that they are in completely
      different parts of the world.


      4. **Establish the east-west relationship**: Given that Rukum District is in
      Nepal and Ramsey Island is in Wales, Rukum District cannot be east of Ramsey
      Island. In fact, it would be to the east of Europe as a whole, considering the
      geographical locations.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is NO.'

      4. **Determine Relative Positions**: Since Viqueque (East Timor) is in the eastern
      hemisphere and Ghasm (Iran) is in the northern part of the Middle East, we can
      analyze their longitudes. Viqueque is further east in terms of longitude compared
      to Ghasm.

      of Ghasm.

      - Vinger, if we are indeed referring to a location in the Netherlands, is situated

      \ determining if one place is east of another is their longitudes. Ch\xEDa,\
      \ Cundinamarca, has a longitude of approximately 74.0\xB0 W, while Praia a Mare\
      \ has a longitude of approximately 15.8\xB0 E. \n\n4. **Understanding East and\
      \ West**: Since the longitudinal line at 0\xB0 (the Prime Meridian) is used\
      \ as the reference point, places with a longitude that is further east than\
      \ 0\xB0 are considered to be east. In this case, Praia a Mare (15.8\xB0 E) is\
      \ significantly east of Ch\xEDa (74.0\xB0 W).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: To be considered\
      \ \"east\" in terms of geography, a location must have a higher longitude value\
      \ if both are in the same hemisphere (which they are not, but the comparative\
      \ longitudes still hold). Since Praia a Mare is located in the eastern hemisphere\
      \ and Ch\xEDa is in the western hemisphere, Praia a Mare is indeed east of Ch\xED\
      a.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **YES**."

      of both places.


      1. **Locate Dhiffushi**: Dhiffushi is an island in the Maldives, specifically
      in the Kaafu Atoll. The Maldives is located in the Indian Ocean, southwest of
      India and Sri Lanka.


      2. **Locate Lukavac**: Lukavac is a town in Bosnia and Herzegovina, situated
      in the central part of the country, which is in Southeast Europe.


      3. **Determine their relative positions**: To compare the locations, we note
      that Dhiffushi is in the southern hemisphere, while Lukavac is in the northern
      hemisphere. Specifically, Dhiffushi is approximately 4.5 degrees north of the
      equator, while Lukavac is around 44.5 degrees north.


      4. **East vs. West**: Since Lukavac is located far to the north of Dhiffushi
      and both are in different hemispheres, we can conclude that Dhiffushi is not
      east of Lukavac, but rather significantly south of it.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      NO.'
