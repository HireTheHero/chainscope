      located east of Ramsey Island, we need to establish the locations of both places
      and their relative positions.


      1. **Location of Rukum District**: Rukum District is located in Nepal. Specifically,
      it is part of the mid-western region of Nepal.


      2. **Location of Ramsey Island**: Ramsey Island is located off the coast of

      1. **Jezzine District**: This is located in Lebanon, which is in the Middle
      East. Specifically, Jezzine is situated in the southern part of Lebanon.


      2. **Gascoyne**: This is a region in Western Australia. It is located on the
      western coast of Australia.


      Now, let''s consider their relative positions:


      - Jezzine District is in the eastern hemisphere, specifically in the Middle
      East.

      - Gascoyne is in the eastern hemisphere but much further east, as it is located
      in Western Australia.


      When considering the global longitudinal lines, Australia (and thus Gascoyne)

      3. Compare the longitudinal positions: To determine whether one place is east
      of another, we compare their longitudes. A place with a higher longitude value
      is considered to be more eastward.


      Since Koltur''s specific location is not clearly defined without further context,
      it''s not possible to definitively compare its longitudinal position with that
      of Gopalpur, Odisha. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot
      accurately answer the question.


      Thus, the answer is: NO (we cannot definitively say Gopalpur is east of Koltur
      without more information).'
