    cd3aeb83-8f53-4a28-afc7-447e42ef4863: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. Gopalpur is a coastal town in Odisha, India, located on the eastern coast
      of India on the Bay of Bengal.


      2. Koltur is a village located in West Bengal, India, which is inland and not

    d4bc0aee-f9b0-4b39-b423-15b1530e3f02: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) Koraput district is located in Odisha state in eastern India.


      2) Combe Down is a suburb of Bath, located in Somerset, England.


      3) England is in Western Europe, while India is in South Asia.


      4) When comparing locations east-west globally, India is significantly east
      of England.


      5) Therefore, since Koraput district is in India and Combe Down is in England,
      Koraput district must be east of Combe Down.

    dc56debd-13dd-4999-b1e1-59f821a3e8df: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to locate both places:

      - Jincheon County is in South Korea

      - Bandikui is in India (Rajasthan state)


      2. Now I need to compare their relative positions:

      - South Korea is in East Asia

      - India is in South Asia

      - When looking at a map of Asia, South Korea is clearly east of India


      3. Since Jincheon County is in South Korea and Bandikui is in India, and South
      Korea is east of India, Jincheon County must be east of Bandikui.

      - Nadvirna is in Europe

      - When comparing east-west positions, India is east of Ukraine


      3. Therefore, since Thisayanvilai is in India, and India is east of Ukraine
      (where Nadvirna is), Thisayanvilai must be east of Nadvirna.


      Answer: YES'
