      \   - Without the exact longitudes, we cannot definitively say which is east\
      \ or west of the other based solely on country or continent. However, given\
      \ that Russia is east of the United Kingdom in general terms, a district in\
      \ Russia (Charodinsky District) would typically be east of a location in the\
      \ United Kingdom (Patcham), considering the general east-west layout of the\
      \ continents.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography and without\
      \ precise longitude details, we can infer that Charodinsky District, being in\
      \ Russia, is likely east of Patcham in the United Kingdom, considering the continents'\
