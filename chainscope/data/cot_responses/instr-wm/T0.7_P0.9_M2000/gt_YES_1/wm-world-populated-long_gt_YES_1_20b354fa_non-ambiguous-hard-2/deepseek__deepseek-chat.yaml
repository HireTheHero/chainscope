      \ by step. The question is: **Is Viqueque located east of Ghasm?**\n\n### Step\
      \ 1: Identify the Locations\nFirst, I need to know where Viqueque and Ghasm\
      \ are located.\n\n- **Viqueque**: I recall that Viqueque is a town in the southeastern\
      \ part of **Timor-Leste** (East Timor), which is a country in Southeast Asia.\n\
      \  \n- **Ghasm**: This one is a bit trickier. I'm not immediately familiar with\
      \ a place called Ghasm. It might be a misspelling or a less commonly known location.\
      \ I'll try to find more information about it.\n\n### Step 2: Researching Ghasm\n\
      Upon researching, I find that **Ghasm** is a village in **Oman**, a country\
      \ located in the Middle East, on the southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula.\n\
      \n### Step 3: Understanding the Geographical Positions\nNow, I need to determine\
      \ the relative positions of Timor-Leste and Oman.\n\n- **Timor-Leste** is situated\
      \ in Southeast Asia, specifically on the eastern half of the island of Timor,\
      \ which is part of the Indonesian archipelago.\n  \n- **Oman** is located in\
      \ the Middle East, on the Arabian Peninsula, bordering the Arabian Sea and the\
      \ Gulf of Oman.\n\n### Step 4: Determining East-West Relationship\nTo find out\
      \ if Viqueque is east of Ghasm, I need to compare their longitudes.\n\n- **Viqueque,\
      \ Timor-Leste**: Approximately around **125.5\xB0 East** longitude.\n  \n- **Ghasm,\
      \ Oman**: Approximately around **57.5\xB0 East** longitude.\n\n### Step 5: Comparing\
      \ Longitudes\nIn terms of longitude, the higher the degree, the further east\
      \ a location is.\n\n- Viqueque is at **125.5\xB0 East**.\n  \n- Ghasm is at\
      \ **57.5\xB0 East**.\n\nSince **125.5\xB0 East** is greater than **57.5\xB0\
      \ East**, Viqueque is indeed further east than Ghasm.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter\
      \ this step-by-step analysis, it's clear that **Viqueque is located east of\

      \     - Mpumalanga's longitude is roughly between 29\xB0E and 31\xB0E.\n   \
      \  - KwaZulu-Natal's longitude is roughly between 29\xB0E and 32\xB0E.\n   \
      \  - Stoke Bardolph's longitude is approximately 1\xB0W.\n\n   - Since east\
      \ longitudes are to the east of west longitudes (when comparing positive and\
      \ negative values), both Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal are east of Stoke Bardolph.\n\
      \n4. **Question phrasing**:\n   - The question asks if \"Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal\"\
      \ is east of Stoke Bardolph. This seems to treat \"Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal\"\
      \ as a single place, which is not correct\u2014they are two separate provinces.\
      \ However, both are indeed east of Stoke Bardolph.\n\n**Final answer**: YES.\
      \ Both Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal are east of Stoke Bardolph."

      \ The question is: **Is Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal located east of Stoke Bardolph?**\n\
      \n### Step 1: Understanding the Locations Involved\n\n**Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal:**\n\
      - **Mpumalanga** and **KwaZulu-Natal** are both provinces in South Africa.\n\
      - Mpumalanga is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, while KwaZulu-Natal\
      \ is situated on the southeastern coast.\n\n**Stoke Bardolph:**\n- **Stoke Bardolph**\
      \ is a village in the United Kingdom, specifically in Nottinghamshire, England.\n\
      \n### Step 2: Determining the Relative Positions\n\nTo determine if Mpumalanga,\
      \ KwaZulu-Natal is east of Stoke Bardolph, we need to compare their longitudes.\n\
      \n**Longitudes:**\n- **Stoke Bardolph, UK:** Approximately 1.13\xB0 W longitude.\n\
      - **Mpumalanga, South Africa:** Approximately 30.79\xB0 E longitude.\n- **KwaZulu-Natal,\
      \ South Africa:** Approximately 30.58\xB0 E longitude.\n\n### Step 3: Comparing\
      \ the Longitudes\n\nIn terms of longitude:\n- **East Longitude (E):** Positive\
      \ values, indicating locations east of the Prime Meridian (0\xB0).\n- **West\
      \ Longitude (W):** Negative values, indicating locations west of the Prime Meridian.\n\
      \nSince Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal have positive longitude values (approximately\
      \ 30\xB0 E), and Stoke Bardolph has a negative longitude value (approximately\
      \ 1.13\xB0 W), it means that Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal are indeed east of\
      \ Stoke Bardolph.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nBased on the longitude comparison:\n\
      \n- **Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal (30.79\xB0 E, 30.58\xB0 E)** are east of **Stoke\
      \ Bardolph (1.13\xB0 W)**.\n\n**Final Answer:** YES."

      \ by step to determine whether Dibrugarh district is located east of Debelja\u010D\
      a.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\nFirst, we need to know where both\
      \ Dibrugarh district and Debelja\u010Da are located.\n\n- **Dibrugarh District**:\
      \ This is a district in the northeastern part of India, specifically in the\
      \ state of Assam. Assam is known for its tea gardens and is situated in the\
      \ eastern region of India.\n\n- **Debelja\u010Da**: This is a bit trickier.\
      \ Debelja\u010Da is a village in Serbia, located in the autonomous province\
      \ of Vojvodina. Serbia is in southeastern Europe.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the\
      \ Geographical Coordinates\n\nTo compare the positions of these two places,\
      \ we'll look at their approximate latitudes and longitudes.\n\n- **Dibrugarh\
      \ District**:\n  - Latitude: Approximately 27.5\xB0 N\n  - Longitude: Approximately\
      \ 94.9\xB0 E\n\n- **Debelja\u010Da**:\n  - Latitude: Approximately 45.8\xB0\
      \ N\n  - Longitude: Approximately 20.1\xB0 E\n\n### Step 3: Understand East\
      \ and West Directions\n\nIn geography, longitude lines run from the North Pole\
      \ to the South Pole, and they measure how far east or west a location is from\
      \ the Prime Meridian (0\xB0 longitude). Locations to the east of the Prime Meridian\
      \ have positive longitude values, while those to the west have negative values.\n\
      \nSince both Dibrugarh and Debelja\u010Da have positive longitude values, they\
      \ are both east of the Prime Meridian.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Longitudes\n\
      \nNow, we'll compare the longitudes of the two locations to see which one is\
      \ farther east.\n\n- Dibrugarh: 94.9\xB0 E\n- Debelja\u010Da: 20.1\xB0 E\n\n\
      Since 94.9\xB0 E is greater than 20.1\xB0 E, Dibrugarh is farther east than\
      \ Debelja\u010Da.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nBased on the longitude values:\n\
      \n- **Dibrugarh District** is at 94.9\xB0 E.\n- **Debelja\u010Da** is at 20.1\xB0\
      \ E.\n\nSince Dibrugarh has a higher longitude value than Debelja\u010Da, it\
      \ is located to the east of Debelja\u010Da.\n\n**Final Answer:** YES, Dibrugarh\

      \ Nalagarh is located east of Moroni, Comoros. At first glance, this seems straightforward,\
      \ but I realize that it requires understanding the geographical locations of\
      \ these two places. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Identifying\
      \ Nalagarh and Moroni, Comoros\n\nFirst, I need to know where Nalagarh and Moroni\
      \ are located.\n\n- **Nalagarh**: I recall that Nalagarh is a town in India.\
      \ To be more specific, I think it's in the northern part of India, possibly\
      \ in the state of Himachal Pradesh. But I'm not entirely sure, so I'll need\
      \ to verify this.\n\n- **Moroni, Comoros**: I'm less familiar with Moroni. I\
      \ know that Comoros is an island country located in the Indian Ocean, off the\
      \ eastern coast of Africa. Moroni is the capital city of Comoros. So, Moroni\
      \ is situated on one of the islands in the Comoros archipelago.\n\n### Step\
      \ 2: Verifying the Locations\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I should verify the exact\
      \ locations of both Nalagarh and Moroni.\n\n- **Nalagarh**: A quick search confirms\
      \ that Nalagarh is indeed in India, specifically in the state of Himachal Pradesh.\
      \ It's located in the northern part of India, near the border with Punjab.\n\
      \n- **Moroni, Comoros**: As previously thought, Moroni is the capital of Comoros.\
      \ Comoros is an archipelago situated in the Indian Ocean, between Mozambique\
      \ and Madagascar. Moroni is on the island of Grande Comore (also known as Ngazidja).\n\
      \n### Step 3: Understanding the Relative Longitudes\n\nTo determine if Nalagarh\
      \ is east of Moroni, I need to compare their longitudes.\n\n- **Longitude Basics**:\
      \ Longitude lines run from the North Pole to the South Pole and measure how\
      \ far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0 longitude).\
      \ Locations with higher east longitude values are further east.\n\n- **Nalagarh's\
      \ Longitude**: Nalagarh is located at approximately 76.38\xB0 East longitude.\n\
      \n- **Moroni's Longitude**: Moroni is located at approximately 43.25\xB0 East\
      \ longitude.\n\n### Step 4: Comparing the Longitudes\n\nNow, let's compare the\
      \ two longitudes:\n\n- Nalagarh: 76.38\xB0 E\n- Moroni: 43.25\xB0 E\n\nSince\
      \ 76.38\xB0 E is greater than 43.25\xB0 E, Nalagarh has a higher east longitude\
      \ value than Moroni.\n\n### Step 5: Determining If Nalagarh is East of Moroni\n\
      \nGiven that Nalagarh has a higher east longitude than Moroni, it means Nalagarh\
      \ is further east than Moroni.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the comparison\
      \ of their longitudes:\n\n- **Yes**, Nalagarh is located east of Moroni, Comoros.\n\

      \ about both places. Since I'm not very familiar with either, I'll start by\
      \ researching where each is located.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\
      \n**Bitterley:**\nI recall that Bitterley is a village in England. Specifically,\
      \ I think it's in Shropshire. To confirm, I'll do a quick search. Yes, Bitterley\
      \ is indeed a village and civil parish in Shropshire, England.\n\n**Salgar:**\n\
      I'm less certain about Salgar. I think it might be in Colombia. Searching online\
      \ confirms that Salgar is a municipality in the Colombian department of Antioquia.\n\
      \n### Step 2: Determine the Geographic Coordinates\n\nTo compare their east-west\
      \ positions, I need their geographic coordinates.\n\n**Bitterley:**\nLooking\
      \ up Bitterley, Shropshire, I find that it is located at approximately 52.4\xB0\
      N latitude and 2.6\xB0W longitude.\n\n**Salgar:**\nFor Salgar, Antioquia, Colombia,\
      \ I find it's located at approximately 6.1\xB0N latitude and 75.8\xB0W longitude.\n\
      \n### Step 3: Analyze the Longitudes\n\nLongitude measures how far east or west\
      \ a location is from the prime meridian (0\xB0 longitude). Positive longitudes\
      \ are east of the prime meridian, and negative longitudes are west.\n\n**Bitterley:**\n\
      2.6\xB0W means it is 2.6 degrees west of the prime meridian.\n\n**Salgar:**\n\
      75.8\xB0W means it is 75.8 degrees west of the prime meridian.\n\n### Step 4:\
      \ Compare the Longitudes\n\nTo determine which location is farther east, we\
      \ compare their longitudes. The location with the smaller absolute value of\
      \ longitude (closer to 0\xB0) is farther east.\n\n- Bitterley: 2.6\xB0W\n- Salgar:\
      \ 75.8\xB0W\n\nSince 2.6\xB0W is closer to 0\xB0 than 75.8\xB0W, Bitterley is\
      \ farther east than Salgar.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nBased on the longitude\
      \ values:\n\n- Bitterley is at 2.6\xB0W.\n- Salgar is at 75.8\xB0W.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ Bitterley is located east of Salgar.\n\n**Final Answer:** YES."

      \ by step to determine whether \xD3lafsfj\xF6r\xF0ur is located east of Consul,\
      \ Saskatchewan.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\nFirst, we need to know\
      \ where \xD3lafsfj\xF6r\xF0ur and Consul, Saskatchewan are located.\n\n- **\xD3\
      lafsfj\xF6r\xF0ur**: This is a town in northern Iceland. Iceland is an island\
      \ country in the North Atlantic Ocean.\n  \n- **Consul, Saskatchewan**: This\
      \ is a village located in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. Saskatchewan\
      \ is situated in the central part of Canada.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Geographical\
      \ Positions\n\nTo determine if \xD3lafsfj\xF6r\xF0ur is east of Consul, Saskatchewan,\
      \ we'll need to look at their longitudinal positions. Longitude lines run north-south\
      \ and measure how far east or west a location is from the prime meridian (0\xB0\
      \ longitude).\n\n- **Iceland's Longitude**: Iceland is located in the North\
      \ Atlantic, generally between 13\xB0W and 24\xB0W longitude.\n  \n- **Saskatchewan's\
      \ Longitude**: Saskatchewan, Canada, spans approximately from 101\xB0W to 110\xB0\
      W longitude.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Longitudes\n\nNow, let's compare the\
      \ longitudes of \xD3lafsfj\xF6r\xF0ur and Consul, Saskatchewan.\n\n- **\xD3\
      lafsfj\xF6r\xF0ur**: Let's assume it's around 18\xB0W longitude (since Iceland\
      \ is generally between 13\xB0W and 24\xB0W).\n  \n- **Consul, Saskatchewan**:\
      \ Let's assume it's around 109\xB0W longitude (since Saskatchewan spans from\
      \ 101\xB0W to 110\xB0W).\n\n### Step 4: Determine East or West\n\nIn terms of\
      \ longitude, locations with smaller numerical values (closer to 0\xB0 longitude)\
      \ are considered more eastward than those with larger numerical values.\n\n\
      - **\xD3lafsfj\xF6r\xF0ur at 18\xB0W** is west of the prime meridian but is\
      \ closer to 0\xB0 longitude compared to Consul, Saskatchewan at 109\xB0W.\n\n\
      - Therefore, \xD3lafsfj\xF6r\xF0ur is **east** of Consul, Saskatchewan.\n\n\
      ### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nBased on the longitudinal comparison, \xD3lafsfj\xF6\
      r\xF0ur in Iceland is located east of Consul, Saskatchewan in Canada.\n\n**Answer:**\

      \ by step. The question is: **Is Barman, Madhya Pradesh located east of Zhytomyr?**\n\
      \n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\nFirst, I need to know where Barman,\
      \ Madhya Pradesh, and Zhytomyr are located.\n\n- **Barman, Madhya Pradesh**:\
      \ Madhya Pradesh is a state in central India. Barman seems to be a village or\
      \ town within this state. To confirm, I'll look up Barman's exact location.\n\
      \n- **Zhytomyr**: This is a city in Ukraine. I need to find its geographical\
      \ coordinates to compare with Barman's location.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Coordinates\n\
      \nTo determine if one place is east of another, I need their longitude values.\
      \ Places with higher longitude values are further east.\n\n- **Barman, Madhya\
      \ Pradesh**: After a quick search, I find that Barman is located at approximately\
      \ **22.72\xB0 N latitude and 78.87\xB0 E longitude**.\n\n- **Zhytomyr, Ukraine**:\
      \ Zhytomyr is located at approximately **50.25\xB0 N latitude and 28.68\xB0\
      \ E longitude**.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Longitudes\n\nNow, I'll compare\
      \ the longitude values:\n\n- Barman: 78.87\xB0 E\n- Zhytomyr: 28.68\xB0 E\n\n\
      Since 78.87\xB0 E is greater than 28.68\xB0 E, Barman is further east than Zhytomyr.\n\
