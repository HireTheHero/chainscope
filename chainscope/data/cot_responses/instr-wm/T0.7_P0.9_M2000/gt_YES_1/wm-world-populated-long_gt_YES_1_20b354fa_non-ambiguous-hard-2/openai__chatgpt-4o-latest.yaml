      \n1. **Rukum District**: This is a district in Nepal. Nepal is a landlocked\
      \ country in South Asia, located primarily between latitudes 26\xB0 and 31\xB0\
      \ N, and longitudes 80\xB0 and 89\xB0 E. Rukum District lies in the western\
      \ part of Nepal. So, its approximate longitude is around 82\xB0 to 83\xB0 E.\n\
      \n2. **Ramsey Island**: This is a small island located off the coast of Pembrokeshire\

      is located east of Graeagle, California, we need to compare their longitudinal
      positions.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Graeagle, California.

      - Graeagle is a small town located in northeastern California. California lies
      on the west coast of the United States, and northeastern California is still
      quite far west in terms of longitude.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Gibson, Tennessee.

      - Gibson is a town located in western Tennessee. Tennessee is a state in the
      southeastern part of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare longitudinal positions.

      - California (including Graeagle) is generally west of most states, including
      Tennessee.

      - Tennessee (including Gibson) is east of California.


      Therefore, since Gibson, Tennessee is located in a state that is east of California,
      and specifically east of northeastern California where Graeagle is located,
      we can conclude that:


      **YES**, Gibson, Tennessee is located east of Graeagle, California.'
