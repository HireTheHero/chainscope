      1. **Identify the Population Sources**: For accurate and up-to-date population

      - Webster Parish, Louisiana, being part of a more populous state, might have

      However, without the exact figures, this remains an educated guess. For the

      population than Vermont, which could imply that even smaller parishes in Louisiana
      might exceed the population of counties in Vermont.


      Given the lack of specific numbers in this response, let''s consider a general
      trend: Louisiana parishes can indeed have larger populations than Vermont counties
      due to the significant difference in state population sizes.


      Therefore, based on this general assumption and without current, specific data,

      \ Loving County.\n   - Historically, Loving County has been known as the least\
      \ populous county in the United States, with a very small population, often\
      \ less than 200 residents.\n   - Kenedy County, while also having a small population,\
      \ has been larger than Loving County based on historical trends.\n\n3. **Compare\
      \ Populations**: Once the populations are identified, comparing them directly\
      \ will yield the answer. If Kenedy County has more residents than Loving County,\
      \ the answer is yes. Given Loving County's status as the least populous county,\
      \ it's reasonable to infer that Kenedy County would have a larger population.\n\
      \nGiven these considerations and without the most current data, historical context\

      United States Census, the population of Overton County, TN is approximately
      22,083.


      2. **Identify the Population of Beckham County, OK**: Next, we determine the

      population figures for a fair comparison.


      3. **Comparison**: Now, we compare the two populations to determine which county
      is more populous. Overton County, TN has approximately 22,083 people, and Beckham
      County, OK has about 22,410 people.


      Based on the comparison, since 22,410 (Beckham County, OK) is greater than 22,083

      Based on the 2020 United States Census:

      - Dallam County, Texas, had a population of approximately 7,045.

      - Goliad County, Texas, had a population of approximately 7,554.


      Given this data:

      - Since 7,045 (Dallam County) is less than 7,554 (Goliad County), Dallam County
