      asks about the relative positions of La Poudre Pass Lake, CO, and Coldwater
      Lake, WA.

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** Colorado (CO) is in the
      central US, generally east of the Rocky Mountains crest. Washington (WA) is
      in the northwestern US, on the Pacific coast.

      3.  **Determine the general direction of CO relative to WA:** Since WA is on
      the Pacific coast and CO is further inland to the east, Colorado is generally
      located *east* of Washington.

      4.  **Consider the specific lakes within their states:** La Poudre Pass Lake
      is in northern Colorado. Coldwater Lake is in southern Washington.

      5.  **Apply the general state relationship to the specific locations:** Even
      within those states, northern CO is significantly east of southern WA.

      6.  **Formulate the conclusion:** Since Colorado is east of Washington, any
      location in Colorado will be east of any location in Washington. Therefore,
      La Poudre Pass Lake, CO, is located east of Coldwater Lake, WA.

      \ longitude. Walker Lake is in western Nevada. A quick search or recall tells\
      \ me western Nevada is significantly further west than Texas. Let's refine this:\
      \ Walker Lake is located around 118.8\xB0 W longitude.\n\n4.  **Compare the\

      5.  Since Iowa is generally east of California, West Okoboji Lake is likely
      east of Bristol Lake.

      6.  Confirm this by looking up approximate coordinates or positions on a map.
      Iowa is around 90-95 degrees West longitude. California is around 115-125 degrees
      West longitude.

      7.  90-95 degrees West is less negative (or closer to 0) than 115-125 degrees
      West. This means Iowa is east of California.

      8.  Therefore, a specific location in Iowa will be east of a specific location
      in California.

      3.  **Determine the general location of Washington:** Washington is a state
      in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, located on the West Coast.

      4.  **Compare the general locations:** Washington is on the West Coast, while
      Colorado is further inland and eastward from the West Coast.

      5.  **Relate the specific locations within their states:** Mummy Range is in

      \ location/state of each:**\n    *   Mummy Range is in Colorado (CO).\n    *\
      \   Rattlesnake Lake is in Washington (WA).\n\n3.  **Determine the general geographical\
      \ relationship between Colorado and Washington states:** I know (or can quickly\
      \ look up) that Colorado is in the central/west-central part of the US, and\
      \ Washington is in the far northwest part of the US. Washington is significantly\
      \ *west* of Colorado.\n\n4.  **Consider the specific locations within the states\
      \ (optional but helpful):**\n    *   Mummy Range is in northern Colorado, part\
      \ of the Rocky Mountains.\n    *   Rattlesnake Lake is in western Washington,\

      While it''s possible for a specific point in a western state like Montana to

      2.  **Determine the approximate location of Quartz Mountains, OK:** Quartz Mountains
      State Park is located in southwestern Oklahoma. Oklahoma is roughly in the south-central
      United States.

      3.  **Determine the approximate location of Horseshoe Lake (Washington), WA:**
      There are many Horseshoe Lakes in Washington state. However, "Horseshoe Lake
      (Washington), WA" strongly implies a specific location within the state of Washington,
      which is in the northwestern United States. Let''s assume a prominent one, like
      the one near Olympic National Park or the one near Spokane. Regardless of the
      *specific* Horseshoe Lake, it will be located within Washington state.

      4.  **Compare the general locations:** Oklahoma is located in the central/south-central
      US. Washington State is located in the far northwestern US.

      5.  **Determine the relative east/west positions:** The northwestern US (Washington)
      is significantly *west* of the south-central US (Oklahoma).

      4.  **Reason about the positions of the lakes within their states:** While a
      lake could be in the far western part of an eastern state or the far eastern
      part of a western state, given the general east-west relationship of Minnesota
      and Montana, it is highly probable that a lake in Minnesota is east of a lake
      in Montana.

      5.  **Confirm the relative positions:** Minnesota is indeed significantly east
      of Montana. Lake Bemidji is in northern Minnesota, and Quake Lake is in southwestern
      Montana. A quick check confirms the eastern longitude of Minnesota relative
      to the western longitude of Montana.


      Therefore, Lake Bemidji, MN is located east of Quake Lake, MT.

      3. **Determine the relative positions (East/West):** This is the key step. Generally,
      if one location is significantly south of another, their east/west relationship
      is not directly comparable without knowing their longitudes. However, we can
      reason about the general orientation. The US is roughly rectangular. If we move
      south from Oregon to Arizona, we stay within a similar range of longitude for
      the continental US.

      4. **Consider the specific locations:** Luna Lake, AZ is in the eastern part
      of Arizona. The Calapooya Mountains are in western Oregon.

      5. **Compare East/West:** Since Luna Lake is in eastern Arizona and the Calapooya
      Mountains are in western Oregon, Luna Lake is located east of the Calapooya
      Mountains.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.
