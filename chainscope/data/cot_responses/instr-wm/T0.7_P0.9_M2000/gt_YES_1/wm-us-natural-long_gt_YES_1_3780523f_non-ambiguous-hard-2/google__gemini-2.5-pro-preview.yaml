      1.  **Identify the location of Sandwich Range, NH:** The Sandwich Range is a
      mountain range located in the White Mountains of New Hampshire (NH). New Hampshire
      is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States.


      2.  **Identify the location of Lake Linville, KY:** Lake Linville (also known
      as Cedar Creek Lake) is located in Kentucky (KY). Kentucky is a state in the
      east south-central region of the United States.


      3.  **Compare the East-West positions of New Hampshire and Kentucky:** New Hampshire
      is one of the easternmost states in the continental US. Kentucky is located
      significantly to the west of New Hampshire.


      4.  **Conclusion:** Since New Hampshire is east of Kentucky, any location within
