      2. **Locate Jackson Lake, GA**: Jackson Lake is located in the state of Georgia,

      Lake). Since Maine is in the eastern part of the United States and is farther
      north, it can be concluded that it is also east in relation to the longitudinal
      positioning of Kingsley Lake.


      Considering these points:


      YES, Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes, ME is located east of Kingsley Lake, FL.'
