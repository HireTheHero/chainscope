      east of Marettimo, we need to consider the geographical locations of both places:


      1. **Identify the location of Marettimo:** Marettimo is an island in the Mediterranean

      Italy.


      2. **Identify the location of Anghiari:** Anghiari is a town in the Tuscany

      - Sarrin is in the Middle East, located in Syria, which is to the north of Africa
      and slightly to the east of Tanzania.


      When comparing the longitudinal positions:


      - Lushoto is approximately at 38.3 degrees East longitude.

      - Sarrin is approximately at 38.1 degrees East longitude.


      Given these coordinates, Sarrin is actually slightly west of Lushoto.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Sarrin is not located east of Lushoto.'

      of San Benito County, we need to compare their positions longitudinally. Grass
      Valley, being in the Sierra Nevada foothills, is generally east of the central
      coastal region where San Benito County is located.


      Based on these steps, Grass Valley is indeed located east of San Benito County.
      Therefore, the answer is:


      YES'
