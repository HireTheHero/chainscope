      \ 0\xB0 to 180\xB0 eastward, and 0\xB0 to 180\xB0 westward from the prime meridian.\
      \  \n- Scott Island longitude: ~179\xB055'W  \n- Rabi Island longitude: ~179\xB0\
      58'W  \n\nSince Scott Island is located at 179\xB055'W and Rabi Island at 179\xB0\
      58'W, Scott Island is slightly closer to the prime meridian (0\xB0 longitude)\
      \ than Rabi Island. On the western hemisphere, longitude numbers increase westward\
      \ from the prime meridian. Thus, an island with a smaller longitude number (closer\
      \ to 0\xB0) is located east of an island with a higher longitude number.\n\n\
      In other words, 179\xB055'W is east of 179\xB058'W.\n\nTherefore, Scott Island\
      \ (179\xB055'W) is indeed located east of Rabi Island (179\xB058'W).\n\nFinal\

      with Punjab and Rajasthan.

      2. Budgam is located in the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, close
      to Srinagar.

      3. Jammu and Kashmir, including Budgam, is located in the northern part of India,
      while Haryana, where Mandi Dabwali lies, is located further south and somewhat
      southeast.

      4. Specifically, Jammu and Kashmir (Budgam) lies to the north and slightly west
      of Haryana (Mandi Dabwali). Therefore, Haryana is located south and somewhat
      east of Jammu and Kashmir.

      5. Given that Haryana is located southeast of Jammu and Kashmir, Mandi Dabwali
      would generally be situated to the south and east of Budgam.

      Bagha Upazila is located in Bangladesh, specifically in Rajshahi District, Rajshahi

      Step 2: Identify the location of Mahishadal community development block.

      Mahishadal is a community development block located in the Purba Medinipur district
      of West Bengal, India.


      Step 3: Consider the relative position of Bangladesh (Rajshahi District) and
      West Bengal (Purba Medinipur district).

      Rajshahi district in Bangladesh lies generally to the northeast of West Bengal,
      India. However, Purba Medinipur district is located in the southeastern part

      - Mahishadal community development block (Purba Medinipur, West Bengal) is located

      2. Joliette Regional County Municipality (RCM) is located in Quebec, Canada.
      Quebec is generally north of New York State, but we need to check specifically
      where Joliette RCM lies.


      3. Joliette RCM is located northeast of Montreal, in the southern part of Quebec,

      New York.


      4. Massapequa Park, being on Long Island, is located roughly along the east

      1. Rush County, Indiana, is located in the state of Indiana, which is generally
      south and somewhat west of Michigan. However, Indiana extends farther eastward
      than one might initially think.

      2. Big Rapids, Michigan, is located in Mecosta County in western Michigan, roughly
      in the central-west part of Michigan''s lower peninsula.

      3. Indiana''s eastern boundary aligns closely with western Ohio, and it is possible
      that Rush County, Indiana, (which is located in eastern Indiana) might still
      be east of Big Rapids, Michigan.

      4. To check east-west positioning, we consider the relative longitudes. Yangon

      region. Naypyidaw and Pyinmana are located inland, generally north but also
      slightly eastward from Yangon.

      5. Indeed, when looking at a map, Naypyidaw (and thus Pyinmana, which is near
      Naypyidaw) is positioned slightly northeast of Yangon.

    e13e2087-92eb-4e2c-94c6-504abbab975c: 'Let''s approach this step-by-step:


      Step 1: Identify the location of Pyinmana.

      Pyinmana is located near Naypyidaw, the administrative capital city of Myanmar.
      Naypyidaw (and thus Pyinmana) is roughly located in the central region of Myanmar.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Thingangyun Township.

      Thingangyun Township is one of the townships in Yangon, Myanmar. Yangon is situated
      in southern Myanmar, near the coast, toward the southern edge of the country.


      Step 3: Compare relative locations.

      Yangon (including Thingangyun Township) lies in southern Myanmar and Naypyidaw/Pyinmana
      lies northward, more centrally inland. Since Naypyidaw (Pyinmana) is situated
      north and slightly eastward compared to Yangon, we need to confirm clearly if
      it is indeed eastward or westward.


      Step 4: Confirming directional alignment.

      Yangon is situated towards the southwest of Naypyidaw/Pyinmana. Pyinmana, located
      near Naypyidaw, is indeed positioned slightly northeast of Yangon. Therefore,
      Pyinmana is not only north but also eastward of Yangon, including Thingangyun

      Pyinmana is located to the northeast of Thingangyun Township, thus clearly to

      Bay.

      2. Berowra Heights is a suburb located in the northern area of Sydney, near
      the Hawkesbury River.

      3. The general geography of Sydney is such that Berowra Heights is positioned
      north-west of the city center, while Sans Souci is positioned south-east of
      the city center.

      4. Given that Sans Souci is southeast of central Sydney and Berowra Heights
      is northwest of central Sydney, Sans Souci must logically be located to the
      east of Berowra Heights.

      1. Sans Souci is a suburb located in the southern area of Sydney, New South
      Wales, near Botany Bay.

      2. Berowra Heights is located in the northern part of Sydney, New South Wales,
      closer to the Hawkesbury River.

      3. Sydney''s coastline generally runs north-south, with Sans Souci located to
      the south, along Botany Bay, and Berowra Heights located far north of Sydney''s
      central business district.

      4. To compare east-west positioning, we need to consider their longitudinal
      positions. Sans Souci is near the eastern coastline, close to Botany Bay, thus
      quite close to the ocean.

      5. Berowra Heights, however, is located significantly inland, further away from
      the coastline to the northwest of Sydney''s central area.

      6. Given Sydney''s geography, suburbs near the coast (like Sans Souci) are generally
      further east than inland suburbs like Berowra Heights.

      2. Berowra Heights is a suburb located in northern Sydney, New South Wales,
      Australia, close to the Hawkesbury River area, north-west of the city center.


      3. Since Sans Souci lies near Botany Bay (to the south-east of central Sydney)
      and Berowra Heights lies to the north-west of central Sydney, Sans Souci is
      clearly positioned south-east relative to Berowra Heights.


      4. To determine whether Sans Souci is east of Berowra Heights, we must consider
      the general geography of Sydney. Berowra Heights is located significantly inland
      and northwest, while Sans Souci, near Botany Bay, lies closer to the coast and
      further east.

      1. Botley is located in Hampshire, England, which is situated in southern England.

      2. Potto is located in North Yorkshire, England, which is situated further north,
      in northern England.

      3. Generally, Hampshire is southwest of North Yorkshire. However, the question
      specifically asks about east-west positioning, not north-south.

      4. Hampshire is situated mostly in south-central England, and North Yorkshire
      is located further north and slightly to the east.

      5. To be precise, Botley is near Southampton, which is in southern Hampshire,
      and Potto is near Middlesbrough, located toward northeastern England.

      6. Given that Potto lies closer to the eastern coast of England, while Hampshire
      and specifically Botley lie further west, we can confidently say that Botley
      is located west of Potto, not east.
