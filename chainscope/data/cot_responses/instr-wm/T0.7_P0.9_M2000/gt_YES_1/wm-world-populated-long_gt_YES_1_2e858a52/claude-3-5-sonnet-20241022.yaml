      1) First, let me locate both places:

      - Walnutport, PA is in eastern Pennsylvania, northwest of Allentown

      - Elsmere, DE is in northern Delaware, near Wilmington


      2) Looking at relative positions:

      - Delaware is east of Pennsylvania

      - Elsmere is in the northern part of Delaware

      - Walnutport is in eastern PA, but PA is still west of Delaware


      3) Even though Walnutport is in eastern PA, since Delaware itself is entirely
      east of Pennsylvania, any point in Delaware (including Elsmere) must be east
      of any point in Pennsylvania (including Walnutport).

      around - Elsmere is east of Walnutport.'

      1) First, let me recall the general geography of Pennsylvania and Delaware:

      - Pennsylvania is north of Delaware

      - Delaware is on the east coast

      - Pennsylvania is inland from Delaware


      2) Let me locate these specific places:

      - Walnutport, PA is in eastern Pennsylvania

      - Elsmere, DE is in northern Delaware near Wilmington


      3) Looking at relative positions:

      - Elsmere is very close to the Delaware River and Delaware Bay

      - Walnutport is inland, west of the Delaware River

      - Delaware''s eastern border is further east than any point in Pennsylvania


      4) Therefore, since Elsmere is in Delaware and closer to the coast, while Walnutport
      is inland in Pennsylvania, Walnutport must be WEST of Elsmere.

      2. After searching my knowledge, I''m uncertain about the exact locations of
      Ein Jorjin and Qatrat al-Rihan.

      3. Without being able to confirm the precise locations of these places, I cannot
      determine their relative positions to each other.

      4. Therefore, I cannot make a reliable determination about whether one is east
      of the other.


      Since I cannot verify the relative positions with confidence, I cannot provide
      a definitive YES or NO answer to this question.


      NO ANSWER - Insufficient information to determine the relative positions of

      2. Looking at their positions relative to each other:

      - Starke is positioned roughly around the middle of the state from east to west

      - Meifod is a village in Powys, Wales

      - Anthorn is a village in Cumbria, England

      - Meifod is in central Wales

      1) First, let''s locate Rossport, Ontario:

      - Rossport is located on the northern shore of Lake Superior

      - It''s in northwestern Ontario, Canada


      2) Next, let''s locate Menominee County, Michigan:

      - Menominee County is in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan

      - It''s on the western shore of Lake Michigan

      - It''s one of the westernmost counties in Michigan''s Upper Peninsula


      3) Now let''s compare their positions:

      - Menominee County is near the Wisconsin border

      - Rossport is much further north and west

      - If you were to draw a line from Menominee County to Rossport, you would need
      to go northwest


      4) Since Rossport is to the northwest of Menominee County, it cannot be east
      of it.
