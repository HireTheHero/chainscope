      \   - Rio Grande do Sul, where Cambar\xE1 do Sul is located, is generally to\
      \ the south of S\xE3o Paulo, where Maced\xF4nia is situated.\n   - Considering\
      \ the north-south difference, we need to consider the longitudinal (east-west)\
      \ positions of both locations to assess the east-west relationship.\n\n4. **Longitudinal\
      \ Comparison**:\n   - Cambar\xE1 do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul is at approximately\
      \ 50.1\xB0W longitude.\n   - Maced\xF4nia, S\xE3o Paulo is at approximately\
      \ 50.2\xB0W longitude.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that both locations share\
      \ approximately the same longitude, Cambar\xE1 do Sul cannot be east of Maced\xF4\

      \ this out:\n\n1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations\
      \ of Riondel, British Columbia, and Crest, California.\n   - Riondel is a small\
      \ community in British Columbia, Canada, located on the east shore of Kootenay\
      \ Lake.\n   - Crest is a community in San Diego County, California, United States,\
      \ located in the eastern part of the county.\n\n2. **Understand Geographic Directions**:\
      \ \n   - East refers to the direction towards the sunrise, or 90 degrees on\
      \ a compass.\n\n3. **Compare Locations**:\n   - Riondel is located in British\
      \ Columbia, which is in western Canada.\n   - Crest is located in California,\
      \ which is on the western coast of the United States.\n\n4. **Longitudinal Comparison**:\n\
      \   - Riondel, British Columbia is at approximately 116.87\xB0W longitude.\n\
      \   - Crest, California is at approximately 116.87\xB0W longitude as well, which\
      \ places them roughly at the same longitude.\n\nGiven that both locations share\
      \ approximately the same longitude, Riondel cannot be east of Crest because\
      \ they are aligned vertically (north-south) rather than horizontally (east-west)\
      \ on the globe.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{NO}$\n\n"

      \ are situated.\n   - Riondel, British Columbia is a small community in southeastern\
      \ British Columbia, Canada.\n   - Crest, California is a census-designated place\
      \ in San Diego County, California, United States.\n\n2. **Understand Geographic\
      \ Directions**: Next, we need to understand the geographic directions. \"East\"\

      \ the right when facing north.\n\n3. **Compare Locations**: \n   - Riondel,\

      \ western Canada.\n   - Crest, California is located in southern California,\
      \ which is in the western part of the United States.\n\n4. **Determine East/West\
      \ Relationship**: Since both locations are in the western part of North America,\
      \ we need to consider their relative positions. Riondel is significantly north\
      \ of Crest. They are separated by a significant distance and a different country\
      \ (Canada and the United States).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that Riondel is\
      \ in western Canada and Crest is in western United States, and considering the\
      \ general layout of North America, Riondel would not be considered east of Crest.\
      \ In fact, it would be more accurate to say that Riondel is north of Crest.\n\
      \nGiven the above reasoning, the answer to whether Riondel, British Columbia\
      \ is located east of Crest, California is: NO\n\n"

      2. **Understand Geographic Positions**: Next, I need to understand their relative
      geographic positions. The Scenic Rim Region (where Harrisville is located) is
      generally located in the south-west of Queensland, while the Ipswich City region
      (where Walloon is situated) is more towards the south-east of Queensland.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Comparing their positions, Harrisville in the Scenic
      Rim Region would be more to the west of Walloon in Ipswich City, considering
      the general layout of Queensland.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of Queensland and the locations
      of these towns, Harrisville is not east of Walloon but rather west of it.


      The final answer is: NO

      directions. "East" refers to the direction towards the sunrise, or in the context
      of a map, to the right when facing north.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Comparing their locations, Yongsan District in Seoul,
      South Korea, is generally south and slightly west of Shulan in Jilin Province,
      China. This is because South Korea is located south of China and slightly to
      the east.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on their geographic positions, Yongsan District is
      not east of Shulan. Instead, it is south and slightly west of Shulan.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      positions.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Roblin
      and Hutchinson County. Roblin is a town in Manitoba, Canada. Hutchinson County
      is a county in Texas, United States.

      geographic positions. Manitoba is a province in central Canada, while Texas
      is a state in the southern United States.

      \n1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Mount\

      \ Peninsula in Victoria, Australia.\n   - Wandong is a town located in the Hume\
      \ region of Victoria, Australia.\n\n2. **Understand Geographic Directions**:\

      \ Mornington Peninsula, which is south of Melbourne.\n   - Wandong is located\
      \ north of Melbourne, in the Hume region.\n\n4. **Longitudinal Comparison**:\n\
      \   - Mount Martha is approximately at 145.01\xB0E longitude.\n   - Wandong\
      \ is approximately at 145.04\xB0E longitude, which is slightly east of Mount\
      \ Martha.\n\nGiven that Wandong is slightly east of Mount Martha based on their\
      \ longitudes, the answer to whether Mount Martha is located east of Wandong\
      \ is: $\\boxed{NO}$\n\n"

      \ the locations of Mount Martha and Wandong.\n\n1. **Identify Locations**: First,\
      \ I need to identify where both places are located. Mount Martha is a town in\
      \ Victoria, Australia. Wandong is also a town in Victoria, Australia.\n\n2.\

      \ directions. \"East\" refers to the direction towards the sunrise, or in the\

      \ \n   - Mount Martha is located on the Mornington Peninsula, which is in the\
      \ southeastern part of Victoria.\n   - Wandong is located in the northern part\
      \ of Victoria.\n\n4. **Determine East/West Relationship**: Since both towns\
      \ are in Victoria, we need to consider their relative positions. Mount Martha\
      \ is southeast of Melbourne, the capital of Victoria. Wandong is north of Melbourne.\n\
      \n5. **Conclusion**: Given that Mount Martha is southeast of Melbourne and Wandong\
      \ is north of Melbourne, Mount Martha would be east of Wandong in a broader\
      \ geographic sense. However, the question is specifically asking if Mount Martha\
      \ is east of Wandong. Since Wandong is more north and Mount Martha is more south,\
      \ and both are somewhat east of Melbourne, but Mount Martha is not directly\
      \ east of Wandong (it's more southeast), the precise answer depends on the exact\
      \ longitudes of the two places. Generally, though, Mount Martha is not directly\
      \ east but rather southeast of Wandong.\n\nGiven the above reasoning and focusing\
      \ on the \"east\" direction specifically, the answer to whether Mount Martha\
      \ is located east of Wandong would be: NO\n\n"
