      3. Billesley is a small village also in Warwickshire, near Stratford-upon-Avon.


      4. Checking their relative positions, Bidford-on-Avon is actually west of Billesley.


      5. Since the question asks if Bidford-on-Avon is east of Billesley, and it is
      actually west, the answer is:


      NO'
