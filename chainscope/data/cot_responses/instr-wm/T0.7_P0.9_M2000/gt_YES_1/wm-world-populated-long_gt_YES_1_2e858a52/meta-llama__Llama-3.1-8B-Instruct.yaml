      is located east of Coxheath, I''ll break it down step by step.


      1. First, I need to know where Coxheath is located. Coxheath is a village in
      Kent, England.

      2. Next, I need to know where Crowhurst is located. Crowhurst is a village in
      East Sussex, England.

      3. Now, I need to compare the locations of Coxheath and Crowhurst. East Sussex
      and Kent are neighboring counties in the south-east of England.

      4. Coxheath is located in Kent, which is west of East Sussex.

      3. The state of California is located in the western part of the North American
      continent.

      4. British Columbia is a province located on the west coast of Canada, east
      of the province of Alaska.

      5. Since both Riondel, British Columbia and Crest, California are on the western
      side of the continent, the question is not about their relative east-west positions
      on the continent, but rather their relative east-west positions within their
      respective countries.


      However, considering the question is asking about the relative east-west position
      of these two places, I will proceed with a geographical analysis:


      6. The province of British Columbia is generally east of the state of California,
      but not necessarily in a direct east-west relationship between the two specific
      locations.


      Now, considering the specific locations of Riondel and Crest, and considering
      the general geography of the region, Riondel is indeed located east of Crest,
      California.


      So, my answer to the question is: **YES**'

      1. Riondel, British Columbia is a location in Canada.

      3. Canada and the United States are adjacent countries, with Canada generally

      5. Since Riondel, British Columbia is in Canada and Crest, California is in

      Since Riondel is north of Crest, it is not located east of Crest. In fact, it''s

      3. Given that Karnataka is generally to the north of Tamil Nadu, and considering
      the geographical layout of both states, Kalaburagi district is likely to be
      north of Thondamuthur.

      4. Since north is typically considered opposite to east, I will assume that
      if Kalaburagi is north of Thondamuthur, it is not east of it.


      Therefore, based on the geographical layout of the regions, the answer to the
      question "Is Kalaburagi district located east of Thondamuthur?" is:


      NO.'

      1. **Identify the location of Kalaburagi district**: Kalaburagi is a district

      2. **Identify the location of Thondamuthur**: Thondamuthur is a town in the

      1. Barwala, Hisar is a town in Haryana, India.

      3. Haryana is a state in northern India, bordered by Punjab to the north, Himachal

      1. **Location of Nalwa**: First, I need to know the location of Nalwa. Unfortunately,
      I couldn''t find any information about a well-known place called "Nalwa". It''s
      possible that it''s a small village or a less-known location. If you could provide
      more context or information about Nalwa, I''d be happy to proceed.


      2. **Location of Barwala, Hisar**: Barwala is a city located in the Hisar district
      of the state of Haryana, India. Haryana is a state in northern India, bordering
      the states of Punjab to the north, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand to the northeast,
      Uttar Pradesh to the southeast, Delhi to the south, and Rajasthan to the west
      and southwest.


      3. **Geographical orientation of India**: India is generally considered to be
      a vast country with a vast north-south axis. The eastern part of India includes
      states like West Bengal, Odisha, and Assam, while the western part includes
      states like Gujarat and Rajasthan.

      Surrey is likely to be south of Great Gonerby in Lincolnshire.


      Therefore, based on these steps, I would conclude that:

      To determine if Boone County, Nebraska is located east of Antelope County, Nebraska,
      we need to consider their geographic locations.


      1. First, I''ll look up the general geographic location of Boone County, Nebraska.
      Boone County is located in the central part of the state, in the High Plains
      region.

      2. Next, I''ll look up the general geographic location of Antelope County, Nebraska.
      Antelope County is located in the north-central part of the state, in the High
      Plains region.

      3. Now, I''ll compare the two locations. Boone County is in the central part
      of the state, while Antelope County is in the north-central part.

      4. Given that central is generally south of north-central, I can conclude that
      Boone County is indeed located south of Antelope County.

      First, I need to know where Musaler and Aparan are located. Musaler is a village
      in Armenia, and Aparan is a town in the Aragatsotn Province of Armenia.


      Next, I need to determine the general geographical location of both places in
      relation to each other. Aparan is located in the Aragatsotn Province, which
      is situated in the north of Armenia.


      Musaler is also located in Armenia, but its exact location in relation to Aparan
      is not immediately clear.


      To determine if Musaler is east of Aparan, I need to consider the geography
      of Armenia. Armenia is a landlocked country located in the South Caucasus region,
      bordered by Turkey to the west, Georgia to the north, Azerbaijan to the east,
      and Iran to the south.


      Without specific coordinates or a map, I can rely on general geographical knowledge

      the Aragats Mountain range located in the north. Aparan is situated in the Aragatsotn
      Province, which is north of Yerevan, the capital city of Armenia. Musaler is
      not a well-known location, so I''ll assume it''s located in the same general
      area as Aparan, given that both are in the Aragatsotn Province.

      1. Boundary Bend is a locality in Victoria, Australia.

      2. Richmond is a suburb in Queensland, Australia.

      3. Victoria and Queensland are states in Australia, which are separated by the
      border between the two states.

      4. Since Boundary Bend is in Victoria and Richmond is in Queensland, they are
      in different states.

      5. The border between Victoria and Queensland runs from the southeast to the
      northwest, which means that Victoria is generally south of Queensland.


      Given this information, Boundary Bend, Victoria cannot be east of Richmond,
      Queensland, as it is in a different state and generally south of Queensland.

      Laura is a town in the Gulf Country of North Queensland, Australia, not South
      Australia. However, since the question asks about South Australia, I will assume
      you are referring to the town of Laura in South Australia, which is a locality
      in the Mid North region.


      Carrickalinga is a locality in the Fleurieu Peninsula, which is in the southern
      part of the Fleurieu Peninsula in South Australia.
