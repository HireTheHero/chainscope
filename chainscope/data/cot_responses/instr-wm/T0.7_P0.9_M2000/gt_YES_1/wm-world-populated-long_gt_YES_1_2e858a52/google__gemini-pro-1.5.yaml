      need to determine which Carthage is being referred to.  Since it specifies "municipality,"
      we''re looking for a city/town named Carthage. The most likely candidate is
      Carthage, Missouri, USA, as it''s relatively well-known.  There are other smaller
      Carthages, but without further specification, we''ll assume the Missouri one.


      2. **Identify Prestine:** This likely refers to Pristina, the capital of Kosovo.  Spelling
      errors happen, and "Prestine" is close enough to assume this is the intended
      location.
