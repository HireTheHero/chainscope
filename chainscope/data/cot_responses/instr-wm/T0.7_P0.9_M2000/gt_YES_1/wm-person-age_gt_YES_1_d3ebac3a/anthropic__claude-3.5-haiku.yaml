      1. First, I''ll check the lifespan of Grimoald III of Benevento:

      - Grimoald III was a Lombard prince who ruled Benevento from 788 to 806 AD

      - Based on historical records, he likely lived in the late 8th/early 9th century


      2. Next, I''ll check the lifespan of Theodora Komnene Angelina:

      - She was a Byzantine princess who lived in the late 12th/early 13th century

      - She was born around 1185 and died around 1224


      3. Comparing their lifespans:

      - Grimoald III lived in the late 8th/early 9th century (around 788-806 AD)

      - Theodora Komnene Angelina lived from around 1185-1224 AD

      - This means Theodora lived several centuries after Grimoald


      4. Conclusion:

      Since Theodora lived much later than Grimoald, she would have lived longer chronologically.

      1. First, I''ll need to identify who Empress Zhou and Jean Flandrin were.


      2. Empress Zhou was a historical figure from ancient China, likely from an imperial
      dynasty.


      3. Jean Flandrin sounds like a French name, potentially from a more recent historical
      period.


      4. Without specific dates of birth and death for these individuals, I cannot

      5. However, given the vast difference in historical periods (ancient China vs.
      likely modern/recent France), it seems unlikely that Empress Zhou lived longer
      than Jean Flandrin.


      6. But without concrete biographical information, I cannot be 100% certain.

      YES or NO answer. More research would be needed to accurately compare their

      1. First, I''ll need to determine the lifespans of both Empress Zhang and Patriarch
      Michael II of Antioch.


      2. Empress Zhang was a Chinese empress during the Han Dynasty, specifically
      the wife of Emperor Yuan of Han. She lived from approximately 190 BC to 178
      BC.


      3. Patriarch Michael II of Antioch was a Christian religious leader who lived
      in the 9th century AD, specifically around 858-870 AD.


      4. Empress Zhang lived from approximately 190 BC to 178 BC, which means she
      lived for about 12 years.


      5. Patriarch Michael II of Antioch lived from around 858 to 870 AD, which means
      he lived for about 12 years as well.


      6. However, the key difference is their time periods: Empress Zhang lived in
      the 2nd century BC, while Patriarch Michael II lived in the 9th century AD.


      7. Comparing their lifespans directly, they both lived for about 12 years.


      8. But since Patriarch Michael II lived much later in history, he would have
      been older in absolute years.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO, Empress Zhang did not live longer than Patriarch
      Michael II of Antioch.'
