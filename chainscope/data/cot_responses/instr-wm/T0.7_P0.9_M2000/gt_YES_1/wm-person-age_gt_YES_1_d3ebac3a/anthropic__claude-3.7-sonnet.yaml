      Step 1: Identify when Anastasia of Sirmium lived.

      Anastasia of Sirmium was a Christian martyr who lived during the late 3rd to
      early 4th century. She was martyred around 304 CE during the Diocletian persecution
      of Christians.


      Step 2: Determine Anastasia''s approximate lifespan.

      While her exact birth date is unknown, she likely lived for about 20-40 years,
      dying around 304 CE.


      Step 3: Identify when William II, Count of Chalon lived.

      William II, Count of Chalon was a medieval French nobleman who lived in the
      13th century. He became Count of Chalon in 1203 and died in 1248.


      Step 4: Determine William II''s approximate lifespan.

      William II lived for approximately 45-70 years, dying in 1248 CE.


      Step 5: Compare their lifespans.

      Even though we don''t have exact birth dates for either figure, William II lived
      in the 13th century (1200s), nearly a thousand years after Anastasia who lived
      in the early 4th century (300s). Based on typical lifespans of their respective
      eras, William II almost certainly lived longer than Anastasia, who died as a
      martyr, likely at a relatively young age.


      NO, Anastasia of Sirmium did not live longer than William II, Count of Chalon.'
    26515213-8026-43e4-91b7-e534770df413: 'I''ll solve this step by step to determine
      who lived longer.


      Step 1: Identify when Anastasia of Sirmium lived.

      Anastasia of Sirmium was a Christian martyr who died around 304 CE during the
      Diocletianic Persecution. While her exact birth date is not well-documented,
      she was an adult at the time of her martyrdom. Based on historical accounts,
      she likely lived for approximately 20-40 years.


      Step 2: Identify when William II, Count of Chalon lived.

      William II of Chalon was a medieval nobleman who lived in the 13th century.
      He became Count of Chalon in 1203 and died in 1245. This means he lived for
      approximately 42+ years (assuming he was at least 18 when he became count, though
      he could have been older).


      Step 3: Compare their lifespans.

      Anastasia of Sirmium: Lived approximately 20-40 years, ending in 304 CE

      William II of Chalon: Lived approximately 42+ years in the 13th century


      Even with some uncertainty about their exact ages, William II almost certainly
      lived longer than Anastasia, who was martyred (likely at a younger age than
      William''s natural death).


      NO, Anastasia of Sirmium did not live longer than William II, Count of Chalon.'
    3658b5c0-cc6a-48d6-86f9-39e84560c801: 'I''ll solve this step by step to determine
      who lived longer.


      Step 1: Identify when Anastasia of Sirmium lived.

      Anastasia of Sirmium was a Christian martyr who died around 304 CE during the
      Diocletianic Persecution. While her birth date isn''t precisely known, she was
      an adult at the time of her martyrdom.


      Step 2: Identify when William II, Count of Chalon lived.

      William II, Count of Chalon lived in the 13th century. He became Count of Chalon
      in 1203 and died in 1245.


      Step 3: Calculate approximate lifespans.

      For Anastasia, we don''t have exact birth information, but as a martyr during
      Roman times, she likely lived somewhere between 20-40 years (just an estimate
      based on typical lifespans of that era).


      For William II, we know he died in 1245. If he became Count in 1203, he was
      likely at least in his teens or twenties then. This suggests he lived approximately
      60+ years, dying at a more advanced age.


      Step 4: Compare the lifespans.

      Even with limited information about Anastasia''s exact age, historical context
      suggests William II almost certainly lived longer. He lived during a later historical
      period with somewhat better living conditions, and the evidence points to him
      having a longer life than Anastasia, who died as a martyr in her adult years.


      NO, Anastasia of Sirmium did not live longer than William II, Count of Chalon.'
    69ce5ac2-7d50-4615-ba7a-9391ce2462b7: 'I''ll solve this step by step to determine
      who lived longer.


      Step 1: Identify when Anastasia of Sirmium lived.

      Anastasia of Sirmium was a Christian saint and martyr who lived during the time
      of Diocletian''s persecutions. She was martyred around 304 CE during the Great
      Persecution. Her birth date isn''t precisely known, but she would have been
      an adult by the time of her death.


      Step 2: Identify when William II, Count of Chalon lived.

      William II of Chalon was a medieval nobleman who lived in the 13th century.
      He became Count of Chalon in 1203 and died in 1245.


      Step 3: Calculate approximate lifespans.

      - Anastasia: Even if she lived to be 30-40 years old before her martyrdom (which
      would be a reasonable estimate), she would have been born around 264-274 CE
      and died around 304 CE. This gives her a maximum estimated lifespan of about
      30-40 years.

      - William II: He lived from approximately the late 12th century until 1245.
      If he became count in 1203 as an adult (at least 20 years old), he would have
      been born around 1183 or earlier. This would give him a lifespan of at least
      62 years (1183-1245).


      Step 4: Compare the lifespans.

      Based on historical records, William II of Chalon almost certainly lived longer
      than Anastasia of Sirmium. William likely lived at least 60+ years, while Anastasia
      probably lived no more than 40 years before her martyrdom.


      NO, Anastasia of Sirmium did not live longer than William II, Count of Chalon.'

      Anastasia of Sirmium was a Christian saint and martyr who lived during the time
      of Diocletian''s persecutions. She was martyred around 304 CE during the Great
      Persecution. Her birth date isn''t precisely known, but she likely lived in

      He became Count of Chalon around 1203 and died in 1248.


      Step 3: Compare their lifespans.

      Since we don''t have exact birth dates for either figure, I''ll focus on when
      they lived:

      - Anastasia lived in the late 3rd/early 4th century and died around 304 CE

      - William II lived in the 13th century (1200s) and died in 1248


      Step 4: Determine their approximate age at death.

      - For Anastasia, historical accounts suggest she was a young woman when martyred,
      possibly in her 20s or 30s

      - William II likely lived a more typical medieval nobleman''s lifespan, probably
      reaching his 50s or 60s


      NO - Anastasia of Sirmium did not live longer than William II, Count of Chalon.
      William II almost certainly lived to an older age than Anastasia, who was martyred

      Anastasia of Sirmium and William II, Count of Chalon, and then compare them.


      Step 1: Identify when Anastasia of Sirmium lived.

      Anastasia of Sirmium was an early Christian martyr who died around 304 CE during
      the Diocletianic Persecution. While her exact birth date is not well-documented,
      she was an adult at the time of her martyrdom. Even if she lived a relatively
      short life of perhaps 20-30 years, she would have been born in the late 3rd
      century CE.


      Step 2: Identify when William II, Count of Chalon lived.

      William II, Count of Chalon lived in the medieval period, specifically in the
      13th century. He became Count of Chalon around 1227 and died in 1248 CE. He
      was likely born in the late 12th or early 13th century.


      Step 3: Compare their lifespans.

      Even without knowing their exact ages at death, we can determine that they lived
      approximately 900 years apart. The question is about which one lived longer
      (age at death), not who lived more recently.


      For Anastasia, we don''t have precise birth information, but even if she lived
      to be quite old for her time (say 50-60 years), she still died around 304 CE.


      For William II, we also don''t have a precise birth year, but medieval nobility
      of his era typically lived between 40-60 years when they didn''t die in battle
      or from disease earlier.


      Since we don''t have enough information about their exact lifespans in years,
      I cannot definitively determine who lived longer in terms of age at death.

      Anastasia of Sirmium was a Christian martyr who lived during the time of Diocletian''s
      persecutions. She died around 304 CE during the Great Persecution. She was likely
      born in the latter half of the 3rd century, perhaps around 270-280 CE, though
      exact birth dates for saints of this period are often uncertain.


      Step 2: Identify when William II, Count of Chalon lived.

      William II of Chalon was a medieval French nobleman who lived in the 12th-13th
      centuries. He became Count of Chalon in 1203 and died in 1227 or 1228 CE. He
      was likely born in the latter half of the 12th century, perhaps around 1170-1180.

      Step 2: Identify when William II, Count of Chalon lived.

      William II, Count of Chalon lived in medieval France, dying around 1227-1231
      CE. He likely was born in the late 12th century, perhaps around 1170-1180.


      Step 3: Calculate approximate lifespans.

      - Anastasia: If born around 270-280 CE and died in 304 CE, she lived approximately
      24-34 years.

      - William II: If born around 1170-1180 CE and died around 1227-1231 CE, he lived
      approximately 47-61 years.


      Step 4: Compare the lifespans.

      Based on historical records, William II of Chalon appears to have lived significantly
      longer than Anastasia of Sirmium. Even with some uncertainty in exact dates,
      the medieval nobleman likely lived into his 50s or 60s, while Anastasia was
      martyred as a relatively young woman.


      NO, Anastasia of Sirmium did not live longer than William II, Count of Chalon.'
    f7e2d358-eebd-40ce-8fcd-62ccc6393a7f: 'I''ll solve this step by step to determine
      who lived longer.


      Step 1: Identify when Anastasia of Sirmium lived.

      Anastasia of Sirmium was a Christian martyr who died around 304 CE during the
      Diocletianic Persecution. While her exact birth date is not well-documented,
      she was an adult at the time of her martyrdom. She likely lived for approximately
      20-40 years, with her life spanning the late 3rd century to 304 CE.


      Step 2: Identify when William II, Count of Chalon lived.

      William II, Count of Chalon, was a medieval nobleman who lived in the 13th century.
      He was born around 1190 and died in 1247. This means he lived approximately
      57 years.


      Step 3: Compare their lifespans.

      Anastasia of Sirmium: Lived approximately 20-40 years, ending in 304 CE

      William II, Count of Chalon: Lived approximately 57 years (1190-1247)


      Step 4: Determine who lived longer.

      Based on the available historical information, William II, Count of Chalon lived
      longer (approximately 57 years) than Anastasia of Sirmium (approximately 20-40
      years).


      NO, Anastasia of Sirmium did not live longer than William II, Count of Chalon.'
    ff6ca0e9-a492-4a1f-a640-b824472e4ab4: 'I need to determine the lifespans of both
      Anastasia of Sirmium and William II, Count of Chalon, and then compare them.


      Step 1: Identify when Anastasia of Sirmium lived.

      Anastasia of Sirmium was an early Christian martyr who died around 304 CE during
      the Diocletianic Persecution. While her exact birth date is not well-documented,
      she was an adult at the time of her martyrdom. Even if she lived a relatively
      short life of perhaps 20-30 years, she would have been born in the late 3rd
      century CE.


      Step 2: Identify when William II, Count of Chalon lived.

      William II, Count of Chalon lived in medieval France, specifically in the 13th
      century. He became Count of Chalon in 1203 and died in 1245 CE. He would have
      been born in the late 12th century, likely around 1170-1180.


      Step 3: Compare their lifespans.

      For Anastasia: Born late 3rd century, died around 304 CE

      For William II: Born late 12th century, died in 1245 CE


      William II lived during the High Middle Ages, nearly 900 years after Anastasia.
      The question isn''t about who lived longer ago, but rather whose lifespan was
      longer.


      While we don''t have exact ages for either, William II likely ruled for over
      40 years (1203-1245), suggesting he lived at least into his 60s or 70s. Anastasia,
      as a Christian martyr during Roman persecutions, likely died relatively young,
      possibly in her 20s or 30s.


      NO, Anastasia of Sirmium did not live longer than William II, Count of Chalon.'

      owicz was a Polish philosopher and physician who lived from approximately 1510\

      \ novel \"Water Margin\" (also known as \"Outlaws of the Marsh\"), which was\

      Since Song Niang is primarily a fictional character without verified historical\
      \ birth and death dates, a direct comparison of actual lifespans isn't possible\

      - Grimoald III: ~806 - ~760 = approximately 46 years

      - Theodora Komnene: ~1230 - ~1180 = approximately 50 years

      Grimoald III was a Lombard prince who ruled Benevento. Based on historical records,
      he was born around 773 AD and died in 806 AD. This means he lived approximately
      33 years.


      Step 2: Identify when Theodora Komnene Angelina lived.

      Theodora Komnene Angelina was a Byzantine noblewoman of the Komnenos and Angelos
      dynasties. She was born around 1096 AD and died after 1126 AD, with some sources
      suggesting she may have lived until approximately 1140 AD. Even taking the earlier
      date, she lived at least 30 years, and possibly up to about 44 years.


      Step 3: Compare their lifespans.

      If Theodora lived until around 1140 AD, she would have lived approximately 44
      years, which is longer than Grimoald III''s 33 years.

      Even if she died closer to 1126 AD, she would have lived about 30 years, which
      is still comparable to Grimoald''s lifespan.

      ibn Hasan and Xiao Daxin to compare who lived longer.


      Step 1: Identify Abdullah ibn Hasan.

      There are several historical figures with this name, but the most prominent
      was Abdullah ibn Hasan ibn Ali, a descendant of Prophet Muhammad who lived in
      the 8th century CE. He was born around 700 CE and died around 763 CE, living
      approximately 63 years.


      Step 2: Identify Xiao Daxin.

      Xiao Daxin was a Chinese official and scholar during the Qing dynasty. He lived
      from 1712 to 1802 CE, making him about 90 years old at death.


      Step 3: Compare their lifespans.

      Abdullah ibn Hasan: ~63 years

      Xiao Daxin: ~90 years


      Since Xiao Daxin lived approximately 90 years while Abdullah ibn Hasan lived
      approximately 63 years, Xiao Daxin lived longer.


      NO, Abdullah ibn Hasan did not live longer than Xiao Daxin.'

      determine if Abdullah ibn Hasan lived longer than Xiao Daxin.


      Step 1: Identify who Abdullah ibn Hasan was and when he lived.

      Abdullah ibn Hasan (also known as Abdullah al-Mahd) was an important Alid figure
      in early Islamic history. He lived approximately from 718 to 763 CE. This gives
      him a lifespan of about 45 years.


      Step 2: Identify who Xiao Daxin was and when he lived.

      Xiao Daxin was a Chinese official during the Qing dynasty. He lived from 1732
      to 1802 CE. This gives him a lifespan of about 70 years.


      Step 3: Compare their lifespans.

      Abdullah ibn Hasan: ~45 years

      Xiao Daxin: ~70 years


      Since 45 years is less than 70 years, Abdullah ibn Hasan did not live longer
      than Xiao Daxin.

      it would be extremely unusual for anyone in 9th century China to live longer
      than 115 years, which would be Jean Flandrin''s approximate age if the historical
      records are accurate.


      Based on historical life expectancies and the available information, I cannot
      definitively determine who lived longer. The historical record for Jean Flandrin
      suggests an unusually long life, which may indicate some historical inaccuracy
      in the recorded dates.


      NO - I cannot confidently state that Empress Zhou lived longer than Jean Flandrin
      based on available historical information.'
    e2fd0460-205e-4a6c-98c4-9c3c300f7d81: 'I need to determine the lifespans of Empress
      Zhou and Jean Flandrin to compare them.


      Step 1: Identify who Empress Zhou was and when she lived.

      Empress Zhou likely refers to Empress Wu Zetian (also known as Wu Zhao), the
      only woman to rule China as an emperor in her own right. She lived from 624
      CE to 705 CE, making her 81 years old at death.


      Step 2: Identify who Jean Flandrin was and when he lived.

      Jean Flandrin was a French cardinal and papal diplomat who lived in the 14th
      century. He was born around 1300 and died in 1415, making him approximately
      115 years old at death.


      Wait - this seems incorrect. Let me verify Jean Flandrin''s dates. Historical
      records indicate he died in 1415, but was likely born in the mid-to-late 1300s,
      not 1300. In fact, most sources suggest he died in either 1415 or 1430, and
      was likely born around 1350-1360, which would make him about 65-80 years old
      at death.


      Step 3: Compare the lifespans.

      Empress Wu Zetian lived to be 81 years old.

      Jean Flandrin lived to be approximately 65-80 years old.


      Based on the best historical information available, Empress Wu Zetian (Empress
      Zhou) appears to have lived slightly longer than Jean Flandrin.

      determine who lived longer.


      Step 1: Let me identify who Jean Flandrin was and when he lived.

      Jean Flandrin was a French cardinal and canonist who lived from approximately
      1301 to 1415. He served as Archbishop of Auch and was made cardinal by Antipope
      Clement VII.


      Step 2: Let me identify who Richard Turstin was and when he lived.

      Richard Turstin (also spelled Thurstan or Turstan) was a Norman nobleman who
      lived in the 11th century. He was a companion of William the Conqueror and participated
      in the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Based on available historical records,
      he likely lived from approximately 1030 to 1086.


      Step 3: Calculate and compare their lifespans.

      Jean Flandrin: ~1301 to ~1415 = approximately 114 years (though this seems unusually
      long for medieval times, suggesting possible error in records)

      Richard Turstin: ~1030 to ~1086 = approximately 56 years


      Step 4: Compare the lengths of their lives.

      Even accounting for potential inaccuracies in the precise dates, Jean Flandrin
      appears to have lived significantly longer than Richard Turstin.


      NO


      Wait - I need to verify my information. Upon further consideration, Jean Flandrin
      likely died around 1415, but was probably born closer to 1350, not 1301. Even
      with this correction, he would have lived approximately 65 years compared to
      Richard Turstin''s approximately 56 years.

      Step 3: Since I don''t have reliable information about Richard Turstin''s lifespan,
      I cannot make a valid comparison between the two lifespans.


      I cannot provide a YES or NO answer to this question because I don''t have sufficient
      information about Richard Turstin''s lifespan to make the comparison. To answer
      this question accurately, I would need reliable birth and death dates for both

      Step 1: Let me recall information about Jean Flandrin.

      Jean Flandrin was a French cardinal and canonist who lived in the late 14th
      to early 15th century. He was born around 1301 and died in 1415. This gives
      him a lifespan of approximately 114 years.


      Step 2: Let me recall information about Richard Turstin.

      Richard Turstin (also sometimes known as Richard Thurstan or Toustain) was a
      Norman knight who participated in the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. While
      his exact birth and death dates are not as well-documented, he was an adult
      during the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Even if he lived to an advanced age for
      his time, he would have likely died by the early 12th century, perhaps around
      1100-1120.


      Step 3: Compare the lifespans.

      Jean Flandrin (c. 1301-1415): ~114 years

      Richard Turstin (lived during 11th century): Even with a generous estimate,
      he would have lived at most 70-80 years, which was extremely rare for that period.


      NO. Richard Turstin did not live as long as Jean Flandrin. Jean Flandrin appears
      to have lived longer.'

      Step 3: Compare their lifespans.

      Even with some uncertainty about exact dates, the historical periods they lived
      in are clear. Jean Flandrin lived in the 14th-15th centuries, while Richard
      Turstin lived in the 11th century. Their lives did not overlap chronologically.


      Step 4: Determine who lived longer.

      Based on the available historical information, Jean Flandrin lived to approximately
      114 years old, which would be an exceptionally long life for his era. Richard
      Turstin''s exact lifespan is not well documented, but it''s highly unlikely

      Step 3: Compare their lifespans.

      Jean Flandrin: ~114 years (1301-1415)

      Richard Turstin: ~55 years (1040-1095)


      Step 4: Determine who lived longer.

      Jean Flandrin''s lifespan of approximately 114 years is significantly longer
      than Richard Turstin''s lifespan of approximately 55 years.


      NO


      Wait, I need to correct myself. After reviewing historical records more carefully,
      I realize I made an error in my initial assessment. Jean Flandrin was a French
      cardinal who died in 1415, but he was not born in 1301. More accurate records
      indicate he was born around 1350 and died in 1415, giving him a lifespan of
      about 65 years. This is still longer than Richard Turstin''s approximately 55
      years.


      YES'
    e65bf593-e4d1-450d-8e14-14d18d4a9d9b: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: I need to identify who Jean Flandrin and Richard Turstin were and when
      they lived.


      Jean Flandrin was a French cardinal and canonist who lived from around 1301
      to 1415. He served as Archbishop of Auch and was created Cardinal by Antipope
      Clement VII.


      Richard Turstin (also spelled Thurstan or Turstan) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman
      who lived in the 11th century, around the time of the Norman Conquest of England
      (1066). The specific dates of his birth and death are not well-documented, but
      he would have lived approximately between 1020-1090.


      Step 2: Calculate their approximate lifespans.

      - Jean Flandrin: ~1301 to ~1415 = approximately 114 years

      - Richard Turstin: ~1020 to ~1090 = approximately 70 years


      Step 3: Compare the lifespans.

      Jean Flandrin''s lifespan of 114 years is longer than Richard Turstin''s lifespan
      of 70 years.


      However, I should note that a lifespan of 114 years would be extraordinarily
      unusual for someone in the 14th-15th centuries. This suggests there might be
      some historical uncertainty about these dates.


      Nevertheless, based on the information available, Jean Flandrin appears to have
      lived longer than Richard Turstin.


      YES'
    f33574ca-2b20-461b-8746-4e6bda99a6c2: 'I need to determine the lifespans of Jean
      Flandrin and Richard Turstin to compare who lived longer.


      Step 1: Let me identify who Jean Flandrin was and when he lived.

      Jean Flandrin was a French cardinal and canonist who lived from around 1301
      to 1415. He served as Archbishop of Auch and was made a cardinal by Antipope
      Benedict XIII.


      Step 2: Let me identify who Richard Turstin was and when he lived.

      Richard Turstin (also spelled Thurstan or Turstan) was a Norman nobleman who
      lived in the 11th century. He was likely born around 1025 and died around 1086.


      Step 3: Calculate and compare their lifespans.

      Jean Flandrin: ~1301 to 1415 = approximately 114 years (which seems unusually
      long, so there may be some historical uncertainty about these dates)

      Richard Turstin: ~1025 to 1086 = approximately 61 years


      Step 4: Compare the two lifespans.

      Even accounting for potential inaccuracies in the historical record, Jean Flandrin
      appears to have lived significantly longer than Richard Turstin.


      YES, Jean Flandrin lived longer than Richard Turstin.'

      Zhang and Patriarch Michael II of Antioch to compare them.


      Step 1: Identify which Empress Zhang we''re referring to.

      There were multiple Empress Zhangs in Chinese history. The most notable was
      Empress Zhang (died 237 CE), who was the empress consort of Emperor Ming of
      Wei during China''s Three Kingdoms period. She died in 237 CE.


      Step 2: Identify Patriarch Michael II of Antioch.

      Michael II was the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch from 1395 to 1404 CE.
      He lived in the late 14th and early 15th centuries.


      Step 3: Compare their lifespans.

      While I don''t have the exact birth year for either figure, I can determine
      that Patriarch Michael II lived approximately 1,100+ years after Empress Zhang.
      Given that Michael II was active until at least 1404 CE, and Empress Zhang died
      in 237 CE, it''s clear that Michael II lived in a much later historical period.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion about longevity.

      Without exact birth dates, I cannot precisely compare their individual lifespans
      (i.e., how many years each lived). However, if the question is asking which
      historical figure lived in a later time period, then Patriarch Michael II of
      Antioch definitely lived later in history than Empress Zhang.


      Since the question appears to be asking about individual longevity (who lived
      longer in terms of age), and I don''t have complete birth and death information
      for both individuals, I cannot give a definitive answer.


      NO, I cannot determine with certainty whether Empress Zhang lived longer than
      Patriarch Michael II of Antioch based on available historical information about
      their individual lifespans.'

    d91c7820-6d07-488a-9394-5d4c7a8b5036: 'I need to determine the lifespans of Empress
      Zhang and Patriarch Michael II of Antioch to compare them.


      Step 1: Identify which Empress Zhang we''re referring to.

      There were multiple Empress Zhangs in Chinese history. The most notable was
      Empress Zhang (969-1033), wife of Emperor Zhenzong of the Song Dynasty. She
      lived for 64 years.


      Step 2: Identify Patriarch Michael II of Antioch.

      Michael II was Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch from 1170 to 1199. Based
      on historical records, he was likely born around 1130-1140 and died in 1199.
      This would give him a lifespan of approximately 60-70 years.


      Step 3: Compare the lifespans.

      Empress Zhang lived for 64 years (969-1033).

      Patriarch Michael II lived approximately 60-70 years (c.1130-1199).


      Since there is some uncertainty about Michael II''s exact age, I cannot make
      a definitive comparison. If he lived more than 64 years, then no, Empress Zhang
      did not live longer. If he lived less than 64 years, then yes, she did live
      longer.


      Given the historical uncertainty and the similar estimated lifespans, I cannot
      provide a clear YES or NO answer with confidence.'

      and theologian who lived in the 12th century. He died around 1185. Like Michael
      II, his exact birth date is not well documented, but he was active as a scholar
      in the mid-12th century.


      Step 3: Compare their lifespans.

      Since Michael II remained Patriarch until 1199, while Gandolfo Sacchi died around
      1185, it appears that Michael II lived at least 14 years longer than Sacchi.
      Even without knowing their exact birth dates, the fact that Michael II was still
      alive and serving as Patriarch in 1199, well after Sacchi''s death in 1185,
      indicates he lived longer.


      NO, Gandolfo Sacchi did not live longer than Patriarch Michael II of Antioch.
      Based on available historical information, Michael II lived longer.'

      Step 1: Find information about Patriarch Michael II of Antioch.

      Patriarch Michael II of Antioch was a Greek Orthodox Patriarch who served as
      Patriarch of Antioch from 1170 to 1182. Based on available historical records,
      he died in 1182, but his birth date isn''t precisely documented.


      Step 2: Find information about Gandolfo Sacchi.

      Gandolfo Sacchi (also known as Gandulphus of Sicily) was a Franciscan theologian
      who lived in the 13th century. He was born around 1240 and died around 1310,
      giving him a lifespan of approximately 70 years.


      Step 3: Compare their lifespans.

      While we don''t have exact birth dates for Michael II, we know he died in 1182,
      which is before Gandolfo Sacchi was even born (around 1240). Since Sacchi lived
      until approximately 1310, he lived entirely after Michael II''s lifetime.


      Step 4: Determine who lived longer.

      Gandolfo Sacchi lived approximately 70 years (from ~1240 to ~1310). For Michael
      II, even if he became Patriarch at a young age (say 30), he would have been
      born around 1140 and died in 1182, giving him a lifespan of about 42 years.

      Step 1: Let me identify when Patriarch Michael II of Antioch lived.

      Patriarch Michael II of Antioch was a Syriac Orthodox Patriarch who lived in
      the 12th century. He served as Patriarch of Antioch from approximately 1166
      to 1199. This suggests he lived for at least 33 years during his patriarchate,
      but I would need his birth and death dates for a complete lifespan.


      Step 2: Let me identify when Gandolfo Sacchi lived.

      Gandolfo Sacchi (also known as Gandulfus of Bologna) was a medieval Italian
      canonist and theologian who lived in the 12th century. He was active around
      1150-1170. However, I don''t have precise birth and death dates for him either.


      Step 3: Compare what information I have.

      I have incomplete information for both figures. For Michael II, I know his patriarchate
      lasted about 33 years, but not his total lifespan. For Gandolfo Sacchi, I have
      even less precise information, just an approximate period when he was active.


      Given the limited historical information available to me, I cannot make a definitive
      comparison of their lifespans. I don''t have enough data to determine who lived
      longer.

      Patriarch Michael II was the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch in the late
      11th century. He served as Patriarch from approximately 1170 to 1182. While
      I don''t have his exact birth and death dates, he was an adult church leader
      in the late 12th century.


      Step 2: Let me identify when Gandolfo Sacchi lived.

      Gandolfo Sacchi (also known as Gandulfus of Bologna) was an Italian canon lawyer
      and theologian who lived in the 12th century. He was active around 1150-1170

      Michael II was Patriarch of Antioch from 1170 to 1199. This gives us a partial
      lifespan, but at minimum he was alive for these 29 years.


      Step 2: Identify when Gandolfo Sacchi lived.

      Gandolfo Sacchi (also known as Gandulphus of Sicily) was a Franciscan theologian
      who lived in the 13th century. Records indicate he was born around 1190 and
      died around 1260, giving him approximately a 70-year lifespan.


      Step 3: Compare the lifespans.

      - Michael II: We know he was Patriarch until 1199, but we don''t have his complete
      birth and death dates. Even if he became Patriarch at a young age (which is
      unlikely as religious leaders typically reached such positions at mature ages),
