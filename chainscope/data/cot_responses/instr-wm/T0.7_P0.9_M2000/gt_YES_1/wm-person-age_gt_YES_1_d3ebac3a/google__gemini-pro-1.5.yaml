      the Patriarch of the Syriac Orthodox Church from 1166 to 1199 AD.

      \ is better known as Rav, a prominent Babylonian amora (sage) of the Talmud.\
      \ He lived approximately from 175 CE to 247 CE.\n\n2. **Identify Guo Dan:**\
      \ Guo Dan (\u90ED\u4E39) is a less common romanization.  A more likely and well-known\
      \ figure with a similar name is Guo Dian (\u90ED\u5E97), associated with the\
      \ Guodian Chu Slips, philosophical texts dating back to the Warring States period\
      \ in China.  He is not the author, but the presumed tomb owner where the slips\
      \ were found. He is believed to have lived around 300 BCE.\n\n3. **Compare their\
      \ lifespans:** Rav (Abba Arika) lived from approximately 175 CE to 247 CE. Guo\
      \ Dian lived around 300 BCE.\n\n4. **Determine who lived longer:**  Since Guo\
      \ Dian lived *before* the Common Era and Rav lived *after* the Common Era, Rav\
      \ lived many centuries after Guo Dian.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **YES**.\n"
