      **Step 2: Determine who Hugh the Great was and when he lived.**  \nHugh the\
      \ Great (c.898 \u2013 956) was a powerful Frankish nobleman, the father of Hugh\

      \ age at death.**  \nIf Jacques Perret died around 1610 and was active around\
      \ 1600, he likely was born between 1550\u20131570 (to be an active architect/engineer\

      - His exact birth and death dates are not well documented, but he is known to
      have published work in 1601. Based on this, historians generally place his life
      roughly in the latter half of the 16th century, possibly dying in the early

      - Hugh the Great was born in 898 and died in 956.

      the age at death of both Bella degli Abati and Aaron of Lincoln, and then compare
      them.


      Step 1: Identify who Bella degli Abati was and her lifespan.


      Bella degli Abati was the mother of Saint Clare of Assisi. Historical records
      about her specific birth and death dates are scarce. However, she is believed
      to have died around 1212 or shortly thereafter, during the early 13th century.


      Since we lack an exact birth date, her age at death is not definitively recorded.
      However, Saint Clare was born in 1194, and Bella was her mother. Assuming Bella
      was about 20 years old when she gave birth to Clare (a reasonable estimate for
      the era), Bella would have been born around 1174. If she died around 1212, she
      would have been approximately 38 years old at death.


      Step 2: Identify who Aaron of Lincoln was and his lifespan.


      Aaron of Lincoln was a wealthy Jewish financier in medieval England. He died
      in 1186. His birth date is not precisely recorded, but estimates suggest he
      was born around 1125. That would make him about 61 years old at death.

      - Bella degli Abati: approximately 38 years old at death.

      - Aaron of Lincoln: approximately 61 years old at death.

      the ages at death of both Carlo Lizzani and Amatus of Montecassino, then compare
      them.


      **Step 1: Determine Carlo Lizzani''s age at death**


      - Carlo Lizzani was born on April 3, 1922.

      - He died on October 5, 2013.


      From April 3, 1922, to April 3, 2013, is exactly 91 years.

      From April 3, 2013, to October 5, 2013, is 6 months and 2 days.


      So, Carlo Lizzani was 91 years old at the time of his death.


      **Step 2: Determine Amatus of Montecassino''s age at death**


      - Amatus of Montecassino was a medieval monk and chronicler. His exact birth
      and death dates are not definitively known, but historians generally place his
      life in the 11th century.

      - He was active during the 11th century, and his chronicle ends around 1077.
      Some estimates suggest he died shortly after that.

      - There is no solid evidence indicating he lived to an old age; typical life
      expectancy in the 11th century was much lower, and monks might live somewhat
      longer than average, but still unlikely to reach 91.


      Given that, it''s very unlikely that Amatus of Montecassino lived to be 91 years
      old.


      **Conclusion:**


      Carlo Lizzani was likely older at the time of his death than Amatus of Montecassino.

      need to determine the age at death of both individuals.


      **Step 1: Determine Carlo Lizzani''s age at death.**

      - Carlo Lizzani was born in 1922 and died in 2013.

      - 2013 - 1922 = 91

      - So, Carlo Lizzani was 91 years old at the time of his death.

      - Amatus of Montecassino was a medieval monk and chronicler who was active in
      the 11th century.

      - Exact birth and death dates are not definitively known, but historical consensus
      estimates he was born around 1000 and died around 1090.

      - 1090 - 1000 = approximately 90 years old.


      However, it''s important to note that these dates are approximate and not confirmed.
      Still, based on the best available estimates:

      - Amatus lived approximately 90 years.

      - Carlo Lizzani lived 91 years.

      - Carlo Lizzani: 91

      - Amatus of Montecassino: ~90

      compare them.


      **Step 1: Determine Charlotte, Princess Royal''s age at death.**

      - Charlotte, Princess Royal was born on September 29, 1766.

      - She died on October 5, 1828.


      To calculate her age at death:

      - From September 29, 1766 to September 29, 1828 is exactly 62 years.

      - She died on October 5, 1828, which is 6 days after her 62nd birthday.


      So, Charlotte, Princess Royal was 62 years old at the time of her death.


      **Step 2: Determine Robert Dowland''s age at death.**

      - Robert Dowland was born in 1591.

      - He died in 1641.


      Assuming he died sometime in 1641, and without an exact birth and death date,
      we estimate his age:

      - 1641 - 1591 = 50 years old (approximate age at death).


      So Robert Dowland was about 50 years old when he died.


      **Step 3: Compare their ages.**

      - Charlotte, Princess Royal: 62 years old.

      at death.

      - Henry II, Lord of Mecklenburg was a German nobleman.

      - His lifespan was from around 1267 to 1329.

      - Age at death: 1329 - 1267 = 62 years old.


      Step 3: Compare the ages at death.

      - Zhang Zhao: 80 years old.

      - Henry II: 62 years old.


      Step 4: Determine whether Zhang Zhao was younger at the time of death than Henry
      II.

      - 80 (Zhang Zhao) is greater than 62 (Henry II), so Zhang Zhao was older.

      \ 1: Identify who Vanni Fucci and Uc Brunet were.**\n\n- **Vanni Fucci** was\
      \ a historical figure from Pistoia, Italy, who appears in Dante Alighieri\u2019\
      s *Divine Comedy* (specifically in *Inferno*, Canto 24 and 25). He was a thief\
      \ who reportedly died before Dante wrote the *Divine Comedy* (early 14th century).\
      \ Not much is known about the exact dates of his birth or death.\n\n- **Uc Brunet\

      \ are approximate, as with many medieval figures.\n\n**Step 2: Estimate their\
      \ ages at death.**\n\n- For **Uc Brunet**, if he was born circa 1210 and died\
      \ circa 1250, he would have lived approximately 40 years.\n\n- For **Vanni Fucci**,\
      \ there is no exact date of birth or death, but historical and literary scholars\
      \ assume that he lived in the late 13th century and died before 1300 (since\
      \ Dante refers to him as already damned in the *Inferno*, written around 1308\u2013\
      1320). There is no specific record of his age at death.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze\
      \ the data.**\n\n- Since we have an approximate age for Uc Brunet (40 years),\

      \ Fucci** is a character from Dante Alighieri\u2019s *Divine Comedy*, specifically\

      \ from the Occitan region (modern-day southern France). He was active in the\
      \ 12th century.\n\n**Step 2: Approximate dates of death**\n\n- **Vanni Fucci**:\
      \ Died sometime after 1290, possibly in his 30s or 40s at most. There is no\
      \ exact birth or death date, but his criminal activity occurred in the late\

      \ no exact birth or death dates are recorded, but troubadours typically lived\
      \ into their 50s or beyond unless they died young.\n\n**Step 3: Estimate ages\

      \ in the late 13th century, and assuming he was an adult during those acts (say,\
      \ at least 20\u201330 years old), he likely died in his 30s or 40s.\n\n- **Uc\

      \ the ages at which both Vanni Fucci and Uc Brunet died, and then compare them.\n\
      \n**Step 1: Who were Vanni Fucci and Uc Brunet?**\n\n- **Vanni Fucci**: He is\
      \ a character mentioned in Dante Alighieri's \"Inferno\", part of the Divine\
      \ Comedy. He was a real historical figure\u2014a thief from Pistoia in Tuscany,\

      \ of Dante\u2019s work. Most of what is known comes from literature, not verified\
      \ historical records. There are no reliable records of his birth or death dates.\n\
      \n- **Uc Brunet** (also known as Uc Brunenc or Uc Brunet de Saint Circ): He\
      \ was a troubadour from the 12th to 13th century. He is believed to have been\
      \ born around 1210 and died around 1250, making him approximately 40 years old\
      \ at death.\n\n**Step 2: Estimate ages at death**\n\n- **Vanni Fucci**: Since\
      \ there are no exact birth or death dates, we must rely on Dante\u2019s portrayal\
      \ in Inferno. Dante wrote the Inferno in the early 14th century, and he places\
      \ Vanni Fucci in Hell for crimes committed during his life. Fucci would have\
      \ lived before Dante\u2019s time, likely in the late 13th century. However,\
      \ there is no reliable indication of his age at death, so we cannot determine\
      \ this with certainty.\n\n- **Uc Brunet**: Based on estimates, he lived from\
      \ around 1210 to 1250, so he died at around age 40.\n\n**Step 3: Compare ages**\n\
      \n- Since Uc Brunet is estimated to have died at about 40 years old, and we\
      \ do not have a definite age for Vanni Fucci, we cannot conclusively say whether\
      \ Fucci was younger or older at death.\n\nHowever, some sources suggest Vanni\
      \ Fucci was a young man when he died, possibly executed for his crimes, but\
      \ again, it is speculative.\n\n**Conclusion**: Given that we have an estimated\
      \ age for Uc Brunet (~40), and no reliable age for Vanni Fucci, we cannot definitively\
      \ say he was younger.\n\n\u2705 Final Answer: **NO**."

      \ Fucci was younger at the time of death than Uc Brunet, we need to consider\
      \ the following:\n\n**Step 1: Identify who Vanni Fucci and Uc Brunet were.**\n\
      \n- **Vanni Fucci** is a character from Dante Alighieri's \"Divine Comedy,\"\
      \ specifically in the \"Inferno.\" He is portrayed as a thief who lived in Pistoia,\
      \ Italy, in the late 13th century. He is believed to have been a historical\

      \ since Dante wrote about him in the early 1300s, and he is described as already\
      \ dead at that time, we can infer he died before the early 14th century.\n\n\
      - **Uc Brunet** (also known as Uc de Saint Circ or Uc Brunenc) was a troubadour\
      \ from the 13th century. He was active in the early to mid-1200s. Based on historical\
      \ records, he is believed to have been born around 1210 and died around 1270,\
      \ making him approximately 60 years old at death.\n\n**Step 2: Estimate Vanni\
      \ Fucci\u2019s age at death.**\n\nSince there is limited historical data, we\
      \ can only estimate. Vanni Fucci was active in the late 13th century and likely\
      \ died before Dante completed the \"Inferno\" (~1308\u20131314). If we assume\
      \ he was born around 1250 and died around 1290 (a reasonable approximation),\
      \ he would have been around 40 years old at death.\n\n**Step 3: Compare their\
      \ ages at death.**\n\n- Uc Brunet: ~60 years old\n- Vanni Fucci: ~40 years old\

      \ at his time of death than Uc Brunet, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.\
      \ **Identify who Vanni Fucci and Uc Brunet were:**\n   - Vanni Fucci is a character\
      \ from Dante Alighieri\u2019s _Divine Comedy_, specifically _Inferno_, Canto\
      \ XXIV-XXV. He was a historical figure from Pistoia, Italy, and a thief who\
      \ lived in the late 13th century. However, precise birth and death dates are\
      \ not well-documented.\n   - Uc Brunet (also known as Uc Brunenc) was a troubadour\
      \ from Provence in the 12th century. Again, specific dates of birth and death\
      \ are not well established.\n\n2. **Estimate or determine approximate life spans:**\n\
      \   - For Vanni Fucci, since he appears in Dante\u2019s _Inferno_, which was\
      \ written in the early 14th century (completed around 1320), and Dante claimed\
      \ he was a contemporary or near-contemporary of Fucci, we can infer Vanni Fucci\
      \ lived in the late 13th century. Some scholars suggest he died around 1290\u2013\
      1300.\n   - For Uc Brunet, being a troubadour, he would have been active during\
      \ the height of troubadour poetry, roughly between 1150 and 1220. His lifespan\
      \ is estimated to fall within the mid-to-late 12th century.\n\n3. **Compare\
      \ ages at death:**\n   - The problem is that both figures have uncertain birth\
      \ and death dates, and neither has a clearly recorded age at death.\n   - However,\
      \ Uc Brunet was a poet with a known body of work, suggesting he lived at least\
      \ into adulthood, possibly middle age.\n   - Vanni Fucci was involved in theft\
      \ and political intrigue, which also suggests adulthood, but no evidence indicates\
      \ he lived to an old age.\n\n4. **Evaluate what is more likely:**\n   - There\
      \ is no definitive evidence of either man\u2019s exact age at death.\n   - However,\
      \ based on Dante's account in the _Inferno_, Vanni Fucci is portrayed as a relatively\
      \ young and violent man. Some interpretations suggest he died young due to his\
      \ criminal life.\n   - Uc Brunet, as a poet, likely had a longer career and\
      \ died older.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the circumstantial evidence and literary\
      \ portrayals, it is more likely Vanni Fucci died younger than Uc Brunet.\n\n\
