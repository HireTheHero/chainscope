      1. First, I''ll need to find out when James K. Gibson lived and died.

      2. Then I''ll need to find out when Jacopo Zucchi lived and died.

      3. Then I''ll compare their ages at death.


      However, after carefully checking my knowledge, I realize I do not confidently
      know the specific birth and death dates for either of these individuals. Without
      being certain of their lifespans, I cannot definitively answer whether one was
      younger than the other at death.


      Therefore, I cannot provide a YES or NO answer with confidence.'

      2. Then I''ll do the same for William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland.

      3. Then I''ll calculate their ages at death and compare.


      Checking my knowledge:

      - Cordelia Edvardson was a Swedish-Israeli author and journalist, born in 1929
      and died in 2011. So she lived to be 82 years old.

      - William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland was a British politician,

      Comparing their ages at death:

      - Edvardson: 82 years old

      - Cavendish-Bentinck: 71 years old


      Since 82 is greater than 71, Cordelia Edvardson was OLDER at her time of death

      1. First, I''ll need to find out who John of Ibelin and Claudius Colas were.


      2. John of Ibelin was a prominent nobleman in the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem
      in the 13th century.


      3. Claudius Colas was a French Resistance leader during World War II.


      4. Since they lived in completely different historical eras (13th century vs.
      20th century), their ages at death are not directly comparable.


      5. However, the question asks for a simple YES or NO.


      6. John of Ibelin lived in the medieval period and likely died much younger
      than Claudius Colas, who lived in the modern era.


      7. Claudius Colas was born in 1912 and died in 1944 at age 32.


      8. John of Ibelin likely lived to a somewhat older age typical for noblemen
      of his time.


      9. Therefore, it seems John of Ibelin was NOT younger at his time of death compared
      to Claudius Colas.

    d7d1dfbb-a7df-470d-ab31-58bc88d53e8d: 'Let me help solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll need to find out the birth and death years for both Christoph
      Cellarius and Antonio di Vincenzo.


      2. Christoph Cellarius (also known as Christoph Keller) was a German historian
      who lived from 1638 to 1707.


      3. Antonio di Vincenzo was an Italian architect who lived from around 1362 to
      1401.


      4. Calculating their ages at death:

      - Cellarius: 1707 - 1638 = 69 years old at death

      - Di Vincenzo: 1401 - 1362 = 39 years old at death


      5. Comparing their ages at death:

      - Cellarius was 69 years old

      - Di Vincenzo was 39 years old

      - 69 is greater than 39


      6. Therefore, Cellarius was OLDER at his time of death, not younger.


      The answer is: NO.'
