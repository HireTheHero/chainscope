      Step 1: Identify who Angelus of Jerusalem was and when he lived/died.

      Angelus of Jerusalem (also known as Angelo of Jerusalem or Angelo of Sicily)
      was a Carmelite martyr who lived in the late 12th to early 13th century. He
      was born around 1185 in Jerusalem and died in 1220 in Sicily, making him approximately
      35 years old at death.


      Step 2: Identify who Hatto II was and when he lived/died.

      Hatto II was Archbishop of Mainz in the late 10th century. He was born around
      940 and died in 970, making him approximately 30 years old at death.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      Angelus of Jerusalem: ~35 years old at death

      Hatto II: ~30 years old at death


      Since Hatto II died at a younger age (30) than Angelus of Jerusalem (35), Angelus

      Angelus of Jerusalem was a Carmelite monk who lived in the 12th-13th centuries.
      He was born around 1185 in Jerusalem and was martyred in Sicily in 1220. This

      Step 1: Identify Gerard I of Durbuy.

      Gerard I of Durbuy was a medieval nobleman, Count of Durbuy. Based on historical
      records, he was born around 1040 and died around 1108-1109. This would make
      him approximately 68-69 years old at death.


      Step 2: Identify Alexander V.

      There are two possible Alexander Vs to consider:

      - Alexander V (antipope), who was born around 1339 and died in 1410, making
      him about 71 years old at death

      - Alexander V of Macedon, who lived in the 2nd century BCE and died very young,
      around age 22


      Step 3: Compare the ages.

      If referring to Alexander V the antipope (which is more likely as he''s more
      commonly known as Alexander V): He died at approximately 71 years old, which
      is older than Gerard I of Durbuy who died at approximately 68-69 years old.


      If referring to Alexander V of Macedon: He died at approximately 22 years old,
      which is much younger than Gerard I of Durbuy.


      Since the more historically recognized Alexander V is the antipope, and he died
      at an older age than Gerard I of Durbuy:


      YES, Gerard I of Durbuy was younger at his time of death than Alexander V (the
      antipope) at his time of death.'

      Gerard I of Durbuy was a medieval nobleman who lived in the 11th century. He
      was born around 1040 and died around 1097-1100. This means he was approximately
      57-60 years old at death.


      Step 2: Identify when Alexander V lived and died.

      There are two notable Alexander Vs in history:

      - Pope Alexander V (Pietro Philarghi), who was born around 1339 and died in
      1410, making him about 70-71 years old at death.

      - Antipope Alexander V (Peter of Candia), who lived around the same time period
      and died at a similar age.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      Gerard I of Durbuy: approximately 57-60 years old at death

      Alexander V: approximately 70-71 years old at death


      Since Gerard I of Durbuy was around 57-60 when he died, and Alexander V was
      around 70-71 when he died, Gerard I of Durbuy was younger at his time of death.


      NO, Gerard I of Durbuy was NOT younger at his time of death than Alexander V

      Gerard I of Durbuy was a medieval nobleman who was the Count of Durbuy. Based
      on historical records, he died around 1124. However, his exact age at death
      is not well-documented in readily available sources.


      Step 2: Identify who Alexander V was and when he died.

      There are two notable Alexander Vs in history:

      - Alexander V (antipope): Pietro Philarghi, who served as antipope from 1409-1410.
      He died in 1410 at approximately 71 years of age.

      - Alexander V (Byzantine Emperor): Alexander, who briefly ruled as Byzantine
      Emperor and died in 913 as a child, around age 7.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      If we''re referring to Alexander V the antipope, he died at about 71 years old.

      If we''re referring to Alexander V the Byzantine Emperor, he died at about 7
      years old.


      Since Gerard I of Durbuy was an adult nobleman who ruled a county, he almost
      certainly lived past age 7, meaning he was older at death than the Byzantine
      Emperor Alexander V.


      However, without knowing Gerard''s exact age at death, I cannot definitively
      compare him to the antipope Alexander V who died at 71.


      Given the available information and the ambiguity about which Alexander V is
      being referenced, I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer. If more specific
      information about Gerard''s age at death or clarification about which Alexander
      V is being referenced were available, a more definitive answer could be given.'

      (born approximately 1339-1340).

      - Alexander V of Macedon who died in 309 BCE at approximately age 20.


      Step 3: Compare the ages.

      Since I don''t have specific information about Gerard I of Durbuy''s age at

      Alexander V the antipope who died at around 70 years old, it''s unlikely that

      If we''re referring to Alexander V of Macedon who died at approximately 20 years

      Gerard I of Durbuy was Count of Durbuy, and according to historical records,
      he lived approximately from 1030 to 1078. This would make him about 48 years
      old at death.


      Step 2: Identify which Alexander V we''re referring to.

      There are two notable Alexander Vs in history:

      - Alexander V (antipope) who lived from 1339 to 1410, making him about 71 years
      old at death

      - Alexander V (Byzantine Emperor) who lived from 1282 to 1308, making him about
      26 years old at death


      Step 3: Compare the ages.

      - If referring to Alexander V the antipope: Gerard I (48) was younger than Alexander
      V (71) at death.

      - If referring to Alexander V the Byzantine Emperor: Gerard I (48) was older
      than Alexander V (26) at death.


      Since Alexander V most commonly refers to the antipope Pietro Philarghi who

      old:


      YES, Gerard I of Durbuy was younger at his time of death than Alexander V at

      Gerard I of Durbuy was a medieval nobleman who was the Count of Durbuy (in present-day

      - Alexander V (antipope): Pietro Philarghi, who served as antipope from 1409-1410.
      He died in 1410 at approximately 70 years of age.

      - Alexander V (Byzantine Emperor): Alexander, who briefly ruled as Byzantine
      Emperor and died in 913 at around 43 years of age.


      The more commonly referenced Alexander V is the antipope, so I''ll use him for
      this comparison.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Gerard I of Durbuy: approximately 48 years old at death

      - Alexander V (antipope): approximately 70 years old at death


      Step 4: Determine who was younger at death.

      Since 48 is less than 70, Gerard I of Durbuy was younger at his time of death
