      Petrus Armengol died in 1304.

      Alonso de Ojeda died in 1515.


      2. **Determine who died earlier.**

      Petrus Armengol died earlier (1304) than Alonso de Ojeda (1515).


      3. **Consider the question: Was Petrus Armengol *younger* at their time of death?**  Since
      Petrus died earlier, it''s entirely possible he was younger at his death than
      Ojeda was at *his* (later) death. We need birth dates to be sure.


      4. **Find birth dates (if possible).**  Petrus Armengol was born in 1238. Alonso
      de Ojeda was born in 1466.


      5. **Calculate ages at death.**

      Petrus Armengol: 1304 - 1238 = 66 years old

      Alonso de Ojeda: 1515 - 1466 = 49 years old


      6. **Compare ages at death.** Petrus Armengol was 66 at his death, while Alonso
      de Ojeda was 49.


      7. **Answer the question.**  Was Petrus Armengol younger at his death than Ojeda
      at his death? NO.

      2. Then we need to compare their ages at death.


      Konstantin Rokossovsky died on August 3, 1968.

      Nikolai Essen died on May 7, 1945.


      Now we need their birth dates to calculate their ages at death.


      Konstantin Rokossovsky was born on December 21, 1896.

      Nikolai Essen was born on December 24, 1860.


      Rokossovsky''s age at death: 1968 - 1896 = 71 years old.

      Essen''s age at death: 1945 - 1860 = 84 years old.


      71 < 84, so Rokossovsky was younger at his time of death than Essen.

      Walch:**  Johann Georg Walch (theologian) died in 1775.  There was also a Johann

      2. **Find the death date of Yong Li:** Yong Li (Yongle Emperor) died in 1424.


      3. **Compare:** 1775 is later than 1424. 1794 is also later than 1424.

      they could not have been younger at their time of death.
