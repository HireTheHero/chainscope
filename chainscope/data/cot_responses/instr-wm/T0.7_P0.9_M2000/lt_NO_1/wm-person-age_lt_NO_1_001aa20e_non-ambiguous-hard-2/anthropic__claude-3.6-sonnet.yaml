      Archbishop in 968

      - Even if he became Archbishop at a young age of 30, he would have been around
      32 when he died


      3) Comparing:

      - Angelus was 35 at death

      - Hatto II was likely in his early-to-mid 30s at death

      - Given the uncertainty around Hatto''s exact age, I cannot make a definitive

      NO - I cannot definitively say Angelus was younger at death than Hatto II, since
      there''s too much uncertainty around Hatto II''s exact age at death.'

      3. Comparing:

      - Carlo Lizzani: 91 years at death

      - Amatus of Montecassino: Approximately 80s at death


      4. Therefore, Carlo Lizzani lived to be older than Amatus of Montecassino.

      was at her death (24), the answer is:


      NO'

      1. First, let me find when Sir John Grey of Groby died and at what age:

      - He died in 1461 at the Second Battle of St. Albans

      - He was born around 1432

      - This means he was about 29 years old when he died


      2. Now, let me find when Beatrice Portinari died and at what age:

      - Beatrice Portinari died in 1290

      - She was born in 1266

      - This means she was 24 years old when she died


      3. Now I can compare:

      - Sir John Grey of Groby: died at ~29 years old

      - Beatrice Portinari: died at 24 years old

      - 29 is greater than 24


      Therefore, Sir John Grey was NOT younger at death than Beatrice Portinari.

      1. First, I need to find out when Conrad, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal died
      and at what age.

      - Conrad died in 1304

      - He was born around 1240

      - This means he was approximately 64 years old at death


      2. Next, I need to find Alexander Pope''s age at death

      - Alexander Pope lived from 1688 to 1744

      - He was 56 years old when he died


      3. Now I can compare:

      - Conrad was around 64 when he died

      - Pope was 56 when he died

      - 64 is greater than 56


      Therefore, Conrad was NOT younger than Pope at their respective times of death.

      - Born around 1010

      - Died in 1057

      - This means he was approximately 47 years old at death


      3. Now I can compare their ages at death:

      - Van Peene: 53 years

      - Humphrey: 47 years

      - 53 is greater than 47


      4. The question asks if Van Peene was younger at death than Humphrey

      - Since Van Peene lived to 53 and Humphrey to 47

      - Van Peene was older at death, not younger


      NO'
