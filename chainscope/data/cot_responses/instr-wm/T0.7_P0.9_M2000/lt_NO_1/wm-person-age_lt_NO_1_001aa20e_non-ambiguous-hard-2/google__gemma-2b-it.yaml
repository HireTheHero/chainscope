      Sure, here''s a breakdown of the reasoning:


      1. **Yi Chong-jun''s death date:** We don''t have specific information about
      Yi Chong-jun''s exact date of death, so we cannot determine if he died earlier
      or later than Wolfgang Clement.



      2. **Wolfgang Clement''s death date:** According to historical accounts, Wolfgang
      Clement died in 1583 at the age of 79.



      3. **Comparison:** Comparing the death dates of Yi Chong-jun and Wolfgang Clement,
      we cannot establish a clear answer.



      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.'

      Sure, here''s the reasoning:


      1. Wolfgang Clement died in 1583, while Yi Chong-jun died in 1420.

      2. So, Wolfgang Clement died more than 60 years before Yi Chong-jun.
