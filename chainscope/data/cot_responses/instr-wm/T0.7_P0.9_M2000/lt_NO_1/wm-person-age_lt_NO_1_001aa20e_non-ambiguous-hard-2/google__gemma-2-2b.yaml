      about the time of death of Zhou Mi and Robert III, Count of Dreux. However,
      we can make some general assumptions based on historical records and other sources.


      First, we know that Zhou Mi was a prominent figure in Chinese history, and that
      he was active during the Tang Dynasty (618-907). On the other hand, Robert III,
      Count of Dreux was a medieval French nobleman who lived during the 12th century.


      From this, we can infer that Zhou Mi was likely born before 618, while Robert
      III was born sometime between the 11th and 12th centuries.


      Therefore, we can say that Zhou Mi was younger at his time of death than Robert
      III, Count of Dreux.

      Find the age of Charlotte, Princess Royal at the time of their death.


      **Step 2:**


      Find the age of Robert Dowland at the time of their death.


      **Step 3:**


      Compare the ages of Charlotte, Princess Royal and Robert Dowland.


      **Answer:**


      From the passage, we know that Charlotte, Princess Royal died in 1559 and Robert
      Dowland died in 1593.


      Step 1: We can find the age of Charlotte, Princess Royal at the time of their
      death by subtracting their year of death from 1559, which gives us 34.


      Step 2: We can find the age of Robert Dowland at the time of their death by
      subtracting their year of death from 1593, which gives us 34.


      Step 3: Since both Charlotte, Princess Royal and Robert Dowland were 34 years
      old at the time of their deaths, we can conclude that they were both the same
      age.


      Therefore, we cannot answer this question with a YES or NO answer, as the passage
      does not provide enough information to determine the age of either person.
