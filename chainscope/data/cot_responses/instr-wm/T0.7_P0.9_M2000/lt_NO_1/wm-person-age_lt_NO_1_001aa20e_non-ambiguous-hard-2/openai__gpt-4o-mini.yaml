      figure, we can only assess them based on the general time periods they lived
      in. However, it is generally accepted that Uc Brunet died after Vanni Fucci.
      Thus, Vanni Fucci would have been younger than Uc Brunet at the time of his
      death.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:


      NO'
    4c9d20bf-a108-4608-ae4a-bd3747d7d6cd: 'To answer the question, we first need to
      establish the birth and death years of both Vanni Fucci and Uc Brunet.


      1. **Vanni Fucci**: He is a character from Dante Alighieri''s "Divine Comedy,"
      specifically from the Inferno. Historical references indicate that Vanni Fucci
      was a real person who lived in the late 13th century, but exact birth and death
      dates are not clearly documented. He is generally believed to have died around
      the year 1300.


      2. **Uc Brunet**: Uc Brunet, also known as Ugo Brunetto, is less well-known
      but was a historical figure from the same period, associated with the region
      of Tuscany. He is often cited in medieval texts, but again, specific dates of
      birth and death are not definitively recorded. However, he is also believed
      to have lived around the same time as Vanni Fucci, with some sources suggesting
      he died around the early 14th century.


      Given that both figures lived around the same time and considering the historical
      context, it is challenging to determine their exact ages at the time of their
      deaths without precise dates.


      Based on available historical context and common scholarship, it is likely that
      Vanni Fucci and Uc Brunet were close in age, potentially making it difficult
      to determine definitively who was younger at their time of death without further
      specific information.


      In conclusion, without clear evidence to suggest one was definitively younger
      than the other at the time of their death, the answer is:


      NO'

      1. **Vanni Fucci**: He is a character from Dante Alighieri''s "Divine Comedy,"
      specifically in the "Inferno." He is depicted as a thief and is believed to
      have lived in the late 13th century. His exact birth and death dates are not
      definitively known, but he is thought to have died around 1290.


      2. **Uc Brunet**: He is a historical figure mentioned in the same context as
      Vanni Fucci. Uc Brunet was a French nobleman and is believed to have lived around
      the same time, although specific dates for his life are also not well-documented.
      He is often associated with the events of the early 14th century.


      Given that both figures are from similar time periods, and if we assume that
      Uc Brunet lived slightly later than Vanni Fucci, it is likely that Vanni Fucci
      died before Uc Brunet was born or at least before he reached adulthood.


      Therefore, based on the assumption that Vanni Fucci was likely older than Uc
      Brunet at their times of death, the answer to the question would be:

      around 1250 and died around 1290, making him approximately 40 years old at his
      time of death.

      the 12th century. He is believed to have been born around 1150 and died around

      Now, we compare their ages at the time of death:

      - Vanni Fucci: approximately 40 years old
