      Conrad I.

      Conrad I of Brandenburg-Stendal was born around 1240.

      Conrad I of Brandenburg-Stendal died in 1304.

      Age at death for Conrad I: 1304 - 1240 = approximately 64 years.


      Step 2: Find the birth and death dates for Alexander Pope.

      Alexander Pope was born on May 21, 1688.

      Alexander Pope died on May 30, 1744.

      Age at death for Alexander Pope: 1744 - 1688 = 56 years.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      Conrad, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal, was approximately 64 years old at his
      death.

      Alexander Pope was 56 years old at his death.


      Step 4: Determine if Conrad was younger than Alexander Pope at their respective
      times of death.

      Was 64 (Conrad''s age) younger than 56 (Pope''s age)? No, 64 is older than 56.


      NO'
