      \ years.\n   - Assuming the birth year is correct and without the exact birth\
      \ and death dates, we estimate he was about 55 years old at the time of his\
      \ death.\n\nNow, comparing their ages at death:\n- James K. Gibson was 66 years\

      1. **Vanni Fucci**: He was a historical figure from Pistoia, Italy, known from
      Dante Alighieri''s "Inferno." He lived in the late 13th century. The exact birth
      and death dates of Vanni Fucci are not well-documented, but he was active around
      1293. He is presumed to have died sometime after this, but without specific
      dates, it''s challenging to determine his exact age at death.


      2. **Uc Brunet**: He was a troubadour from the late 12th century. His dates
      are also not precisely documented, but he was active around 1190. Like many
      troubadours, the exact years of his birth and death are uncertain.


      Given the lack of precise birth and death dates for both individuals, it is
      not possible to definitively state which of the two was younger at the time
      of their death. Therefore, without specific ages at death, a definitive comparison
      cannot be made.


      The answer, based on the available information, is: NO, we cannot conclusively
      say Vanni Fucci was younger at their time of death than Uc Brunet.'

      1. **Vanni Fucci**: He was a character mentioned in Dante Alighieri''s "Divine

      a thief from Pistoia, Italy, who lived during the late 13th century. The exact
      dates of his birth and death are not well-documented, but it is generally believed
      he died around the year 1295.


      2. **Uc Brunet**: He was a troubadour from the Provence region, active during
      the late 12th and early 13th centuries. Again, the exact dates of his birth
      and death are not well-documented, but it is estimated that he died around 1220.


      To compare their ages at death, we need to make assumptions based on historical
      context:


      - Vanni Fucci: Assuming he was born around 1250 (a common assumption for people
      active in the late 13th century), he would have been approximately 45 years
      old at the time of his death in 1295.


      - Uc Brunet: Assuming he was born around 1175 (a common assumption for people
      active in the late 12th century), he would have been approximately 45 years
      old at the time of his death in 1220.


      Both figures are estimated to have died at around the same age, approximately
      45 years old. Therefore, based on these estimates, neither Vanni Fucci nor Uc
      Brunet was definitively younger than the other at their time of death.
