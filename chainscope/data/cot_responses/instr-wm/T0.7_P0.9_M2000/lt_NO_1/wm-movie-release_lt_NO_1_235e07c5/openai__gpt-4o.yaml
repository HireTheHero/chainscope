      2. **Silencing Mary**: This is a television film directed by Craig R. Baxley.

      - **Silencing Mary** was released on 8 March 1998.

      - **Thulli Thirintha Kaalam** was released on 12 March 1998.


      Given this information, **Silencing Mary** was released earlier than **Thulli

      - "Silencing Mary" was specifically released on March 8, 1998.


      Since "Silencing Mary" has a precise release date in March 1998, and "Thulli

      information about the month and day of "Thulli Thirintha Kaalam''s" release

      in 2006. It premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September
      2005 but had its general release in various countries throughout 2006.


      Given these dates:

      - "Opal Dream" premiered earlier in September 2005, but its general release
      came in 2006.
