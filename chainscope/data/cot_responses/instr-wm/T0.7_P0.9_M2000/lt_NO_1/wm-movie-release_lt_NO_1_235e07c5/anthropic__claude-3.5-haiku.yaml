      1. First, I''ll find the release year for "Red" directed by Dean Parisot

      - "Red" was released in 2010


      2. Next, I''ll find the release year for "A Woman" directed by Giada Colagrande

      - After checking, "A Woman" was released in 2012


      3. Compare the years:

      - "Red" was released in 2010

      - "A Woman" was released in 2012


      4. Determine which came first:

      - 2010 comes before 2012

      - So "Red" was indeed released earlier than "A Woman"


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      1. First, I''ll find the release year for Bob Chinn''s "The Jade Pussycat"

      - This appears to be an adult film from the 1970s

      - After research, it was released in 1977


      2. Next, I''ll find the release year for Richard Attenborough''s "A Bridge Too
      Far"

      - This is a well-known World War II epic

      - It was released in 1977


      3. Comparing the years:

      - Both films were released in 1977

      - This means neither was released "earlier" than the other


      4. Since the question asks specifically about whether "The Jade Pussycat" was
      released earlier, and it was not, the answer is:


      NO'
