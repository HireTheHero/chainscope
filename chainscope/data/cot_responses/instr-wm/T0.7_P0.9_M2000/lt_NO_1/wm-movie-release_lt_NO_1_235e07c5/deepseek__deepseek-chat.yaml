      Mission Cleopatra* was released earlier than Raymond Yip''s *Beauty and the
      Breast*. To answer this, we''ll need to find the release dates of both movies
      and compare them.


      ### Step 1: Identify the Release Date of *Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra*


      First, let''s find out when *Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra* was released.


      - **Title:** *Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra*

      released in France on **January 30, 2002**.


      ### Step 2: Identify the Release Date of *Beauty and the Breast*


      Next, let''s determine the release date of Raymond Yip''s *Beauty and the Breast*.

      - *Beauty and the Breast*: **December 13, 2002**


      Comparing these dates, it''s clear that *Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra*

      ### Step 4: Conclusion


      Based on the release dates:

      we need to look at the release dates of both films.


      1. **Conspiracy of Hearts** was released in **1960**.

      2. **Once More, with Feeling!** was released in **1960** as well.


      However, to determine which one came first, we need to look at the specific

      - *Conspiracy of Hearts* was released on **March 7, 1960**.

      - *Once More, with Feeling!* was released on **April 28, 1960**.


      Since **March 7, 1960** is earlier than **April 28, 1960**, we can conclude
