      "Kalankini Kankabati" is a Bengali film starring Uttam Kumar. It was released
      in 1981.


      Step 2: Identify when "Asso" was released.

      "Asso" is an Italian comedy film directed by Franco Castellano (along with Giuseppe
      Moccia). It was released in 1981.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      Both films were released in the same year (1981), but to answer precisely whether
      one was released "earlier" than the other, I would need the specific month and
      day of release. Without that specific information available to me, I cannot

      - "A Bridge Too Far" directed by Richard Attenborough (referred to as "Lord

      two films: "Dear Yelena Sergeyevna" directed by Eldar Ryazanov and "The Crazy
      Companies" directed by Wong Jing.


      For "Dear Yelena Sergeyevna":

      - This is a Soviet film directed by Eldar Ryazanov

      - It was released in 1988


      For "The Crazy Companies":

      - This is a Hong Kong film directed by Wong Jing

      - It was released in 1988 as well


      Since both films were released in the same year (1988), I need to determine
      if one was released earlier within that year. However, without specific month
      and date information for both releases, I cannot definitively state which film
      came out earlier within 1988.


      Given the limited information available to me, I cannot determine if "Dear Yelena
      Sergeyevna" was released earlier than "The Crazy Companies" within the same
      year.


      NO (I cannot confirm that Ryazanov''s film was released earlier)'

      - "East Wind" (also known as "Vent d''est") directed by Robert Enrico was released
      in 1993.

      - "Fight Back to School III" directed by Wong Jing was released in 1993.

      - April 21, 1993 comes before July 8, 1993.

      I don''t have specific information about a film called "East Wind" directed

      Step 2: Compare the release dates.

      - "Pandora''s Promise" had its premiere in January 2013 at Sundance.

      - "Summer in February" was released in June 2013.

      - Even if we consider the wider theatrical release of "Pandora''s Promise" (June
      12, 2013), it still came out slightly before "Summer in February" (June 14,
      2013).


      Step 3: Determine which was released earlier.

      Since "Pandora''s Promise" was released in January 2013 (or even considering
      its June 12 wider release), it was released before "Summer in February" which
      came out on June 14, 2013.

      - "Winnetou and the Crossbreed" (also known as "Winnetou und das Halbblut Apanatschi"

      of Fu Manchu."


      NO, Don Sharp''s "The Brides of Fu Manchu" was not released earlier than Harald

      "The Young Doctors" directed by Phil Karlson was also released in 1961.

      "The Young Doctors" was released on August 23, 1961.


      Step 4: Compare the dates.

      August 23, 1961 (The Young Doctors) comes before August 25, 1961 (Ada).


      Therefore, "Ada" was NOT released earlier than "The Young Doctors" - it was
      released two days later.

      Joe Mantello.

      - "Love! Valour! Compassion!" was released in 1997.


      Step 2: Identify the release year of "Omkaram" directed by Upendra.

      - I need to check if this film exists. There is an Indian film called "Om" directed
      by Upendra that was released in 1995.

      - However, I''m not finding clear information about a film called "Omkaram"
      directed by Upendra. There is a Telugu film called "Omkaram" but it doesn''t
      appear to be directed by Upendra.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      - If we''re referring to "Om" (1995) by Upendra, then it was released before
      "Love! Valour! Compassion!" (1997).

      - If "Omkaram" is a different film by Upendra released after 1997, then the
      answer would be different.


      Based on the most likely interpretation that "Omkaram" refers to Upendra''s
      "Om" from 1995, and "Love! Valour! Compassion!" was released in 1997:


      NO, Joe Mantello''s "Love! Valour! Compassion!" was not released earlier than
      Upendra''s film.'

      "Love! Valour! Compassion!" was released in 1997. It was directed by Joe Mantello

      "Omkaram" was released in 1995.

      - Upendra''s "Omkaram" was released in 1997 as well.


      Wait, I need to verify this information. Let me check more carefully.


      Step 2: Double-checking the films and their release dates.

      - "Love! Valour! Compassion!" directed by Joe Mantello was indeed released in
      1997 (specifically May 16, 1997 in the US).

      - I need to clarify about "Omkaram." There seems to be some confusion as Upendra
      directed films like "Om" (1995) and "A" (1998), but I don''t have clear records
      of a film titled "Omkaram" by Upendra. The closest match might be "Om" from
      1995.


      Step 3: Based on the information I can verify:

      - If comparing "Love! Valour! Compassion!" (1997) with Upendra''s "Om" (1995),
      then "Om" was released earlier.

      - If "Omkaram" is a different film released after 1997, then "Love! Valour!
      Compassion!" was released earlier.


      Since I cannot verify with certainty the existence or release date of "Omkaram"
      by Upendra, I cannot give a definitive answer. However, based on Upendra''s
      known filmography, his film "Om" from 1995 would have been released earlier
      than "Love! Valour! Compassion!" from 1997.

      Malmuth.

      specific release dates.

      - "Superfantagenio" was released in Italy on February 13, 1986.

      - "Where Are the Children?" was released in the United States on November 21,

      Zero".


      Step 1: Identify Richard Stanley''s "Brave".

      There appears to be some confusion here. Richard Stanley is a filmmaker known
      for films like "Hardware" (1990) and "Dust Devil" (1992), but I don''t have
      a record of him directing a film titled "Brave." The well-known animated film
      "Brave" (2012) was a Pixar production directed by Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman.


      Step 2: Identify Rick Jacobson''s "Bloodfist VI: Ground Zero".

      Rick Jacobson did direct "Bloodfist VI: Ground Zero," which was released in
      1995.


      Step 3: Compare release dates.

      Since I cannot confirm the existence of Richard Stanley''s "Brave," I cannot
      make a direct comparison of release dates.


      However, if the question is referring to the Pixar film "Brave" (2012) versus
      "Bloodfist VI: Ground Zero" (1995), then "Bloodfist VI" was released earlier.


      NO - Based on available information, I cannot confirm that Richard Stanley''s
      "Brave" was released earlier than Rick Jacobson''s "Bloodfist VI: Ground Zero"
      (1995), as I don''t have evidence of Richard Stanley directing a film called
      "Brave."'

      Ginty.

      - "Here Come the Munsters" is a made-for-TV movie directed by Robert Ginty that
      was released on October 31, 1995 (Halloween).


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      - "Gulabi" was released in 1995.

      - "Here Come the Munsters" was released specifically on October 31, 1995.

      - Without the exact month and day for "Gulabi," I cannot make a definitive determination.
      If "Gulabi" was released before October 31, 1995, then YES. If it was released
      on or after October 31, 1995, then NO.


      Since I don''t have the exact date for "Gulabi" beyond the year 1995, I cannot
      provide a definitive YES or NO answer with complete certainty.'
