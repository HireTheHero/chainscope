      **Step 1: Locate Thomas More University, KY**

      Thomas More University is in Crestview Hills, Kentucky.


      **Step 2: Locate Southern Polytechnic State University, GA (and its successor)**

      Southern Polytechnic State University was located in Marietta, Georgia. It merged
      with Kennesaw State University in 2015, and the Marietta campus is now a campus
      of Kennesaw State University. For the purpose of this question, we''ll consider
      its original location.


      **Step 3: Compare Latitudes**

      *   Crestview Hills, KY (Thomas More University) is near Cincinnati, Ohio. Its
      approximate latitude is 39.0 degrees North.

      *   Marietta, GA (Southern Polytechnic State University) is just north of Atlanta.
      Its approximate latitude is 34.0 degrees North.


      **Step 4: Determine North/South Relationship**

      A higher North latitude means the location is further north. Since 39.0 is greater
      than 34.0, Thomas More University is further north than Southern Polytechnic
      State University.


      Therefore, Thomas More University, KY is **not** located south of Southern Polytechnic

      Now, let''s consider their relative positions on a map.


      *   Arkansas is *north* of Louisiana.

      *   Monticello, AR is in the southern part of Arkansas.

      *   Lafayette, LA is in the southern part of Louisiana.


      However, the question asks if Monticello, AR is *south of* Lafayette, LA. Since
      Arkansas is geographically north of Louisiana, any point in Arkansas will be
      north of any point in Louisiana, generally speaking, when considering north-south
      latitude.


      Therefore, Monticello, AR is *north* of Lafayette, LA.

      2.  **Locate Western Kentucky University-Owensboro, KY:** Owensboro, Kentucky.
      Owensboro is in northwestern Kentucky, on the Ohio River.


      Now, visualize or look at a map:


      *   Indiana is generally north of Kentucky.

      *   Muncie, IN is clearly north of the Ohio River.

      *   Owensboro, KY is on the Ohio River, which forms the border between Kentucky

      **Step 1: Locate Ball State University, IN.**

      Ball State University is in Muncie, Indiana. Muncie is in east-central Indiana.


      **Step 2: Locate Western Kentucky University-Owensboro, KY.**

      Western Kentucky University-Owensboro is in Owensboro, Kentucky. Owensboro is
      in northwestern Kentucky, on the Ohio River.


      **Step 3: Compare Latitudes.**

      To determine if one is south of the other, we need to compare their latitudes.


      *   **Muncie, IN (Ball State):** Approximately 40.2 degrees North latitude.

      *   **Owensboro, KY (WKU-Owensboro):** Approximately 37.7 degrees North latitude.


      **Step 4: Conclusion based on Latitude.**

      A lower North latitude means a location is further south. Since Owensboro, KY
      has a lower North latitude (37.7) than Muncie, IN (40.2), Owensboro is south
      of Muncie.


      The question asks if Ball State University, IN is located **south** of Western
      Kentucky University-Owensboro, KY. Since Owensboro is south of Muncie, Muncie
      (Ball State) must be **north** of Owensboro (WKU-Owensboro).


      Therefore, Ball State University is NOT south of Western Kentucky University-Owensboro.
