      Methodist University, MO and Arkansas State University Paragould, AR, and compare

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Central Methodist University is in Missouri (MO)

      - Arkansas State University Paragould is in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Missouri is located north of Arkansas in the United States


      Step 3: Find the specific cities.

      - Central Methodist University is in Fayette, Missouri

      - Arkansas State University Paragould is in Paragould, Arkansas


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      - Since Missouri is north of Arkansas, and these cities don''t lie in unusual
      border areas that would reverse this relationship, Central Methodist University
      would be north of Arkansas State University Paragould.

      - Therefore, Central Methodist University is NOT south of Arkansas State University
      Paragould.

      - Central Methodist University is in Fayette, Missouri (MO).

      - Arkansas State University Paragould is in Paragould, Arkansas (AR).


      Step 2: Let me determine their relative positions on a north-south axis.

      - Missouri is a state that borders Arkansas on its northern side.

      - This means Missouri is north of Arkansas.


      Step 3: Looking more specifically at these cities:

      - Fayette, MO is in central Missouri.

      - Paragould, AR is in northeastern Arkansas, near the Missouri border.


      Step 4: Comparing their positions:

      - Since Fayette, MO is in Missouri, and Missouri is north of Arkansas, Central
      Methodist University is located north of Arkansas State University Paragould.

      - Therefore, Central Methodist University is NOT south of Arkansas State University

      - Johnson University is in Knoxville, Tennessee


      Step 2: Determine the general north-south relationship between Ohio and Tennessee.

      - Ohio is located north of Tennessee in the United States


      Step 3: Verify the specific cities'' locations within their states.

      - Columbus is in central Ohio

      - Knoxville is in eastern Tennessee


      Step 4: Compare the latitudes.

      - Since Ohio is north of Tennessee, and the cities are not positioned in a way
      that would reverse this relationship (like if one were at the extreme southern
      edge and the other at the extreme northern edge of their states), Ohio Dominican
      University would be north of Johnson University.


      Therefore, Ohio Dominican University is NOT located south of Johnson University.

      - Delaware is entirely north of North Carolina on the U.S. map

      - Since Widener University is in Delaware, and UNC Wilmington is in North Carolina,
      Widener must be north of UNC Wilmington

      I need to determine the locations of both universities and compare their north-south
      positions.


      Step 1: Locate Thomas More University in Kentucky (KY).

      - Thomas More University is located in Crestview Hills, Kentucky.

      - Kentucky is a state in the north-central United States.

      - Specifically, Crestview Hills is in northern Kentucky, near Cincinnati, Ohio.


      Step 2: Locate Southern Polytechnic State University in Georgia (GA).

      - Southern Polytechnic State University (now part of Kennesaw State University)
      was located in Marietta, Georgia.

      - Georgia is a southeastern state, south of Kentucky.

      - Marietta is in northern Georgia, near Atlanta.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Kentucky is entirely north of Georgia on the map.

      - Northern Kentucky (where Thomas More is located) is significantly north of
      northern Georgia (where Southern Polytechnic was located).


      NO, Thomas More University in Kentucky is not south of Southern Polytechnic
      State University in Georgia. It is north of it.'

      if Thomas More University in Kentucky is located south of Southern Polytechnic
      State University in Georgia.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both universities.

      - Thomas More University is located in Crestview Hills, Kentucky.

      - Southern Polytechnic State University (now part of Kennesaw State University)
      is located in Marietta, Georgia.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Kentucky and Georgia.

      - Kentucky is a state that borders the northern part of Georgia.

      - Generally, Kentucky is north of Georgia in the United States.


      Step 3: Check the specific locations within their states.

      - Crestview Hills, KY is in the northern part of Kentucky, near the Ohio border.

      - Marietta, GA is in the northern part of Georgia, near Atlanta.


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes (north-south positioning).

      - Kentucky is entirely north of Georgia.

      - Therefore, Thomas More University in Kentucky must be north of any location
      in Georgia, including Southern Polytechnic State University.


      NO. Thomas More University in Kentucky is not located south of Southern Polytechnic
      State University in Georgia. It is located north of it.'

      is located south of Elizabeth City State University, NC, I need to find the

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Webb Institute is in Glen Cove, New York, on Long Island.

      - Elizabeth City State University is in Elizabeth City, North Carolina.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography.

      - New York is generally north of North Carolina in the United States.

      - Long Island (where Glen Cove is located) is in the northeastern part of the
      US.

      - Elizabeth City, NC is in the northeastern part of North Carolina.


      Step 3: Compare their approximate latitudes.

      - New York locations are typically between 40-45 degrees North latitude.

      - Northern North Carolina locations are typically around 36 degrees North latitude.

      - Even though Elizabeth City is in northern NC, it would still be south of Long
      Island, NY.
