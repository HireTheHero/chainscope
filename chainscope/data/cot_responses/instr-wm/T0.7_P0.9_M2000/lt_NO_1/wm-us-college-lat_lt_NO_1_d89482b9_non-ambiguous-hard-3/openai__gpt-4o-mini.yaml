      of both places.


      1. **Location of University of New Haven, CT**: The University of New Haven
      is located in West Haven, Connecticut, which is situated in the southern part
      of the state near the coast.


      2. **Location of Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts, ME**: This
      institution is located in Portland, Maine.


      3. **Geographical Relationship**: Maine is north of Connecticut. Portland, ME
      is significantly farther north than West Haven, CT.


      4. **Directionality**: Since Maine is to the north of Connecticut, the Institute
      for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts in Maine cannot be south of the University
      of New Haven in Connecticut.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      NO'
