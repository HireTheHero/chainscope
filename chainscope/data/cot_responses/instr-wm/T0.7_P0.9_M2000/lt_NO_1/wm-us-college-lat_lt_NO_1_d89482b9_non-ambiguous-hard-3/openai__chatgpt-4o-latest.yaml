      (also known as Cal Poly Humboldt), we need to:


      1. Identify the locations of both universities.

      2. Determine their latitudes to assess which one is further north or south.


      **Step 1: Location of Saint Martin''s University**

      - Saint Martin''s University is located in Lacey, Washington.

      - Lacey, WA is near Olympia, in the western part of Washington state.


      **Step 2: Location of Cal Poly Humboldt**

      - Cal Poly Humboldt is located in Arcata, California.

      - Arcata is in northern California, on the coast, near Eureka.


      **Step 3: Compare their latitudes**

      - Lacey, WA (Saint Martin''s): approximately 47.045 latitude (north).

      - Arcata, CA (Cal Poly Humboldt): approximately 40.866 latitude (north).


      **Step 4: Analyze**

      - A higher latitude number in the northern hemisphere means the location is
      further north.

      - Since 47.045 (Lacey) is greater than 40.866 (Arcata), Lacey is north of Arcata.
