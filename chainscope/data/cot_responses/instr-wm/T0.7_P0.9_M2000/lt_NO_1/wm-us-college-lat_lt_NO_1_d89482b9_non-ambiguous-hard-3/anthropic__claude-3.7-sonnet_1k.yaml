      1. I need to find the location of Central Methodist University in Missouri (MO).

      2. I need to find the location of Arkansas State University Paragould in Arkansas
      (AR).

      3. Then I need to determine if Central Methodist University is south of Arkansas
      State University Paragould.


      Central Methodist University is located in Fayette, Missouri. Missouri is generally
      north of Arkansas.


      Arkansas State University Paragould is located in Paragould, Arkansas. Arkansas
      is generally south of Missouri.


      Since Missouri is north of Arkansas, and Central Methodist University is in
      Missouri while Arkansas State University Paragould is in Arkansas, Central Methodist
      University would be north of Arkansas State University Paragould, not south.</think>To
      determine if Central Methodist University in Missouri is located south of Arkansas
      State University Paragould in Arkansas, I need to consider their geographic
      locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Central Methodist University is located in Fayette, Missouri.

      - Arkansas State University Paragould is located in Paragould, Arkansas.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Missouri and Arkansas.

      - Missouri is a state that borders Arkansas to the north.

      - Arkansas is positioned south of Missouri.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations within these states.

      - Since Fayette, MO is within Missouri, and Paragould, AR is within Arkansas,
      the general state positioning applies.

      - Missouri institutions will typically be north of Arkansas institutions.


      NO, Central Methodist University is not located south of Arkansas State University
      Paragould. It is located north of it, as Missouri is north of Arkansas.'

      1. Central Methodist University in Missouri (MO)

      2. Arkansas State University Paragould in Arkansas (AR)


      Let me think about the geographic layout of these states. Missouri is north
      of Arkansas. This is a general fact about US geography - Missouri borders Arkansas
      on its northern side.


      Now, to be more precise, I need to know where in Missouri is Central Methodist
      University, and where in Arkansas is Arkansas State University Paragould.


      Central Methodist University is in Fayette, Missouri, which is in the central
      part of Missouri.


      Arkansas State University Paragould is in Paragould, Arkansas, which is in the
      northeastern part of Arkansas, near the Missouri border.


      Since Missouri is north of Arkansas, and Central Methodist University is in
      central Missouri while Arkansas State University Paragould is in northeastern
      Arkansas (even though it''s near the Missouri border), Central Methodist University
      would be north of Arkansas State University Paragould.


      If Central Methodist University is north of Arkansas State University Paragould,
      then it is NOT south of it.</think>To determine if Central Methodist University
      (MO) is south of Arkansas State University Paragould (AR), I need to compare
      their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Missouri is located directly north of Arkansas on the US map.


      Step 2: Locate the specific universities within their states.

      - Central Methodist University is in Fayette, Missouri, located in the central
      part of the state.

      - Arkansas State University Paragould is in Paragould, Arkansas, located in
      the northeastern part of Arkansas (near the Missouri border).


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Even though Paragould is in the northeastern corner of Arkansas (relatively
      close to Missouri), it''s still south of central Missouri where Fayette is located.


      Since Central Methodist University in Missouri is north of Arkansas State University
      Paragould in Arkansas, it cannot be south of it.

      1. Central Methodist University in Missouri (MO)

      2. Arkansas State University Paragould in Arkansas (AR)


      To determine if one is south of the other, I need to know their locations in
      terms of latitude. A lower latitude means further south.


      Missouri is generally north of Arkansas in the US. Missouri borders Arkansas
      on Arkansas''s northern border. So geographically speaking, locations in Missouri
      tend to be north of locations in Arkansas.


      Central Methodist University is in Missouri (MO), which suggests it''s likely
      north of a university in Arkansas.


      Arkansas State University Paragould is in Arkansas (AR), which suggests it''s
      likely south of a university in Missouri.


      So just based on the states, Central Methodist University (in MO) would be north
      of Arkansas State University Paragould (in AR), not south of it.


      Therefore, the answer is likely NO, Central Methodist University is NOT located
      south of Arkansas State University Paragould.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Central Methodist University is in Missouri (MO)

      - Arkansas State University Paragould is in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Missouri is located directly north of Arkansas in the United States

      - The entire state of Missouri is above (north of) the entire state of Arkansas


      Step 3: Apply this state-level geography to the universities.

      - Since Central Methodist University is in Missouri, and Missouri is north of
      Arkansas

      - And Arkansas State University Paragould is in Arkansas

      - Central Methodist University must be north of Arkansas State University Paragould


      NO, Central Methodist University is not located south of Arkansas State University

      Let me think about the geography of these two states first:

      - Missouri (MO) is generally north of Arkansas (AR)

      - Arkansas borders Missouri to the south


      Now I need to locate these specific universities:


      1. Central Methodist University is in Missouri (MO)

      2. Arkansas State University Paragould is in Arkansas (AR)


      Since Missouri is north of Arkansas, and these universities are in their respective

      State University Paragould.


      To be more precise:

      - Central Methodist University is located in Fayette, Missouri

      - Arkansas State University Paragould is located in Paragould, Arkansas


      Paragould, AR is in the northeastern part of Arkansas, near the Missouri border.
      But even the northernmost part of Arkansas is still south of most of Missouri.
      Fayette, MO is in central Missouri.


      Given this information, Central Methodist University in Missouri would be north

      - Arkansas State University Paragould is in Paragould, Arkansas, which is in

      1. Mildred Elley, NY: This indicates the institution is in New York state.

      2. Eastern University, PA: This indicates the institution is in Pennsylvania.


      To determine if one is south of the other, I need to find their specific locations
      and compare their latitudes. A location with a lower latitude is further south
      than a location with a higher latitude.


      Let me recall what I know about these institutions:


      Mildred Elley appears to be a college in New York state. I believe it has campuses
      in Albany, NY and possibly other locations in New York.


      Eastern University is located in St. Davids, Pennsylvania, which is in the Philadelphia
      metropolitan area in eastern Pennsylvania.


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Albany, NY is located in upstate New York

      - St. Davids, PA is in southeastern Pennsylvania near Philadelphia


      In general, upstate New York is north of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is south
      of New York State. However, I need to be precise about these specific locations.


      Albany, NY is definitely north of St. Davids, PA. So if Mildred Elley is in

      - Mildred Elley is located in New York state (NY)

      - Eastern University is located in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Find their specific locations

      - Mildred Elley has its main campus in Albany, NY (in upstate New York)

      - Eastern University is located in St. Davids, PA (in the Philadelphia area
      of southeastern Pennsylvania)


      ## Step 3: Compare their geographical positions

      - Albany, NY is in upstate New York, which is generally north of Pennsylvania

      - St. Davids, PA is in southeastern Pennsylvania, which is south of upstate
      New York

      - On a map, Albany has a higher latitude than St. Davids


      ## Conclusion

      Let me think about the geographic locations:


      Oklahoma City is in the state of Oklahoma, which is directly north of Texas.

      Our Lady of the Lake University is in Texas.

      Ohio Valley University is (or was) located in Vienna, West Virginia. West Virginia

      St. Andrews University is located in Laurinburg, North Carolina. North Carolina

      West Virginia is generally north of North Carolina. West Virginia is bordered
      by Pennsylvania to the north and Virginia to the south, while North Carolina
      is south of Virginia.

      NC. Rather, it''s the opposite - St. Andrews University is south of Ohio Valley
      University.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions of
      these two universities by comparing their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Ohio Valley University is located in Vienna, West Virginia

      - St. Andrews University is located in Laurinburg, North Carolina


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - West Virginia is in the Appalachian region of the eastern United States

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positioning.

      - West Virginia is positioned north of North Carolina

      - The southern border of West Virginia connects with Virginia, while North Carolina
      is even further south than Virginia


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the universities.

      Since West Virginia is north of North Carolina, Ohio Valley University (in WV)
      would be north of St. Andrews University (in NC), not south of it.

      Then I need to compare their geographical positions to determine if Ohio Valley
      University is south of St. Andrews University.


      First, let me identify their locations:


      Ohio Valley University is (or was) located in Vienna, West Virginia. West Virginia
      is a state in the Appalachian region of the United States.


      St. Andrews University is located in Laurinburg, North Carolina. North Carolina

      Now I need to determine their relative positions. In the United States:

      - West Virginia is north of North Carolina

      - North Carolina is south of West Virginia


      Therefore, Ohio Valley University in West Virginia would be north of St. Andrews
      University in North Carolina, not south of it.</think>I need to determine the

      Step 2: Compare the geographical positions of West Virginia and North Carolina.

      - West Virginia is situated in the Appalachian region of the eastern United
      States

      - North Carolina is located on the eastern seaboard, south of West Virginia

      - On a map of the US, West Virginia is clearly north of North Carolina


      Step 3: Determine the relative position of the universities.

      - Since West Virginia is north of North Carolina, Ohio Valley University (in
      WV) must be north of St. Andrews University (in NC)

      - Therefore, Ohio Valley University is NOT south of St. Andrews University

      Let me think about the geography of these states:

      - West Virginia (WV) is a state in the Appalachian region

      - North Carolina (NC) is a state on the eastern seaboard


      In terms of north-south positioning, North Carolina is generally south of West
      Virginia. West Virginia is bordered by Pennsylvania to the north and Virginia
      to the south, while North Carolina is south of Virginia.


      So, based on the states, Ohio Valley University in WV would likely be north

      - St. Andrews University is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      West Virginia is a northern Appalachian state, bordering Pennsylvania, Ohio,
      Kentucky, Maryland, and Virginia.

      North Carolina is a southeastern state, located south of Virginia.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      In terms of latitude, West Virginia is generally north of North Carolina. The
      entire state of North Carolina lies south of most of West Virginia.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Ohio Valley University is in West Virginia, and St. Andrews University
      is in North Carolina, the former is almost certainly north of the latter.

      Furman University is in South Carolina (SC). Specifically, it''s in Greenville,
      SC, which is in the northwestern part of South Carolina.


      Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus is in Georgia (GA). The Armstrong
      Campus is in Savannah, GA, which is on the Atlantic coast in the eastern part
      of Georgia.


      Now I need to determine which one is further south:


      Georgia is generally south of South Carolina, as South Carolina is directly
      north of Georgia along the Atlantic coast.


      Savannah, GA (where Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus is located)
      is in the far eastern part of Georgia, right near the coast and close to the
      South Carolina border.


      Greenville, SC (where Furman University is located) is in the northwestern part
      of South Carolina.


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - Greenville, SC is further north in South Carolina

      - Savannah, GA is very far south in Georgia, near the coast


      So Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus in Savannah, GA is further south
      than Furman University in Greenville, SC.</think>To answer this question, I
      need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Furman University is located in Greenville, South Carolina, which is in the
      northwestern part of the state.

      - Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus is located in Savannah, Georgia,
      on the Atlantic coast in the eastern part of Georgia.


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      - South Carolina is generally located north of Georgia.

      - Greenville (Furman) is in the northern part of South Carolina.

      - Savannah (GSU-Armstrong) is in the coastal southeastern part of Georgia, near
      the Georgia-South Carolina border.


      Step 3: Determine their relative north-south positioning.

      - Savannah is significantly further south than Greenville.

      - The Armstrong Campus is therefore at a lower latitude than Furman University.

      Ohio is a northern state that borders Lake Erie and is typically north of Tennessee.

      Tennessee is in the southeastern United States, south of Kentucky and north
      of Alabama and Georgia.


      Generally speaking, any location in Ohio would be north of any location in Tennessee,

      to determine the geographic locations of Morehead State University in Kentucky
      and Columbus Technical College in Georgia, and then compare their positions
      to determine which is further south.


      First, let me recall where these institutions are located:


      1. Morehead State University is in Morehead, Kentucky (KY)

      2. Columbus Technical College is in Columbus, Georgia (GA)


      Now, to determine which is further south, I need to consider the general geographic
      positions of Kentucky and Georgia:


      - Kentucky is a state in the upper South/lower Midwest of the United States

      - Georgia is a state in the Deep South of the United States


      Generally speaking, Georgia is further south than Kentucky. Georgia borders
      Florida (the southernmost eastern state), while Kentucky is further north, bordering
      states like Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois.


      To be more specific:

      - Morehead, KY is in the northeastern part of Kentucky

      - Columbus, GA is in the west-central part of Georgia, near the Alabama border


      Given these locations, Columbus, GA would be further south than Morehead, KY.</think>I
      need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Morehead State University is in Morehead, Kentucky (KY)

      - Columbus Technical College is in Columbus, Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Kentucky and Georgia.

      - Kentucky is located in the upper South/lower Midwest region of the United
      States

      - Georgia is located in the Deep South, significantly further south than Kentucky

      - Georgia borders Florida (the southernmost eastern state), while Kentucky is
      much further north


      Step 3: More specifically, Morehead is in northeastern Kentucky, while Columbus
      is in west-central Georgia near the Alabama border.


      Step 4: Compare the locations on a north-south axis.

      Since Georgia is substantially south of Kentucky, Columbus Technical College
      must be south of Morehead State University, not the other way around.

      Morehead State University is located in Morehead, Kentucky.

      Columbus Technical College is located in Columbus, Georgia.


      Now I need to think about their relative positions on a map of the United States:


      Kentucky is generally north of Georgia. Kentucky borders the northern part of

      speaking, Kentucky is north of Georgia.


      Since Morehead State University is in Kentucky and Columbus Technical College
      is in Georgia, it''s very likely that Morehead State University is north of
      Columbus Technical College, not south.


      To be more precise:

      - Morehead, KY is in the eastern part of Kentucky

      - Columbus, GA is in the western part of Georgia, near the Alabama border

      of two universities and compare them:

      1. University of Wisconsin-Waukesha in Wisconsin (WI)

      2. Anderson University in Indiana (IN)


      Let me think about their geographic locations:


      Wisconsin (WI) is a state in the northern part of the United States, bordering
      Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. It''s generally located north of Indiana.


      Indiana (IN) is a state in the Midwest, south of Michigan and east of Illinois.
      It''s generally located south of Wisconsin.


      More specifically:

      - Waukesha, WI would be in the southeastern part of Wisconsin

      - Anderson, IN would be somewhere in Indiana


      Given the general positions of these states, Wisconsin is north of Indiana.
      Therefore, University of Wisconsin-Waukesha would likely be north of Anderson
      University, not south of it.


      So the answer should be NO, University of Wisconsin-Waukesha is NOT located
      south of Anderson University.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative geographic positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - University of Wisconsin-Waukesha is in Waukesha, Wisconsin (WI)

      - Anderson University is in Anderson, Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Wisconsin and Indiana.

      - Wisconsin is located in the northern part of the Midwest

      - Indiana is located in the central Midwest

      - Wisconsin is generally north of Indiana


      Step 3: Be more specific about these cities.

      - Waukesha is in the southeastern part of Wisconsin

      - Anderson is in central Indiana

      - Even though Waukesha is in southern Wisconsin, the entire state of Wisconsin
      is still positioned north of Indiana


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      - Since Wisconsin is north of Indiana, University of Wisconsin-Waukesha would
      be north of Anderson University, not south of it

      First, let''s identify the states:

      - Cincinnati Christian University is in Ohio (OH)

      - Georgia Military College is in Georgia (GA)


      Geographically speaking, Ohio is a northern state, located in the Midwest/Great
      Lakes region of the United States. Georgia is a southern state, located in the
      southeastern United States.


      In terms of latitude:

      - Ohio is generally north of Georgia

      - Georgia is generally south of Ohio


      Since Cincinnati is a city in Ohio, and Ohio is north of Georgia, Cincinnati
      Christian University would be north of Georgia Military College, not south of
      it.


      Therefore, Cincinnati Christian University, OH is NOT located south of Georgia
      Military College, GA. The answer is NO.</think>I need to determine the relative
      geographical positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these universities are located.

      - Cincinnati Christian University is in Ohio (OH)

      - Georgia Military College is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Ohio is a northern state in the Midwest/Great Lakes region

      - Georgia is a southern state in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a north-south axis.

      - Ohio is positioned significantly north of Georgia on the map of the United
      States

      - Cincinnati is a city in southern Ohio, but even southern Ohio is still north
      of Georgia


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Ohio is north of Georgia, Cincinnati Christian University (in Ohio) must
      be north of Georgia Military College (in Georgia), not south of it.

      Since New York is north of Virginia, and Cortland is in New York while the UVA
      Center for Politics is in Virginia, it''s very likely that SUNY Cortland is
      north of UVA Center for Politics, not south.


      Therefore, SUNY Cortland is NOT south of UVA Center for Politics.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step to determine the relative positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - State University of New York at Cortland is located in Cortland, New York.

      - University of Virginia Center for Politics is located in Charlottesville,
      Virginia.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - New York state is located in the northeastern United States.

      - Virginia is located in the mid-Atlantic/southeastern United States.

      - Generally, New York is north of Virginia.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Cortland, NY is in central New York state.

      - Charlottesville, VA is in central Virginia.

      - Following the general north-south arrangement of these states, Cortland would
      be north of Charlottesville.


      Therefore, State University of New York at Cortland is NOT south of University
      of Virginia Center for Politics, but rather north of it.

      locations of two institutions:

      1. State University of New York at Cortland, NY

      2. University of Virginia Center for Politics, VA


      First, I need to identify where these institutions are located.


      SUNY Cortland is in Cortland, New York.

      The University of Virginia Center for Politics is in Charlottesville, Virginia,
      where the University of Virginia is located.


      Now I need to determine which is further north or south. In the United States:

      - New York is in the northeast

      - Virginia is in the mid-Atlantic region, south of New York


      In terms of latitude:

      - Locations in New York state are generally at higher latitudes (more north)
      than locations in Virginia

      - Virginia is south of New York


      Therefore, SUNY Cortland in New York would be north of the University of Virginia
      Center for Politics in Virginia, not south of it.</think># Determining the north-south
      relationship between two institutions


      To answer this question, I need to identify the geographic locations of both
      institutions and compare their latitudes.


      ## Step 1: Locate both institutions

      - State University of New York at Cortland is located in Cortland, New York

      - University of Virginia Center for Politics is located in Charlottesville,
      Virginia


      ## Step 2: Compare the states geographically

      - New York state is in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia is in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States

      - Geographically, New York is north of Virginia


      ## Step 3: Determine the specific north-south relationship

      - Locations in New York generally have higher latitudes (more northerly) than
      locations in Virginia

      - Cortland, NY is therefore north of Charlottesville, VA

      - Since SUNY Cortland is north of UVA Center for Politics, it cannot be south
      of it


      NO'

      these two universities and compare their north-south positions.


      1. Thomas More University in Kentucky (KY)

      2. Southern Polytechnic State University in Georgia (GA)


      First, let me determine where Thomas More University in Kentucky is located.
      Kentucky is generally north of Georgia, but I need to be specific about these
      universities.


      Thomas More University is located in Crestview Hills, Kentucky, which is in
      the northern part of Kentucky, near Cincinnati, Ohio.


      Southern Polytechnic State University is (or was) located in Marietta, Georgia,
      which is in the northern part of Georgia, near Atlanta.


      Now I need to compare their latitudes to determine which is further south.


      Kentucky is a state that borders Georgia to the north, so generally speaking,
      locations in Kentucky are north of locations in Georgia. Crestview Hills, KY
      is in the northernmost part of Kentucky, while Marietta, GA is in the northern
      part of Georgia.


      Given the general geography of the United States, where Georgia is south of
      Kentucky, Southern Polytechnic State University in Georgia would be south of
      Thomas More University in Kentucky.


      So Thomas More University is NOT located south of Southern Polytechnic State
      University.</think># Determining the North-South Positions of the Universities


      I need to compare the geographic locations of these two universities to determine
      which one is further south.


      ## Step 1: Locate Thomas More University, KY

      Thomas More University is located in Crestview Hills, Kentucky, which is in
      the northern part of Kentucky near the Ohio border, close to Cincinnati.


      ## Step 2: Locate Southern Polytechnic State University, GA

      Southern Polytechnic State University (now part of Kennesaw State University)
      was located in Marietta, Georgia, which is in the northern part of Georgia near
      Atlanta.


      ## Step 3: Compare their locations

      Kentucky is entirely north of Georgia in the United States. Even the southernmost
      part of Kentucky is still north of the northernmost part of Georgia. Since Thomas
      More is in northern Kentucky and Southern Polytechnic is in northern Georgia,
      the geographic relationship is clear.


      # Answer: NO


      Thomas More University is NOT located south of Southern Polytechnic State University.
      It is located north of it, as Kentucky is north of Georgia.'

      First, let me identify the locations of each university:

      - University of Scranton is in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which is in the northeastern

      1. Saint Martin''s University in Washington (WA)

      2. California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt in California (CA)


      I need to figure out if the first is south of the second.


      First, let''s identify their locations:

      - Saint Martin''s University is in Washington state, which is on the West Coast,
      north of California.

      - California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt (formerly known as Humboldt
      State University) is in California, specifically in Arcata in Humboldt County,
      which is in the northern part of California.


      Since Washington state is entirely north of California, Saint Martin''s University
      (in WA) must be north of any university in California, including Cal Poly Humboldt.


      Therefore, Saint Martin''s University is NOT south of California State Polytechnic
      University, Humboldt.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the
      relative locations of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Saint Martin''s University is in Washington state (WA)

      - California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Washington state is located on the West Coast, north of California

      - California is south of Washington state


      Step 3: More specifically, Cal Poly Humboldt (formerly Humboldt State) is in
      Arcata, in the northern part of California, but even northern California is
      still south of Washington state.


      Step 4: Since Saint Martin''s University is in Washington, and Washington is
      entirely north of California, Saint Martin''s must be north of Cal Poly Humboldt.

      1. Saint Martin''s University in Washington (WA)

      2. California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt in California (CA)


      I need to figure out if Saint Martin''s is south of Cal Poly Humboldt.


      First, let''s establish where these universities are located:

      - Saint Martin''s University is in Lacey, Washington, which is in the northwestern
      United States.

      - California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt (formerly known as Humboldt
      State University) is in Arcata, California, which is in the far northern part
      of California.


      Washington state is entirely north of California state. So generally speaking,
      locations in Washington would be north of locations in California.


      However, I need to be more precise. Humboldt County is in the very northern
      part of California, near the Oregon border. Lacey, Washington is in the western
      part of Washington, near Olympia (the state capital).


      Despite Humboldt being in the northern part of California, Washington state
      is still north of California. So Saint Martin''s University in Washington would
      be north of Cal Poly Humboldt in California.


      Therefore, Saint Martin''s University is NOT south of California State Polytechnic
      University, Humboldt.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the
      geographic locations of both universities and compare them.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Saint Martin''s University is located in Lacey, Washington (WA), which is
      in the northwestern United States.

      - California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt (formerly Humboldt State)
      is located in Arcata, California (CA), in the northern part of California.


      Step 2: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Washington state is entirely north of California state.

      - Even though Cal Poly Humboldt is in the northernmost part of California, it''s
      still south of Washington state.

      - Lacey, WA (where Saint Martin''s is located) is significantly north of Arcata,
      CA (where Cal Poly Humboldt is located).


      Step 3: Reach a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Saint Martin''s University in Washington is north of Cal Poly Humboldt
      in California, Saint Martin''s is NOT south of Cal Poly Humboldt.


      NO'

      2. California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt in California (CA)


      Then I need to compare their positions to determine if Saint Martin''s is south
      of Cal Poly Humboldt.


      Let me think about where these universities are located:


      Saint Martin''s University is in Lacey, Washington, which is near Olympia (the
      capital of Washington). Washington state is north of California on the west
      coast of the United States.


      California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt (formerly known as Humboldt
      State University) is located in Arcata, California, which is in the northern
      part of California.


      So geographically:

      - Washington state is entirely north of California

      - Saint Martin''s is in Washington

      - Cal Poly Humboldt is in northern California


      Since Washington state is north of California, and Saint Martin''s is in Washington
      while Cal Poly Humboldt is in California, Saint Martin''s University is NOT
      south of Cal Poly Humboldt. In fact, it''s the opposite - Saint Martin''s is
      north of Cal Poly Humboldt.</think># Step-by-step reasoning


      To determine if Saint Martin''s University is south of California State Polytechnic
      University, Humboldt, I need to identify where each institution is located geographically.


      1. Saint Martin''s University is located in Lacey, Washington (WA)

      2. California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt is located in Arcata, California
      (CA)


      Looking at the geography of the west coast of the United States:

      - Washington state is positioned entirely north of California state

      - Lacey, WA is in the western part of Washington

      - Arcata, CA is in the northern part of California


      Since Washington state is geographically north of California, any location in
      Washington (including Lacey) would be north of any location in California (including
      Arcata).


      Therefore, Saint Martin''s University is NOT south of Cal Poly Humboldt - it''s
      actually north of it.

      - Lacey, WA is in western Washington.

      - Arcata, CA is in the far northern part of California.


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      - Even though Cal Poly Humboldt is in northern California, any location in Washington

      to determine the locations of both colleges and compare their geographical positions,
      specifically whether Webb Institute, NY is south of Elizabeth City State University,
      NC.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      1. Webb Institute is located in New York (NY)

      2. Elizabeth City State University is located in North Carolina (NC)


      Generally, New York is north of North Carolina in the United States. But I need
      to be more specific about these particular institutions.


      Webb Institute is located in Glen Cove, NY, which is on Long Island.

      Elizabeth City State University is located in Elizabeth City, NC.


      In the United States, states generally follow a north-to-south pattern where
      New York is considerably north of North Carolina. New York is in the northeastern
      part of the country, while North Carolina is in the southeastern part.


      Given this geographical arrangement, Webb Institute in New York would be north
      of Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina, not south of it.


      Therefore, Webb Institute, NY is NOT located south of Elizabeth City State University,
      NC.</think>I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two
      institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Webb Institute is in New York (NY)

      - Elizabeth City State University is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States

      - Generally speaking, New York is north of North Carolina


      Step 3: Be more specific about the institutions'' locations.

      - Webb Institute is specifically in Glen Cove, NY, on Long Island

      - Elizabeth City State University is in Elizabeth City, NC, in the northeastern
      part of North Carolina


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      - Even though Elizabeth City is in the northern part of North Carolina, all
      of New York state (including Long Island where Webb Institute is located) is
      farther north than any part of North Carolina.


      NO'

      1. Webb Institute is located in Glen Cove, New York on Long Island.

      2. Elizabeth City State University is located in Elizabeth City, North Carolina.


      Generally speaking, New York is north of North Carolina in the United States.
      But to be precise, I need to consider the specific locations.


      New York is in the northeastern United States, while North Carolina is in the
      southeastern United States. This means that typically, locations in New York
      would be north of locations in North Carolina.


      Glen Cove, NY (where Webb Institute is located) is on Long Island, which is
      fairly far south in New York state, but still north of the North Carolina border.


      Elizabeth City, NC (where Elizabeth City State University is located) is in
      the northeastern part of North Carolina, fairly close to the Virginia border.


      Even with Elizabeth City being in northern North Carolina and Glen Cove being
      in southern New York, the general geography of the US would put Glen Cove further
      north than Elizabeth City.


      So Webb Institute in NY should be NORTH of Elizabeth City State University in
      NC, not south.</think>To determine if Webb Institute, NY is located south of
      Elizabeth City State University, NC, I need to compare their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Webb Institute is located in Glen Cove, New York, on Long Island.

      - Elizabeth City State University is located in Elizabeth City, North Carolina.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions.

      - New York state is located in the northeastern United States.

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States.

      - Generally, locations in New York are north of locations in North Carolina.


      Step 3: Consider specific positioning.

      - Even though Glen Cove (Webb Institute) is in southern New York (on Long Island)
      and Elizabeth City is in northeastern North Carolina, the general north-south
      geography of the US still places New York locations north of North Carolina
      locations.


      NO, Webb Institute in NY is not located south of Elizabeth City State University
      in NC. It is located north of it.'

      in New York is located south of Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina,
      I need to determine their relative latitudes.


      First, let me locate each institution:


      Webb Institute is located in Glen Cove, New York, which is on Long Island.

      Elizabeth City State University is located in Elizabeth City, North Carolina.


      Now I need to determine which one is further south (i.e., which has the lower
      latitude).


      New York is generally north of North Carolina in the United States. North Carolina
      is a southern state while New York is a northern state.


      To be more specific:

      - Glen Cove, NY (where Webb Institute is located) is on Long Island in the southeastern
      part of New York state

      - Elizabeth City, NC (where Elizabeth City State University is located) is in
      the northeastern part of North Carolina


      However, even though Elizabeth City is in the northern part of North Carolina,
      North Carolina as a whole is significantly south of New York state. The northernmost
      parts of North Carolina are still south of the southernmost parts of New York.


      Therefore, Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina is south of Webb
      Institute in New York, not the other way around.</think># Is Webb Institute,
      NY located south of Elizabeth City State University, NC?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two institutions
      by considering their locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Webb Institute is in Glen Cove, New York (on Long Island)

      - Elizabeth City State University is in Elizabeth City, North Carolina


      ## Step 2: Compare the states geographically

      - New York is a northern state

      - North Carolina is a southern state that lies significantly south of New York


      ## Step 3: Consider specific locations within states

      - Even though Webb Institute is on Long Island (southern New York), New York''s
      southernmost points are still north of North Carolina''s northernmost points

      - Elizabeth City is in northeastern North Carolina, but this is still well south
      of any point in New York


      ## Conclusion

      NO - Webb Institute is not south of Elizabeth City State University. Webb Institute
      is located NORTH of Elizabeth City State University.'

      Step 2: Let me identify where Lake Michigan College is located.

      Lake Michigan College is in Michigan (MI), and based on its name, it''s likely
      near Lake Michigan.


      Step 3: Think about the geography of Wisconsin and Michigan in relation to Lake
      Michigan.

      - Wisconsin is west of Lake Michigan

      - Michigan is east of Lake Michigan

      - "Northeast Wisconsin" would be in the northeastern part of Wisconsin, likely

      - Shenandoah University is located in Winchester, Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Pennsylvania and Virginia.

      - Pennsylvania is a northern state

      - Virginia is south of Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      Since Pennsylvania is located north of Virginia on the US map, and these universities
      are in their respective states, PennWest Edinboro must be north of Shenandoah
      University, not south of it.

      East Central University is located in Ada, Oklahoma.

      Texas A&M University-San Antonio is located in San Antonio, Texas.


      2. Now I need to determine their relative north-south positions.


      Oklahoma is north of Texas on a map of the United States.

      Ada, OK is in the southern part of Oklahoma.

      San Antonio, TX is in the southern part of Texas.


      3. Even though Ada is in southern Oklahoma and San Antonio is in southern Texas,

      To answer whether East Central University (OK) is south of Texas A&M University-San
      Antonio (TX), I need to determine their geographic positions relative to each
      other.


      ## Step 1: Locate the universities

      - East Central University is in Ada, Oklahoma

      - Texas A&M University-San Antonio is in San Antonio, Texas


      ## Step 2: Compare their north-south positions

      - Oklahoma is located entirely north of Texas on the map

      - Ada, Oklahoma is in the southern part of Oklahoma

      - San Antonio, Texas is in the southern part of Texas

      - Even though both cities are in the southern portions of their respective states,
      Oklahoma itself is north of Texas


      ## Step 3: Make the determination

      Since Oklahoma is north of Texas geographically, East Central University (in
      Oklahoma) must be north of Texas A&M University-San Antonio (in Texas).


      NO, East Central University is not south of Texas A&M University-San Antonio.
      It is north of it.'

      - Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia (Pennsylvania borders Maryland
      to its south, and Maryland borders Virginia).

      - Erie, PA is in the far northern part of Pennsylvania.

      - Danville, VA is in the southern portion of Virginia.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on their positions.

      - Since Mercyhurst is in northern Pennsylvania and Averett is in southern Virginia,
      Mercyhurst is significantly north of Averett.


      NO, Mercyhurst University in Pennsylvania is not located south of Averett University

      1. Adams State University is located in Alamosa, Colorado (CO).

      2. New Mexico State University Carlsbad is located in Carlsbad, New Mexico (NM).


      Now I need to determine if Adams State (in CO) is south of NMSU Carlsbad (in
      NM).


      Generally speaking, Colorado is north of New Mexico in the United States. Colorado''s
      southern border connects with New Mexico''s northern border. So typically, locations
      in Colorado would be north of locations in New Mexico.


      Let me think about the specific cities:

      - Alamosa, CO is in southern Colorado, not far from the New Mexico border

      - Carlsbad, NM is in southeastern New Mexico, near the Texas border


      Given that Colorado is north of New Mexico, and these specific locations don''t
      change that fundamental geographic relationship, Adams State University in Alamosa,
      CO would be north of New Mexico State University Carlsbad in Carlsbad, NM.


      So Adams State University is NOT south of NMSU Carlsbad.</think>I''ll think
      about this step by step.


      First, I need to identify where each university is located:

      - Adams State University is in Alamosa, Colorado

      - New Mexico State University Carlsbad is in Carlsbad, New Mexico


      Next, I need to consider the geographic relationship between these locations:

      - Colorado is directly north of New Mexico in the United States

      - Alamosa is in southern Colorado, but still north of the Colorado-New Mexico
      border

      - Carlsbad is in southeastern New Mexico


      Since Colorado is north of New Mexico, and these specific cities maintain this
      north-south relationship (Alamosa is in southern Colorado but still north of
      any location in New Mexico), Adams State University must be north of NMSU Carlsbad,
      not south of it.

      2. University of Louisiana at Lafayette is in Lafayette, Louisiana


      Now I need to determine which is further south. Generally speaking, Louisiana
      is south of Arkansas, as Arkansas borders the northern part of Louisiana. Let

      Monticello, AR is in the southeastern part of Arkansas.

      Lafayette, LA is in the southern part of Louisiana.


      Looking at the geography of the United States, Louisiana is directly south of
      Arkansas. Even though Monticello is in the southern part of Arkansas, it would
      still be north of most cities in Louisiana, including Lafayette which is in

      - Arkansas is a state that sits directly north of Louisiana

      - Louisiana borders the Gulf of Mexico in the south


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Monticello is located in southeastern Arkansas

      - Lafayette is located in south-central Louisiana


      Step 4: Compare the latitudes.

      - Even though Monticello is in southern Arkansas, the entire state of Arkansas

      - Arkansas State University-Newport is in Newport, Arkansas (AR)

      - University of New Orleans is in New Orleans, Louisiana (LA)


      Now I need to determine whether Newport, Arkansas is south of New Orleans, Louisiana.


      Arkansas is generally north of Louisiana in the United States. Louisiana is

      More specifically:

      - Newport, Arkansas is in the northeastern part of Arkansas

      - New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana, near the Gulf of Mexico

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - Calvary University is in Missouri (MO)

      - Oklahoma State University-Tulsa is in Oklahoma (OK)


      To determine if one is south of the other, I need to compare their latitudes.

      - Oklahoma State University-Tulsa is located in Tulsa, Oklahoma


      Step 2: Examine the geographic relationship between Missouri and Oklahoma.

      Missouri is positioned north of Oklahoma. The southern border of Missouri is
      adjacent to the northern border of Oklahoma.


      Step 3: Compare the specific cities.

      Kansas City is in the western part of Missouri, near its border with Kansas.

      Tulsa is in northeastern Oklahoma.


      Step 4: Determine north-south positioning.

      Since Missouri is north of Oklahoma, and Kansas City (in Missouri) is north

      of Husson University, ME and Bryant University, RI to determine which one is
      further south.


      ME refers to Maine, and RI refers to Rhode Island. These are two states in the
      northeastern United States.


      Let me think about the general geographic positions of these states:

      - Maine is the northernmost state in New England, located at the northeastern
      corner of the US

      - Rhode Island is also in New England, but it''s located more south, near Connecticut
      and Massachusetts


      In terms of latitude (north-south position):

      - Maine is further north

      - Rhode Island is further south


      Since Husson University is in Maine (ME) and Bryant University is in Rhode Island
      (RI), we can generally say that Husson University is north of Bryant University,
      not south of it.


      Therefore, the answer should be NO - Husson University, ME is NOT located south
      of Bryant University, RI. It''s located north of it.</think>I need to determine
      the relative north-south positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Husson University is in ME (Maine)

      - Bryant University is in RI (Rhode Island)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Maine is the northernmost state in New England, located at the northeastern
      corner of the United States

      - Rhode Island is also in New England, but is positioned significantly further
      south than Maine


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Maine is clearly north of Rhode Island on the map. Since Husson University is
      in Maine and Bryant University is in Rhode Island, Husson must be north of Bryant
      (not south).


      NO'

      To solve this, I need to know the geographic locations of these universities.
      Let me think about where Maine and Rhode Island are located in the United States.


      Maine (ME) is the northeasternmost state in the contiguous United States. It''s
      located at the very top of New England.


      Rhode Island (RI) is also in New England, but it''s located south of Maine.
      Rhode Island is the southernmost state in New England, bordered by Connecticut
      to the west and Massachusetts to the north and east.


      Since Husson University is in Maine and Bryant University is in Rhode Island,
      and Maine is north of Rhode Island, Husson University would be north of Bryant
      University, not south.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Husson University is not located south of Bryant
      University. It''s located north of it.</think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative geographic positions of these two universities based

      - Bryant University is located in Rhode Island (RI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Maine is located in the northeasternmost part of the contiguous United States

      - Rhode Island is also in New England, but is positioned significantly south
      of Maine


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Maine is north of Rhode Island on the map

      - Therefore, a university in Maine would be north of a university in Rhode Island


      NO, Husson University in Maine is not located south of Bryant University in
      Rhode Island. It is located north of it.'

      2. Western Kentucky University-Owensboro is located in Owensboro, Kentucky


      Now, to determine which is further south, I need to think about the geographic
      positions of these places.


      Indiana is generally north of Kentucky. The entire state of Kentucky is south

      1) First, I need to identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Concordia Seminary is in Missouri (MO)

      - University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry is in Mississippi
      (MS)


      2) Now I need to determine which is further south.


      Missouri is generally north of Mississippi in the United States. Missouri is
      in the Midwest region while Mississippi is in the Deep South.


      Missouri''s southern border is at approximately 36.5 degrees north latitude,
      while Mississippi extends from about 35 degrees north at its northern border
      to about 30 degrees north at its southern border.


      Since Concordia Seminary is in Missouri and the University of Mississippi Medical
      Center School of Dentistry is in Mississippi, it''s very likely that the Mississippi
      institution is further south than the Missouri institution.


      Therefore, Concordia Seminary (in MO) is NOT located south of University of
      Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry (in MS). Rather, it''s the other
      way around - the Mississippi institution is south of the Missouri one.</think>#
      Determining Which Institution is Further South


      To answer this question, I need to identify the locations of both institutions
      and determine their relative positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Concordia Seminary is located in St. Louis, Missouri (MO)

      - University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry is located in
      Jackson, Mississippi (MS)


      ## Step 2: Compare geographical positions

      Missouri is generally located north of Mississippi in the United States:

      - Missouri is in the Midwest region

      - Mississippi is in the Deep South region

      - On a map of the US, Mississippi is positioned significantly south of Missouri


      ## Step 3: Draw conclusion

      Since Concordia Seminary is in Missouri and the University of Mississippi Medical
      Center School of Dentistry is in Mississippi, the Mississippi institution is
      further south than the Missouri institution.


      # Answer: NO


      Concordia Seminary (MO) is NOT located south of the University of Mississippi

      First, let me identify the locations:

      1. Concordia Seminary is in Missouri (MO)

      2. University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry is in Mississippi
      (MS)


      Now I need to determine which one is more north or south. I''ll think about
      the general geography of these states:


      Missouri is north of Mississippi in the United States. Missouri borders Iowa
      to the north and Arkansas to the south, while Mississippi borders Tennessee
      to the north and Louisiana to the south.


      Since Missouri is a state that''s entirely north of Mississippi, any location
      in Missouri would be north of any location in Mississippi.


      Therefore, Concordia Seminary in Missouri would be north of the University of
      Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry in Mississippi.


      If Concordia Seminary is north of the dental school, then the dental school
      is south of Concordia Seminary.


      So, is Concordia Seminary located south of the dental school? No, it''s the
      opposite - Concordia Seminary is north of the dental school.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the geographic locations of both institutions
      and compare them.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Concordia Seminary is located in Missouri (MO)

      - University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry is located in
      Mississippi (MS)


      Step 2: Compare the geographic positions of Missouri and Mississippi.

      - Missouri is a midwestern state that sits north of Arkansas

      - Mississippi is a southern state that borders the Gulf of Mexico

      - Missouri is geographically north of Mississippi


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on the states'' positions.

      Since Missouri is entirely north of Mississippi on the map, Concordia Seminary
      (in MO) must be north of the University of Mississippi Medical Center School
      of Dentistry (in MS).


      NO, Concordia Seminary is not located south of University of Mississippi Medical

      Florida State University, both of which are located in Tallahassee, Florida.
      Tallahassee is in the northern part of Florida, near the Georgia border.


      Now, let''s think about their relative positions:


      Georgia is directly north of Florida. Within these states, Morrow, GA (where
      Clayton State is) is in northern Georgia, while Tallahassee, FL (where the joint

      - Clayton State University is located in Morrow, Georgia, which is in the Atlanta
      metropolitan area

      - The FAMU-FSU College of Engineering is located in Tallahassee, Florida


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Georgia and Florida

      - Georgia is directly north of Florida

      - Morrow, GA is in the northern part of Georgia

      - Tallahassee, FL is in the northern part of Florida, near the Georgia border


      ## Step 3: Compare the relative positions

      - Even though both are in the northern parts of their respective states, the
      fact that Georgia is entirely north of Florida means that any location in Georgia
      (including Clayton State) would be north of any location in Florida (including
      the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering)


      NO - Clayton State University is not south of the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering.

      - New Jersey is also in the northeastern United States

      - Critically, New Hampshire is located NORTH of New Jersey on the map


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion about the relative positions.

      Since Franklin Pierce University is in New Hampshire, and New Hampshire is north
      of New Jersey (where the Liechtenstein Institute is located), Franklin Pierce
      University is positioned north of the Liechtenstein Institute, not south of
      it.

      step:


      1. I need to determine the locations of Franklin Pierce University in New Hampshire
      (NH) and the Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination in New Jersey (NJ).


      2. Franklin Pierce University is located in Rindge, New Hampshire, which is
      in the northeastern United States.


      3. The Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination is likely at Princeton
      University in Princeton, New Jersey (based on my knowledge, this is where this

      4. To determine which is further south, I need to compare their geographical

      5. New Hampshire is generally north of New Jersey in the United States. New
      Hampshire borders Canada to the north and Massachusetts to the south, while
      New Jersey is further south, between New York and Pennsylvania.


      6. Therefore, Franklin Pierce University in NH would be north of the Liechtenstein

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Franklin Pierce University is located in Rindge, New Hampshire (NH)

      - The Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination is located at Princeton
      University in Princeton, New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Compare the geographical positions.

      - New Hampshire is in the northeastern United States, bordering Canada to the
      north and Massachusetts to the south

      - New Jersey is further south, positioned between New York and Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      - States in the northeastern US are generally arranged with more northern states
      (like NH) above more southern states (like NJ)

      - New Hampshire is north of New Jersey on a map of the United States


      Therefore, Franklin Pierce University (NH) is located NORTH of the Liechtenstein

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - IDSVA is in Maine (ME)

      - University of New Haven is in Connecticut (CT)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of Maine and Connecticut.

      Maine is located in the northeastern United States, at the northernmost part
      of New England.

      Connecticut is also in New England, but is located south of Maine.


      Looking at a map of the United States, Maine is definitely north of Connecticut.
      Maine borders New Hampshire to the west and Canada to the north and east. Connecticut
      is much further south, bordering Massachusetts to the north, Rhode Island to
      the east, and New York to the west.


      Step 3: Conclude based on state positions.

      Since Maine is north of Connecticut, and IDSVA is in Maine while the University
      of New Haven is in Connecticut, IDSVA must be north of the University of New
      Haven.

      - Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts (IDSVA) is in Maine (ME)

      - University of New Haven is in Connecticut (CT)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of Maine and Connecticut.

      Maine is located in the northernmost part of New England in the northeastern
      United States.

      Connecticut is also in New England, but is positioned significantly south of
      Maine.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      On a north-south axis, Maine is clearly north of Connecticut. This means that
      any institution in Maine would be north of an institution in Connecticut.


      NO, the Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts in Maine is NOT located

      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Determine the locations of both institutions

      2. Compare their latitudes (north-south positions)


      Let me think about the general geography:

      - Maine (ME) is a state in the northeastern United States, at the very top of
      New England

      - Connecticut (CT) is also in New England, but is located south of Maine


      Maine is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US, while Connecticut
      is further south. This means that generally, locations in Maine would be north
      of locations in Connecticut.


      The Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts is in Maine, and the University
      of New Haven is in Connecticut. Based on the states'' positions, the institution
      in Maine would be north of the one in Connecticut, not south.


      Therefore, the Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts is NOT located
      south of the University of New Haven.</think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative north-south positions of these two institutions by

      - The University of New Haven is in Connecticut (CT)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between Maine and Connecticut.

      Maine is located in the northernmost part of New England, while Connecticut
      is located further south in New England.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Since Maine is north of Connecticut on the map of the United States, any institution
      in Maine would be north of (not south of) an institution in Connecticut.


      NO, the Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts in Maine is not located
