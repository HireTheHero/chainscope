      Agar Malwa district has a population of approximately 500,000-600,000 people.

      However, if we''re referring to Perth, Western Australia, it has a population

      If we''re referring to any settlement called Perth in Tasmania (which would
      be very small if it exists at all), it would almost certainly have fewer than
      500,000 people, as even Hobart (Tasmania''s capital) has only about 240,000
