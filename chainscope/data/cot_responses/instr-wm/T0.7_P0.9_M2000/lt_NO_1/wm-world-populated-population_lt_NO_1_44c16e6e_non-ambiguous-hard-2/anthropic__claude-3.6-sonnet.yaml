      - Department of Ayacucho has a population of around 700,000 people

      - Mulapadu is a small village, and while I don''t have exact population figures,
      as a village in India it would likely have a population of a few thousand people
      at most


      3. Compare:

      - A department (state-level division) vs a village

      - 700,000 vs likely a few thousand

      - The department is clearly much larger in population


      Therefore:

      NO (Ayacucho is NOT less populous than Mulapadu)'

      1. Montserrado County is a county in Liberia that contains the capital city
      Monrovia

      2. As it contains the capital city, it''s the most populous county in Liberia

      3. Its population is around 1.4 million people

      7. Comparing: 1.4 million (Montserrado) vs 13,000 (Beryslav)

      8. 1.4 million is much larger than 13,000


      Answer: NO (Montserrado County is NOT less populous than Beryslav)'

      1) First, let me find the population of Agar Malwa district (in Madhya Pradesh,
      India)

      - Agar Malwa district has a population of approximately 500,000 people


      2) Next, let me find the population of Perth, Tasmania

      - Wait, there seems to be a misunderstanding - Perth is in Western Australia,
      not Tasmania

      - Hobart is the major city in Tasmania

      - Perth, Tasmania appears to be a very small town, if it exists at all


      3) Since Perth, Tasmania is either a very small town or doesn''t exist as a
      significant settlement, while Agar Malwa district has about 500,000 people...


      NO - Agar Malwa district is NOT less populous than Perth, Tasmania. It is significantly
