      1. Harare Province is located in Zimbabwe, Africa

      - It is an urban province that includes Zimbabwe''s capital city

      - Zimbabwe is a country with over 14 million people

      - Harare Province itself likely has several hundred thousand to over a million
      people


      2. Geiranger is a small village in Norway

      - It is located in a fjord region

      - Norway has a very low population density

      - Geiranger itself has fewer than 300 permanent residents


      3. Comparing population:

      - Harare Province: Hundreds of thousands to over a million people

      - Geiranger: Less than 300 people


      4. Therefore, Harare Province is significantly MORE populous than Geiranger.
