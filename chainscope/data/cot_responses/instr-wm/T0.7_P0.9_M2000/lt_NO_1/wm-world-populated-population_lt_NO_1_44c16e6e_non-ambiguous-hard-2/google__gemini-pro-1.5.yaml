      Dongsheng District is part of Ordos City, Inner Mongolia, China.  It''s a significant
      urban area.  Finding a precise, reliable population number for a district within
      a Chinese city can be challenging.  It''s likely well over 100,000 people, possibly
      several hundred thousand.


      2. **Find the population of Reni, Ukraine:** Reni is a relatively small city.
      Internet searches suggest a population of under 20,000, potentially closer to
      10,000, especially given recent events.

      figures, Dongsheng District is almost certainly significantly larger than Reni.

      * **Step 2: What is Mundgod?** Mundgod is a town in Karnataka, India.


      * **Step 3: Comparing populations:**  The Sahel region spans a vast area and

      a single town, will undoubtedly have a much smaller population.

      The Sahel is a vast semi-arid region in Africa, stretching across multiple countries.
      It has a substantial population, though precise numbers are difficult to pin
      down due to nomadic populations and census challenges.


      * **Step 2: What is Mundgod?** Mundgod is a town in Karnataka, India.  It''s
      known for its Tibetan settlements but is still a relatively small town.


      * **Step 3: Comparing populations:** A vast region spanning multiple countries
      (Sahel) is virtually guaranteed to have a larger population than a single small
      town (Mundgod).


      * **Step 4: Answering the question:** Is the Sahel Region *less* populous than
      Mundgod?  NO.
