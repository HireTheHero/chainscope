      of Tswelopele Local Municipality. According to the 2011 census, the population
      of Tswelopele Local Municipality was about 53,651. However, for a more accurate
      comparison, we should consider more recent estimates if available. Assuming
      the population might have grown, let''s consider that the actual number could
      be higher but not drastically different from the 2011 figure, given the general
      population growth rates.

      less populous than Reni, Ukraine, we need to follow a few steps of reasoning
      and gather some information.


      1. **Identify Dongsheng District**: First, we need to identify where Dongsheng
      District is. After research, it appears that Dongsheng District is located in
      Ordos City, Inner Mongolia, China. This gives us a clear location for one of
      the places in question.


      2. **Population of Dongsheng District**: Next, we need to find out the population
      of Dongsheng District. As of my last update, specific and current population
      figures for Dongsheng District might not be readily available without the most
      recent census data or official statistics. However, considering it''s a district
      within a city in China, the population is likely to be significant, potentially
      in the hundreds of thousands or more, given the population density of many Chinese
      cities.


      3. **Identify Reni, Ukraine**: Reni is a city located in the Odessa Oblast of
      Ukraine. It''s situated in the southwestern part of the country.


      4. **Population of Reni, Ukraine**: The population of Reni, Ukraine, as of the

      small city compared to many urban areas in China.


      5. **Comparison**: Comparing the population of Dongsheng District to that of
      Reni, Ukraine, given that Dongsheng is part of a larger urban area in China
      and considering the general population sizes of Chinese districts versus small
      Ukrainian cities, it is reasonable to infer that Dongsheng District would have
      a significantly larger population than Reni, Ukraine.

    7c932083-8e18-43a2-8dcc-2015e011b92b: 'To determine if Bishnupur subdivision is
      less populous than Middle Bass Island, let''s analyze the information step by
      step.


      1. **Identify Bishnupur Subdivision**: Bishnupur is a subdivision (or sub-division)
      in the South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, India. It is known for its
      historical and cultural significance.


      2. **Population of Bishnupur Subdivision**: The population of the Bishnupur
      subdivision, as per the 2011 census, includes the population of Bishnupur I
      and Bishnupur II community development blocks (CD blocks). The combined population
      of these areas is substantial, given the urban and rural areas within its boundaries.


      3. **Identify Middle Bass Island**: Middle Bass Island is one of the Lake Erie
      Islands in Ohio, United States. It is much smaller in terms of land area compared
      to Bishnupur subdivision.


      4. **Population of Middle Bass Island**: Middle Bass Island has a very small
      population. As of the 2020 census, the population of Middle Bass Island is not
      explicitly stated, but considering it''s a small island with limited residential
      areas, the population is expected to be very low, likely fewer than 100 permanent
      residents, though it can swell with seasonal visitors.


      5. **Comparison**: Given the significant difference in size and the nature of
      these two places (one being a subdivision with urban and rural areas in India
      and the other being a small island in the United States), it''s reasonable to
      infer that Bishnupur subdivision would have a much larger population than Middle
      Bass Island.


      Based on the above analysis, the answer to whether Bishnupur subdivision is
      less populous than Middle Bass Island is: **NO**'

      Islands in Ohio, United States. It''s a small island with limited residential
      areas and is more known for its natural beauty and as a tourist destination.


      3. **Population of Bishnupur Subdivision**: The population of Bishnupur subdivision,
      as part of a larger administrative district in India, would likely be in the
      tens or hundreds of thousands, given the densely populated nature of many areas
      in India.


      4. **Population of Middle Bass Island**: Middle Bass Island has a very small
      population. According to the 2020 census, the population of the entire Put-in-Bay
      Township, which includes several islands (South Bass Island, Middle Bass Island,
      and others), is less than 2,000 people. The specific population of Middle Bass
      Island alone would be significantly smaller, likely in the low hundreds or less.


      5. **Comparison**: Given the vast difference in the geographical and demographic
      contexts of these two places, with Bishnupur subdivision being part of a densely
      populated region in India and Middle Bass Island being a small, sparsely populated
      island in the United States, it''s reasonable to conclude that Bishnupur subdivision

    6a843632-5001-48c7-a854-2ca10cce2e48: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Department of Ayacucho is a region in Peru, and
      Mulapadu is presumably a location, possibly a village or town, but without specific
      context, it''s hard to pinpoint its exact location or population. For the sake
      of this question, let''s assume Mulapadu refers to a specific, possibly small,
      settlement.


      2. **Population of Department of Ayacucho**: The Department of Ayacucho in Peru
      has a significant population. According to the 2017 census, the region had approximately
      551,000 inhabitants. This number may have changed slightly since then due to
      population growth or decline, but it gives us a rough estimate.


      3. **Population of Mulapadu**: Without specific details on Mulapadu, including
      its country or region, it''s challenging to determine its exact population.
      However, given the context of the question, it seems likely that Mulapadu is
      being compared as a smaller entity (possibly a village or small town) to a larger
      administrative division like the Department of Ayacucho.


      4. **Comparison**: Generally, a department in a country like Peru would encompass
      multiple towns, cities, and villages, making it more populous than a single
      village or town like Mulapadu. Unless Mulapadu is an exceptionally large city,
      which seems unlikely given the comparison to an entire department, the Department
      of Ayacucho would likely have a larger population.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the typical population sizes of departments versus
      individual towns or villages, the Department of Ayacucho is likely more populous
      than Mulapadu.

      the population of both the Sahel Region and Mundgod.


      1. **Identify the Sahel Region**: The Sahel is a transitional zone in Africa
      between the Sahara Desert to the north and the Sudanian Savanna to the south.
      It spans across several countries, including Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina
      Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Central African Republic, South Sudan, Sudan, Ethiopia,
      and Eritrea. The population of the Sahel Region is estimated to be over 100
      million people, given its vast area and the number of countries it covers.


      2. **Identify Mundgod**: Mundgod is a town in the Uttara Kannada district of
      Karnataka, India. It''s known for being the site of the Tibetan settlement of
      Doeguling (also known as Mundgod Tibetan Settlement) which was established in
      1966. The population of Mundgod and its surrounding settlements, including the
      Tibetan refugee settlements, is significantly smaller compared to large regions
      or cities. The population of Mundgod town itself and the nearby settlements
      combined is in the tens of thousands.


      3. **Compare Populations**: Given that the Sahel Region covers a vast area across
      several countries with a population in the tens of millions, and comparing it
      to Mundgod, which has a population in the tens of thousands, it''s clear that
      the Sahel Region is much more populous than Mundgod.


      Therefore, considering the vast difference in population, the answer to whether
      the Sahel Region is less populous than Mundgod is: **NO**.'
    48cb4c8e-8e1b-48c0-b939-06b9453679a4: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the population of both the Sahel Region and Mundgod, and then compare them.


      1. **Identify the Sahel Region**: The Sahel Region is a transitional zone in
      Africa between the Sahara Desert to the north and the Sudanian Savanna to the
      south. It stretches across several countries, including Senegal, Mauritania,
      Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Sudan, and Eritrea. The Sahel Region
      is known for its arid climate and covers a vast area.


      2. **Population of the Sahel Region**: Estimating the exact population of the
      Sahel Region can be challenging due to its vast size and the fact that it spans
      across multiple countries. However, it is home to a significant population.
      According to various sources, the population of the Sahel Region is approximately
      150 million people, though this number can vary depending on the definition
      of the region''s boundaries and the source of the data.


      3. **Identify Mundgod**: Mundgod is a town in the Uttara Kannada district of
      Karnataka, India. It is known for being a major Tibetan settlement area outside
      of Tibet, with several Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and a significant Tibetan
      population.


      4. **Population of Mundgod**: The population of Mundgod is significantly smaller
      than that of the Sahel Region. According to the 2011 census of India, the population
      of Mundgod town was around 18,000 people. Even considering the broader area
      or taluka (sub-district) of Mundgod, the population would not exceed a few tens
      of thousands of people.


      5. **Comparison**: Given the population of the Sahel Region (approximately 150
      million) and that of Mundgod (tens of thousands), it is clear that the Sahel
      Region is far more populous than Mundgod.

      is less populous than Yunta, South Australia, let''s break down the information
      step by step:


      1. **Identify Zona da Mata (Minas Gerais):** Zona da Mata is a region in the
      state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. It''s known for its historical and cultural significance,
      as well as its coffee production.


      2. **Population of Zona da Mata (Minas Gerais):** Without the exact population
      figures at hand, we know that Zona da Mata encompasses several cities and towns.
      Given its historical importance and the fact that it''s part of Minas Gerais,
      one of the most populous states in Brazil, it''s reasonable to infer that the
      population is substantial. However, for precise comparisons, exact numbers would
      be ideal. Let''s proceed with the understanding that it''s a notable region
      within a populous state.


      3. **Identify Yunta, South Australia:** Yunta is a small town in South Australia.
      It''s known for its rural setting and is part of the Outback region, which is
      generally less populated compared to urban areas.


      4. **Population of Yunta, South Australia:** Yunta is described as a small town,
      which typically implies a low population. Exact figures might not be readily
      available, but given its classification as a small town in a rural area, it''s
      logical to conclude that its population is relatively small, likely in the hundreds
      or low thousands.


      5. **Comparison:** Without exact numbers, we can make an educated guess based
      on the characteristics of each location. Zona da Mata, being part of a populous
      state in Brazil and encompassing multiple cities and towns, is likely to have
      a significantly larger population than a small town like Yunta in rural South
      Australia.


      Based on these steps, it''s reasonable to conclude that Zona da Mata (Minas
      Gerais) is more populous than Yunta, South Australia. Therefore, the answer
      to whether Zona da Mata is less populous than Yunta is:

      2. **Population Data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both places.
      As of my last update, Buleleng Regency has a population of approximately 728,771
      people, according to the 2020 estimates. For Mulakuzha, specific population
      figures can be challenging to find due to its smaller size and less global recognition.
      However, considering it''s a village, its population would likely be significantly
      less than that of a regency.


      3. **Comparison**: Given the vast difference in administrative levels (a regency

      multiple towns, villages, and possibly cities, would have a larger population
      than a single village.

      Mulakuzha, on the other hand, seems to refer to a village or a smaller administrative

      2. **Population Comparison Basis**: To compare their populations, we need to
      understand the typical population sizes of regencies in Indonesia and villages
      or similar administrative units in India. Generally, a regency (or kabupaten)
      in Indonesia is a second-level administrative division below the province level

      with a rough and potentially lower estimate of 200,000 to 400,000 people (considering
      it''s a part of a larger district that has around 1.5 million people), is significantly
      more populous than Perth, Tasmania.


      Based on the steps above, the answer is: **NO**'
    393fe386-9914-4838-8c8a-a162e76289ac: "To answer this question, we need to follow\
      \ these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the population of Agar Malwa district**: Agar\
      \ Malwa is a district in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India. According to the\
      \ 2011 census, the population of Agar Malwa district is approximately 517,692.\n\
      \n2. **Identify Perth, Tasmania**: However, there seems to be a confusion in\
      \ the question. Perth is actually the capital city of Western Australia, not\
      \ Tasmania. Tasmania has its own capital, Hobart. Perth, as a city in Western\
      \ Australia, has a population of over 2 million people in its metropolitan area.\
      \ But considering the context might imply a mix-up with a smaller place or considering\
      \ a very specific part of Perth in Tasmania (which doesn't exist as a city or\
      \ major town), we need clarification. However, assuming the question meant to\
      \ compare with a place that might be smaller or with the city of Perth in Western\
      \ Australia, we'll proceed under the assumption that there's been a geographical\
      \ mistake and the comparison is with the city of Perth in Western Australia,\
      \ which would not make sense given the population figures.\n\n3. **Correcting\
      \ the understanding of Perth, Tasmania**: Given that Perth does not exist in\
      \ Tasmania, and assuming there might have been confusion with a smaller town\
      \ or an incorrect geographical reference, let's consider what might have been\
      \ intended. If the intention was to compare with a city or town in Tasmania,\
      \ Hobart, the capital, has a population of around 255,445 as of 2021. Other\
      \ significant towns are much smaller.\n\n4. **Comparison**: Given the actual\
      \ population figures:\n   - Agar Malwa district has a population of approximately\
      \ 517,692.\n   - Perth (in Western Australia) has a population of over 2 million.\n\
      \   - Hobart (capital of Tasmania) has a population of around 255,445.\n\nIf\
      \ we were to compare Agar Malwa with Hobart (considering a mix-up in the question),\
      \ Agar Malwa is more populous than Hobart. If we compare Agar Malwa with Perth\
      \ (Western Australia), Agar Malwa is less populous.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given\
      \ the direct question asks if Agar Malwa is less populous than Perth, Tasmania,\
      \ and considering there's no Perth in Tasmania but using the likely intended\
      \ large city for comparison (which would be Perth in Western Australia due to\
      \ its size), Agar Malwa is indeed less populous than Perth, Western Australia.\
      \ However, the question's phrasing implies a geographical error regarding \"\
      Perth, Tasmania,\" which does not exist. Thus, based on the most logical interpretation\
      \ of the question as it stands (and correcting for the geographical mistake\
      \ by assuming a comparison with a significant city), the answer would reflect\
      \ the comparison with Perth, Western Australia, or the intended comparison if\
      \ \"Perth, Tasmania\" was meant to reference a city in Tasmania, which would\
      \ not be accurate.\n\nGiven the logical steps and correcting for the error in\
      \ the question (assuming a comparison with a city in Australia or Tasmania),\
      \ the answer to whether Agar Malwa district is less populous than what was likely\
      \ intended to be a comparison with a major city (and correcting the geographical\
      \ mistake) would be YES if we compare it to Perth, Western Australia. However,\
      \ the question as posed contains a significant geographical error regarding\
      \ \"Perth, Tasmania.\"\n\nANSWER: YES"
    4a51340c-7d54-4191-acd6-3fdc6e87c254: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Agar Malwa is a district in the state of Madhya
      Pradesh, India. Perth, on the other hand, refers to a city, but since it''s
      specified as Perth, Tasmania, it''s crucial to note there might be confusion
      because the more well-known Perth is in Western Australia. However, there is
      a small town named Perth in Tasmania, Australia.


      2. **Population of Agar Malwa**: As of the 2011 census, Agar Malwa district
      had a population of approximately 517,000 people.


      3. **Population of Perth, Tasmania**: This is where clarification is necessary.
      The well-known Perth is in Western Australia and has a population of over 2
      million people. However, the question specifies Tasmania, which suggests a potential
      mix-up or a reference to a much smaller settlement. The city of Perth in Tasmania
      is not as well-known and has a significantly smaller population, but specific
      numbers might be hard to find due to its size and the fact that it''s often
      overshadowed by its Western Australian counterpart in searches. However, for
      the sake of this question, let''s assume we are indeed talking about a smaller
      town or area in Tasmania named Perth.


      4. **Comparison**: Without the exact population of Perth, Tasmania, it''s challenging
      to make a precise comparison. However, given that Agar Malwa has a population
      of over 517,000, for it to be less populous than Perth, Tasmania, Perth, Tasmania,
      would need to have more than 517,000 people, which seems highly unlikely given
      the context and the usual population sizes of towns in Tasmania.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the likely population difference, considering Agar
      Malwa''s known population and the probable small size of Perth, Tasmania, it
      is reasonable to deduce that Agar Malwa is more populous than a small town like
      Perth in Tasmania.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$'

    b89b6a62-c085-4063-a55e-9479d2e45e31: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Agar Malwa District**: Agar Malwa is a district in the state of
      Madhya Pradesh, India. It was created in 2013 by bifurcating the Shajapur district.


      2. **Population of Agar Malwa District**: As of the 2011 census (the latest
      data available for such specific areas might be from this time or slightly more
      recent, but considering it''s a newer district, the 2011 census data is a good
      starting point), the population of the area that is now Agar Malwa, when it
      was part of Shajapur district, needs to be considered. However, given the specific
      nature of the question and the need for precise, up-to-date population figures
      which might not be readily available for Agar Malwa as a separate entity, we''ll
      have to generalize based on typical district population sizes in India and the
      fact that it''s a relatively newly formed district.


      3. **Identify Perth, Tasmania**: Perth is actually the capital of Western Australia,
      not Tasmania. Tasmania''s capital is Hobart. However, there might be a small
      town or locality named Perth in Tasmania. Given the context, it seems there
      might be a confusion here. Assuming the question refers to the city of Perth
      in Western Australia (as Perth, Tasmania, is not a well-known or major city),
      let''s proceed with that assumption for the sake of providing an answer.


      4. **Population of Perth, Western Australia**: As of the latest available data,
      Perth, the capital of Western Australia, has a population of approximately 2
      million people in its metropolitan area.


      5. **Comparison**: Given the population of Perth (around 2 million) and considering
      that many districts in India have populations ranging widely but often in the
      hundreds of thousands to a couple of million, without the exact figure for Agar
      Malwa, it''s a bit challenging. However, if Agar Malwa were significantly less
      populous than a major city like Perth, it would likely have a population under
      2 million, potentially much lower given the urban vs. district population dynamics.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given that Agar Malwa is a district and might have a population
      potentially in the lower hundreds of thousands or possibly over a million but
      less than 2 million (considering the average size of districts in India), and
      considering Perth has a population of around 2 million, it''s reasonable to
      infer that Agar Malwa district could indeed be less populous than the Perth
      metropolitan area. However, without exact figures for Agar Malwa, this is an
      educated guess based on typical population sizes.
