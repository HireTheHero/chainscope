      2. Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is located in Minneapolis, Minnesota.


      Now, let''s consider the general geographical layout of these two locations:


      - Chicago, Illinois, is situated to the southeast of Minneapolis, Minnesota.

      - Minneapolis is located to the northwest of Chicago.


      Since Chicago is southeast of Minneapolis, this means that Chicago, and thus
      the James R. Thompson Center, is located east of Minneapolis, where Our Lady
      of Lourdes Catholic Church is located.


      Therefore, the James R. Thompson Center is not west of Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic
      Church.


      The answer is: NO.'
