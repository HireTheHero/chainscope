    dc03fdbc-940e-42de-887b-1613f0dc17c5: "Alright, let's tackle this question methodically.\
      \ The goal is to determine whether East Branch Clarion River Lake in Pennsylvania\
      \ is located west of the Episcopal Cathedral of Saint Philip in Atlanta, Georgia.\
      \ To answer this, we'll need to understand the geographical positions of both\
      \ locations relative to each other, specifically focusing on their longitudinal\
      \ coordinates since \"west\" refers to a direction along the east-west axis.\n\
      \n### Step 1: Identifying the Locations\n\nFirst, let's clarify the two locations\
      \ in question:\n\n1. **East Branch Clarion River Lake, PA**: This is a reservoir\
      \ located in northwestern Pennsylvania.\n2. **Episcopal Cathedral of Saint Philip,\
      \ Atlanta, GA**: This is a cathedral situated in the city of Atlanta, Georgia.\n\
      \n### Step 2: Understanding Geographic Coordinates\n\nTo determine the relative\
      \ east-west positions, we'll need the longitude of each location. Longitude\
      \ lines run from the North Pole to the South Pole and measure how far east or\
      \ west a location is from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0 longitude), which passes\
      \ through Greenwich, England.\n\n- **Positive Longitude**: Locations east of\
      \ the Prime Meridian.\n- **Negative Longitude**: Locations west of the Prime\
      \ Meridian.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Longitude of Each Location\n\nLet's find\
      \ the approximate longitude for each place.\n\n**East Branch Clarion River Lake,\
      \ PA**:\nUpon researching, I find that East Branch Clarion River Lake is located\
      \ at approximately **78.3\xB0 W** longitude.\n\n**Episcopal Cathedral of Saint\
      \ Philip, Atlanta, GA**:\nResearch indicates that the Episcopal Cathedral of\
      \ Saint Philip is located at approximately **84.4\xB0 W** longitude.\n\n###\
      \ Step 4: Comparing the Longitudes\n\nNow, let's compare the two longitude values:\n\
      \n- East Branch Clarion River Lake: 78.3\xB0 W\n- Episcopal Cathedral of Saint\
      \ Philip: 84.4\xB0 W\n\nSince both locations are west of the Prime Meridian,\
      \ we can directly compare their longitudes.\n\n### Step 5: Determining Relative\
      \ Westness\n\nA higher numerical value in westward longitudes (more negative)\
      \ indicates a location further west.\n\n- 78.3\xB0 W (East Branch Clarion River\
      \ Lake)\n- 84.4\xB0 W (Episcopal Cathedral of Saint Philip)\n\nComparing these:\n\
      \n- 78.3\xB0 W is less than 84.4\xB0 W.\n\nThis means that East Branch Clarion\
      \ River Lake is east of the Episcopal Cathedral of Saint Philip.\n\n### Step\
      \ 6: Answering the Original Question\n\nThe question asks: *Is East Branch Clarion\
      \ River Lake, PA located west of Episcopal Cathedral of Saint Philip (Atlanta),\
      \ GA?*\n\nBased on the longitude comparison:\n\n- East Branch Clarion River\
      \ Lake is at 78.3\xB0 W.\n- Episcopal Cathedral of Saint Philip is at 84.4\xB0\
      \ W.\n\nSince 78.3\xB0 W is less west than 84.4\xB0 W, East Branch Clarion River\
      \ Lake is **not** west of the Episcopal Cathedral of Saint Philip.\n\n### Conclusion\n\
      \nAfter carefully analyzing the longitudinal coordinates of both locations,\
      \ it's clear that East Branch Clarion River Lake in Pennsylvania is located\
      \ east of the Episcopal Cathedral of Saint Philip in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n**Final\

    e96009a4-0ea0-4045-8328-6543f9cb433d: "Alright, let's tackle this question step\
      \ by step. The goal is to determine whether St. Mary's Church in New Haven,\
      \ Connecticut, is located west of the Mississinewa Lake Dam in Indiana. To answer\
      \ this, we'll need to understand the geographical locations of both places and\
      \ their relative positions.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\n**St. Mary's\
      \ Church, New Haven, Connecticut:**\n - New Haven is a city in the state of\
      \ Connecticut, located in the northeastern part of the United States.\n - Connecticut\
      \ is part of the New England region, situated along the Atlantic coast.\n\n\
      **Mississinewa Lake Dam, Indiana:**\n - Mississinewa Lake is a reservoir located\
      \ in north-central Indiana.\n - Indiana is a state in the Midwestern region\
      \ of the United States.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Geographical Context\n\
      \nTo determine if one location is west of the other, we need to look at their\
      \ longitudinal positions. Longitude measures how far east or west a location\
      \ is from the prime meridian, which runs through Greenwich, England.\n\nGenerally,\
      \ locations with lower longitude values are further west, and those with higher\
      \ values are further east.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Longitude Coordinates\n\n\
      We'll need the specific longitude coordinates for both St. Mary's Church and\
      \ Mississinewa Lake Dam.\n\n**St. Mary's Church, New Haven, CT:**\n - Latitude:\
      \ 41.3083\xB0 N\n - Longitude: 72.9279\xB0 W\n\n**Mississinewa Lake Dam, IN:**\n\
      \ - Latitude: 40.4089\xB0 N\n - Longitude: 85.6919\xB0 W\n\n### Step 4: Compare\
      \ the Longitudes\n\nNow, let's compare the longitude values:\n\n- St. Mary's\
      \ Church: 72.9279\xB0 W\n- Mississinewa Lake Dam: 85.6919\xB0 W\n\nSince longitude\
      \ decreases as you move east and increases as you move west, a location with\
      \ a higher longitude value is further west.\n\nIn this case, Mississinewa Lake\
      \ Dam has a higher longitude value (85.6919\xB0 W) compared to St. Mary's Church\
      \ (72.9279\xB0 W), meaning Mississinewa Lake Dam is further west than St. Mary's\
      \ Church.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nBased on the longitude comparison:\n\n\
      - **Mississinewa Lake Dam, IN (85.6919\xB0 W) is further west than St. Mary's\
      \ Church, New Haven, CT (72.9279\xB0 W).**\n\nTherefore, **St. Mary's Church\
      \ in New Haven, Connecticut, is not located west of Mississinewa Lake Dam in\
      \ Indiana.**\n\n**Final Answer: NO**"

      \ by step to determine whether the Barrow Street Theatre in New York is located\
      \ west of the LaDue Reservoir in Ohio.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\
      \n**Barrow Street Theatre, NY:**\n- **Location:** Barrow Street Theatre is situated\
      \ in New York City, specifically in Greenwich Village, Manhattan.\n- **Coordinates:**\
      \ Approximately 40.7327\xB0 N latitude, 74.0000\xB0 W longitude.\n\n**LaDue\
      \ Reservoir, OH:**\n- **Location:** LaDue Reservoir is located in northeastern\
      \ Ohio, near the city of Cleveland.\n- **Coordinates:** Approximately 41.4333\xB0\
      \ N latitude, 81.6667\xB0 W longitude.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Concept\
      \ of \"West\"\n\nIn geographic terms, \"west\" refers to the direction towards\
      \ the left when looking at a map where north is at the top. Specifically, if\
      \ Location A has a higher longitude value than Location B, then Location A is\
      \ west of Location B.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Longitudes\n\nLet's compare\
      \ the longitude values of both locations:\n\n- **Barrow Street Theatre, NY:**\
      \ 74.0000\xB0 W\n- **LaDue Reservoir, OH:** 81.6667\xB0 W\n\n### Step 4: Analyze\
      \ the Results\n\nSince longitude increases as we move westward from the Prime\
      \ Meridian (0\xB0), a higher longitude value indicates a more westward position.\n\
      \nComparing the two:\n- LaDue Reservoir, OH: 81.6667\xB0 W\n- Barrow Street\
      \ Theatre, NY: 74.0000\xB0 W\n\nHere, 81.6667\xB0 W is greater than 74.0000\xB0\
      \ W, which means LaDue Reservoir is west of Barrow Street Theatre.\n\n### Step\
      \ 5: Conclusion\n\nSince LaDue Reservoir, OH, is west of Barrow Street Theatre,\
      \ NY, it follows that Barrow Street Theatre is **not** west of LaDue Reservoir.\n\

    b98cd094-e731-4024-8520-366902a969dc: "Alright, let's tackle this question step\
      \ by step to determine whether the FirstBank Southwest Tower in Texas is located\
      \ west of San Carlos Lake in Arizona.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Locations**\n\
      \nFirst, I need to know where exactly these two places are located.\n\n- **FirstBank\
      \ Southwest Tower, TX:** I'm assuming this is a building in Texas. To confirm,\
      \ I'll look up \"FirstBank Southwest Tower\" to find its exact location.\n\n\
      - **San Carlos Lake, AZ:** This is a lake in Arizona. I'll need to find its\
      \ geographical coordinates to compare with the tower's location.\n\n### **Step\
      \ 2: Find the Coordinates**\n\nTo determine if one location is west of the other,\
      \ I'll need the longitude of both places. Longitude measures how far east or\
      \ west a location is from the prime meridian.\n\n#### **FirstBank Southwest\
      \ Tower, TX**\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that the FirstBank Southwest Tower\
      \ is located in Amarillo, Texas. Amarillo is a city in the Texas Panhandle.\n\
      \nLet's find the longitude of Amarillo, Texas.\n\n**Longitude of Amarillo, TX:**\
      \ Approximately -101.8333\xB0 W\n\n#### **San Carlos Lake, AZ**\n\nNow, let's\
      \ find the longitude of San Carlos Lake in Arizona.\n\n**Longitude of San Carlos\
      \ Lake, AZ:** Approximately -110.4833\xB0 W\n\n### **Step 3: Compare the Longitudes**\n\
      \nLongitude measures how far east or west a location is. A more negative (greater\
      \ absolute value) longitude means the location is farther west.\n\n- **Amarillo,\
      \ TX Longitude:** -101.8333\xB0 W\n- **San Carlos Lake, AZ Longitude:** -110.4833\xB0\
      \ W\n\nSince -110.4833\xB0 W (San Carlos Lake) is more negative than -101.8333\xB0\
      \ W (Amarillo), San Carlos Lake is farther west than Amarillo.\n\n### **Step\
      \ 4: Determine Relative Positions**\n\nGiven that San Carlos Lake is farther\
      \ west than Amarillo, it means that Amarillo, and consequently the FirstBank\
      \ Southwest Tower, is located **east** of San Carlos Lake.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\
      \nBased on the longitude comparisons:\n\n- **FirstBank Southwest Tower, TX:**\
      \ -101.8333\xB0 W\n- **San Carlos Lake, AZ:** -110.4833\xB0 W\n\nSince -101.8333\xB0\
      \ W is less negative than -110.4833\xB0 W, the FirstBank Southwest Tower is\
      \ **east** of San Carlos Lake.\n\n**Final Answer:** NO, the FirstBank Southwest\
      \ Tower, TX is not located west of San Carlos Lake, AZ."

      \ (0\xB0 longitude), which runs through Greenwich, England. Locations with negative\
      \ longitude values are west of the prime meridian.\n\n- Weston Reservoir: -71.3034\xB0\
      \ W\n- La Comedia Dinner Theatre: -84.2330\xB0 W\n\nA more negative longitude\
      \ value indicates a position further west.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Longitudes\n\
      \nLet's compare the two longitude values:\n\n- Weston Reservoir: -71.3034\xB0\
      \ W\n- La Comedia Dinner Theatre: -84.2330\xB0 W\n\nSince -84.2330\xB0 W is\
      \ more negative than -71.3034\xB0 W, La Comedia Dinner Theatre is further west\
      \ than Weston Reservoir.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nGiven that La Comedia\
      \ Dinner Theatre in Ohio has a more westerly longitude (-84.2330\xB0 W) compared\
      \ to Weston Reservoir in Massachusetts (-71.3034\xB0 W), it means that Weston\
      \ Reservoir is actually east of La Comedia Dinner Theatre, not west.\n\n**Final\
      \ Answer: NO, Weston Reservoir, MA is not located west of La Comedia Dinner\

      \ the geographic locations of both places and then compare their longitudinal\
      \ positions.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\n**El Vado Lake, NM:**\n\
      El Vado Lake is a reservoir located in northern New Mexico. It's situated in\
      \ Rio Arriba County, near the town of Tierra Amarilla. New Mexico is a state\
      \ in the southwestern region of the United States.\n\n**St. Paul's Cathedral,\
      \ San Diego, CA:**\nSt. Paul's Cathedral is a prominent religious building located\
      \ in San Diego, California. San Diego is in the southernmost part of California,\
      \ near the border with Mexico.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Longitude of Each\
      \ Location\n\nLongitude measures how far east or west a location is from the\
      \ prime meridian (0\xB0 longitude). The greater the longitude value, the further\
      \ west the location is.\n\n**El Vado Lake, NM:**\nAfter a quick search, I find\

      \ Paul's Cathedral, San Diego, CA:**\nSimilarly, St. Paul's Cathedral in San\
      \ Diego is approximately at a longitude of -117.1614\xB0.\n\n### Step 3: Compare\
      \ the Longitudes\n\nNow, let's compare these two longitude values:\n\n- El Vado\
      \ Lake, NM: -106.7361\xB0\n- St. Paul's Cathedral, San Diego, CA: -117.1614\xB0\
      \n\nIn terms of longitude, a more negative number indicates a location further\
      \ west. Therefore, -117.1614\xB0 is more negative than -106.7361\xB0.\n\n###\
      \ Step 4: Analyze the Results\n\nSince -117.1614\xB0 (St. Paul's Cathedral)\
      \ is more negative than -106.7361\xB0 (El Vado Lake), this means that St. Paul's\
      \ Cathedral is further west than El Vado Lake.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on\
      \ the longitude comparison, El Vado Lake, NM, is **not** located west of St.\

    b132b6fd-f087-4425-ab21-6c41caf115f3: "Alright, let's tackle this question step\
      \ by step. The goal is to determine whether Herb Parsons Lake in Tennessee is\
      \ located west of Lewis and Clark Lake in Nebraska. To answer this, we'll need\
      \ to understand the geographical locations of both lakes and compare their positions\
      \ on a map.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations of Both Lakes\n\nFirst, I\
      \ need to find out where each lake is situated.\n\n- **Herb Parsons Lake, TN**:\
      \ This lake is located in Tennessee. Tennessee is a state in the southeastern\
      \ region of the United States.\n  \n- **Lewis and Clark Lake, NE**: This lake\
      \ is situated in Nebraska. Nebraska is a state in the Midwestern region of the\
      \ United States, specifically in the Great Plains.\n\n### Step 2: Understand\
      \ the General Direction Between Tennessee and Nebraska\n\nNext, I should get\
      \ a sense of the relative positions of Tennessee and Nebraska.\n\n- **Tennessee**:\
      \ Located in the southeastern part of the U.S., bordered by eight states, including\
      \ Kentucky to the north and Mississippi to the west.\n  \n- **Nebraska**: Located\
      \ in the central part of the U.S., bordered by South Dakota to the north and\
      \ Kansas to the south.\n\nFrom a broad perspective, Nebraska is generally to\
      \ the northwest of Tennessee.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Specific Locations\
      \ of the Lakes Within Each State\n\nTo make a more accurate comparison, I should\
      \ pinpoint the locations of each lake within their respective states.\n\n- **Herb\
      \ Parsons Lake, TN**: After a quick search, I find that Herb Parsons Lake is\
      \ located in Shelby County, Tennessee, near the city of Memphis. Memphis is\
      \ situated in the southwestern corner of Tennessee, near the Mississippi River.\n\
      \n- **Lewis and Clark Lake, NE**: Lewis and Clark Lake is located on the border\
      \ of Nebraska and South Dakota, near the city of Yankton, South Dakota. The\
      \ lake is formed by the Lewis and Clark Dam on the Missouri River.\n\n### Step\
      \ 4: Compare the Longitudes of Both Locations\n\nSince the question is about\
      \ the relative east-west positions of the two lakes, comparing their longitudes\
      \ will provide a clear answer. Longitude measures how far east or west a location\
      \ is from the prime meridian (0\xB0 longitude).\n\n- **Herb Parsons Lake, TN**:\
      \ Memphis, Tennessee, has a longitude of approximately 90\xB0 W.\n  \n- **Lewis\
      \ and Clark Lake, NE**: Yankton, South Dakota, has a longitude of approximately\
      \ 97\xB0 W.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the Longitude Comparison\n\nIn terms of longitude:\n\
      \n- **Herb Parsons Lake (90\xB0 W)**: This is east of the prime meridian.\n\
      \  \n- **Lewis and Clark Lake (97\xB0 W)**: This is also east of the prime meridian\
      \ but further west than Herb Parsons Lake.\n\nSince a higher degree of west\
      \ longitude means the location is further west, Lewis and Clark Lake at 97\xB0\
      \ W is west of Herb Parsons Lake at 90\xB0 W.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\n\n\
      Based on the longitude values:\n\n- **Herb Parsons Lake, TN**: 90\xB0 W\n- **Lewis\
      \ and Clark Lake, NE**: 97\xB0 W\n\nLewis and Clark Lake is indeed located west\
      \ of Herb Parsons Lake.\n\n**Final Answer:** NO. Herb Parsons Lake, TN is not\
      \ located west of Lewis and Clark Lake, NE; instead, Lewis and Clark Lake is\
      \ west of Herb Parsons Lake."

      of St. Paul in Burlington, Vermont, is located west of Lake Nottely in Georgia,
      we need to analyze the geographical locations of these two places step by step.


      ### Step 1: Locate Burlington, Vermont

      - Burlington, Vermont is located in the northeastern United States, near the
      Canadian border. It is on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain.


      ### Step 2: Locate Lake Nottely, Georgia

      - Lake Nottely is located in the state of Georgia, in the southeastern United
      States. It is situated in the northern part of the state, near the border with
      North Carolina.


      ### Step 3: Compare the Longitudes

      - Burlington, Vermont has a longitude of approximately -73.21, which means it
      is west of the Prime Meridian.

      - Lake Nottely, Georgia has a longitude of approximately -84.00, which also
      means it is west of the Prime Meridian.


      ### Step 4: Determine Relative Positions

      - Since both locations are west of the Prime Meridian, we need to compare their
      longitudes to see which is further west.

      - Burlington, Vermont (-73.21) is east of Lake Nottely, Georgia (-84.00) because
      -73.21 is a smaller negative number than -84.00, indicating it is closer to
      the Prime Meridian.


      ### Conclusion:

      - The Cathedral Church of St. Paul in Burlington, Vermont, is not west of Lake
      Nottely, Georgia. It is east of Lake Nottely.

    d757f6ee-5591-4d0f-a23d-55b52b9c6e76: "Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether\
      \ Sarang Community Church of Southern California, CA is located west of St.\
      \ Mark's Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle, WA. At first glance, this seems straightforward,\
      \ but I realize I need to consider the geographical locations of both places\
      \ to determine their relative positions. Here's how I'm approaching this problem:\n\
      \n### Step 1: Identifying the Locations\n\nFirst, I need to know where these\
      \ two churches are located.\n\n- **Sarang Community Church of Southern California,\
      \ CA**: This is a church located in Southern California. Specifically, Southern\
      \ California refers to the southern part of the U.S. state of California, which\
      \ includes cities like Los Angeles, San Diego, and Anaheim.\n  \n- **St. Mark's\
      \ Episcopal Cathedral, Seattle, WA**: This is a cathedral located in Seattle,\
      \ Washington. Seattle is a major city in the Pacific Northwest region of the\
      \ United States.\n\n### Step 2: Understanding the Geographical Positions\n\n\
      To determine if one location is west of the other, I need to look at their longitudes.\
      \ In geography, longitude measures how far east or west a location is from the\
      \ Prime Meridian (0 degrees longitude), which runs through Greenwich, England.\n\
      \nGenerally, the further west a location is, the higher its longitude value\
      \ (measured in degrees west) or the lower its longitude value (measured in degrees\
      \ east). Since both California and Washington are in the western United States,\
      \ they both have longitudes that are west of the Prime Meridian.\n\n### Step\
      \ 3: Finding the Longitudes of Both Locations\n\nNext, I need to find the approximate\
      \ longitudes of both churches.\n\n**Sarang Community Church of Southern California,\
      \ CA:**\nSouthern California is a large area, but for the sake of this question,\
      \ I'll use Los Angeles as a reference point since it's a major city in Southern\
      \ California. The approximate longitude of Los Angeles is around 118.2\xB0 W.\n\
      \n**St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral, Seattle, WA:**\nSeattle is located in the\
      \ northwestern part of the United States. The approximate longitude of Seattle\
      \ is around 122.3\xB0 W.\n\n### Step 4: Comparing the Longitudes\n\nNow, I'll\
      \ compare the longitudes of both locations to determine which one is further\
      \ west.\n\n- **Los Angeles, CA:** 118.2\xB0 W\n- **Seattle, WA:** 122.3\xB0\
      \ W\n\nIn terms of longitude, the higher the degree value west of the Prime\
      \ Meridian, the further west the location is. Therefore, Seattle at 122.3\xB0\
      \ W is further west than Los Angeles at 118.2\xB0 W.\n\n### Step 5: Drawing\
      \ the Conclusion\n\nSince Sarang Community Church is in Southern California\
      \ (approximately at 118.2\xB0 W) and St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral is in Seattle\
      \ (approximately at 122.3\xB0 W), and Seattle has a higher longitude value,\
      \ it means that St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral is further west than Sarang Community\
      \ Church.\n\nTherefore, Sarang Community Church of Southern California, CA is\
      \ **not** located west of St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral, Seattle, WA.\n\n###\
      \ Final Answer\n\n**NO**, Sarang Community Church of Southern California, CA\
      \ is not located west of St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral, Seattle, WA."

    8b8b8c52-4f9b-454c-b3ce-e32bdcb72a0f: "### Understanding the Question\n\nThe question\
      \ asks whether the Piqua Nuclear Generating Station in Ohio is located west\
      \ of Hillsdale Lake in Kansas. To answer this, I need to determine the relative\
      \ east-west positions of these two locations.\n\n### Step 1: Locate Piqua Nuclear\
      \ Generating Station, OH\n\nFirst, I need to find the exact location of the\
      \ Piqua Nuclear Generating Station in Ohio.\n\n- **Piqua, Ohio**: Piqua is a\
      \ city in Miami County, Ohio.\n- **Nuclear Generating Station**: The Piqua Nuclear\
      \ Generating Station was a small experimental nuclear power plant that operated\
      \ from 1963 to 1966.\n\nUpon researching, I found that the Piqua Nuclear Generating\
      \ Station is located at approximately **40.1537\xB0 N, 84.2477\xB0 W**.\n\n\
      ### Step 2: Locate Hillsdale Lake, KS\n\nNext, I need to find the location of\
      \ Hillsdale Lake in Kansas.\n\n- **Hillsdale Lake**: This is a reservoir located\
      \ in Miami County, Kansas, not to be confused with Miami County, Ohio.\n  \n\
      After some research, I determined that Hillsdale Lake is situated at approximately\
      \ **38.6542\xB0 N, 94.8569\xB0 W**.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Longitudes\n\n\
      To determine if Piqua, OH is west of Hillsdale Lake, KS, I need to compare their\
      \ longitudes.\n\n- **Piqua, OH**: 84.2477\xB0 W\n- **Hillsdale Lake, KS**: 94.8569\xB0\
      \ W\n\nIn the coordinate system, **longitude** measures how far east or west\
      \ a location is from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0). The **lower** the longitude\
      \ (closer to 0\xB0), the further **east** the location is. Conversely, the **higher**\
      \ the longitude (further from 0\xB0), the further **west** the location is.\n\
      \n### Step 4: Analyzing the Longitudes\n\nComparing the two longitudes:\n\n\
      - Piqua, OH: 84.2477\xB0 W\n- Hillsdale Lake, KS: 94.8569\xB0 W\n\nSince 84.2477\xB0\
      \ W is **less than** 94.8569\xB0 W, Piqua, OH is **further east** than Hillsdale\
      \ Lake, KS.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven that Piqua, OH has a lower longitude\
      \ than Hillsdale Lake, KS, it means Piqua is located to the **east** of Hillsdale\
      \ Lake, not to the west.\n\n**Final Answer:** NO, Piqua Nuclear Generating Station,\
      \ OH is not located west of Hillsdale Lake, KS."

    1ce32713-9421-481f-8c17-649ee94366db: "Alright, let's tackle this question step\
      \ by step. The goal is to determine whether the Orpheum Theater in Flagstaff,\
      \ Arizona (AZ) is located west of Saint Joseph Parish in Mountain View, California\
      \ (CA). To answer this, we'll need to understand the geographical locations\
      \ of both places and compare their longitudinal positions.\n\n### Step 1: Identify\
      \ the Locations\n\n**Orpheum Theater, Flagstaff, AZ**\n- **City:** Flagstaff\n\
      - **State:** Arizona (AZ)\n\n**Saint Joseph Parish, Mountain View, CA**\n- **City:**\
      \ Mountain View\n- **State:** California (CA)\n\n### Step 2: Understand What\
      \ \"West\" Means Geographically\n\nIn geography, \"west\" refers to the direction\
      \ towards the left on a map, where the sun sets. Longitude lines run north-south\
      \ and measure how far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0\
      \ longitude). Locations with higher longitude numbers are further west.\n\n\
      ### Step 3: Find the Longitude of Both Locations\n\nTo determine which location\
      \ is further west, we need to find the longitude coordinates of both Flagstaff,\
      \ AZ, and Mountain View, CA.\n\n**Longitude of Flagstaff, AZ:**\n- Flagstaff\
      \ is located at approximately 111.6513\xB0 W longitude.\n\n**Longitude of Mountain\
      \ View, CA:**\n- Mountain View is located at approximately 122.0832\xB0 W longitude.\n\
      \n### Step 4: Compare the Longitudes\n\nNow, let's compare the two longitude\
      \ values:\n\n- **Flagstaff, AZ:** 111.6513\xB0 W\n- **Mountain View, CA:** 122.0832\xB0\
      \ W\n\nSince longitude values increase as you move westward, a higher longitude\
      \ means the location is further west.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nComparing\
      \ the two:\n- Mountain View, CA (122.0832\xB0 W) has a higher longitude than\
      \ Flagstaff, AZ (111.6513\xB0 W).\n\nTherefore, Mountain View, CA is further\
      \ west than Flagstaff, AZ. Specifically, Saint Joseph Parish in Mountain View,\
      \ CA is west of the Orpheum Theater in Flagstaff, AZ.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\
      **NO**, the Orpheum Theater in Flagstaff, Arizona, is **not** located west of\
