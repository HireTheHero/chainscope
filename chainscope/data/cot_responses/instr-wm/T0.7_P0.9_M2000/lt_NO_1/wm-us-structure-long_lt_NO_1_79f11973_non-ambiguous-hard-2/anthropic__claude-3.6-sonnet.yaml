      1. First, let me identify the locations:

      - Fontana Lake is in North Carolina

      - Presidential Towers is in Chicago, Illinois


      2. Let me consider their relative positions:

      - North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States

      - Illinois is in the midwest

      - Chicago, IL is located near Lake Michigan

      - Fontana Lake is in western North Carolina


      3. When comparing east-west positions:

      - Illinois is significantly west of North Carolina

      - Even western North Carolina is still east of Illinois

      - Therefore, Fontana Lake must be east of Presidential Towers
