      Step 1: Identify the locations of both structures.

      - James R. Thompson Center is in Chicago, Illinois

      - Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is in Minneapolis, Minnesota


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a map.

      - Chicago, IL is located in northeastern Illinois, on the western shore of Lake
      Michigan

      - Minneapolis, MN is located in eastern Minnesota

      - Illinois is generally east of Minnesota

      - Chicago (in eastern Illinois) is east of Minneapolis (in eastern Minnesota)


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since the James R. Thompson Center is in Chicago, IL, which is east of Minneapolis,
      MN, where Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is located, the Thompson Center
      is NOT west of the church.

      GA, I need to compare their relative positions on a map of the United States.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - East Branch Clarion River Lake is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is in the northeastern
      part of the United States.

      - The Episcopal Cathedral of Saint Philip is in Atlanta, Georgia (GA), which
      is in the southeastern United States.

      - Pennsylvania is north of Georgia, but the question asks about east-west positioning.

      - Pennsylvania is generally east of the Mississippi River but west of the Atlantic
      coast.

      - Georgia is also east of the Mississippi River and borders the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 3: Compare their specific longitudes.

      - Pennsylvania is located further north but is generally in the same longitudinal
      range as Georgia.

      - However, western Pennsylvania (where Clarion River is located) is actually
      west of Atlanta, Georgia.

      - East Branch Clarion River Lake is in the western portion of Pennsylvania.

      - When comparing locations in the eastern United States, places further north
      (like New York) are generally east of places further south (like Florida) due
      to the shape of the eastern coastline.

      - New York is positioned to the northeast of Florida, meaning West Point would
      be east of Miami Beach.


      Step 4: Verify the specific locations.

      - West Point is located on the Hudson River in eastern New York.

      - Miami Beach is on the eastern coast of Florida.

      - The eastern position of West Point relative to Miami Beach is confirmed by
      their coordinates.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Arizona and California.

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States


      Step 3: More specifically, Arizona borders California to the east.

      - California is the westernmost continental state

      - Arizona is located east of California


      Step 4: Since Flagstaff, AZ is in Arizona and Mountain View, CA is in California,
      the same east-west relationship applies.

      - Mountain View, CA is further west than Flagstaff, AZ

      - Flagstaff, AZ is east of Mountain View, CA


      Therefore, Orpheum Theater in Flagstaff, Arizona is NOT west of Saint Joseph
      Parish in Mountain View, California. It is east of it.
