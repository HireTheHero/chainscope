      1.  **Identify the locations:** We need the general locations of Vernon Court,
      RI and Buckhorn Lake, KY.

      2.  **Determine the state locations:** Rhode Island (RI) is a state in the northeastern
      United States. Kentucky (KY) is a state in the southeastern/midwestern United
      States.

      3.  **Consider the relative East/West position of the states:** Generally, Kentucky
      is located significantly west of Rhode Island.

      4.  **Consider the locations within the states (optional but helpful):** Vernon
      Court is a mansion in Newport, RI, which is on the southeastern coast of Rhode
      Island. Buckhorn Lake State Resort Park is located in eastern Kentucky. Even
      considering specific locations within the states, Rhode Island is further east
      than Kentucky.

      5.  **Compare the East/West positions:** Since Rhode Island is located east
      of Kentucky, any point in Rhode Island will be located east of any point in
      Kentucky.


      Therefore, Vernon Court, RI is located east of Buckhorn Lake, KY. The question

      part of the country.

      3.  **Determine the general location of Kentucky (KY):** Kentucky is a state
      in the southeastern part of the United States.

      4.  **Compare the general locations:** Rhode Island is significantly *east*
      of Kentucky.

      5.  **Determine the specific location of Vernon Court, RI:** Vernon Court is
      a specific location within Rhode Island. Since Rhode Island is generally east,
      Vernon Court will also be relatively far east in the US.

      6.  **Determine the specific location of Buckhorn Lake, KY:** Buckhorn Lake
      is a specific location within Kentucky. Since Kentucky is generally west of
      Rhode Island, Buckhorn Lake will be relatively west of Vernon Court.

      7.  **Evaluate the question:** The question asks if Vernon Court, RI is located
      *west* of Buckhorn Lake (Kentucky), KY.

      8.  **Synthesize the findings:** We know Rhode Island (and thus Vernon Court)
      is east of Kentucky (and thus Buckhorn Lake). Therefore, Vernon Court is *east*
      of Buckhorn Lake, not west.

      Time Zone as well, but further west, with longitudes generally around 80-84
      degrees West.

      4. **Determine relative positions:** A larger West longitude number means a
      location is further west. Since the longitudes for Ohio (around 80-84 degrees
      W) are larger than the longitudes for Massachusetts (around 70-72 degrees W),
      Ohio is located west of Massachusetts.

      1.  **Identify the key locations:** We need the location of Sandals Church,\
      \ CA and the location of Lost Creek Lake, OR.\n2.  **Determine the general location\
      \ of Sandals Church, CA:** Sandals Church has multiple campuses in Southern\
      \ California. While the exact campus isn't specified, all Sandals Church campuses\
      \ are within Southern California. California is a state on the US West Coast.\n\
      3.  **Determine the general location of Lost Creek Lake, OR:** Lost Creek Lake\
      \ is located in Southern Oregon. Oregon is also a state on the US West Coast,\
      \ located *north* of California.\n4.  **Compare the relative positions:** Since\
      \ Lost Creek Lake, OR is located north of California, and Sandals Church, CA\
      \ is located in California, Sandals Church, CA is south of Lost Creek Lake,\
      \ OR.\n5.  **Consider the east/west relationship:** While both are on the West\
      \ Coast, we need to determine if Sandals Church is *west* of Lost Creek Lake.\
      \ Since California is directly south of Oregon, and both run roughly north-south\
      \ along the coastline, a location in Southern California will generally be *east*\
      \ of a location in Southern Oregon *if* you were to draw a straight line horizontally\
      \ across the states. However, the question asks if Sandals Church is *west*\
      \ of Lost Creek Lake. Given their relative north-south positions, it's highly\
      \ unlikely a location in Southern California is west of a location in Southern\
      \ Oregon.\n\nLet's be more precise: Southern California's longitude is generally\
      \ around 115\xB0W to 120\xB0W. Southern Oregon's longitude is generally around\
      \ 122\xB0W to 124\xB0W. Since larger negative numbers (or numbers further west)\
      \ indicate a more westerly position, a location at 122\xB0W is west of a location\
      \ at 120\xB0W. Therefore, Lost Creek Lake, OR (around 122\xB0W) is generally\
      \ *west* of Sandals Church, CA (around 115\xB0W - 120\xB0W).\n\nTherefore, Sandals\
      \ Church, CA is located *east* of Lost Creek Lake, OR.\n\n**Conclusion:** Since\

      is generally north of North Carolina along the East Coast of the US.

      3.  **Determine the general geographic relationship of the cities:** Fairfax,
      VA is in Northern Virginia, near Washington D.C. Asheville, NC is in Western
      North Carolina, in the mountains.

      4.  **Compare the longitudes:** Fairfax, VA is around 77 degrees West longitude.
      Asheville, NC is around 82 degrees West longitude.

      5.  **Relate longitude to East/West:** A smaller West longitude number means
      the location is further East. A larger West longitude number means the location
      is further West.

      6.  **Compare the longitudes directly:** 77 degrees West (Fairfax) is less than
      82 degrees West (Asheville).

      7.  **Conclude the relative East/West positions:** Since Fairfax is at a smaller
      West longitude than Asheville, Fairfax is located *east* of Asheville.


      Therefore, Truro Church (Fairfax, Virginia) is *east* of Cathedral of All Souls
      (Asheville, North Carolina).
