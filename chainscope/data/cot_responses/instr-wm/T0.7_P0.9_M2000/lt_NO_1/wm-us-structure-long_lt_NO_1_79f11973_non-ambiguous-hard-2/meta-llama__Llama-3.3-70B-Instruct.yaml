      - Harlan County Reservoir, being in Nebraska, is west of Nashville, Tennessee.


      Therefore, considering the relative positions of Tennessee and Nebraska, the
      Cathedral of the Incarnation in Nashville, Tennessee, is not west but east of
      Harlan County Reservoir in Nebraska.

      \ (San Bernardino) is located in San Bernardino, California.\n   - The Trojan\
      \ Nuclear Power Plant is located in Oregon.\n\n2. **Understand Geographic Directions**:\n\
      \   - \"West\" refers to the direction towards the setting sun, in a general\
      \ sense. In the context of the United States, moving west means moving towards\
      \ the Pacific Ocean from the interior of the country.\n\n3. **Compare Locations**:\n\

      \ directly bordering the Pacific Ocean.\n   - Oregon is also a state on the\
      \ West Coast, located north of California.\n\n4. **Determine Relative Positions**:\n\
      \   - Since both locations are on the West Coast, the question of which is \"\
      west\" of the other depends on their longitudinal positions (east-west positioning).\
      \ However, because they are in different states and the question involves comparing\
      \ a location in California to one in Oregon, it's about their relative east-west\
      \ positioning.\n   - California is south of Oregon. \n   - The Trojan Nuclear\
      \ Power Plant in Oregon is north of the California Theatre in San Bernardino,\
      \ California. However, being \"north\" does not directly answer the question\
      \ of being \"west.\"\n\n5. **Longitudinal Comparison**:\n   - The critical aspect\
      \ is comparing their longitudes. California (specifically San Bernardino) and\
      \ Oregon (where the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is located) are both near the\
      \ Pacific Ocean, but Oregon is slightly east and significantly north of California\
      \ in terms of latitude. However, in terms of longitude, Oregon is generally\
      \ at a similar longitude to the northern parts of California but is north.\n\
      \n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The key point is that \"west\" refers to a direction.\
      \ Given California is generally west of many parts of the United States but\
      \ considering the question is about a specific location in California and another\
      \ in Oregon, we must consider their relative positions. The Trojan Nuclear Power\
      \ Plant is in Oregon, which is north and slightly east of California in general\
      \ geographic terms. However, since the question asks if the California Theatre\
      \ is west of the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant, and considering the longitudinal\
      \ aspect (east-west positioning), California (where the theatre is) is generally\
      \ at a longitude that could be considered west or very close in longitude to\
      \ parts of Oregon, depending on the specific longitudes of these locations.\
      \ But since the question is about being \"west\" of Oregon from California,\
      \ and given the nature of their geographic positions (with California being\
      \ to the south and generally at a similar or slightly west longitude compared\
      \ to the westernmost parts of the continental United States), the critical factor\
      \ is the longitudinal difference, which would suggest the California Theatre\
      \ could indeed be considered west or very close in longitude, but for a strict\
      \ interpretation of \"west\" in terms of moving towards the Pacific from the\
      \ interior, the question might seem to hinge on a nuanced understanding of their\
      \ relative positions.\n\nGiven these considerations, and simplifying to the\
      \ core question without overcomplicating with unnecessary detail:\n\n- The California\
      \ Theatre in San Bernardino, California, is not significantly west in the sense\
      \ of being in a different longitudinal position that would categorically place\
      \ it \"west\" of the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant in Oregon in a manner that disregards\
      \ their north-south relationship. However, considering the general direction\
      \ and without precise longitudinal data, the question seems to simplify to whether\
      \ California is west of Oregon, which in a broad geographic sense, it is, but\
      \ this does not accurately reflect the nuance of their specific locations.\n\
      \n**Final Answer**: \nGiven the complexity and the need for a simple YES or\
      \ NO, the correct interpretation hinges on understanding \"west\" in the context\
      \ of U.S. geography and the relative positions of these locations. California\

      \ question and the relative positions of California and Oregon, the answer simplifies\

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations mentioned.
      Eighth & Main is a location in Idaho (ID), and Red Bluff Diversion Dam is located
      in California (CA).


      2. **Geographical Positions**: Next, we consider the general geographical positions
      of Idaho and California. Idaho is located east of California within the United
      States.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Since we are comparing specific locations within
      these states, we need more detailed geographical information. Eighth & Main
      could refer to a specific address or landmark in Idaho, and the Red Bluff Diversion
      Dam is a known location in California.


      4. **Red Bluff Diversion Dam Location**: The Red Bluff Diversion Dam is located
      in the northern part of California, near the city of Red Bluff.


      5. **Determining East/West Relationship**: To determine if Eighth & Main, ID,
      is west of Red Bluff Diversion Dam, CA, we must understand that since Idaho
      is generally east of California, any location in Idaho would typically be east
      of locations in California, not west.

    0d72caad-84c6-40f8-92b7-8a8cbc2ec4ae: 'To determine if Little Goose Dam, WA is
      located west of San Andreas Lake, CA, we need to consider the geographical locations
      of both.


      1. Little Goose Dam is located in the state of Washington (WA). Washington is
      in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.


      2. San Andreas Lake is located in the state of California (CA). California is
      also on the West Coast but is south of Washington.


      3. Since both locations are on the West Coast, we need to compare their longitudinal
      positions (east-west positioning) to determine if Little Goose Dam is west of
      San Andreas Lake.


      4. Generally, the farther north you go on the West Coast, the more westward
      the coastline and geographical features tend to be due to the curvature of the
      Earth and the orientation of the North American continent. However, the specific
      longitudinal positions of these two locations will provide the definitive answer.


      5. Without exact longitudinal coordinates, we can consider that Washington state
      is generally north of California, and the West Coast of North America does curve,
      which means that as you move north, you are also moving slightly west due to
      the continent''s shape. However, the difference in longitude between the two
      states is not significant enough to conclude solely based on their north-south
      relationship.


      6. To make an accurate determination, we would ideally compare the exact longitudes
      of Little Goose Dam, WA, and San Andreas Lake, CA. However, given the general
      knowledge that both are on the West Coast and relatively close in longitude,
      with Washington being slightly more west than the southern parts of California
      due to the coastline''s curvature, we can make an educated guess.


      7. Considering the general geography and without precise longitudes, it''s reasonable
      to infer that Little Goose Dam, WA, could indeed be west or very close in longitude
      to San Andreas Lake, CA, but the exact relationship depends on their specific
      longitudes.


      Given these considerations and the fact that both locations are relatively far
      north and south on the West Coast, respectively, the most accurate answer based
      on geographical reasoning would be:


      YES'

    1701d0aa-c639-4041-ab1e-dc64365ae7f5: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Moore
      Dam, NH, and Allegheny Reservoir, PA. Moore Dam is located in New Hampshire,
      and Allegheny Reservoir is located in Pennsylvania.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we determine their general geographic
      positions relative to each other. New Hampshire is in the northeastern United
      States, while Pennsylvania is also in the eastern United States but south of
      New Hampshire.


      3. **Compare Longitudes**: To determine if Moore Dam, NH, is west of Allegheny
      Reservoir, PA, we need to compare their longitudes. If Moore Dam has a lower
      longitude than Allegheny Reservoir, it would be west.


      4. **General Knowledge of US Geography**: Knowing that the eastern seaboard
      of the United States generally runs north-south, we can reason about the relative
      positions. New Hampshire is directly north of Pennsylvania in terms of their
      general positions on the map.


      5. **Longitude Comparison**: Without exact longitudes, we can still reason that
      since New Hampshire is north and slightly east of Pennsylvania due to the curvature
      of the eastern coastline, structures within New Hampshire would typically be
      east of structures in Pennsylvania, not west.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Moore Dam, NH, is located west of
      Allegheny Reservoir, PA, is:


      NO'

      Bunch-of-Grapes, MA, refers to a small island in Massachusetts. Pleasants Power
      Station, WV, is a power plant located in West Virginia.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we determine the general geographic
      positions of these locations. Massachusetts is on the East Coast of the United
      States, while West Virginia is further inland, to the west of Massachusetts
      but still considered part of the Eastern United States.

      positions. Massachusetts is located in the Northeastern United States, and West
      Virginia is in the Eastern United States but is considered part of the Mid-Atlantic
      or Appalachian regions, which is southwest of Massachusetts.


      3. **Compare Longitudes**: Since "west" refers to a direction on the compass
      that is towards the setting sun, we need to compare the longitudes of these
      two locations. Generally, the farther west a location is, the higher its longitude
      (though in the context of the United States, we''re considering relative positions
      rather than precise longitude values, as both locations are in the Western Hemisphere).


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Massachusetts is northeast and West Virginia is
      southwest of Massachusetts, Pleasants Power Station, WV would be southwest (and
      thus more west) than Bunch-of-Grapes, MA. However, the question asks if Bunch-of-Grapes,
      MA is located west of Pleasants Power Station, WV.


      Based on the steps above, since Bunch-of-Grapes, MA is actually east (northeast)

    f4b275d3-35e3-40d0-9587-67f0849a4c3c: "To answer this question, let's break it\
      \ down into steps:\n\n1. **Identify the locations**: \n   - Sandals Church is\
      \ located in California (CA).\n   - Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon (OR).\n\n2.\
      \ **Understand the geography**:\n   - California (CA) is a state located on\
      \ the West Coast of the United States.\n   - Oregon (OR) is also a state on\
      \ the West Coast, situated north of California.\n\n3. **Determine the relative\
      \ positions**:\n   - Given that California is south of Oregon, any location\
      \ in California would generally be south (and possibly slightly east or west,\
      \ depending on the specific locations within the states) of a location in Oregon.\n\
      \n4. **Consider the specific query about being \"west\"**:\n   - The question\
      \ asks if Sandals Church, CA, is located west of Lost Creek Lake, OR. Since\
      \ Oregon is north of California, and considering the general westward positioning\
      \ of both states along the West Coast, the critical factor is the longitudinal\
      \ (east-west) positioning relative to each other.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n  \
      \ - Given the geography, it's possible for parts of California to be west of\
      \ parts of Oregon, depending on the specific longitudes of the locations in\
      \ question. However, without exact longitudinal coordinates, we rely on general\
      \ knowledge that both states are on the West Coast, and California extends further\
      \ west than Oregon does in many areas.\n\n6. **Decision**:\n   - Based on the\
      \ general geography and without precise location data, it's reasonable to infer\
      \ that parts of California could indeed be west of parts of Oregon. However,\
      \ the specific question about Sandals Church and Lost Creek Lake requires knowing\
      \ their exact longitudes. \n   - Generally speaking, though, California as a\
      \ whole is not west of Oregon as a whole; it's more south. But specific locations\
      \ can vary.\n\nGiven these considerations and without precise longitude information\
      \ for these specific locations, the question seems to probe for a general understanding\
      \ of U.S. geography. However, since Sandals Church is in California and Lost\
      \ Creek Lake is in Oregon, and considering California is generally south of\
      \ Oregon but also extends westward, the answer could depend on the exact longitudes\
      \ of these locations. \n\nFor a definitive YES or NO without specific longitudes:\n\
      - If we consider the general trend that California is south of Oregon and that\
      \ the question asks about being \"west\" of, without exact coordinates, it might\
      \ seem like a nuanced answer is required. However, the nature of the question\
      \ suggests a straightforward geographical comparison.\n\nTherefore, the answer,\
      \ based on the step-by-step reasoning provided and considering the need for\
      \ a simple YES or NO response without further geographical detail, leans towards\
      \ understanding the relative positions of California and Oregon and the possibility\

      \ about \"west\" of implies a comparison that might not align with the general\
      \ north-south relationship between the two states.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\\

    831c1ffe-aa5e-4b8e-a86b-0a12b07b24b1: 'To determine if Sarang Community Church
      of Southern California, CA is located west of St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral,
      Seattle, WA, we need to consider the geographical locations of both.


      1. **Identify the location of Sarang Community Church of Southern California,
      CA**: This church is in California, which is on the West Coast of the United
      States.


      2. **Identify the location of St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral, Seattle, WA**:
      This cathedral is in Seattle, Washington, which is also on the West Coast but
      further north than California.


      3. **Compare the locations in terms of longitude (east-west positioning)**:
      Since both locations are on the West Coast, we need to consider their relative
      positions. California is generally southwest of Washington state.


      4. **Determine the directional relationship**: Given that California is southwest
      of Washington, any point in California would be south (and slightly east due
      to the shape of the coastlines, but primarily south) of any point in Washington
      state.


      Given these steps, since California (where Sarang Community Church is located)
      is southwest of Washington (where St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral is located),
      and considering the primary direction of interest is west, we must conclude
      based on geographical positioning.


      YES.'

      1. **Identify the location of Panguitch Lake, UT**: Panguitch Lake is located
      in southwestern Utah. Utah is a state in the western United States.


      2. **Identify the location of Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles, California**:
      Los Angeles is a city in the state of California, which is also in the western
      United States but farther west than Utah.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Since both locations are in the western United
      States, we need to consider their relative positions. California is west of
      Utah. Therefore, any location in California, including Los Angeles, is west
      of any location in Utah.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Panguitch Lake, UT, is in Utah and Immanuel Presbyterian
      Church is in California, and knowing that California is west of Utah, it means
      Panguitch Lake, UT, is east of Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles,
      California. Thus, Panguitch Lake, UT, is not west of Immanuel Presbyterian Church
      in Los Angeles, California.

      the locations of both the Civic Theatre in New Orleans, Louisiana, and the Dal-Tex
      Building in Texas, and then compare their positions relative to each other,
      specifically in terms of east-west orientation.


      1. **Identify the location of Civic Theatre (New Orleans), LA**: New Orleans
      is a city located in the state of Louisiana. Louisiana is in the southeastern
      part of the United States.


      2. **Identify the location of Dal-Tex Building, TX**: The Dal-Tex Building is
      located in Dallas, Texas. Dallas is a city in the northern part of Texas, and
      Texas is in the south-central part of the United States.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Louisiana, where the Civic Theatre is located,
      is generally east of Texas, where the Dal-Tex Building is located. This is because
      Louisiana is part of the southeastern United States, while Texas is considered
      part of the southwestern United States.


      Given these steps, since Louisiana (where Civic Theatre is located) is east
      of Texas (where Dal-Tex Building is located), the Civic Theatre in New Orleans,
      LA, is not west of the Dal-Tex Building, TX.
