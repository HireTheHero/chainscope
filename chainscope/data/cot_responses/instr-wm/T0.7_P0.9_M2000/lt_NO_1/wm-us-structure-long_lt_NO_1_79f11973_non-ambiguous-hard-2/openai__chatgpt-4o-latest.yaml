      **Step 1: Identify the locations**

      - The James R. Thompson Center is located in downtown Chicago, Illinois.

      - Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is located in Minneapolis, Minnesota.


      **Step 2: Understand geographical coordinates**

      - Longitude determines how far east or west a location is. The more negative
      the longitude (in the Western Hemisphere), the farther west the location is.


      **Step 3: Find the approximate longitudes**

      - Chicago, IL (Thompson Center): approximately **-87.63** degrees longitude.

      - Minneapolis, MN (Our Lady of Lourdes): approximately **-93.26** degrees longitude.


      **Step 4: Compare the longitudes**

      - -87.63 (Chicago) is more east than -93.26 (Minneapolis), since it is a smaller
      negative number.

      - Therefore, Chicago is east of Minneapolis.

      we need to analyze the geographic positions of both locations.


      Step 1: Determine the location of St. Mary''s Church.

      - St. Mary''s Church is in New Haven, Connecticut.

      - New Haven is located in the southern part of Connecticut, which is in the
      northeastern United States.


      Step 2: Determine the location of Mississinewa Lake Dam.

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United States, west of Connecticut.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      - Since Connecticut is on the East Coast and Indiana is farther inland to the
      west, New Haven, CT is clearly east of the Mississinewa Lake Dam, IN.


      Therefore, St. Mary''s Church in New Haven, CT is located EAST of Mississinewa

      in Connecticut is located west of The Emerson Theater in Indiana, we need to
      compare their geographical positions, specifically their longitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Long Wharf Theatre.

      - Long Wharf Theatre is located in New Haven, Connecticut.

      - Connecticut is in the northeastern United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of The Emerson Theater.

      - The Emerson Theater is located in Indianapolis, Indiana.

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 3: Understand the relative positions.

      - Indiana is geographically west of Connecticut.

      - Therefore, Indianapolis (IN) is west of New Haven (CT).


      Step 4: Conclusion based on geography.

      - Since Connecticut is east of Indiana, Long Wharf Theatre is east of The Emerson
      Theater.

      **Step 1: Identify the location of St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, NY**

      - St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church is located at the World Trade Center site
      in Lower Manhattan, New York City.

      - New York City is on the East Coast of the United States.

      - The approximate longitude of New York City is around **-74 degrees**.

      - Nashville is in the state of Tennessee, which is located in the southeastern
      region of the United States, generally west of New York.

      - The Nashville Municipal Auditorium is in downtown Nashville.

      - The approximate longitude of Nashville is around **-86.8 degrees**.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes**

      - Longitudes increase in magnitude (more negative) as you go west in the Western
      Hemisphere.

      - -86.8 (Nashville) is farther west than -74 (New York).

      - Therefore, New York is east of Nashville.

      in Tennessee is located west of Blue Canyon Wind Farm in Oklahoma, we need to
      analyze their relative geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Tellico Reservoir, TN.

      - Tellico Reservoir is located in eastern Tennessee, near the town of Lenoir
      City, which is close to Knoxville. This places it in the eastern part of the
      state of Tennessee.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Blue Canyon Wind Farm, OK.

      - Blue Canyon Wind Farm is located near Lawton, Oklahoma, in the southwestern
      part of the state.


      Step 3: Determine the relative longitudinal positions.

      - Eastern Tennessee (where Tellico Reservoir is located) lies significantly
      farther east than southwestern Oklahoma (where Blue Canyon Wind Farm is located).

      - Tennessee is in the Eastern Time Zone, while Oklahoma is in the Central Time
      Zone, further indicating that Tennessee is east of Oklahoma.

      Massachusetts (MA) is located west of La Comedia Dinner Theatre in Ohio (OH),
      we need to compare their longitudinal positions.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Weston Reservoir.

      - Weston Reservoir is located in Weston, Massachusetts, which is a suburb west
      of Boston.

      - Massachusetts is a northeastern state in the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of La Comedia Dinner Theatre.

      - La Comedia Dinner Theatre is located in Springboro, Ohio.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States and is generally
      west of Massachusetts.


      Step 3: Compare the general longitudinal positions.

      - Massachusetts lies further east than Ohio.

      - Therefore, Weston Reservoir, located in Massachusetts, should be east of La
      Comedia Dinner Theatre in Ohio.


      Conclusion:

      Since Weston Reservoir is in Massachusetts and La Comedia Dinner Theatre is
      in Ohio, and Ohio is west of Massachusetts, Weston Reservoir is east of La Comedia
      Dinner Theatre.

      in New York City, NY is located west of Lewis Smith Lake in Alabama, we need
      to compare their longitudes. The further west a location is, the more negative
      (or lower) its longitude in degrees.


      **Step 1: Determine the location of Astor Theatre (New York City), NY.**

      - New York City is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      - Approximate longitude of New York City: **around -74 degrees**.


      **Step 2: Determine the location of Lewis Smith Lake, Alabama.**

      - Lewis Smith Lake is located in northern Alabama.

      - Approximate longitude of Lewis Smith Lake: **around -87 degrees**.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      - -87 degrees (Lewis Smith Lake) is further west than -74 degrees (New York
      City).

      - Therefore, New York City (and the Astor Theatre) is located **east** of Lewis
      Smith Lake.

      negative number), the farther west the location is.

      - -87.685 (Gibson) is more west than -73.991 (41 Cooper Square).


      Conclusion:

      41 Cooper Square is east of the Gibson Generating Station.

    1eedfaaf-a60e-4a88-9dab-cbd8251a62c8: 'To determine whether Bull Shoals Dam, AR
      is located west of Civic Center Music Hall, OK, we need to analyze the geographic
      locations of both structures.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Bull Shoals Dam.

      - Bull Shoals Dam is located in northern Arkansas, near the town of Bull Shoals,
      close to the border with Missouri.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Civic Center Music Hall.

      - Civic Center Music Hall is located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions.

      - Oklahoma City is in central Oklahoma, which is generally west of the Arkansas
      border.

      - Arkansas is east of Oklahoma, so Bull Shoals Dam, being in Arkansas, is further
      east than Oklahoma City.


      Step 4: Conclusion.

      - Since Bull Shoals Dam is in Arkansas and Civic Center Music Hall is in Oklahoma
      City, and Arkansas is east of Oklahoma, Bull Shoals Dam is located east of Civic
      Center Music Hall.


      Final Answer: NO.'
