      1.  **Locate Lake Mohave, AZ:** Lake Mohave is a reservoir on the Colorado River,
      forming part of the border between Arizona and Nevada. It''s in the northwestern
      part of Arizona.

      2.  **Locate Loch Lomond (California), CA:** There is a Loch Lomond Recreation
      Area (with a reservoir also called Loch Lomond) near Felton, in the Santa Cruz
      Mountains of California. This is in coastal California, south of the San Francisco
      Bay Area.

      3.  **Compare their positions:** California is west of Arizona. More specifically,
      the Santa Cruz Mountains in California are significantly west of the Arizona/Nevada
      border where Lake Mohave is situated.

      4.  **Answer the question:** Is Lake Mohave, AZ located west of Loch Lomond
      (California), CA? Since Lake Mohave is in Arizona/Nevada and Loch Lomond is
      in coastal California, Lake Mohave is *east* of Loch Lomond, CA.

      1.  **Location 1:** St. Mary''s Episcopal Cathedral is in Memphis, Tennessee.
      Memphis is in the far southwestern corner of Tennessee, right on the Mississippi
      River.

      2.  **Location 2:** Lake Icaria is in Iowa. A quick search shows Lake Icaria
      is in Adams County, southwestern Iowa.

      3.  **Relative Position:** Iowa is generally west and north of Tennessee. Southwestern
      Iowa would be significantly west of southwestern Tennessee. The Mississippi
      River forms part of the eastern border of Iowa and the western border of Tennessee.
      Memphis is on the *eastern* side of the Mississippi River. Lake Icaria is well
      west of the Mississippi River.


      Therefore, St. Mary''s Episcopal Cathedral in Memphis, TN is *east* of Lake
      Icaria, IA.

      is east of Indiana, Long Wharf Theatre is east of The Emerson Theater.


      Therefore, the answer is:

      NO'
    9881f3f7-90af-45eb-8dce-56d875009ad8: 'Okay, let''s break this down:


      1.  **Locate Long Wharf Theatre, CT:** Long Wharf Theatre is in New Haven, Connecticut.
      Connecticut is an East Coast state.

      2.  **Locate The Emerson Theater, IN:** The Emerson Theater is in Indianapolis,
      Indiana. Indiana is a Midwestern state.

      3.  **Compare their relative positions:** Geographically, the East Coast (where
      Connecticut is) is east of the Midwest (where Indiana is).

      4.  **Determine "west of":** For Long Wharf Theatre, CT to be *west* of The
      Emerson Theater, IN, Connecticut would need to be further west than Indiana.
      This is not the case. Connecticut is east of Indiana.


      Therefore, Long Wharf Theatre, CT is *not* located west of The Emerson Theater,
      IN.


      NO'

      1.  **Locate Horseshoe Lake, Arizona:** This lake is in Arizona.

      2.  **Locate Binoculars Building, CA:** This iconic building (officially the
      Chiat/Day Building) is in Venice, Los Angeles, California.

      3.  **Determine Relative Positions:** California is on the Pacific coast of
      the United States. Arizona is a state directly to the east of California.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, any location in Arizona (like Horseshoe Lake)
      will be east of a location in California (like the Binoculars Building).


      So, is Horseshoe Lake, Arizona, AZ located west of Binoculars Building, CA?

      \ major cities in the continental United States. Its approximate longitude is\
      \ around 117.16\xB0 West.\n\n2.  **Locate El Vado Lake, NM:** El Vado Lake is\
      \ in northern New Mexico. New Mexico is a state located east of California.\
      \ The approximate longitude of El Vado Lake is around 106.73\xB0 West.\n\n3.\
      \  **Compare Longitudes:** To determine if one location is west of another,\
      \ we compare their longitudes. Locations with a numerically larger West longitude\
      \ are further west (or numerically smaller East longitude).\n    *   St. Paul's\
      \ Cathedral: ~117.16\xB0 W\n    *   El Vado Lake: ~106.73\xB0 W\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\
      \ Since 117.16\xB0 W represents a position further west than 106.73\xB0 W, St.\

      Station, MA is *west of* Rose Valley Lake, PA. Since Massachusetts is east of
      Pennsylvania, Kendall Cogeneration Station is *east of* Rose Valley Lake.


      Therefore, the statement "Kendall Cogeneration Station, MA is located west of
      Rose Valley Lake (Pennsylvania), PA" is false.
