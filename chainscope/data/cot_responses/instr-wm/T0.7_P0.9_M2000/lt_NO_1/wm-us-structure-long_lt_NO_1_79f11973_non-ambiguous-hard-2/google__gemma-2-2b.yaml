      RI is located west of Buckhorn Lake (Kentucky), KY.


      First, we know that Vernon Court, RI is located in Rhode Island.


      Then, we know that Rhode Island is located in the northeastern part of the United
      States, and that the state is bordered by Massachusetts to the north and Connecticut
      to the east.


      So we can assume that Vernon Court, RI is located east of Massachusetts and
      Connecticut.


      Finally, we can assume that Vernon Court, RI is located west of Buckhorn Lake
      (Kentucky), KY, because it is west of the state of Kentucky.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is yes. Vernon Court, RI is located west
      of Buckhorn Lake (Kentucky), KY.

      I''m not sure I understand what you are asking. If you are asking if the locations
      are near to each other then the answer is no. They are not near each other.
      If you are asking if the locations are the same then the answer is yes. They
      are the same location.


      I don''t see anything in the question that says they are near each other. I
      don''t see anything in the question that says they are the same location.

      That is a really stupid question.


      There are hundreds of places in the US with the name "Lake".


      You could say that "Lake Michigan" is located west of "Lake Tahoe".


      Is that correct?


      Yes, you could say that.

      The first question is stupid.


      If you''re asking about whether they are the same location, the answer is "yes".


      If you''re asking if they are close to each other, the answer is "no".


      They are not close to each other.

      You are not making any sense.
