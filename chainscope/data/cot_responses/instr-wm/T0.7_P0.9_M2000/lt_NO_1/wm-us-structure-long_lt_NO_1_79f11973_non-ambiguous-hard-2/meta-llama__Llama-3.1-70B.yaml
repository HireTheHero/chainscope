      \ the process:\n\n1. **Identify the locations**: \n   - Mahalia Jackson Theater\
      \ of the Performing Arts is located in Louisiana (LA).\n   - Ford Park is located\
      \ in Texas (TX).\n\n2. **Understand the geography**:\n   - Louisiana is generally\
      \ located east of Texas, given the west-to-east sequence of states in the United\
      \ States.\n\n3. **Specific locations**: However, to answer this question accurately,\
      \ we need to consider the specific locations of these places within their respective\
      \ states. \n\n4. **Mahalia Jackson Theater**: It is located in New Orleans,\
      \ which is in the southeastern part of Louisiana.\n\n5. **Ford Park**: This\
      \ park is situated in Beaumont, Texas, which is in the southeastern part of\
      \ Texas.\n\n6. **Comparison**: Given that Louisiana is east of Texas, for Mahalia\
      \ Jackson Theater to be west of Ford Park, it would have to be in a very western\
      \ part of Louisiana, and Ford Park would have to be in a relatively eastern\
      \ part of Texas, or at least their longitudes would need to be compared directly.\n\
      \n7. **Longitudinal comparison**: Without exact longitudes, we can make an educated\
      \ guess based on the general geography. Louisiana is to the east of Texas, but\
      \ the specific locations of these places (Mahalia Jackson Theater in southeastern\
      \ Louisiana and Ford Park in southeastern Texas) suggest that Mahalia Jackson\
      \ Theater might still be east of Ford Park due to the overall east-west alignment\
      \ of the states.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: Given the general geography and without\
      \ precise longitudinal data, the most reasonable assumption based on state locations\
      \ is that Mahalia Jackson Theater, LA is likely east of Ford Park, TX, because\
      \ Louisiana as a whole is east of Texas. However, for a definitive answer, exact\
      \ longitudes or a detailed map would be necessary. But considering typical geographical\
      \ layouts and the fact that these locations are not on the extreme edges of\
      \ their states in a way that would reverse the general east-west relationship\

      \ located west of Fitzsimons Army Medical Center, CO, let's break down the steps:\n\
      \n1. **Identify the locations**: Mammy's Cupboard is in Mississippi (MS), and\
      \ Fitzsimons Army Medical Center is in Colorado (CO).\n\n2. **General geographical\
      \ knowledge**: Mississippi is generally located east of Colorado, given the\
      \ west-to-east sequence of states in the United States.\n\n3. **Specific locations**:\

      \ locations of these landmarks within their respective states. \n\n4. **Mammy's\
      \ Cupboard**: It is located in the central-southern part of Mississippi.\n\n\
      5. **Fitzsimons Army Medical Center**: This center is situated in the central-northern\
      \ part of Colorado.\n\n6. **Comparison**: Given that Mississippi is east of\
      \ Colorado, for Mammy's Cupboard to be west of Fitzsimons Army Medical Center,\
      \ it would have to be in a very western part of Mississippi, and Fitzsimons\
      \ Army Medical Center would have to be in a relatively eastern part of Colorado,\
      \ or at least their longitudes would need to be compared directly.\n\n7. **Longitudinal\
      \ comparison**: Without exact longitudes, we can make an educated guess based\
      \ on the general geography. Mississippi is to the east of Colorado, but the\
      \ specific locations of these landmarks (Mammy's Cupboard in central-southern\
      \ Mississippi and Fitzsimons Army Medical Center in central-northern Colorado)\
      \ suggest that Mammy's Cupboard might still be east of Fitzsimons Army Medical\
      \ Center due to the overall east-west alignment of the states.\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\
      \ Given the general geography and without precise longitudinal data, the most\
      \ reasonable assumption based on state locations is that Mammy's Cupboard, MS\
      \ is likely east of Fitzsimons Army Medical Center, CO, because Mississippi\
      \ as a whole is east of Colorado. However, for a definitive answer, exact longitudes\
      \ or a detailed map would be necessary. But considering typical geographical\
      \ layouts and the fact that these landmarks are not on the extreme edges of\
      \ their states in a way that would reverse the general east-west relationship\

      \ geography and without precise longitudinal data, the most reasonable assumption\
      \ based on state locations is that Rockport Reservoir, UT is likely east of\

      \ California. However, for a definitive answer, exact longitudes or a detailed\
      \ map would be necessary. But considering typical geographical layouts and the\

      the relative positions of Utah and California and the locations of the specific
      structures within these states. Here''s a step-by-step approach:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Rockport Reservoir is located in Utah (UT), and
      Saint Sophia Cathedral is located in Los Angeles, California (CA).


      2. **Understand the general geography**: Utah is located east of California

      AZ is located west of Copper Mountain Solar Facility, NV, let''s break down
      the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Apache Lake is in Arizona (AZ), and Copper Mountain
      Solar Facility is in Nevada (NV).


      2. **General geographical knowledge**: Arizona is generally located to the southeast
      of Nevada.


      3. **Specific locations**: However, to answer this question accurately, we need
      to consider the specific locations of these places within their respective states.


      4. **Apache Lake**: It is located in the central part of Arizona.


      5. **Copper Mountain Solar Facility**: This facility is situated in the southern
      part of Nevada.


      6. **Comparison**: Given that Arizona is southeast of Nevada, for Apache Lake
      to be west of Copper Mountain Solar Facility, it would have to be in a very
      western part of Arizona, and Copper Mountain Solar Facility would have to be
      in a relatively eastern part of Nevada, or at least their longitudes would need
      to be compared directly.


      7. **Longitudinal comparison**: Without exact longitudes, we can make an educated
      guess based on the general geography. Arizona is to the southeast of Nevada,
      but the specific locations of these places (Apache Lake in central Arizona and
      Copper Mountain Solar Facility in southern Nevada) suggest that Apache Lake
      might still be east of Copper Mountain Solar Facility due to the overall east-west
      alignment of the states.


      8. **Conclusion**: Given the general geography and without precise longitudinal
      data, the most reasonable assumption based on state locations is that Apache
      Lake, AZ is likely east of Copper Mountain Solar Facility, NV, because Arizona
      as a whole is southeast of Nevada. However, for a definitive answer, exact longitudes
      or a detailed map would be necessary. But considering typical geographical layouts
      and the fact that these locations are not on the extreme edges of their states
      in a way that would reverse the general east-west relationship between Arizona
      and Nevada, we lean towards a geographical understanding that suggests Apache
      Lake is not west of Copper Mountain Solar Facility.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

    41850171-2759-4e6b-90b9-3390ecacf12a: 'To determine if Richland-Chambers Reservoir,
      TX is located west of Parker Canyon Lake, AZ, we need to consider the following
      steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Richland-Chambers Reservoir is located in Texas
      (TX), and Parker Canyon Lake is located in Arizona (AZ).


      2. **Understand the geography**: Arizona is generally west of Texas, given the
      west-to-east sequence of states in the United States.


      3. **Specific locations**: However, to answer this question accurately, we need
      to consider the specific locations of these reservoirs within their respective
      states.


      4. **Richland-Chambers Reservoir**: It is located in the northern part of Texas.


      5. **Parker Canyon Lake**: This lake is situated in the southern part of Arizona.


      6. **Comparison**: Given that Arizona is west of Texas, for Richland-Chambers
      Reservoir to be west of Parker Canyon Lake, it would have to be in a very western
      part of Texas, and Parker Canyon Lake would have to be in a relatively eastern
      part of Arizona, or at least their longitudes would need to be compared directly.


      7. **Longitudinal comparison**: Without exact longitudes, we can make an educated
      guess based on the general geography. Texas is east of Arizona, but the specific
      locations of these reservoirs (Richland-Chambers in northern Texas and Parker
      Canyon Lake in southern Arizona) suggest that Richland-Chambers Reservoir might
      still be east of Parker Canyon Lake due to the overall east-west alignment of
      the states.


      8. **Conclusion**: Given the general geography and without precise longitudinal
      data, the most reasonable assumption based on state locations is that Richland-Chambers
      Reservoir, TX is likely east of Parker Canyon Lake, AZ, because Texas as a whole
      is east of Arizona. However, for a definitive answer, exact longitudes or a
      detailed map would be necessary. But considering typical geographical layouts
      and the fact that these reservoirs are not on the extreme edges of their states
      in a way that would reverse the general east-west relationship between Texas
      and Arizona, we lean towards a geographical understanding that suggests Richland-Chambers
      Reservoir is not west of Parker Canyon Lake.

      the specific locations of Lake Cascade and Topaz Solar Farm within their respective
      states.


      4. **Lake Cascade**: It is located in the southwestern part of Idaho.


      5. **Topaz Solar Farm**: This solar farm is situated in the southern part of
      California.


      6. **Comparison**: Given that Idaho is east of California, for Lake Cascade
      to be west of Topaz Solar Farm, it would have to be in a very western part of
      Idaho, and Topaz Solar Farm would have to be in a relatively eastern part of
      California.


      7. **Longitudinal comparison**: Without exact longitudes, we can make an educated
      guess based on the general geography. Idaho is to the east of California, but
      the specific locations of these sites (Lake Cascade in southwestern Idaho and
      Topaz Solar Farm in southern California) suggest that Lake Cascade might still
      be east of Topaz Solar Farm due to the overall east-west alignment of the states.


      8. **Conclusion**: Given the general geography and without precise longitudinal
      data, the most reasonable assumption based on state locations is that Lake Cascade,
      ID is likely east of Topaz Solar Farm, CA, because Idaho as a whole is east
      of California. However, for a definitive answer, exact longitudes or a detailed
      map would be necessary. But considering typical geographical layouts and the
      fact that these sites are not on the extreme edges of their states in a way
      that would reverse the general east-west relationship between Idaho and California,
      we lean towards a geographical understanding that suggests Lake Cascade is not
      west of Topaz Solar Farm.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      2. **Understand geographic directions**: West is the direction towards the setting
      sun, or generally towards the Pacific Ocean from any given point in the United

      3. **Compare the locations geographically**: California is located on the West
      Coast of the United States, while Oregon is also on the West Coast but generally
      north of California.


      4. **Consider the specific locations**: Sandals Church is likely located in
      Southern California, while Lost Creek Lake is in Southern Oregon.


      5. **Compare the longitudes**: Since both locations are on the West Coast, we
      need to compare their longitudes. Generally, locations with higher longitudes
      are further west.

      is located west of Auraria Campus, CO, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Stockton Lake is located in Missouri (MO), and
      Auraria Campus is located in Colorado (CO).


      2. **Understand the general geography**: Missouri is generally located east
      of Colorado. However, we need to consider the specific locations of these places
      within their respective states.


      3. **Specific locations**: Stockton Lake is in the southwestern part of Missouri,
      while Auraria Campus is in the central part of Colorado.


      4. **Comparison**: Given that Missouri is generally east of Colorado, for Stockton
      Lake to be west of Auraria Campus, it would have to be in a very western part
      of Missouri, and Auraria Campus would have to be in a relatively eastern part
      of Colorado, or at least their longitudes would need to be compared directly.


      5. **Longitudinal comparison**: Without exact longitudes, we can make an educated
      guess based on the general geography. Missouri is to the east of Colorado, but
      the specific locations of these places (Stockton Lake in southwestern Missouri
      and Auraria Campus in central Colorado) suggest that Stockton Lake might still
      be east of Auraria Campus due to the overall east-west alignment of the states.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given the general geography and without precise longitudinal
      data, the most reasonable assumption based on state locations is that Stockton
      Lake, MO is likely east of Auraria Campus, CO, because Missouri as a whole is
      east of Colorado. However, for a definitive answer, exact longitudes or a detailed
      map would be necessary. But considering typical geographical layouts and the
      fact that these locations are not on the extreme edges of their states in a
      way that would reverse the general east-west relationship between Missouri and
      Colorado, we lean towards a geographical understanding that suggests Stockton
      Lake is not west of Auraria Campus.

      \nBased on the steps above, the answer to whether Panguitch Lake, UT is located\
      \ west of Immanuel Presbyterian Church (Los Angeles, California), CA is: **NO**"
    e3be8332-72b6-4eb2-be89-75772f097392: 'To determine if Panguitch Lake, UT is located
      west of Immanuel Presbyterian Church (Los Angeles, California), CA, we need
      to consider the following steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Panguitch Lake is in Utah (UT), and Immanuel
      Presbyterian Church is in Los Angeles, California (CA).


      2. **Understand the geography**: Utah is generally located to the east of California,
      given the general east-west layout of the United States.


      3. **Specific locations**: However, to answer this question accurately, we need
      to consider the specific locations of Panguitch Lake and Immanuel Presbyterian
      Church within their respective states.


      4. **Panguitch Lake**: This lake is situated in the southern part of Utah.


      5. **Immanuel Presbyterian Church**: This church is located in Los Angeles,
      which is in the southern part of California.


      6. **Comparison**: Given that Utah is generally east of California, for Panguitch
      Lake to be west of Immanuel Presbyterian Church, it would have to be in a very
      western part of Utah, and Immanuel Presbyterian Church would have to be in a
      relatively eastern part of California, or at least their longitudes would need
      to be compared directly.


      7. **Longitudinal comparison**: Without exact longitudes, we can make an educated
      guess based on the general geography. Utah is to the east of California, but
      the specific locations of Panguitch Lake and Immanuel Presbyterian Church (in
      the southern parts of their states) suggest that Panguitch Lake might still
      be east of Immanuel Presbyterian Church due to the overall east-west alignment
      of the states.


      8. **Conclusion**: Given the general geography and without precise longitudinal
      data, the most reasonable assumption based on state locations is that Panguitch
      Lake, UT is likely east of Immanuel Presbyterian Church (Los Angeles, California),
      CA, because Utah as a whole is east of California. However, for a definitive
      answer, exact longitudes or a detailed map would be necessary. But considering
      typical geographical layouts and the fact that these locations are not on the
      extreme edges of their states in a way that would reverse the general east-west
      relationship between Utah and California, we lean towards a geographical understanding
      that suggests Panguitch Lake is not west of Immanuel Presbyterian Church.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$
