      3. St. Peter Cathedral is in Marquette, Michigan.

      4. Marquette, Michigan is in the Eastern Time Zone.

      5. Generally, locations further west are in time zones further west (e.g., Central,
      Mountain, Pacific).  Since both locations are in the same time zone, and the
      US mainland doesn''t have significant longitudinal deviations within the same
      time zone, it''s highly unlikely for a location further east to be west of a
      location in the same time zone.

      6. Therefore, The Mark Hotel is almost certainly EAST of St. Peter Cathedral.

      United States, but further west than Fairfax, Virginia.


      4. **West means higher longitude:**  Locations west of a point will have a higher
      longitude value (further west of the Prime Meridian). Since Asheville is west
      of Fairfax, its longitude will be higher.

      need the longitude of each church.  Longitude measures east-west position.


      2. **Compare the longitudes:**  A location further west will have a *larger*
      longitude value (in the Western Hemisphere, where both these churches are).


      3. **Determine west/east based on comparison:** If Truro Church has a *larger*
      longitude than the Cathedral of All Souls, it is west of the Cathedral.


      Truro Church, Fairfax, VA is approximately at -77.3 degrees longitude.

      Cathedral of All Souls, Asheville, NC is approximately at -82.5 degrees longitude.


      Since -77.3 is *less than* -82.5, Truro Church is *east* of the Cathedral of
      All Souls.
