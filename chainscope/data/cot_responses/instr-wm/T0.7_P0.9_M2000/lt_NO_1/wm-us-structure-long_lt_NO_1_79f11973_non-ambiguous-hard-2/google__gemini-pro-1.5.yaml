      Rosary Cathedral (Toledo, OH) is approximately at -83.55 longitude.

      Omaha Community Playhouse (Omaha, NE) is approximately at -95.94 longitude.


      Since -83.55 is *less than* -95.94 (remember, with negative numbers, smaller
      values are actually greater), Toledo is *east* of Omaha.

      3. **General US Geography:** Massachusetts is a northeastern state, while Georgia
      is a southeastern state.  Generally, locations further east will have a more
      easterly longitude.

      4. **West/East Relationship:**  For a location A to be west of location B, the
      longitude of A must be less than the longitude of B. Since Massachusetts is

      4. **California vs. Oregon:** California is generally west of Oregon.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

    b76701da-3dcc-48f5-bd5c-1d592cb64cbc: '1. **Locate Sandals Church, CA:** Sandals
      Church has multiple locations in California.  We need to determine if *any*
      of them are west of Lost Creek Lake.

      2. **Locate Lost Creek Lake, OR:** Lost Creek Lake is in southern Oregon.

      3. **West of Lost Creek Lake:**  Being "west" of Lost Creek Lake means being
      further west along lines of longitude.  Since California is west of Oregon,
      any location in California will be west of any location in Oregon.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.

      Church has multiple locations in California.  We need to determine if *any*
      of them are west of Lost Creek Lake.


      2. **Locate Lost Creek Lake, OR:** Lost Creek Lake is in southern Oregon.


      3. **Determine general longitudinal coordinates:**  California is generally
      west of Oregon.  Therefore, anything in California is likely west of anything
      in Oregon.


      4. **Consider edge cases:** While most of California is west of Oregon, the
      northern border of California extends slightly further east than the southern
      border of Oregon.  So we need to make sure no Sandals Church locations are in
      far northeastern California.


      5. **Verify (if possible):** A quick search indicates that Sandals Church locations
      are primarily in Southern California and the Central Valley. These areas are
      definitively west of Lost Creek Lake.


      YES

    c04fa9ef-137c-4bc4-9ce6-dd4b722735c6: '1. **Locate Sandals Church, CA:** Sandals
      Church has multiple locations in California.  We need to consider the general
      area of California since the question asks about a relative location to Oregon.  California
      is west of Oregon.


      2. **Locate Lost Creek Lake, OR:** Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon.


      3. **West of Lost Creek Lake:** Anything west of Lost Creek Lake would generally
      be further west in Oregon or potentially into the Pacific Ocean.


      4. **Is California west of Oregon?** Yes.


      Therefore, since Sandals Church is in California, and California is west of
      Oregon, and Lost Creek Lake is *in* Oregon, Sandals Church is west of Lost Creek
      Lake.


      YES

      Sandals Church has multiple locations in California.  However, California is

      Sandals Church has multiple locations in California, most of them in Southern

      Lake is in Southern Oregon. Therefore, even the easternmost Sandals Church location
      in California is likely west of Lost Creek Lake, Oregon.
