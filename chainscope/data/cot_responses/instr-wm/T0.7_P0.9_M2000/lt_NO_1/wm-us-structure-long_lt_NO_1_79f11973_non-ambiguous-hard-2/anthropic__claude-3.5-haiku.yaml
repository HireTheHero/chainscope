    90ad21d8-7dc0-4632-841f-6543baaeb651: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Tower 49, NY on a map

      2. Then I''ll locate Lake Wateree, SC on a map

      3. Then I''ll determine their relative positions


      Step 1: Tower 49 is likely in New York state

      Step 2: Lake Wateree is located in South Carolina

      Step 3: These locations are in different states, quite far apart


      Checking their geographic positions:

      - Tower 49, NY would be in the New York City area

      - Lake Wateree is in central South Carolina


      To be west of Lake Wateree, Tower 49 would need to be west of South Carolina


      Conclusion: Tower 49, NY is NOT west of Lake Wateree, SC. It is actually far
      to the northeast.

      - San Bernardino is in Southern California, in San Bernardino County

      - It is located inland, east of Los Angeles


      2. Next, I''ll locate Trojan Nuclear Power Plant

      - This was located in Oregon

      - Specifically, it was near Rainier, Columbia County, in northwestern Oregon


      3. Comparing their geographic positions

      - San Bernardino is in Southern California (south and east)

      - Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is in northwestern Oregon

      - Oregon is north and west of California


      4. Comparing their west/east positioning

      - Since the nuclear plant is in Oregon (west of California), and San Bernardino
      is in California (east of Oregon), the California Theatre is EAST of the Trojan
      Nuclear Power Plant


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

    06dd1411-3bb5-488a-8a09-13bf1c5d2943: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate 120 Wall Street

      - This is in Manhattan, New York City, on the east side of Manhattan

      - It is located in the eastern part of New York state


      2. Next, locate Bayles Lake

      - Bayles Lake is in Illinois

      - Illinois is a state west of New York


      3. Reasoning about geographical positioning

      - New York state is entirely east of Illinois

      - Manhattan is even further east within New York state

      - 120 Wall Street is on the eastern edge of Manhattan


      4. Comparing their geographical positions

      - 120 Wall Street is east of Bayles Lake, IL

      - Therefore, it is NOT west of Bayles Lake


      5. Answer determination

      - The question asks: "Is 120 Wall Street, NY located west of Bayles Lake (Illinois),
      IL?"

      - The answer is NO
