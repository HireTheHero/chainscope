    a4b9eb0f-bb45-4efd-bab4-08de67993b64: 'To determine whether Purdue University
      College of Agriculture is located south of the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering,
      we need to consider their relative positions on the Purdue University campus
      in West Lafayette, Indiana.


      1. **Identify the location of the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering**:
      The Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering is located in the Martin C. Jischke
      Hall of Biomedical Engineering.


      2. **Identify the location of the College of Agriculture**: The College of Agriculture
      encompasses several buildings, with one of the main administrative buildings
      being Pfendler Hall.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Both the Martin C. Jischke Hall and
      Pfendler Hall are situated on the Purdue University campus. Based on the campus
      map, Pfendler Hall (College of Agriculture) is located more towards the south
      compared to the Martin C. Jischke Hall (Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering).


      Thus, the Purdue University College of Agriculture is indeed located south of
      the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering.

      3. **Relative Positions on the FSU Campus**: Both the Askew School of Public
      Administration and Policy and the College of Social Sciences are located on
      the main campus of FSU in Tallahassee. The exact buildings for each school are
      different, but they are part of the same university campus.


      Considering that both are located on the same campus, the question of whether
      one is south of the other is very specific. However, generally, these departments
      do not have significant enough separation or distinction in cardinal direction
      to make a meaningful statement about one being south of the other without a
      detailed campus map.


      Therefore, based on the available information, the answer is: **NO**. The Askew
      School of Public Administration and Policy is not distinctly located south of
      the Florida State University College of Social Sciences in a way that is typically
      considered significant or relevant.'

      the locations of both institutions:


      1. **George Washington University School of Nursing, DC** - This school is part
      of the George Washington University, which primarily has its main campus located
      in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C.


      2. **Corcoran College of Art and Design, DC** - The Corcoran School of the Arts
      and Design is now part of George Washington University, and it is also situated
      in the Foggy Bottom area, near the main campus of George Washington University.


      Given that both institutions are located within close proximity to each other
      in the Foggy Bottom area, determining which one is south of the other involves
      looking at specific locations on a map.


      Since both are part of the same university and generally centered around the
      same main campus, there isn''t a significant north-south distinction between
      them. The specific buildings related to each may vary slightly in their north-south
      orientation, but they are essentially part of the same geographic area.


      Thus, the answer to whether the George Washington University School of Nursing
      is located south of the Corcoran College of Art and Design is:


      NO.'
