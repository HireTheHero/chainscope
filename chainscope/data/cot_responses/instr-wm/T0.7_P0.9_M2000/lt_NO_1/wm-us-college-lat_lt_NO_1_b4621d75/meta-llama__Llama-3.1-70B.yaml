      \ both universities are in Chicago, without exact addresses or more specific\

      1. **Identify the locations**: Both Eastern Michigan University College of Arts
      and Sciences and Eastern Michigan University College of Education are located
      in Ypsilanti, Michigan. This means they are in the same city, so we need to
      look at their specific addresses or locations within the city to determine which
      one is south of the other.


      2. **Compare the locations**: Since both colleges are located in Ypsilanti,
      we need to consider their exact addresses or positions within the city to determine
      which one is south of the other. However, given that they share the same city,
      the difference in their locations would typically be minimal in terms of cardinal
      directions (north, south, east, west) unless specific addresses or neighborhoods
      are compared.


      3. **Conclusion based on shared location**: Given that both colleges are in
      Ypsilanti, Michigan, without exact addresses or more specific locations within
      the city, it''s reasonable to infer that they are not significantly north or
      south of each other in a way that would make one distinctly south of the other
      based solely on their shared city location. However, for the purpose of this
      question and without further detailed information, we must consider if there''s
      any implication that one might be slightly south or north based on typical city
      layouts or any available general information.


      Based on the steps and information provided, since both colleges are located
      in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and without more specific details on their exact locations

      the locations of the two colleges and determine if one is located south of the

      1. **Identify the locations**: Both colleges are part of Eastern Michigan University
      (EMU), which is located in Ypsilanti, Michigan.


      2. **Consider the campus layout**: Since both colleges are part of the same
      university, they are likely located on the same campus or in close proximity
      to each other. The exact locations of the specific colleges on the campus might
      not be known, but we can assume they are relatively close to each other.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Given that they are both part of the same university
      campus, there might not be a significant difference in their geographical locations
      within the campus. However, if one college is located in a building or area
      that is slightly south of the other, it could be considered as being located
      "south" of the other.

      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Franklin Pierce University and Westmar University. Franklin Pierce University
      is located in Rindge, New Hampshire. Westmar University is located in Le Mars,
      Iowa.


      2. **Understand the Geographical Relationship**: To determine if Franklin Pierce
      University is located south of Westmar University, we need to understand the
      geographical relationship between New Hampshire and Iowa. New Hampshire is located
      in the northeastern part of the United States, while Iowa is in the Midwest.


      3. **Compare the Locations**: Based on their locations, Franklin Pierce University
      in New Hampshire is generally northeast of Westmar University in Iowa. This
      means that Franklin Pierce University is not south of Westmar University.
