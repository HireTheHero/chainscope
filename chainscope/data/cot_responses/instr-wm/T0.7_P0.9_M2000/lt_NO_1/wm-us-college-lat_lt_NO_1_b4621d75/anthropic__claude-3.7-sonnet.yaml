      Step 2: Since Kate Gleason College of Engineering is a college within RIT, it
      is located on the RIT campus.


      Step 3: If Kate Gleason College of Engineering is part of RIT and located on

      Step 1: Let me identify what Kate Gleason College of Engineering is.

      Kate Gleason College of Engineering is actually one of the colleges within Rochester
      Institute of Technology. It''s not a separate institution but rather a college/department
      of RIT.


      Step 2: Since Kate Gleason College of Engineering is part of RIT and located
      on RIT''s campus, it cannot be geographically north or south of RIT as a whole.
      The college is contained within RIT''s campus boundaries.


      Step 3: It would be like asking if New York City is south of Manhattan - it''s
      not a valid geographical comparison since Manhattan is part of New York City.


      NO - Rochester Institute of Technology is not located south of Kate Gleason
      College of Engineering, because Kate Gleason College of Engineering is a part
      of RIT itself, not a separate location.'

      First, let me identify what these institutions are:

      - Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) is a private university located in
      Rochester, New York

      - Kate Gleason College of Engineering is actually one of the colleges within
      RIT, not a separate institution


      Since Kate Gleason College of Engineering is a college that is part of Rochester
      Institute of Technology, they are located on the same campus. The engineering
      college is a building or set of buildings within the RIT campus.


      It doesn''t make sense to say that RIT is south of one of its own colleges,
      as the college is contained within RIT itself. This would be like asking if
      New York State is south of Manhattan - Manhattan is part of New York State.


      NO'

      - Northeast Wisconsin Technical College is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - College of the Atlantic is in Maine (ME)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - Wisconsin is in the Midwest region of the United States

      the relative positions of these two universities in Virginia.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of Richmond School of Professional & Continuing Studies is located
      in Richmond, Virginia.

      - Virginia Union University is also located in Richmond, Virginia.


      Step 2: Since both are in Richmond, I need to determine their specific locations
      within the city.

      - University of Richmond is located in the western part of Richmond, specifically
      in the Westhampton area.

      - Virginia Union University is located in the northern part of Richmond.


      Step 3: Compare the north-south positioning.

      - If we look at a map of Richmond, the University of Richmond campus is positioned
      southwest of downtown Richmond.

      - Virginia Union University is positioned north of downtown Richmond.

      - This means University of Richmond is south of Virginia Union University.


      YES, the University of Richmond School of Professional & Continuing Studies
      is located south of Virginia Union University.'

      - Virginia Union University is located in the northern part of Richmond


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - If University of Richmond is south of Virginia Union University, the answer
      is YES

      - Since University of Richmond is in western Richmond and Virginia Union University
      is in northern Richmond, University of Richmond would be south of Virginia Union
      University


      NO


      Actually, I need to correct myself. Looking more carefully at their relative
      positions:

      - University of Richmond is located in the western suburbs of Richmond

      - Virginia Union University is located in north-central Richmond


      Given their positions, the University of Richmond is indeed south of Virginia
      Union University.

      Step 1: Both schools are part of the University of Georgia (UGA), which is located
      in Athens, GA.


      Step 2: Let me identify the specific buildings:

      - SPIA is primarily housed in Candler Hall on UGA''s North Campus.

      - Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is UGA''s oldest and largest college,
      with departments spread across multiple buildings on campus, but its main administrative
      offices are in the New College building, also on North Campus.


      Step 3: Looking at the relative positions of these buildings on UGA''s North
      Campus:

      - Candler Hall (SPIA) is located on the northern part of North Campus.

      - New College (Franklin College) is also on North Campus, slightly south of
      Candler Hall.


      Based on the physical locations of their main buildings on UGA''s campus, SPIA''s
      Candler Hall is located north of Franklin College''s New College building, not
      south of it.

      - Sacramento is the capital city of California, located in the central part
      of the state

      - Davis is a city located in Yolo County, California

      - Davis is approximately 15 miles west of Sacramento


      Step 3: Determine the north-south relationship.

      - When looking at a map, Davis is slightly west and south of Sacramento

      - Sacramento is northeast of Davis


      Therefore, Sacramento is NOT south of Davis. Since University of Sacramento
      would be in Sacramento, and D-Q University is in Davis, the University of Sacramento
      is NOT south of D-Q University.


      NO, University of Sacramento, CA is not located south of D-Q University, CA.'

      Sciences and Public Policy, they are essentially in the same location or the

      cannot be described as being "south of" the college they belong to, as they
      are part of the same organizational structure and often in the same buildings.

      and Technical College (MN) is located south of North Dakota State College of
      Science (ND), I''ll think about the geography of these states.


      Step 1: Consider the relative positions of Minnesota and North Dakota.

      - Minnesota is located east of North Dakota

      - North Dakota is directly north of South Dakota

      - Minnesota shares its western border with North Dakota


      Step 2: Consider the likely locations of these colleges within their states.

      - North Dakota State College of Science is in North Dakota, likely somewhere
      within the state

      - Minnesota State Community and Technical College is in Minnesota


      Step 3: Since North Dakota is entirely north of the southern border of Minnesota
      (the two states share an east-west border), any location in Minnesota would
      be south of or at the same latitude as the northernmost parts of North Dakota.


      Step 4: While there could be exceptions if the Minnesota college were in the
      far northern part of Minnesota and the North Dakota college in the southern
      part of North Dakota, the general principle holds that Minnesota locations tend
      to be south of North Dakota locations.


      Looking more specifically at these institutions:

      - North Dakota State College of Science is in Wahpeton, ND, which is in the
      southeastern corner of North Dakota

      - Minnesota State Community and Technical College has multiple campuses, with
      locations in Fergus Falls, Detroit Lakes, Moorhead, and Wadena, all in western
      or central Minnesota

      Step 1: Let me consider what these two entities are. Angelo State University
      is the main university campus. The College of Sciences is one of the colleges
      within Angelo State University.


      Step 2: The College of Sciences is a subdivision or department of Angelo State

    c3afff14-d28d-44fb-82b1-a0ef42774980: '# Is New York University Tandon School
      of Engineering, NY located south of Pratt Institute, NY?


      Let me think about this step by step:


      1) NYU Tandon School of Engineering is located in Brooklyn, specifically in
      the Downtown Brooklyn/MetroTech area.


      2) Pratt Institute''s main campus is also in Brooklyn, located in the Clinton
      Hill neighborhood.


      3) In New York City geography, Downtown Brooklyn is south of Clinton Hill.


      4) Looking at their specific locations: NYU Tandon is around MetroTech Center/Jay
      Street, while Pratt Institute is on Willoughby Avenue between Classon Avenue
      and Hall Street.


      5) On a map of Brooklyn, Downtown Brooklyn (where NYU Tandon is) is indeed south
      of Clinton Hill (where Pratt Institute is).


      Therefore, YES, NYU Tandon School of Engineering is located south of Pratt Institute.'

      - George Washington University School of Nursing is located in Washington, DC,
      specifically at 1919 Pennsylvania Avenue NW.

      - Corcoran College of Art and Design was absorbed into George Washington University
      in 2014, but was historically located at 500 17th Street NW, Washington, DC.


      Step 2: Compare the coordinates on a map.

      - In Washington DC''s grid system, streets with higher numbers run north-south
      and are further west.

      - Pennsylvania Avenue runs diagonally across the city.

      - The Nursing School at 1919 Pennsylvania Ave NW is in the Foggy Bottom area.

      - The Corcoran building at 500 17th St NW is near the White House.


      Step 3: Determine north-south positioning.

      - The historic Corcoran Gallery building (which housed the college) is at 500
      17th Street NW, near the White House.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Both are in northwest DC.

      - The White House area (where Corcoran was) is slightly northeast of Foggy Bottom.

      Step 2: Looking at their specific locations:

      - GW''s School of Nursing is primarily located on GW''s main campus in Foggy
      Bottom, around 23rd Street NW and I Street NW.

      - The historic Corcoran building is located at 500 17th Street NW, near E Street
      NW.

      - In Washington DC''s grid system, Pennsylvania Avenue runs diagonally, but
      the 1900 block is generally northwest of the 500 block of 17th Street.

      - The Corcoran building is closer to the National Mall, which is south of Pennsylvania

      and became the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design at GWU.


      Step 2: Compare the locations.

      - If we consider the Foggy Bottom location of GWU''s nursing program, it would
      be in approximately the same area as the former Corcoran College (now Corcoran
      School within GWU).

      - If we consider the Virginia campus location of GWU''s nursing program in Ashburn,
      VA, this is significantly west and south of DC proper.


      Step 3: Determine cardinal directions.

      - Ashburn, VA is southwest of Washington DC.

      - The former Corcoran College building is in downtown DC near the White House.

      - Therefore, the GWU School of Nursing''s Virginia campus is south of the Corcoran

      - George Washington University School of Nursing is located in the Foggy Bottom
      area of Washington, DC.

      - Corcoran College of Art and Design was historically located near the White
      House in downtown DC. However, it''s important to note that Corcoran College
      was actually absorbed by George Washington University in 2014, with its programs
      becoming part of GW''s Corcoran School of the Arts and Design.


      Step 2: Looking at their specific locations:

      - GW''s School of Nursing is primarily located on GW''s main campus in Foggy
      Bottom, around 23rd Street NW and I Street NW.

      - The historic Corcoran building was at 17th Street NW and E Street NW, near
      the White House.


      Step 3: Comparing their positions on a north-south axis:

      - Foggy Bottom (where GW Nursing is located) is slightly northwest of the White
      House area.

      - The Corcoran building near the White House is slightly southeast of Foggy
      Bottom.

      - On a north-south axis, E Street (Corcoran) is south of I Street (GW Nursing).


      Based on this analysis, George Washington University School of Nursing is located
      NORTH of the historic Corcoran College location, not south.


      NO.'

      Step 2: For the purpose of this question, I''ll consider their historical/main
      campus locations.

      - GW School of Nursing''s main location is at 1919 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington,
      DC.

      - The historic Corcoran building was at 500 17th Street NW, Washington, DC.


      Step 3: Comparing their positions on a north-south axis.

      - In Washington DC, streets with "NW" designations follow a grid where lower
      numbered streets are further east, and higher lettered streets are further north.

      - Both are on Pennsylvania Avenue NW, but their specific positions place the
      Corcoran building slightly south of GW''s School of Nursing.

      - In Washington DC''s grid system, lower numbered streets are further east,
      while higher numbered streets are further west.

      - Both are on similar east-west positioning (both on Pennsylvania Avenue or
      nearby).

      - Looking at the north-south positioning, Foggy Bottom (where GW Nursing is)

      of Henley-Putnam University, CA?


      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to determine the locations of both universities in California.


      2) Palo Alto University is located in Palo Alto, California, which is in the
      San Francisco Bay Area, specifically in Santa Clara County.


      3) Henley-Putnam University was a specialized university focused on national
      security, intelligence, and counterterrorism. However, it merged with National
      American University in 2018 and no longer exists as a separate physical institution.
      When it existed independently, it was headquartered in San Jose, California.


      4) San Jose is located south of Palo Alto in the San Francisco Bay Area. Palo
      Alto is approximately 17-20 miles north of San Jose.


      5) Since Palo Alto is north of San Jose (where Henley-Putnam was headquartered),
      Palo Alto University is located NORTH of where Henley-Putnam University was
      located.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      of Palo Alto University and Henley-Putnam University in California.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Palo Alto University.

      Palo Alto University is located in Palo Alto, California, which is in the San
      Francisco Bay Area, specifically in Santa Clara County.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Henley-Putnam University.

      Henley-Putnam University was located in San Jose, California, also in the San
      Francisco Bay Area and Santa Clara County. (Note: Henley-Putnam has since merged
      with National American University, but I''ll use its original location for this
      comparison.)


      Step 3: Compare the north-south positions of these cities.

      In the Bay Area, Palo Alto is located north of San Jose. On a map, Palo Alto
      is closer to San Francisco, while San Jose is further south in the Bay Area.


      Step 4: Determine the relative position.

      Since Palo Alto is north of San Jose, and the universities are in these respective
      cities, Palo Alto University is located north of (not south of) Henley-Putnam
      University.


      NO, Palo Alto University is not located south of Henley-Putnam University. It
      is located north of it.'

      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Graduate Theological Union (GTU) is located in Berkeley, California.

      - Goldman School of Public Policy is also located in Berkeley, California, and
      is part of UC Berkeley.


      Step 2: I need to determine their relative positions within Berkeley.

      - Graduate Theological Union is located in the northern part of Berkeley, specifically
      in the "Holy Hill" area north of the UC Berkeley campus.

      - Goldman School of Public Policy is located on the UC Berkeley campus, which
      is south of the "Holy Hill" area.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Since GTU is in the northern part of Berkeley (Holy Hill), and the Goldman
      School is on the main UC Berkeley campus which is south of Holy Hill, GTU is
      located north of the Goldman School.

      - This means the Goldman School is south of GTU, not the other way around.


      NO, Graduate Theological Union is not located south of Goldman School of Public
      Policy. It is located north of it.'
