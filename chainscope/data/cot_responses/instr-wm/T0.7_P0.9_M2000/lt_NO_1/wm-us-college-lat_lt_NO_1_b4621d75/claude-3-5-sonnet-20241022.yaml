      1) First issue: Q6156423 appears to be a code/ID number rather than a recognizable
      place name, so I cannot determine its location.


      2) USC Rossier School of Education is part of the University of Southern California
      (USC), located in Los Angeles, CA.


      3) Without knowing the location of Q6156423, it''s impossible to determine if
      it''s south of USC Rossier School of Education.


      4) Therefore, I cannot make a valid comparison of the relative locations.


      NO - I cannot definitively determine if Q6156423 is south of USC Rossier School
      of Education, as I don''t have enough information about Q6156423''s location.'

      1. Let me recall the locations of both institutions:

      - Illinois College of Optometry is located in Chicago at 3241 S Michigan Ave

      - Illinois Institute of Technology is also in Chicago at 3300 S Federal St


      2. Looking at the street addresses:

      - Both are on the South Side of Chicago

      - Both are in the 3200-3300 block of their respective streets

      - ICO is on Michigan Ave while IIT is on Federal St


      3. Michigan Ave and Federal St run parallel to each other in this area

      - Federal St is slightly west of Michigan Ave

      - They are only about 2 blocks apart


      4. Comparing the street numbers:

      - ICO: 3241 S

      - IIT: 3300 S

      - The higher number (3300) indicates a more southern location


      Therefore: NO, Illinois College of Optometry is not south of Illinois Institute
      of Technology - it''s actually slightly north of it.'

      - Illinois College of Optometry is located at 3241 S Michigan Ave, Chicago

      - Illinois Institute of Technology is located at 10 W 35th St, Chicago


      2. Looking at the addresses:

      - Illinois College of Optometry is at 3241 S Michigan Ave

      - IIT is at 35th Street


      3. Since Chicago uses a numbered street system:

      - 3241 S Michigan Ave is around 32nd Street

      - IIT is on 35th Street


      4. In Chicago''s grid system, street numbers increase as you go south

      - Therefore, 35th Street is further south than 32nd Street


      5. Since IIT is on 35th Street and Illinois College of Optometry is around 32nd
      Street, the College of Optometry is NORTH of IIT.


      NO'

    c658b981-69fe-4045-aee5-198b41f95ac0: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to locate Indiana State University

      - Indiana State University is in Terre Haute, Indiana

      - Terre Haute is located in west-central Indiana


      2. Next, I need to locate Sonnencroft, WV

      - Sonnencroft is in West Virginia

      - West Virginia as a state is located southeast of Indiana


      3. Now I can compare their relative positions

      - Since West Virginia is southeast of Indiana, any point in WV would be south
      of a point in central Indiana

      - Therefore, Sonnencroft, WV must be south of Indiana State University


      Answer: YES'
