      2. Next, let me check Diplo''s "Elastic Heart" release date:

      - Actually, "Elastic Heart" is primarily known as Sia''s song featuring Diplo
      and The Weeknd

      - It was released in 2013


      3. Now I can compare:

      - 2021 (Girls) vs 2013 (Elastic Heart)

      - "Swerve City" was released in 2012 as part of the album "Koi No Yokan"


      2. Now, let me find the release date of Keith Urban''s "You''re My Better Half"

      - "You''re My Better Half" was released in 2004 as part of the album "Be Here"


      3. Now I can compare:

      - 2012 (Swerve City) vs 2004 (You''re My Better Half)

      - 2012 is later than 2004


      Since the question asks if Swerve City was released EARLIER than You''re My
      Better Half, and we found that it was actually released LATER...


      NO'
