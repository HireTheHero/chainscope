      which song was released earlier.


      Step 1: Find the release date of Mike Posner''s "Looks Like Sex."

      - "Looks Like Sex" was released on December 6, 2011.


      Step 2: Find the release date of Alesha Dixon''s "Knockdown."

      - "Knockdown" was released on September 27, 2010.


      Step 3: Compare the two dates.

      - September 27, 2010 (Knockdown) is earlier than December 6, 2011 (Looks Like
      Sex).

      - This means Alesha Dixon''s "Knockdown" was released before Mike Posner''s
      "Looks Like Sex."


      Step 4: Answer the specific question asked.

      - The question asks if "Looks Like Sex" was released earlier than "Knockdown."

      - Since "Knockdown" came out in 2010 and "Looks Like Sex" in 2011, Mike Posner''s
      song was NOT released earlier.

      Step 1: Let me check Pink Floyd''s "Round and Around."

      There''s a potential issue here - Pink Floyd doesn''t have a song specifically
      titled "Round and Around." They have a song called "Around and Around" from
      their early years, which was on the album "The Early Years 1965-1972" but was
      recorded much earlier.


      Step 2: Let me check Divinyls''s "Science Fiction."

      Divinyls released "Science Fiction" as a single in 1983, and it was also included
      on their album "Desperate" released in the same year.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Even if we''re referring to Pink Floyd''s "Around and Around" (assuming that''s
      what the question meant), this was recorded in their early years (late 1960s/early
      1970s), which would be earlier than Divinyls''s 1983 release.


      NO - Pink Floyd''s song was not released earlier than Divinyls''s "Science Fiction"
      because there is no Pink Floyd song specifically titled "Round and Around."
      If the question refers to "Around and Around," then the answer would be YES,
      as that would predate the Divinyls song by many years.'

      determine which song was released earlier.


      Step 1: I need to identify when Pink Floyd released "Round and Around."

      - I should note that Pink Floyd doesn''t have a song specifically titled "Round
      and Around." They have a song called "Around and Around" which appears on their
      album "The Early Years 1965-1967."

      - This track was recorded in 1967.


      Step 2: I need to identify when Divinyls released "Science Fiction."

      - Divinyls released "Science Fiction" on their album "Desperate" in 1983.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      - Pink Floyd''s "Around and Around" (1967) was released before Divinyls''s "Science
      Fiction" (1983).

      - The difference is about 16 years.


      NO.


      Wait, I need to be more careful. If we''re specifically talking about "Round
      and Around" by Pink Floyd (not "Around and Around"), I don''t believe Pink Floyd
      has a song with exactly that title. In that case, I can''t make a proper comparison.

      14 years before Divinyls''s song.


      NO


      (The answer is "no" because the question asked if Pink Floyd''s song was released

      not "Round and Around." This appears to be a mistaken premise in the question.

      "Dhadkane Azad Hain" is a song from the Bollywood film "Akaash Vani" which was
      released in 2013.


      Step 2: Identify when Nelly''s "Move That Body" was released.

      Nelly''s "Move That Body" featuring T-Pain and Akon was released in 2010 as

      "Dhadkane Azad Hain" is from the Bollywood film "Aakrosh" which was released
      in 2010. The song would have been released around the same time as the film.


      Step 2: Find the release date of "Move That Body" by Nelly.

      a single from Nelly''s album "5.0".


      Step 3: Compare the specific dates within 2010.

      "Aakrosh" was released in October 2010, so "Dhadkane Azad Hain" would have been
      released around that time.

      "Move That Body" was released on October 12, 2010.

      same time as "Move That Body," but without the exact day of release for the
      Shreya Ghoshal song, I cannot definitively determine which came first.


      However, since film songs in India are typically released before the film as
      part of promotion, it''s possible that "Dhadkane Azad Hain" was released before
      October 12, 2010.

      - Sweetbox''s song: 1997

      - Springsteen''s song: 1984

      - 1984 is earlier than 1997 by 13 years.

      - "Everything''s Gonna Be Alright" by Sweetbox was released in 1997. It samples
      Bach''s "Air on the G String" and became a hit in the late 1990s.


      Step 2: Let me identify when Bruce Springsteen''s "Darlington County" was released.

      - "Darlington County" was released on Bruce Springsteen''s album "Born in the

      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      - Sweetbox''s song: 1997

      - Springsteen''s song: 1984

      - 1984 is earlier than 1997


      Step 4: Determine if Sweetbox''s song was released earlier than Springsteen''s.

      - Since 1997 comes after 1984, Sweetbox''s song was released later, not earlier.

      - Sweetbox''s "Everything''s Gonna Be Alright" was released in 1997 as a single
      from their debut album.


      Step 2: Identify when Bruce Springsteen''s "Darlington County" was released.

      - "Darlington County" was a track on Bruce Springsteen''s album "Born in the

      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      - Sweetbox''s song: 1997

      - Springsteen''s song: 1984

      - 1984 is earlier than 1997


      Step 4: Determine if Sweetbox''s song was released earlier than Springsteen''s.

      - Since Springsteen''s song was released in 1984 and Sweetbox''s in 1997, Sweetbox''s

      1) Haim''s "Summer Girl" - This song was released on July 31, 2019. It was the
      lead single from Haim''s third studio album "Women in Music Pt. III."


      2) Queen + Paul Rodgers''s "C-lebrity" - This song was released in 2008 as part
