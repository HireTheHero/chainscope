      1. "12-Bar Original" is an instrumental track by The Beatles that was recorded
      in 1968. However, it was never officially released on an album during their
      active years. It was included as a bonus track on some reissues and compilations,
      but the original recording dates back to 1968.


      2. U2''s "Seconds" is a song from their 1984 album "The Unforgettable Fire."
      This means that it was officially released in 1984.


      Now, comparing the two:

      - The Beatles''s "12-Bar Original" dates from 1968.

      - U2''s "Seconds" was released in 1984.


      Since 1968 is earlier than 1984, we can conclude that The Beatles''s "12-Bar

      2. **The Cure''s "Never Enough":** This song was released on November 13, 1990,

      - "Lunchbox" was released on August 19, 1990.

      - "Never Enough" was released on November 13, 1990.

      Now, since both songs were released in the same year (1990), we need to check

      to be verified. However, "Never Enough" was released in July 1990.


      If "Lunchbox" was released before July 1990, then it would be earlier. If it
      was released in July or later, then it would not be earlier.


      Upon checking, "Lunchbox" was indeed released in 1990 but specifically in April.
