    f3cd7985-cbb5-44fe-9521-d3db1f63f31b: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll find the release year for Erykah Badu''s "Turn Me Away (Get
      MuNNY)"

      - This song was on her album "Mama''s Gun"

      - "Mama''s Gun" was released in 2000


      2. Next, I''ll find the release year for Matthew Good Band''s "Hello Time Bomb"

      - This song was on their album "Beautiful Midnight"

      - "Beautiful Midnight" was released in 1999


      3. Comparing the years:

      - Erykah Badu''s song: 2000

      - Matthew Good Band''s song: 1999


      4. The question asks if Badu''s song was released EARLIER than Good Band''s
      song

      - 2000 is NOT earlier than 1999

      - Therefore, the answer is NO


      The answer is NO.'
