      3. Compare the two dates to see which one came first.


      Step 1: Charli XCX''s song "Girls"

      - Note: There is a song titled "Girls" by Charli XCX featuring other artists
      (e.g., Rita Ora, Bebe Rexha, and Cardi B), but this was actually a track by
      Rita Ora, not Charli XCX as the lead artist.

      - Charli XCX has a song called "Girls Night Out", released officially in 2018,

      dates for both songs and compare them.


      Step 1: Find the release date of "Chained" by The xx.

      - "Chained" is a song by The xx from their second studio album, "Coexist."

      - "Coexist" was released on September 5, 2012.

      - Therefore, "Chained" was released in 2012.

      - "Put It on Ya" is a song by Plies featuring Chris J.

      - It was released as a single in 2008.


      Step 3: Compare the two dates.

      - "Put It on Ya" was released in 2008.

      - "Chained" was released in 2012.


      Since 2008 is earlier than 2012, Plies''s "Put It on Ya" was released earlier.

      - "I Love You" was released in 1980.

      - It appeared on the album "Flying the Flag," which was released in 1980.


      Step 2: Find the release date of "10538 Overture" by Electric Light Orchestra.

      - "10538 Overture" was released in 1972.

      - It was Electric Light Orchestra''s debut single and was featured on their
      debut album, also titled "The Electric Light Orchestra" (sometimes referred
      to as "No Answer" in the U.S.), released in 1971 in the UK and 1972 in the US.


      Step 3: Compare the release years.

      was released in 2000.

      - The remix features D''Angelo and was part of the album''s promotion in that

      Remix T.S.O.I. (The Sound of Illadelph)" was released earlier than Enya''s "The
      Celts", we need to look at the release dates of both songs.


      Step 1: Determine the release date of Common''s "Geto Heaven Remix T.S.O.I.
      (The Sound of Illadelph)".


      - This remix appears on Common''s album "Like Water for Chocolate", which was
      released in the year 2000.


      Step 2: Determine the release date of Enya''s "The Celts".


      - "The Celts" was originally released in 1987 under the title "Enya" and later
      re-released in 1992 under the title "The Celts".


      Step 3: Compare the dates.


      - Enya''s "The Celts" was initially released in 1987 (and even if we consider
      the 1992 re-release, it''s still earlier).

      - Common''s "Geto Heaven Remix" was released in 2000.

      step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the release date of "That''s Life" by Sia.

      - "That''s Life" is a song originally made famous by Frank Sinatra in 1966.

      - Sia covered "That''s Life" for the soundtrack of the 2022 film "Samaritan."
      Therefore, Sia''s version of "That''s Life" was released in 2022.


      Step 2: Identify the release date of "Changing of the Seasons" by Two Door Cinema
      Club.

      - "Changing of the Seasons" is a single by Two Door Cinema Club released in
      2013.


      Step 3: Compare the two dates.

      - Sia''s "That''s Life": 2022

      - Two Door Cinema Club''s "Changing of the Seasons": 2013


      Since 2013 is earlier than 2022, we can conclude:


      Answer: NO'

      was released earlier than "Show Me" by Jessica Sutta, we need to find the official
      release dates of both songs and compare them.


      **Step 1: Find the release date of "The Truth" by Kygo.**


      - "The Truth" is a song by Kygo featuring Valerie Broussard.

      - It was released as part of Kygo''s album "Golden Hour."

      - "Golden Hour" was released on May 29, 2020.

      was not a single released earlier).


      **Step 2: Find the release date of "Show Me" by Jessica Sutta.**


      - "Show Me" is a single by Jessica Sutta.

      - It was released on August 23, 2011.


      **Step 3: Compare the dates.**


      - "Show Me": August 23, 2011

      - "The Truth": May 29, 2020


      Since 2011 is earlier than 2020, Jessica Sutta''s "Show Me" was released earlier
