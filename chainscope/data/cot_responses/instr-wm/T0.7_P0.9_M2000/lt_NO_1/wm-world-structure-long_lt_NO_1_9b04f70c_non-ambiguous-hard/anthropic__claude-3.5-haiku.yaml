      - These are in different countries, quite far apart


      4. To determine west/east, I''ll consider their longitudes

    f3c5794b-b060-4934-9b5c-ce07711b9af3: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll need to locate Church of the Redeemer, Sacrow and Cathcart Castle
      geographically.


      2. Church of the Redeemer, Sacrow is located in Sacrow, near Potsdam, Germany.


      3. Cathcart Castle is located in Glasgow, Scotland.


      4. Since these two structures are in different countries (Germany and Scotland),
      their relative west/east positioning would depend on their specific longitudes.


      5. Looking at a map, Germany is east of the United Kingdom.


      6. Therefore, the Church of the Redeemer, Sacrow would actually be EAST of Cathcart
      Castle, not west.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

    cd37fd1c-d4fe-4f8c-96a5-efbf5dc9a9cf: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Argao Church:

      - Argao Church is located in Argao, Cebu, Philippines


      2. Next, I''ll locate Azad Pattan Hydropower Project:

      - This project is located in Pakistan-administered Kashmir


      3. Now I''ll compare their geographical positions:

      - Argao is in the Philippines (Southeast Asia)

      - Azad Pattan is in Kashmir (South Asia)

      - These are in completely different countries and regions


      4. Checking their relative west/east positioning:

      - The Philippines is east of Kashmir/Pakistan

      - This means Argao Church is east of Azad Pattan Hydropower Project, not west


      5. Therefore, the answer to "Is Argao Church located west of Azad Pattan Hydropower
      Project?" is:


      NO'
