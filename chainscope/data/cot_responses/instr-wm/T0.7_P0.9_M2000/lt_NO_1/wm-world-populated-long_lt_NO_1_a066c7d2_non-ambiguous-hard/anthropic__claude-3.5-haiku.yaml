    a549cceb-d8b7-47fc-a3b7-9c15c066d716: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate Bilaspur district:

      - Bilaspur is a district in the state of Chhattisgarh, India

      - It is located in central India


      2. Next, locate Hydra, Algeria:

      - Hydra is a town/district in Algeria

      - Algeria is in North Africa


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Bilaspur is in central India, which is in Asia

      - Hydra is in North Africa

      - These locations are very far apart, on different continents


      4. Determine their relative position:

      - Bilaspur is east of Hydra (to the east)

      - This means Bilaspur is NOT west of Hydra


      5. Answer the specific question:

      - Is Bilaspur district, Chhattisgarh located west of Hydra, Algeria?

      - No, it is not west of Hydra


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      1. First, I need to verify the locations of Delahey and Phalut.


      2. Delahey is a suburb located in Victoria, Australia, specifically in the western
      part of Melbourne.


      3. Phalut is a mountain peak located in the Himalayas, on the border between
      India (West Bengal) and Nepal.

      - It is located near the border with Romania

      - It is situated in the northern part of Bulgaria


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Barguna Sadar Upazila is in southern Bangladesh

      - Silistra is in northeastern Bulgaria

      - These locations are very far apart, on different continents

      - They are separated by thousands of miles, with multiple countries and bodies
      of water between them


      4. To determine if Barguna Sadar Upazila is west of Silistra, we need to check
      their relative longitude:

      - Barguna Sadar Upazila is east of Silistra, not west


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

    f29699ab-1366-417b-87c9-a5c46dd65c37: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll check if I know the locations of Gascoyne and Sarmathura.


      2. Gascoyne is a region in Western Australia, located on the west coast of Australia.


      3. I do not recognize "Sarmathura" as a real place name. I cannot confidently
      determine its location.


      4. Without knowing the location of Sarmathura, I cannot definitively say whether
      Gascoyne is west of it.


      5. Given the lack of information about Sarmathura, I cannot provide a confident
      YES or NO answer.


      Therefore, I cannot answer this question with a definitive YES or NO.'

      2. Gascoyne is a region in Western Australia, located in the northwestern part

      3. Sarmathura appears to be a location in India, though I''m not certain of
      its precise location.


      4. Western Australia is west of India.


      5. Therefore, if Gascoyne is in Western Australia and Sarmathura is in India,
      Gascoyne would indeed be west of Sarmathura.


      6. The reasoning suggests that Gascoyne is located west of Sarmathura.

    b5b6d1e5-65f4-4da2-a14c-f434a0c38c37: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, Samdrup Jongkhar is a town located in southeastern Bhutan, near the
      border with India.


      2. Delos is a small Greek island located in the Aegean Sea, in the Cyclades

      Jongkhar is also east of Delos.


      6. The question asks if Samdrup Jongkhar is west of Delos.


      7. Since Samdrup Jongkhar is east of Delos, it is NOT west of Delos.
