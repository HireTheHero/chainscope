      - **Dagestan**, and therefore Charodinsky District, lies significantly to the

      - **Lukavac**, being in Bosnia, lies to the west of the Caspian Sea and thus

      west.


      **Step 1: Location of Uribarri**

      Uribarri is a district (or neighborhood) in the city of Bilbao, which is in
      the Basque Country in northern Spain. Bilbao is located in western Europe.


      **Step 2: Location of Mascouche**

      Mascouche is a city in the province of Quebec, Canada. It is located near Montreal,
      in eastern Canada.


      **Step 3: Compare Longitudes**

      - Bilbao, Spain is approximately at a longitude of -2.93 degrees.

      - Mascouche, Quebec is approximately at a longitude of -73.60 degrees.


      Longitudes increase to the west in the Western Hemisphere. Since -73.60 is further
      west than -2.93, Mascouche is significantly west of Uribarri.
