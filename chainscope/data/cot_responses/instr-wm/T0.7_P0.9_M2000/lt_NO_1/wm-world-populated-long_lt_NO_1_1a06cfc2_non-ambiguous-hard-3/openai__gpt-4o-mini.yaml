      1. **Identify the location of Cape May, New Jersey**: Cape May is situated at
      the southern tip of New Jersey, on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean.


      2. **Determine the location of Verd**: Without specific context, "Verd" could
      refer to several places. However, if we assume "Verd" refers to a location in
      the United States, we can look for known places named Verd or similar names.


      3. **Comparative positioning**: Once we identify where Verd is located, we need
      to compare its longitude with that of Cape May. If Verd has a higher longitude
      (numerically greater) than Cape May, it would be considered to be west; if it
      has a lower longitude, it would be east.


      After considering these steps, if Verd is indeed located west of Cape May based
      on its geographical coordinates, the answer would be YES. If it is not, the
      answer would be NO.

      \   - Lisburn is a city in Northern Ireland, United Kingdom.\n\n2. **Geographical\
      \ Coordinates**:\n   - Warsaw (and thus Ursus) is situated at approximately\
      \ 52.2297\xB0 N latitude and 21.0122\xB0 E longitude.\n   - Lisburn has coordinates\
      \ of approximately 54.5055\xB0 N latitude and 6.0369\xB0 W longitude.\n\n3.\
      \ **Comparing Longitudes**:\n   - Ursus (Warsaw) is at 21.0122\xB0 E, while\
      \ Lisburn is at 6.0369\xB0 W.\n   - Since eastern longitudes (E) are positive\
      \ and western longitudes (W) are negative on a global scale, we can convert\
      \ Lisburn's longitude to a positive value for comparison: 6.0369\xB0 W is equivalent\
      \ to -6.0369\xB0.\n\n4. **Determine the Relative Positions**:\n   - Since 21.0122\xB0\
      \ E is a much larger value than -6.0369\xB0, it indicates that Ursus is located\
      \ much further east than Lisburn.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that Ursus\
      \ in Warsaw is located significantly east of Lisburn, it cannot be considered\
      \ west of Lisburn.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is NO."

      western side of a continent (Australia), while Bungeni is located in Eastern
      Africa.


      4. **Relative Positioning**: Given that Gascoyne is in the western part of Australia

      located in West Sussex, England. It is situated in the southern part of England.


      2. **Cascade, Wisconsin**: Cascade is a village in the state of Wisconsin, which
      is located in the north-central region of the United States.


      Next, we need to establish the relative longitudes of both places:


      - West Sussex, England, is located at approximately 0.2 degrees west longitude.

      - Wisconsin, USA, is generally located at longitudes ranging from about 85 to
      92 degrees west.


      Since West Sussex (0.2 degrees west) is significantly east of the longitudes
      of Wisconsin (85 to 92 degrees west), it follows that Shipley is located to
      the east of Cascade, Wisconsin.
