      3. **Determine the Relative Position**: Compare the longitudinal coordinates
      of both locations. Generally, places in China, especially coastal areas like
      Zhoushan, are further east compared to locations in northern India.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Zhoushan is on the eastern coast of China, and
      Phalut is in the northeastern part of India, Zhoushan is east of Phalut.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is NO, Putuo District, Zhoushan is not

      located to the north of Jakarta, Indonesia, in the Java Sea. They are part of
      Indonesia.


      2. **Mityana, Uganda**: Mityana is a town located in the central region of Uganda,

      for the Gascoyne River and surrounding areas.


      2. **Bungeni**: This is a place located in South Africa, specifically in the
      Limpopo Province.

      - Gascoyne, Western Australia, is in the eastern hemisphere but much further
      east relative to Bungeni when considering the globe as a whole.

      - Bungeni, Limpopo, South Africa, is also in the eastern hemisphere but west
      of Gascoyne.


      Based on this information, Gascoyne is actually located east of Bungeni. Therefore,
      the answer to the question is:


      NO.'

      in Allegany County, New York. New York is in the Eastern United States, generally
      around 75-79 degrees west longitude.

      \n3. **Determine the longitudinal positions:**\n   - Mullanpur Dakha is approximately\
      \ at a longitude of 75.7\xB0 E.\n   - Germasogeia is approximately at a longitude\
      \ of 33.0\xB0 E.\n\n4. **Compare the longitudes:**\n   - Since 75.7\xB0 E (Mullanpur\
      \ Dakha) is east of 33.0\xB0 E (Germasogeia), Mullanpur Dakha is located east\
      \ of Germasogeia.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:\n\
      \nNO."

    ceb87320-b4b3-4ed4-ad1e-9e722cd0c78b: 'To determine whether Mullanpur Dakha is
      located west of Germasogeia, we need to first identify the locations of both
      places:


      1. **Mullanpur Dakha**: This is a town in the Ludhiana district of the Indian
      state of Punjab. It is located in northern India.


      2. **Germasogeia**: This is a town in the Limassol District of Cyprus. Cyprus
      is an island country in the Eastern Mediterranean, south of Turkey.


      Now, let''s consider their relative positions:


      - **Mullanpur Dakha** is situated in India, which is in South Asia.

      - **Germasogeia** is situated in Cyprus, which is in the Eastern Mediterranean
      region.


      When looking at a world map, India is generally east of Cyprus. Therefore, Mullanpur
      Dakha, being in India, is east of Germasogeia, which is in Cyprus.


      Based on this geographical understanding:


      **NO**, Mullanpur Dakha is not located west of Germasogeia.'
