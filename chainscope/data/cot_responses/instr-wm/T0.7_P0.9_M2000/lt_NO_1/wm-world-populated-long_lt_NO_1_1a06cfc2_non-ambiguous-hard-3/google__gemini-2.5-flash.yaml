      is significantly *east* of Barclay, Baltimore, across the Atlantic Ocean.


      Therefore, Urbisaglia is not located west of Barclay, Baltimore.

      1.  **Identify "La Vera":** "La Vera" is a comarca (administrative division)
      in Spain, known for its paprika.

      2.  **Identify "Succasunna, New Jersey":** This is a specific place in the United
      States.

      3.  **Determine the general location of La Vera:** Spain is in Western Europe.

      4.  **Determine the general location of Succasunna, New Jersey:** New Jersey
      is on the East Coast of the United States.

      5.  **Compare their longitudes:** Spain (La Vera) is significantly *east* of
      the Prime Meridian (0 degrees longitude). The United States (Succasunna, New
      Jersey) is significantly *west* of the Prime Meridian. Therefore, Spain is geographically
      *east* of the United States.


      If Spain is east of the United States, then La Vera is east of Succasunna, New
      Jersey.


      Therefore, the answer to "Is La Vera located west of Succasunna, New Jersey?"
      is NO.

      1. **Identify Gascoyne:** The Gascoyne region is located in Western Australia.

      2. **Identify Bungeni:** Bungeni is a town in Limpopo, South Africa.

      3. **Determine relative locations:** Australia is a continent located to the
      east of the African continent. Therefore, Western Australia (where Gascoyne
      is) is further east than South Africa (where Bungeni is).


      Since Gascoyne is in Australia and Bungeni is in South Africa, and Australia
      is generally east of Africa, Gascoyne is **not** west of Bungeni.


      NO'

      E to ~160\xB0E, and Changbai is at ~128\xB0E, Changbai falls *within* the longitudinal\
      \ span of Sakha, and specifically, it is *east* of the westernmost parts of\
      \ Sakha and *west* of the easternmost parts of Sakha.\n\n    However, the question\
      \ asks \"west of Sakrah.\" Given the vastness of Sakha, there are certainly\
      \ parts of Sakha (like its eastern regions) that are *east* of Changbai. But\
      \ there are also parts of Sakha (like its western regions) that are *west* of\
      \ Changbai.\n\n    If the question implies \"west of *any part* of Sakrah,\"\
      \ then no, because Changbai is *not* west of the entire Sakha region. If it\
      \ means \"west of its general centroid,\" that's also complicated.\n\n    Let's\
      \ re-evaluate if \"Sakrah\" could be something else. If it's a very small, specific\
      \ place, the answer might change. But as a general geographical comparison,\
      \ \"Sakha\" is the most logical fit.\n\n    Given the phrasing \"west of Sakrah,\"\
      \ it implies being entirely to the west. Changbai (128\xB0E) is *not* entirely\
      \ west of Sakha (110\xB0E to 160\xB0E). In fact, a significant portion of Sakha\
      \ is *west* of Changbai.\n\n    Therefore, Changbai is *not* located west of\

      2.  **Locate Bonanza, Colorado:** This is in central Colorado.

      3.  **Compare their longitudes:** New York is further east than Colorado. Therefore,
      Colorado is west of New York.


      Since Bonanza, Colorado is west of Friendship, New York, it means Friendship,
      New York is *east* of Bonanza, Colorado.


      So the answer to "Is Friendship, New York located west of Bonanza, Colorado?"
      is:


      NO'

    ca6db68e-67bc-46bb-91c6-f8abe93b7a36: 'Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Locate Friendship, New York:** Friendship, NY is in Allegany County, New
      York. New York is on the East Coast of the United States.

      2.  **Locate Bonanza, Colorado:** Bonanza, CO is in Saguache County, Colorado.
      Colorado is in the Western United States (specifically, the Mountain West).

      3.  **Compare Longitudes (East vs. West):** Locations in New York (East Coast)
      have a longitude that is *east* of locations in Colorado (Western US).

      4.  **Determine "West of":** If New York is east of Colorado, then Colorado
      is west of New York. The question asks if Friendship, NY is *west* of Bonanza,
      CO. Since Friendship, NY is significantly *east* of Bonanza, CO, it cannot be
      west of it.


      Therefore:


      NO'

      Yuli is a township in Hualien County, Taiwan. Hualien County is on the eastern

      \ the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Locate Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal.**\n* KwaZulu-Natal\
      \ is a province in South Africa.\n* Mpumalanga is a *separate* province in South\
      \ Africa, located to the north of KwaZulu-Natal.\n* The phrasing \"Mpumalanga,\
      \ KwaZulu-Natal\" is geographically incorrect. It seems to imply a location\
      \ *within* KwaZulu-Natal, but Mpumalanga is its own distinct province.\n* Assuming\
      \ the intent is to ask about *either* Mpumalanga province *or* a location *within*\
      \ KwaZulu-Natal, let's consider both possibilities for their westernmost points.\n\
      \    * Westernmost point of Mpumalanga province: Around 25.5\xB0S, 29.5\xB0\
      E (approximate)\n    * Westernmost point of KwaZulu-Natal province: Around 29.5\xB0\
      S, 29.0\xB0E (approximate)\n\n**Step 2: Locate Vinhedo.**\n* Vinhedo is a municipality\
      \ in the state of S\xE3o Paulo, Brazil.\n* Its coordinates are approximately\
      \ 23.0\xB0S, 47.0\xB0W.\n\n**Step 3: Compare longitudes.**\n* Longitude for\
      \ Mpumalanga (western part): Approximately 29.0\xB0E to 29.5\xB0E (East of the\
      \ Prime Meridian)\n* Longitude for KwaZulu-Natal (western part): Approximately\
      \ 29.0\xB0E (East of the Prime Meridian)\n* Longitude for Vinhedo: Approximately\
      \ 47.0\xB0W (West of the Prime Meridian)\n\n**Step 4: Determine relative \"\
      westness.\"**\n* Locations with \"East\" longitudes are to the east of the Prime\
      \ Meridian.\n* Locations with \"West\" longitudes are to the west of the Prime\
      \ Meridian.\n* To be \"west of\" another location, your longitude must be numerically\
      \ smaller if both are East, or numerically larger if both are West (closer to\
      \ 180\xB0W), or if one is East and one is West, the West longitude is always\
      \ to the west of the East longitude.\n\nIn this case:\n* Mpumalanga (and KwaZulu-Natal)\
      \ are in the Eastern Hemisphere.\n* Vinhedo is in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\
      Therefore, Vinhedo is significantly to the west of both Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal.\n\
      \nThe question asks: \"Is Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal located west of Vinhedo?\"\
      \nThis means: Is the longitude of Mpumalanga/KwaZulu-Natal further west than\
      \ the longitude of Vinhedo?\n\nSince Mpumalanga/KwaZulu-Natal are at ~29\xB0\
      \ East and Vinhedo is at ~47\xB0 West, Mpumalanga/KwaZulu-Natal are far to the\
      \ **east** of Vinhedo.\n\nThe initial premise \"Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal\"\
      \ is geographically inaccurate as Mpumalanga is a separate province. However,\
      \ even considering a western point of either province in South Africa, they\
      \ are both in the Eastern Hemisphere. Vinhedo is in the Western Hemisphere.\
      \ All locations in the Eastern Hemisphere are to the east of all locations in\
      \ the Western Hemisphere (when viewed on a standard world map, or considering\
      \ the Prime Meridian as the dividing line).\n\nTherefore, Mpumalanga/KwaZulu-Natal\
      \ are *east* of Vinhedo, not west.\n\nThe answer is **NO**."

      \ are *two separate provinces* in South Africa. The question implies one location\
      \ that is both.\n    *   If it means a place *within* KwaZulu-Natal that is\
      \ *called* Mpumalanga (unlikely for a major reference point unless it's a very\
      \ specific, small town), that's one thing.\n    *   More likely, it's a misstatement\

      1.  **Locate Mullanpur Dakha:** Mullanpur Dakha is a town in Punjab, India.

      2.  **Locate Germasogeia:** Germasogeia is a town in Cyprus.


      Now, let''s consider their approximate longitudes:


      *   India (where Mullanpur Dakha is) is generally located at longitudes around
      70-80 degrees East.

      *   Cyprus (where Germasogeia is) is generally located at longitudes around
      32-35 degrees East.


      Since 70-80 degrees East is further east than 32-35 degrees East, Mullanpur
      Dakha is located **east** of Germasogeia.


      Therefore, is Mullanpur Dakha located west of Germasogeia?
