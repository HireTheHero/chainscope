      Step 3: Compare their locations on a global map.

      India is located in South Asia, while Ethiopia is in East Africa.

      Looking at a world map, India is east of Africa. Since Koraput is in India and
      Agame is in Ethiopia, Koraput must be east of Agame, not west.

      Uganda is in East Africa, while Liberia is in West Africa. Looking at a map
      of Africa, Liberia is positioned much further west than Uganda. Therefore, Kibaale
      District (in Uganda) is east of Rivercess County (in Liberia), not west of it.

      - When looking at a world map, Syria (where Jubb al-Safa is) lies to the west
      of India (where Basti district is).

      - Therefore, Basti district is to the east of Jubb al-Safa, not to the west.

      - Cyprus is in the eastern Mediterranean, west of mainland Asia

      - Geographically, India (where Mullanpur Dakha is) is east of Cyprus (where
      Germasogeia is)


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Mullanpur Dakha (in India) is to the east of Germasogeia (in Cyprus),
      Mullanpur Dakha is NOT located west of Germasogeia.


      NO'

      \ Dakha and Germasogeia, and then compare their positions to see if Mullanpur\
      \ Dakha is west of Germasogeia.\n\nStep 1: Identify where Mullanpur Dakha is\
      \ located.\nMullanpur Dakha is a town in Punjab, India, in the northern part\
      \ of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nStep 2: Identify where Germasogeia is located.\n\
      Germasogeia is a municipality in Cyprus, which is an island country in the eastern\
      \ Mediterranean Sea.\n\nStep 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.\nIndia\
      \ is located in Asia and is significantly east of the Mediterranean Sea. Cyprus\
      \ is in the eastern Mediterranean.\n- India's longitude is roughly between 68\xB0\
      E and 97\xB0E\n- Cyprus's longitude is roughly around 33\xB0E\n\nStep 4: Make\
      \ the comparison.\nSince Mullanpur Dakha is in India (farther east) and Germasogeia\
      \ is in Cyprus (farther west), Mullanpur Dakha is located EAST of Germasogeia,\
      \ not west.\n\nNO, Mullanpur Dakha is not located west of Germasogeia."

      \ between 32\xB0E and 34\xB0E.\n\nStep 3: Compare the longitudes.\n- Mullanpur\
      \ Dakha, being in Punjab (northern India), would have a longitude of roughly\
      \ 75\xB0E-76\xB0E.\n- Germasogeia in Cyprus would have a longitude of roughly\
      \ 33\xB0E.\n- Since larger eastern longitude numbers indicate more easterly\
      \ positions, Mullanpur Dakha (\u224875\xB0E) is east of Germasogeia (\u2248\
      33\xB0E).\n\nNO, Mullanpur Dakha is not located west of Germasogeia. It is located\
      \ east of Germasogeia."
