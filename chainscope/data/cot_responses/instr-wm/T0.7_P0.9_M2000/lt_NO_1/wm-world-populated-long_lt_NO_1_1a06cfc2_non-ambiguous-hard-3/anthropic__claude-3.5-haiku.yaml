      1. First, let''s locate Bogor:

      - Bogor is a city in West Java, Indonesia

      - It is located on the island of Java, in the western part of the island


      2. Next, let''s locate Mombasa Island:

      - Mombasa is actually a city on the coast of Kenya, not an island

      - It is located on the southeastern coast of Kenya, in East Africa


      3. Comparing their geographical locations:

      - Bogor is in Southeast Asia (Indonesia)

      - Mombasa is in East Africa (Kenya)

      - These locations are very far apart, on different continents


      4. Determining west/east relationship:

      - From a global perspective, Bogor is significantly east of Mombasa

      - Bogor is east of the prime meridian

      - Mombasa is west of the prime meridian


      5. Conclusion:

      - Bogor is NOT west of Mombasa

    bf8089e2-ab10-4067-a9fe-de888ea9e456: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll check the locations of Rhodes, Iowa and Crofton, British Columbia.


      2. Rhodes, Iowa is located in Butler County, in the northeastern part of Iowa,
      United States.


      3. Crofton, British Columbia is located in western Canada, in the province of
      British Columbia.


      4. To determine if Rhodes, Iowa is west of Crofton, British Columbia, I need
      to compare their geographical positions.


      5. Iowa is located in the central United States, while British Columbia is on
      the west coast of Canada.


      6. This means that Crofton, British Columbia is significantly west of Rhodes,
      Iowa.


      7. Therefore, Rhodes, Iowa is NOT west of Crofton, British Columbia.

      1. First, I recognize Rhodes, Iowa is a location in the United States.


      2. Crofton, British Columbia is a location in Canada.


      3. These locations are in different countries, so I''ll need to determine their
      relative positions.


      4. Iowa is a state in the central United States, located in the Midwestern region.


      5. British Columbia is a province on the west coast of Canada.


      6. To determine their relative east-west positions, I''ll consider their longitude
      coordinates.


      7. Iowa is east of the longitude of British Columbia.


      8. This means locations in Iowa will be east of locations in British Columbia.

    2be28b2a-45f3-4fdb-81ba-b8e571359cee: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate Thousand Islands:

      - Thousand Islands is an archipelago located north of Jakarta, Indonesia

      - It is situated in the Java Sea, off the coast of Indonesia


      2. Next, locate Mityana:

      - Mityana is a town in Uganda, located in the central part of the country

      - Uganda is in East Africa


      3. Compare their geographical locations:

      - Thousand Islands is in Southeast Asia (Indonesia)

      - Mityana is in East Africa (Uganda)

      - These locations are on completely different continents, separated by thousands
      of miles


      4. Determine their relative west-east positioning:

      - Indonesia is much further east compared to Uganda

      - Therefore, Thousand Islands is east of Mityana, not west


      5. Answer the specific question:

      - Is Thousand Islands west of Mityana? No.

      County.


      2. Kibaale District is located in Uganda, in the western part of the country.


      3. Rivercess County is located in Liberia, in West Africa.

    7b743227-238c-4e4f-b384-6fd42817c210: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Moret-sur-Loing:

      - Moret-sur-Loing is a commune in the Seine-et-Marne department in France

      - It is located in north-central France, east of Paris


      2. Next, I''ll locate Huntington County, Indiana:

      - Huntington County is in northeastern Indiana, in the United States

      - It is located in the Midwestern region of the United States


      3. Now, I''ll compare their global positions:

      - Moret-sur-Loing is in Europe (France)

      - Huntington County is in North America (United States)

      - These locations are on different continents


      4. Analyzing their relative positions:

      - Moret-sur-Loing is east of Huntington County

      - This means Moret-sur-Loing is NOT west of Huntington County

    ba36d592-a7e4-4149-8092-b2c2f84e2634: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s locate Nusa Kambangan:

      - Nusa Kambangan is an island off the southern coast of Java, Indonesia

      - It is located in the Indian Ocean, west of the main island of Java


      2. Next, let''s locate Pemba Island:

      - Pemba Island is part of Tanzania

      - It is located in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of East Africa, north of
      Zanzibar


      3. Now, let''s compare their geographical positions:

      - Nusa Kambangan is in Southeast Asia (Indonesia)

      - Pemba Island is in East Africa (Tanzania)

      - These are very far apart, on opposite sides of the Indian Ocean


      4. To determine which is west of the other, we need to look at their absolute
      longitude:

      - Nusa Kambangan is around 108-109 degrees East longitude

      - Pemba Island is around 39-40 degrees East longitude


      5. Since Nusa Kambangan is further east than Pemba Island, Nusa Kambangan is
      NOT west of Pemba Island.

    e30d7775-a2d2-4c7a-bd82-ff1dd0ec90dd: "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. San\
      \ Sebastiano al Vesuvio is a town located in Italy, specifically in the Campania\
      \ region near Naples.\n\n2. Camden County is located in North Carolina, United\
      \ States, on the southeastern coast of the state.\n\n3. Italy and the United\
      \ States are on different continents, separated by the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n4.\
      \ When comparing their geographical positions:\n   - San Sebastiano al Vesuvio\
      \ is in southern Europe\n   - Camden County is in southeastern North America\n\
      \n5. To determine west/east positioning, I'll use their longitudinal coordinates:\n\
      \   - San Sebastiano al Vesuvio is around 14.4\xB0 East longitude\n   - Camden\
      \ County is around 77.3\xB0 West longitude\n\n6. 14.4\xB0 East is to the east\
      \ of 77.3\xB0 West\n\n7. This means San Sebastiano al Vesuvio is EAST of Camden\
      \ County, not west.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: NO."
