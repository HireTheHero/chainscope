    560093bf-7377-4ebb-9b3d-51cee252e305: 'To answer this question, we need to follow
      a series of steps:


      1. **Identify the Publication Dates**: First, we need to identify the publication
      dates of both "The Phantom Menace" by Terry Brooks and "Shrek!" by William Steig.


      2. **Terry Brooks''s The Phantom Menace**: Terry Brooks wrote the novelization
      of "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace". The movie was released in 1999,
      and typically, novelizations are published around the same time as the movie''s
      release. So, "The Phantom Menace" novelization by Terry Brooks was published
      in 1999.


      3. **William Steig''s Shrek!**: William Steig wrote and illustrated "Shrek!",
      a children''s book that was published in 1990. This book is the original story
      from which the popular movie franchise was later adapted.


      4. **Comparison**: Now, comparing the publication dates - "Shrek!" by William
      Steig was published in 1990, and "The Phantom Menace" by Terry Brooks was published
      in 1999.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that 1990 is earlier than 1999, "Shrek!" was released
      before "The Phantom Menace".


      So, considering the question asks if "The Phantom Menace" was released earlier
      than "Shrek!", the answer is:


      NO'

      2. **Compare the publication dates** to determine which book was released first.


      According to my knowledge, Michael Crichton''s "Pirate Latitudes" was published
      in 2009, and Robert Muchamore''s "The Killing" was published in 2005.


      Given these dates, we can see that "The Killing" by Robert Muchamore was published
      before "Pirate Latitudes" by Michael Crichton.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Michael Crichton''s "Pirate Latitudes" was
      released earlier than Robert Muchamore''s "The Killing" is: **NO**'

      was discovered by his family after his death in 2008.


      3. **Robert Muchamore''s The Killing**: Robert Muchamore is known for writing

      by Timothy Brook. It was published in 2008.


      4. **Comparison**: Now, comparing the publication dates - "Vermeer''s Hat" by
      Timothy Brook was published in 2008, and "Under the Never Sky" by Veronica Rossi
      was published in 2012.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that 2008 is earlier than 2012, "Vermeer''s Hat" was
      released before "Under the Never Sky".


      So, considering the question asks if "Under the Never Sky" was released earlier
      than "Vermeer''s Hat", the answer is:


      NO'
    0d47d1b7-30c7-4c04-a4bf-06b05cb85e9f: 'To answer this question, we need to find
      the publication dates of both books:


      1. **Under the Never Sky** by Veronica Rossi: This book was published on January
      3, 2012.

      2. **Vermeer''s Hat** by Timothy Brook: This book was published on November
      1, 2008.


      Now, we can compare the publication dates:


      - **Under the Never Sky**: January 3, 2012

      - **Vermeer''s Hat**: November 1, 2008


      Since 2012 is later than 2008, we can conclude that **Under the Never Sky**
      was released **after** **Vermeer''s Hat**.


      So, the answer to the question is: **NO**'

      - Justin Richards''s "The Resurrection Casket" was published in 2006.

      - Ian Russell McEwan''s "Black Dogs" was published in 1992.


      Given these dates, we can see that "Black Dogs" by Ian Russell McEwan was published
      before "The Resurrection Casket" by Justin Richards.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Justin Richards''s "The Resurrection Casket"
      was released earlier than Ian Russell McEwan''s "Black Dogs" is:

      1. **Identify the release dates**: The release date of "The Resurrection Casket"
      is not specified in the given information. However, we can assume that it was
      released after the year 2000, as Justin Richards started writing the "Doctor
      Who" novels in 1996. On the other hand, "Black Dogs" by Ian Russell McEwan was
      released in 1992.


      2. **Compare the release dates**: Since "Black Dogs" was released in 1992, which
      is earlier than the assumed release date of "The Resurrection Casket" (after
